This project is intended to increase our understanding of ways to deter
criminal action. It is a systematic study of the effects of neighborhood
structure on the interaction between police and criminals, the proper level of
aggregation necessary to delineate this interaction, and the lag time that
occurs between criminal responsiveness to police sanctions and police responses
to criminal behavior patterns. In this collaborative project, Drs. Kohfeld and
Sprague investigate the mutual interaction between police and criminals by means
of a measurement procedure that accounts for the differential time pattern of
response. The uniquely rich and detailed data set they develop for carrying out
these analyses is drawn from the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. The
data set spans the time period 1970 through 1982 and is characterized by a very
fine time structure-- the unit for crime occurrence is hours and the unit for
arrests is days--and a very fine geographic structure--the place of each crime
and each arrest is identified by X-Y coordinates and can be located as to census
blocks, blockgroups, and tracts. Drs. Kohfeld and Sprague utilize an innovative
geo-based software program for graphic display and analysis to aid them in their
examination of criminal and police interactions under varying demographic
conditions. By modelling both the offender and police reactions to one another
at the incident level, the project has the potential to make a major advance in
our knowledge of deterrence processes, which is central to understanding the
social control and enforcement functions of law. Modelling this action-reaction
process within social contexts will explain why the criminal justice system
works better or differently in some places than in others and why crime is
exhibited or can be deterred more effectively in some sites.
