Most current research on optimal repair and replacement policies for machines
operating in parallel does not utilize all of the information that is available.
The purpose of this research is to provide repair and replacement policies that
incorporate the dynamic information an engineer receives as the system is
operating. The second major direction of this research is to investigate the
situation where the parameter of an underlying exponential failure time
distribution is unknown. A prior distribution for the unknown parameter is
provided. This distribution is continually updated as information on the
performance of the machines is gathered. A decision rule based on this updated
information will be developed. The novelty of this approach is that it
incorporates Bayesian statistical inference together with the probabilistic
reliability methods that have traditionally been used.
