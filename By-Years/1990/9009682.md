The investigator will examine the rearrangement of synapses ("synapse
elimination") occurring in neonatal rat muscle. The long-term goal is to
understand the qualitative and quantitative roles of this rearrangement in
generating the adult innervation. The project has two specific aims. 1) To
ascertain how single motor neurons distribute their synapses to the types of
fibers present at the time of birth. Intracellular dye injection will be used to
mark fibers innervated by a single motor neuron; the types of these fibers will
be determined using antibodies directed against myosin heavy chain isoforms.
These results will reveal whether synaptic rearrangement generates the selective
innervation of fiber types found to exist a week following birth or whether
these connections are already selective at birth. An examination of the
innervation of fiber types during the early stages of reinnervation of neonatal
muscle is also proposed in order to determine whether the final selective
pattern seen in these muscles is the result of synaptic rearrangement. 2) To
determine whether slow and fast motor neurons innervate the same fibers during
embryonic developments. The fast fibers which are present in the neonatal soleus
muscles are not generated until after the 20th day of gestation. Thus at this
time, fast motor neurons must either be innervating slow fibers or alternatively
awaiting the generation of fast fibers before they begin synaptogenesis. These
alternatives will be distinguished by determining the number of motor neurons
innervating soleus on the 20th day of gestation.
