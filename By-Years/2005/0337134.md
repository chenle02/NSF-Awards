0337134&lt;br/&gt;Anisfeld&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for the acquisition of a Carbon-Nitrogen-Sulfur(CNS) analyzer for solid
samples. This instrument would replace an antiquated CHN analyzer in the School
of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale University which is no longer
operable. The CHN would support research and education in fields spanning
disciplines of forestry, soil science and marine chemistry. Specific examples of
research uses of the CHN will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o measurement of C
and N content of salt marsh sediment and vegetation in order
to&lt;br/&gt;understand marsh accretion and loss processes and their
implications for coastal water quality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o measurement of S
content of riverine suspended sediment in order to better understand the S cycle
in oxygenated surface waters and its impact on trace metal
speciation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o measurement of C and N content of riverine
suspended sediment to supplement isotopic&lt;br/&gt;studies aimed at
understanding sources and bioavailability of particulate organic
carbon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o measurement of C and N content of soil and plant
material (including woody tissue) in order to assess the effects of changing
nutrient status at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o
measurement of foliage N content in order to understand the ecological and
physiological controls on seedling development and tree
health&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o measurement of C and N content of tropical forest
soils and vegetation in order to assess C sequestration in these
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
