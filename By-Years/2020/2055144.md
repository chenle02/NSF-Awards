This workshop was organized to promote interactions between researchers working
in the nascent field of biomanufacturing, with a primary focus on therapeutic
cell manufacturing. The workshop is also intended to identify significant
knowledge gaps in the manufacturing of differentiated cells. This workshop will
bring together the EAGER Biomanufacturing awardees from FY15 and FY16, to share
results and techniques, and identify challenges and new opportunities. The two
funding years cover cell differentiation and large-scale biomanufacturing. It is
critical that such upstream and downstream processing research is integrated,
and that all researchers in the therapeutic cell area are aware of the
constraints faced in the integrated process, as well as the federal regulations
surrounding biologics. The small workshop atmosphere enables high-level
discussion and participation, and the participation of representatives from
CBER, NIIMBL and ARMI is critical to delivering that information to the
attendees.
