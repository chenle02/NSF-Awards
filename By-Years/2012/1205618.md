This institutional infrastructure (II) project, called INSpiRE, is aimed at
building a new shared research facility for conducting multidisciplinary
research in several areas of computer science and engineering. The proposed
infrastructure is a heterogeneous cluster computing system with a heterogeneous
memory and storage hierarchy. This equipment will facilitate implementation,
evaluation and validation of research projects that focus on several layers of
the system design stack, with the common theme of leveraging heterogeneity in
each of these layers for designing heterogeneous multicore architectures. It
would enable cross-pollination of ideas and tighter integration across these
projects for initiating new cross-cutting research. In addition, existing
projects in three application domains (neuromorphic vision processing, high
performance soft computing, and statistical analysis of privacy-preserving
datasets) will directly benefit from this
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed infrastructure would support
the research activities of more than 50 Ph.D. students in three major
disciplines: hardware architecture, system software, and applications. The
infrastructure will be a catalyst to advance the state-of-the-art in designing
future multicore systems. Undergraduate, graduate, minority and women students
involved in the project will get hands-on training in several cross-cutting
areas. The tools techniques developed in this research will be used in teaching
existing and new courses, and will be made publicly available.
