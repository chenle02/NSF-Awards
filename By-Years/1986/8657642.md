Highway Pavements are deteriorating due to heavier traffic loads and
environment. The influence of environment is uncertain and requires further
study. This project will investigate the effects of moisture on the pavement
behavior, such as, changes in strength and stiffness of soils, the erosion of
the subgrade, and the damage due to freezing and thawing.
