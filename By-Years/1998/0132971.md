Previously thought to inhabit only extreme environments, Archaea are now known
to exist throughout the oceans. These prokaryotes can contribute over 34% of
marine bacterioplankton biomass, thereby representing an important functional
component of biogeochemical cycling in marine ecosystems. This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research will investigate the relative importance of Archaea and
Eubacteria in the Southern Ocean. Water column, sediment trap and sediment core
samples will be analyzed to quantify archaeal and bacterial diversity and
distribution. The presence of unique biomarkers for the lipid membranes of these
two groups will be compared to results from molecular analyses with rRNA probes.
The data obtained will also be used to evaluate the origin of archaeal signals
in the benthos. Since archaeal lipids are relatively resistant to degradation,
preservation in ancient sediments might be expected; but has not been observed.
Instead, the concentrations of these compounds in sediments suggest in situ
production rather than deposition from the water column. This project will
provide important data for evaluating the relationship between water column and
sedimentary archaeal biomarkers and for determining the origin of archaeal in
benthic habitats. The combination of lipid biomarker analysis with molecular
ecological probing to test these questions will establish an essential
information base for future archaeal biomarker work in Antarctica.
