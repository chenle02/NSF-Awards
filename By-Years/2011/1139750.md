This award will support Professional Development Courses that will take place
during the upcoming winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The
proposed activities include two half-day workshops, one two-hour seminar, and
one career panel on the topics of; Effective Mentoring, Writing Effective
Scientific Papers, the Effective Visual Communication of Data, and Making the
most of Oral Presentations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the courses is to
provide expert training in an array of non-scientific tasks that are crucial to
the effectiveness of scientists and educators. Many astronomers have had little
or no formal training in the topics that will be covered. For researchers that
are also educators these courses will help in both aspects of their careers. The
courses will also increase the effectiveness of the participants in these topics
which will directly promote the progress of science. In particular, the courses
will likely have a large impact on young investigators and participants from
underrepresented groups. The courses will be professionally evaluated to assess
the impact of the sessions.
