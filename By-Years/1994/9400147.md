9400147 Bawa The overall aim of this proposal is the examine the effect of
deforestation and forest fragmentation on genetic diversity, gene dispersal, and
mating patterns in tropical lowland rain forests of Costa Rica. The specific
goals are to: (1) measure the amount of genetic differentiation in tropical tree
populations over relatively small spatial scales, (2) ascertain if a matrix of
fragmented populations possesses the same level of genetic diversity as a large
forest area of equal size, (3) calculate the levels of gene flow in a large
contiguous forest, among small fragments, and between fragments and large forest
reserves, (4) assess the level of inbreeding for trees in small fragments and
compare this to trees in large contiguous forests, and (5) determine if a
decline in outbreeding is associated with inbreeding depression. Genetic
variation will be studies using a variety of genetic markers and morphological
traits. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR's) that have been developed by the PI for
tropical tree species will be used to estimate levels of gene flow and
inbreeding. SSR's loci are highly variable with a tremendous discriminatory
power, but have not been used in the study of natural populations of plants. %%%
Deforestation and forest fragmentation are ubiquitous in the tropics and are
presumed to result in loss of biodiversity, including genetic diversity within
species. However, there are no estimates of loss of genetic diversity within
species of tropical forest trees. One reason for this lack of knowledge is that
the population genetics of tropical trees is poorly understood. Moreover, the
genetic consequences of forest fragmentation depend on the levels of gene
exchange among fragments and between fragments and large continuous tracts of
forest. The information attained from this research will be useful in assessing
the impact of deforestation on genetic diversity. This research will also
provide information about the comparative utility of various markers for
estimating pop ulation genetic parameters.
