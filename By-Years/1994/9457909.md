9457909 Patterson This is the initiation of a research program in experimental
particle physics. Techniques will be developed to make precision measurements of
tests of the current theory of particles (the "Standard Model"). One such
measurement will be of a rare decay process of particular particles. Another
will be a search for particle decays that violate certain basic symmetries. ***
