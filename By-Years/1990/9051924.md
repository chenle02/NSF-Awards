The Earth Sciences Department has made significant commitments toward
strengthening its program in meteorology. Recent additions to the faculty,
curriculum, and equipment have initiated the process. This project allows for
significant improvement in the quality of the program by providing improvements
and increased access to the meteorological data used. The department's use of
the UNIDATA PC-MCIDAS service is being expanded by the addition of terminals and
a filesaver/storage unit to create a local area network open to students.
Additional components incude a microcomputer based system for receiving National
Weather Service DIFAX map service and high resolution monitors for display of
computer terminal images to laboratory discussion groups. This equipment and the
resulting data provides students and faculty with complete access to a wide
range of meteorological observations, analyzed products, and forecasts for North
America. Successful implementation of the project will result in an up-to-date
undergraduate meteorology program for Minnesota students. The university will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
