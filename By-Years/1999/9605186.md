New experiments at Brookhaven and CERN will probe matter at high temperatures
and densities, achieved only during the very early stages of evolution of the
Universe. The next generation of Astrophysical experiments will also offer a
glimpse of the Physics of the Early Universe through the imprint left by the
physical processes as anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Particle
Physics predicts that several phase transitions have occurred during the very
Early Universe that are responsible for these anisotropies. My project is to
develop and implement the tools of non-equilibrium quantum physics to provide a
detailed analysis of the dynamics of these phase transitions. The goal is to be
able to recognize and quantify their Cosmological consequences and their
experimental signatures and to compare predictions from theories to the
experimental data that will become available through these new experiments. It
has been recognized that only a consistent study away from equilibrium can
address effectively the Physics of the extreme environments that has taken place
in the Early Universe.
