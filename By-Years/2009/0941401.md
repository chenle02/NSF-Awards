With the pervasive role played by databases in our society and the increased
demand for students with interdisciplinary skills, the next challenge for
educators is the design of database curriculum suitable for a variety of majors.
This challenge is consistent with the enhanced awareness of computational
thinking, which introduces computational methods and models to non-computing
majors. The objective of this project is to develop a collection of learning
materials to support student learning of relational databases. The collection
includes student learning outcomes, engaging animations and several cooperative
learning exercises. This project has the potential for significant impact on the
future workforce by providing students with the necessary understanding of data
and the exchange of data in order to solve problems in our information-centric
society.
