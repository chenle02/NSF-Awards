The study of the evolution of stars is important because it deals with such
topics as the synthesis of the elements (including those needed for the making
of planets and life), the age of the galaxy and the universe, and the evolution
of galaxies (including the evolution of our own galaxy, the Milky Way). For
millions or billions of years, stars typically evolve rather quiescently.
However, occasionally their evolution is punctuated by explosions (e.g.,
supernovae), internal upheavels (e.g., shell flashes), or mergers of two nearby
stars. This proposal addresses these episodic events by computer modelling of
stars in the mass range like our sun and stars that are 8 to 12 times as
massive.
