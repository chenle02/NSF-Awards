A new laboratory course is being developed that combines the principles and
methods from several interrelated areas: molecular genetics, cell biology,
biochemistry;, immunology, and developmental biology. Four pieces of equipment
have been purchased that are fundamental components of a modern biology
laboratory: a refrigerated high speed centrifuge, a laminar flow hood, a tissue
culture incubator and a vibratome. The equipment is being used in an
introductory cell biology course, in plant and animal physiology, in independent
study and honors research in addition to the new integrated course. The project
demonstrates important scientific principles, such as separation science,
culture of animal and plant cells, monoclonal antibody production,
identification of biomolecules in tissues, as well as a balanced treatment of
these principles. It is also a unique solution to limited time and resources.
The college is contributing an amount equal to the award.
