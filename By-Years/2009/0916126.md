Protecting confidential information is a major concern for organizations and
individuals alike, who stand to suffer huge losses if private data falls into
the wrong hands. One of the primary threats to confidentiality is malicious
software, which is estimated to reside on millions of computers. Current
security solutions, such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and intrusion
detection systems, are inadequate at preventing malware
infection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main contribution of this project will be a
novel mechanism, called Storage Capsules, that will allow users to protect
confidential files on personal computers and servers. Storage Capsules are
encrypted containers that will allow users on a compromised machine to securely
read and write files on the container using standard applications without
malware being able to steal confidential file data. Research themes include
designing the system, analyzing its security and addressing the potential
threats, improving its efficiency, and extending it to support user-defined
access policies. Broader implications of this work include providing a new
method for people to secure sensitive data on their personal computers and
servers, even in the presence of malware.
