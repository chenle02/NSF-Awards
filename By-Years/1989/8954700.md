The Children's Museum proposes to develop two versions of an interative
physical.science exhibit dealing with wave mechanics and the related actions of
vibrating and oscillation systems. One version will be a permanent exhibit that
is to be a central component in the new science area of the museum, while the
other will be a traveling exhibit that will tour the country under the auspices
of the Association of Science.Technology Centers. The purpose of the exhibit is
to heighten the interest of children in scientific experimentation, with
learning taking place at three levels including sensory.motor,
perceptual.operational and intutitive.conceptual. Materials for teachers will
supplement the exhibit, and an internship program will train largely minority
middle.school students in basic concepts and then use them as "explainers" for
the general public. The request to the National Science Foundation represents
73% of the total cost of the exhibits, with the remainder coming from
institutional and other sources.
