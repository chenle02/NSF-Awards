The purpose of this research is to study the temperature field around a rapidly
propagating crack tip in metals. Because of the high rate effects occurring in
rapidly propagating cracks, the classical Fourier heat conduction formulation is
replaced by the so-called thermal wave theory, in which there is a finite
propagation speed for heat conduction. The heat generation rate in the local
area surrounding the moving crack tip is modelled by the rate of dynamic plastic
work, using several different constitutive relations for the metal, each of
which takes into account rate-sensitivity. Predictions based on this theory will
be compared to available experimental results in order to establish whether it
is important to utilize thermal wave theory to accurately predict crack
propagation phenomena in metals, and to determine the appropriateness of the
different constitutive relations employed in this study.
