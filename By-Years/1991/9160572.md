Computing software for problems like seismic ray tracing and travel time
inversion in three-dimensional complex geologic media often provides only local
solutions, i.e., local optima, rather than global solutions because of the
"bumpiness" of the response surface to be explored. This research will develop
algorithms that can escape from local optima using coarse grain parallel
techniques. Global optimization techniques will be combined with local
optimization techniques to solve multiobjective optimization and large inversion
problems. The key to the development of these algorithms is the efficient use of
coarse grain parallelism operating asynchronously.
