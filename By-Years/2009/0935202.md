This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to the University of Texas at Arlington will employ researchers to infuse
sustainability concepts into the undergraduate curriculum of three major
departments, civil, electrical, and industrial engineering, in a vertically
integrated structure from the freshman through the senior year. This will be
accomplished by developing sustainability learning modules for 12 courses,
developing interdisciplinary senior design projects, and developing a student
internship program with industrial partners who have good sustainability
practices. A novel Quality Sustainable Engineering Internship Checklist will
also be created. The proposed cross-cutting and targeted modules will be new
additions to the set of modules compiled by the Center for Sustainable
Engineering as part of the Engineering Education Delivery System (NEEDS)
database. This project will increase students' understanding of sustainability
concepts and improve their ability to analyze real-world projects for
sustainability. This will contribute to the education of engineers who can
design systems and technologies that have a small environmental footprint and
are sustainable over the long term.&lt;br/&gt;
