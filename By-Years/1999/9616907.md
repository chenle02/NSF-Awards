Wilcots, Eric AST 96-16907 Dr. Wilcots will study the structure, distribution,
kinematics and other properties of giant H I envelopes around irregular
galaxies. The project has four specific goals -- to reveal what, if any,
structure there is in the extended gas; to measure the kinematics of the far-
flung gas; to determine the relationship between the gas in the outer parts of
the galaxy with that in the inner parts; and to determine the relationship
between the extended gas and the star formation history of the optical galaxy.
This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. Deidre Hunter at the Lowell
Observatory.
