IBN-9412116 Ramirez Sex steroids, including progesterone, modify specific
tissues in the body by binding to unique proteins called nuclear steroid
receptors andactivating specific genes in the cells of that tissue. Dr. Ramirez
is studying how the sex hormone progesterone exerts its action upon the central
nervous system (CNS) of female and male rats. In the CNS, progesterone appears
to bind to specific binding sites on the membranes, indicating that
progesterone, besides acting on the genes of the cells, can also alter the
function of neurons by binding to the cell membrane. Progesterone appears to
bind to a membrane progesterone receptor that is unique to the CNS of female
rats since it is not functionally active in the CNS of male rats. The specific
objectives of this study are: 1) to study the characteristics of the membrane
binding sites in membranes isolated from different regions of the brain, 2) to
isolate and characterize a protein from the cerebellum of the brain that may be
the membrane progesterone receptor, and 3) to demonstrate that this membrane
progesterone receptor in the CNS is regulated by the estrous cycle of the female
rat. The unambiguous proof of the existence of membrane molecules from the CNS
that bind progesterone will help to clarify some of the actions of steroids upon
mood and behavior.
