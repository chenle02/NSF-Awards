This research will try to answer basic questions about how populations of
organisms evolve. Two closely related species, Drosophila melanogaster and
Drosophila simulans, will be studied because they are easy to rear in the
laboratory and because a great deal is known about them. The most common
procedure to be used will be obtaining the sequence of the DNA of genes in
several individuals from both of these species. The sequences of six different
genes will be studied. By comparing DNA sequences it will be clear how different
these two species are at the DNA level as well as how different individuals from
the same species are at the DNA level. These data will be compared to
mathematical models of the evolutionary process. If the data fit the models
well, then the models can be very useful for asking questions about how natural
selection affects the amount of DNA divergence seen between individuals and
between species. If the data fit the models poorly, then our understanding of
evolution that produced the models is incorrect, and the models must be revised.
