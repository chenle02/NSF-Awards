9704644 Ruoff This research project emphasizes the synthesis and
characterization of the chemical and physical properties of periodic arrays of
carbon and metal carbide nanotubes and nanorods. This is the first time these
types of arrays have been synthesized and chararcterized. The nanotube arrays
will be grown from a periodic array of catalytic metal particles of well-
defined sizes arranged in a predetermined spatial pattern. Properties such as
mechanical strength, field emission, and chemical reactivity will be determined,
and nanotube arrays will be studied with matrix materials such as polymer,
metal, or ceramic. A significant understanding of the nucleation and growth of
very small diameter carbon nanofibers and filaments will also be obtained. %%%
Basic knowledge regarding the fundamental synthesis of nanotubes and nanoarrays,
together with their chemical and physical properties, underpins several focused
areas of high technological interest to industry. These include high thermal
conductivity carbon fiber / carbon matrix composites, vacuum microelectronic
devices, fiber-reinforced composites, novel membrane and catalyst materials, and
new magnetic materials for high-density recording media. This project is
supported under an initiative entitled Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison
with Industry (GOALI), and it is funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the
Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program of the Division of Materials
Research. ***
