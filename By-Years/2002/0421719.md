This is a scholarship program designed to attract, retain, graduate, and place
academically talented, financially needy students in the technological workforce
or in a graduate program in computer science or mathematics. The department
faculty are identifying and recruiting students from on-campus programs and
meetings. Other recruitment tools include high school visits, publicity on the
Web, and the annual University Interscholastic League competition in Abilene.
The program provides a total of 60 scholarships, with six new awards per year
for four years. Each awardee has the option of renewing the scholarship for the
duration of the grant. Eligibility is determined by a committee of mathematics
and computer science faculty, a representative from the financial aid office,
and CSEMS guidelines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses the Student Support
Team (SST) concept. A SST will include a faculty mentor serving as the director,
a career counselor, a financial advisor, a representative from industry, peers
in the student's major, and others suggested by the mentor. A major facet of the
SST is the use of the existing course, University Seminar for Mathematics and
Computer Science Majors, in which all scholarship recipients enroll. Faculty
mentors help the students design an Individual Academic Plan (IAP) that includes
suggested coursework, opportunities for internships, possibilities for
undergraduate research, leadership roles, and graduate school
goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit in the project comes from the
culture of excellence at ACU and the multiple opportunities afforded to the
scholarship recipients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project
comes from increasing the number of students who utilize their computer science
and mathematics degrees in the technological workforce or in graduate school in
computer science or mathematics.
