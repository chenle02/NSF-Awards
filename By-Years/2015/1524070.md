Usable security and privacy is increasingly recognized as an important aspect of
the cybersecurity field. The Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS)
brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in
human computer interaction, security, and privacy. The program features
technical papers, workshops and tutorials, a poster session, panels and invited
talks, and discussion sessions. The eleventh SOUPS will be held July 22-24, 2015
in Ottawa, Canada. The funds support travel grants for students to attend the
conference. SOUPS is the top conference devoted to usable privacy and security.
By increasing student participation at the SOUPS conference, it may encourage
more students to get involved in usable security research and pursue further
graduate education and careers in this area.
