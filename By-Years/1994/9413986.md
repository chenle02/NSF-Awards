The funds requested in this proposal will be used to implement a Biotechnology
course at Villa Julie College. The course will be designated as an upper-level
course for undergraduates majoring in Biology, or related fields, leading to a
Bachelors degree. The acquisition of the state-of-the art equipment, including a
laminar flow hood, Co2 incubator, ultrafreezer, ultracentrifuge,
spectrophotometer, and equipment for protein electrophoresis will allow the
students access to more modern instrumentation and enhance their skills and
knowledge of current technologies. Presently the Science Department offers upper
level courses in Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry. The
development of a Biotechnology course will complement these courses and prepare
the students for graduation and their future endeavors. Students completing this
course will be able to use their knowledge and skills to help them obtain
employment in biotechnology and life sciences fields upon graduation with a
baccalaureate degree, or they may wish to pursue a Masters or Doctoral degree.
The Biotechnology course will include both the theory and practical use of the
following: a) centrifugation, both low and ultra speed, b) isolation and
electrophoresis separation of proteins and nucleic acids, c) Recombinant DNA
Technology; specifically plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme analysis,
cloning, and analysis of foreign DNA expression, d) the growth and maintenance
of bacterial, yeast, and animal cell cultures, e) the propagation and isolation
of viruses, and f) the use of antibodies to identify specific proteins by ELISA
and Western Blot procedures. 3
