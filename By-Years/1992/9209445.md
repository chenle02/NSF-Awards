GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in
the central nervous system of many animals. GABA binds to a specific cell
membrane protein receptor to control the activity of the neuron. The GABA-A type
receptor regulates a chloride ion channel which is also the target of
neurotoxins and a variety of sedative, anxiety-relieving agents and alcohol.
Recently a new novel GABA-A receptor has been discovered in the human eye and
its primary gene structure has been elucidated. Although its primary structure
is similar to the previously characterized GABA-A receptor its physiological
function is largely unknown. These studies are directed at furthering our
understanding of the interaction between retinal cells, the function of the
inhibitory neurotransmitter in signal processing in the retina. A combined
electrophysiological investigation of the receptor activation on the retinal
cells with molecular biological techniques to produce mutants of the normal
receptor will be used to uncover structure/function relationships of this
receptor.
