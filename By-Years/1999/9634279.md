Description: The work proposed, `Synthesis of Higher Alcohols from Synthesis
Gas through Modified Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis`, is a collaboration in chemical
engineering between West Virginia University (WVU) and the Central Fuel Research
Institute (CFRI) in India. The investigators are Professors Dadyburjor, Kugler
of WVU and Drs. Roy, Sharma of CFIR. The goals of the research are to develop
catalysts and processes for the production of high-molecular-weight, branched
alcohols from synthesis gas. This includes preparation and characterization of
the catalysts, and testing under reaction conditions. The kinetics and mechanism
are to be studied, to help in the design of improved catalysts. Characterization
and reaction studies will be run in both locations. The studies are
complementary, in that experimental facilities that are unavailable at CFRI are
available at WVU and vice versa. The results of the proposed work are of value
in both countries. In the US higher alcohols can be used in reformulated
gasoline, while in India they can be substituted for tetraethyl lead in gasoline
or used as a feedstock for mixed olefins. Scope: This is a new collaboration
with the unique feature of linking a university laboratory in the US with a
government research laboratory in India. Such laboratories are among the most
important centers in India for their effectiveness in conducting research that
is of value to economic and industrial development. The CFRI group is highly
experienced in the synthesis of olefins and other selected chemicals.
