This project will enable Texas A&amp;M University through the College of
Engineering and the College of Science to establish a Research Careers for
Minority Scholars Program (RCMS). The principal objectives will be retention of
minority students in science and engineering degree programs, with a particular
emphasis on encouragement of these students, through a process of mentoring and
research activities, to enter graduate programs in science and engineering at
elite institutions, especially at the doctoral level. As a major research
institution with 1,400 minority students enrolled in the Colleges of Engineering
and Science, Texas A&amp;M is uniquely positioned to bring about a confluence of
the components essential to achieving this goal: a well-recognized and highly
successful institutional commitment to minority recruitment and retention;
nationally recognized research activities and faculty; an extensive network of
corporate participants and funding programs to assist its minority students; and
most importantly, its large, cohesive and active minority population in
engineering and science forms an essential "critical mass" for peer support,
encouragement and reinforced career expectations.
