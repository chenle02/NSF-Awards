The Department of Biological Sciences recently has implemented a curriculum
revision involving the creation of three core courses for all majors - namely -
Genetics, Ecology and Cell Biology. Of these, Cell Biology had not existed on
this campus in the past and Genetics had been in need of revision. Instruments
procured through this project are being used to provide current technology to
the laboratory portions of both of these core courses. Included among the new
instruments are teaching and instructor's microscopes equipped with phase-
contrast optics that provide for more effective observation of living cells, and
an ultracentriguge. The instruments are enhancing both laboratory teaching and
student research projects by making the modern techniques of Light Microscopy
and of Molecular Genetics (especially methods of isolating cellular components)
available to undergraduates.
