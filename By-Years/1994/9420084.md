9420084 Topoleski An SGER award will support feasibility testing of a conceptual
coating process which involves alternating steps of ion implantation and plasma
deposition. The aim is to combine the excellent adhesion created by the ion
implanted mixed layers with the more rapid deposition of material by the plasma
technique. The coatings will be processed at a facility in Russia which has the
capability of switching between the two processes without sample removal or
bpeaking of the vacuum. The integrity and strength of the coatings will be
determined by scratct testing and microscopy. ***
