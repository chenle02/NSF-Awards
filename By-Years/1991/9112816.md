A user mode research program will be carried out in electromagnetic nuclear
physics. New and much more precise data on the charge structure of the proton
and on the short distance structure of the deuteron will be obtained.
Polarization studies relating to properties of the nucleon and of few-body
systems will be carried out at the MIT/Bates electron linac and at CEBAF. These
data will lead to improved understanding of the deuteron and of structure
aspects of more complex nuclei. Construction of a polarimeter for approved Bates
experiments on polarization transfer will be carried out. Also, development work
for the CEBAF high resolution coincidence spectrometers will be carried out,
specifically work relating to the trigger system and data acquisition system.
R&amp;D, simulations, data analysis, interpretation, and other related
activities will be carried out at William Mary.
