9723982 Hirsch In contrast to the Rhizobium-plant symbiosis which has been
studied extensively, the association of mycorrhizal symbioses is less well
known. Mycorrhizae enable plants to colonize phosphorus-poor soils, are
ubiquitous, and contribute significantly to plant productivity. The project
originates from the recognition of VAM-fungi inducing the expression of genes in
plants where these genes are also induced by Rhizobium. Alfalfa plants will be
studied for their early responses to the VAM fungi. After inoculation, the
infection process will be followed and the timing and expression pattern of
several selected plant genes will be analyzed. It is proposed using the
expression of early nodulin genes as molecular markers for developing a bioassay
to detect the putative Myc-factor, i.e., a chemical signal that induces plant
gene expression in VA-mycorrhizal roots, and is involved in establishing the
symbiosis.
