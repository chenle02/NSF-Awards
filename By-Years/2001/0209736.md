ABSTRACT

COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: MAINTAINING HIGH SPECIES DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITIES

Ecosystems frequently contain species that are evolutionarily and ecologically
similar. However, whether this diversity is actually maintained by mechanisms
that directly promote coexistence or rather is lost very slowly from systems is
unclear. Many mechanisms have been proposed that could promote the indefinite
coexistence of species on both local and regional scales. These mechanisms of
coexistence are only present when vital rates (survival, growth, reproduction)
vary with the environment and when individual species have different responses
to the same environment change. The alternative is that species do not differ in
their responses to the environment and are slowly being lost through a random
process called "ecological drift" in which the population size of one species
relative to another is determined by the unpredictability inherent in survival,
growth, and reproduction. This process is akin to "random genetic drift" in
which random evolutionary changes among the relative abundances of so-called
neutral genes occur due to unpredictability in the process of inheritance.

This project will elaborate recent models of ecological drift by incorporating
mechanisms of coexistence into these "neutral" ecological models. Like the
neutral models, development of the new theory will take advantage of analogies
between the ecological mechanisms that determine species diversity patterns and
the evolutionary processes that determine genetic diversity. The goal of the
research is to develop a set of predictions that incorporates both ecological
drift and various coexistence mechanisms that operate on local and regional
scales. These predictions will be statistically compared with existing data on
community diversity across local and regional scales. The research will provide
indirect but highly practical tests for mechanisms that shape community
diversity.
