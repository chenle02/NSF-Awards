Brassinosteroids are important plant hormones that promote plant growth and
enhance plant resistance to a variety of environmental stresses by increasing or
decreasing the expression of hundreds, if not thousands of plant genes. This
project uses a combinatory approach of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology,
genomics, and genetics to investigate the biological functions of a small family
of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in regulating the expression of
some of these growth-related genes. It also studies how the gene-regulatory
activities of these transcription factors themselves are controlled by protein
phosphorylation and protein-protein interaction. The successful completion of
this project will significantly enhance our understanding of the gene regulatory
mechanisms of the plant steroid hormones to stimulate growth and could lead to
better strategies to increase grain yield in crop plants and biomass production
in biofuel feedstocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide excellent
training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral
research fellow to gain significant research experience and to develop their
ability to critically analyze experimental data, formulate testable hypothesis,
and solve scientific problems. It will also contribute to the University of
Michigan's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program and Summer Research
Opportunity Program that specifically recruits outstanding underrepresented
undergraduates into research laboratories. This project will integrate the
proposed research activities with an Introductory Plant Biology course and will
generate exciting experimental data that will be discussed with students of a
Plant Physiology course. The successful execution of the proposed project will
create interesting mutant or transgenic plants that can be used as teaching
materials for science education at local public schools.
