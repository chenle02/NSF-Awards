9314084 Goldsman We are developing a new approach to device simulation by
direct, self-consistent solution of the Poisson equation and the Boltzmann
transport equation (BTE). The method will quickly calculate the momentum
distribution function for a semiconductor device. To solve the BTE, the
distribution function will be expressed as a quasi-infinite spherical harmonic
(SH) expansion, with unknown coefficients that depend on energy and position. To
find the coefficients, a system of arbitrarily high-order equations will be
obtained by projecting the BTE onto the SH basis. The system will then be solved
numerically to yield the coefficients and thereby the device distribution
function. ***
