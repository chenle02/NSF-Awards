This three-year RUI grant supports the research of a faculty member, and two
undergraduate students/graduate student (summer only) to participate in research
at the Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS using the Multi-Particle Spectrometer
(MPS). The experiment will search for OexoticO states with quantum numbers not
allowed in a simple quark/anti-quark mesonic model. Examples of such states are
glueballs or hybrid states of a glueball with a quark/anti- quark pair. There is
an increasing interest within the nuclear physics community in meson and baryon
spectroscopy, and this research lies at the interface between the fields of
particle and nuclear physics.
