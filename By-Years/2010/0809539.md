Seismic waves generated by any substantial earthquake travel through the Earth?s
inside, providing information on material properties of the Earth?s interior. In
order to understand the seismic observations, we perform laboratory experiments
to obtain physical properties of earth materials under high pressure (P) and
temperature (T) conditions equivalent to the Earth?s interior. The experimental
data are then used to directly compare with the observations and build models of
the Earth?s interior. In this proposal, we will measure densities of silicate
perovskite and ferropericlase (two dominant phases of the Earth?s lower mantle)
and iron-nickel alloy (the main constituent of the Earth?s inner core) at high
pressure and temperature, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. We
will use newly developed laser heating and combination of external resistance
and laser heating techniques in the diamond anvil cell to simulate conditions of
the Earth?s interior. The emphasis of the proposed research is to obtain high-
quality data while expanding the experimental P-T range. Using the new data, we
can directly evaluate if a peridotitic mantle model is consistent with the
observed mantle density profile and constrain the amount of light elements in
the inner core. The results will have important implications for mantle
convection, core dynamics, and composition models of the Earth?s interior. The
project will develop high-pressure techniques that will be available for
researchers in broad scientific communities and provide opportunity for young
researchers at all levels to gain research experience in high-pressure research.
Knowledge obtained from the proposed study will improve our general
understanding of the planet Earth, especially, its interior.
