Electrophysiology workstations are being used to assist in the teaching of
human, rodent and avian physiology. More specifically, the workstations are used
in labs associated with a course in electrophysiological reactions to
psychological stimuli. These facilities are also used for independent or senior
thesis research by undergraduate students. This project is expected to enhance
current facilities and enable the presentation of electrophysiological research
using a hands-on approach. Students also work with state-of-the-art facilities,
have a better understanding of human physiology and are encouraged to pursue
research careers.
