One of the major questions in thrust fault terranes is how the cover
corresponds during blind-thrust duplex development below. In southern Virginia
and West Virginia, the Keeber and Tuscarora Sandstones are found in two
settings. To the north they are in the cover sequence, and to the south they are
involved in duplex faulting. This project will measure strain in these
sandstones, including shape changes in quartz grains by cathodoluminescence
techniques. Results will be applied to understanding the operative kinematic
interactions between a blind-duplex thrust system and its overlying cover.
