The field of mechanism design studies how to build algorithms to solve economic
problems, such as selling an item at an auction, or matching buyers to sellers
in a marketplace. This project aims to develop formal verification methods for
economic mechanisms, addressing two main technical challenges. First, mechanisms
are complex: mechanisms operate on richly structured, and often quantitative,
data. Second, mechanisms accept inputs controlled by economic agents who may
have incentives to manipulate the inputs they report. Verifying economically-
relevant properties of mechanisms requires assuming and reasoning about how
agents behave. This project has broader impacts along two dimensions. First, as
mechanisms are increasingly used in high-stakes settings to match people to
scarce resources (e.g., residents to hospitals, students to schools, and even
organ donors to recipients), the risks and consequences of implementation errors
increase. This project aims to develop methods to verify that economic
mechanisms are implemented correctly. Second, since mechanisms aim to allocate
resources in a socially acceptable manner, transparency and accountability are
paramount. Methods developed by this project could help independent auditors
certify that mechanisms behave correctly. Further, this project incorporates
integrated education and outreach activities spanning both computer science and
economics.
