The City College of New York and the American Museum of Natural History propose
a three-year research and development project to refine and test case study
units based on existing museum-developed scientific content on contemporary
issues in ecology for students underserved in their connection to nature. The
resources are designed to be used by teachers of middle and high school biology,
ecology, and environmental science classes. The project will produce three
complete curriculum modules. They will include new scientist at work profile
videos that will be disseminated online through a web interface that enables
teachers to select and customize scaffolding and to address their particular
students' needs in the classroom. The program will also develop in-person and
online courses at CCNY and AMNH for local New York City public school teachers
and teachers nationally to explore their own connection to environmental issues
and ecology and to reflect upon the role of scientific inquiry in building
understanding of the natural world.
