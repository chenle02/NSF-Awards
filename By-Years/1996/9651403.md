Because of the large student response to the Molecular Genetics and Microbial
Ecology courses in the Biology curriculum, this project designed a collaborative
project centered around the theory of the two courses and the combined expertise
of faculty and students. The pilot project included the isolation and
purification of coliphages from sewage followed by enzyme restriction analyses
of coliphage DNA. Newly purchased instruments now enhance and expand this
project to include the isolation, restriction mapping, and polymerase chain
reaction amplification of genomic DNA. Students are also able to conduct
qualitative analyses with the acquisition of DNA sequencing capabilities and
quantitative analyses using an optical densitometer. With the new equipment,
students are able to conduct modern techniques including PCR amplification of
DNA, Southern blotting, probe hybridization, DNA sequencing, and
chemiluminescent probing. These capabilities can greatly increase students'
understanding of genetic theory and phylogeny and can also enable students to
learn how to generate molecular markers to be used in genetic and microbial
investigations. A knowledge of these techniques is essential to the success of
students in their research projects, in their future studies, and in an
increasingly technical world.
