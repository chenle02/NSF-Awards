9521518 Sandwell Radar altimeters abroad the Geosat and ERS-1 spacecraft have
mapped the marine gravity field over nearly all of the world's oceans to a high
accuracy and spatial resolution. In the wavelength band 15 to 700 km, variations
in gravity anomaly are highly correlated with seafloor topography. Since many
southern ocean areas are sparsely sorveyed these new satellite altimeter data
reveal many previously unsurveyed features. The objectives of this work are to
accumulate all available depth soundings, use the short wavelength satellite
gravity information to interpolate between ship soundings, extract regional
variations in the topography/gravity transfer function and relate them to
tectonic province, and examine variations in topography/gravity transfer
function at spreading ridges with regard to spreading rate. ***
