Abstract for DMS - 0104089

The focus of the proposal is on the research of locally Hermitian symmetric
spaces of non-compact type, considered as special complex manifolds of non-
positive sectional curvature. Complex hyperbolicity can be considered as a weak
notion of negative curvature. From analytic point of view, the principal
investigator proposes to work on the rigidity of tangent bundles among the
moduli space of vector bundles of locally Hermitian symmetric spaces. From the
uniformization point of view, he proposes to work on characterization of
arithmetic lattices in complex two balls. He proposes to investigate the
analogue of Fijita's conjectures concerning very ampleness of pluricanonical
line bundles on such manifolds, relating to algebraic geometry. He proposes to
understand and estimate the growth of Betti numbers on a tower of coverings
naturally associated with the manifolds, relating topology to geometry. In the
direction of number theory, he proposes to study the question on finiteness of
rational points on models of two ball quotients defined over an algebraic number
field. He also proposes to work on several other problems in the area of complex
hyperbolicity and Kaehler geometry, relating to his earlier research directions.

In mathematics, people are interested in models which on one hand are elegant
and relatively simple to describe and on the other hand display rich
mathematical structures. Locally Hermitian symmetric spaces are such nice
geometric models for which different disciplines of mathematics meet. The main
purpose of this proposal is to understand several geometric and arithmetic
aspects of such models and explain their interrelationships. Understanding of
the various properties and problems proposed will enhance the knowledge of the
subject and other disciplines of mathematics involved.
