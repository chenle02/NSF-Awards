This research examines three classes of statistical models in common use. The
first topic is aliasing in models for the covariance function of random
processes and arrays. The second topic involves the further use of higher-order
cumulants and Edgeworth expansions to study the behaviour of estimators and
tests in variance component analysis. The final topic is the method of residual
or restricted maximum likelihood estimation of variance and covariance
parameters. This research in statistics will impact the areas of spectral
analysis, analysis of variance, and the users of the classical random effects
and mixed linear models in fields such as agriculture, plant and human genetics,
psychology and manufacturing.
