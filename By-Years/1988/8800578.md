This study will evaluate the ability of metalimnetic phytoplankton to mitigate
the effects on intergrated water column primary productivity of changes in
piscivory. It is hypothesized that increased planktivory will lead to reduced
grazing, increased epilimnetic chlorophyll, reduced transparency, and
elimination of metalimnetic algae, thereby shifting the locus of production to
the epilimnion with little change in total primary production. This mechanism
could substantially alter the effects of cascading trophic interactions in lakes
which support deep chlorophyll maxima. The hypothesis will be tested with a
whole- lake planktivore addition experiment. Both experimental and control lakes
presently support dense metalimnetic algal populations. Biomass budgets derived
from this sampling and epilimnetic budgets derived from another project will be
used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative effects of changes in
planktivory within metalimnetic and epilimnetic algal populations, and the
implications of those changes to total primary productivity.
