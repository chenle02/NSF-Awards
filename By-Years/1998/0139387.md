0139387&lt;br/&gt;Freitag&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Rhode Island's
Graduate School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to improve the
oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Endeavor, an NSF-
owned ship operated by URI as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The dissolved oxygen sensors, pure water
system, water sampling bottles and improvements to the ship's isotope van
supported here will replace aging systems with modern ones, maintaining state of
the art capability for researchers using the ship. These improvements will be of
substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research
during 2002 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
