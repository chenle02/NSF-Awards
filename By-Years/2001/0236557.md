P.I. - Orcutt&lt;br/&gt;Proposal -
0236557&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of the MERMAID float: an
autonomous vehicle for recording regional earthquakes within the world
oceans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to test
whether untethered floats can record arrivals of teleseismic P waves while
drifting at depths of 1-2 km. Specifically, they propose to construct a
prototype float for recording earthquakes within the oceans. They have named
this float MERMAID (Mobile Earthquake Recorder in Marine Areas by Independent
Divers). If the proposed pilot project is successful, it will opens up the
possibility of using existing monitoring efforts to fill in the large gaps in
global teleseismic coverage posed within the ocean basins, and will
significantly enhance our ability to image the deeper regions of the Earth
through tomographic inversions&lt;br/&gt;
