This proposal relates to the investigation of nanostructures for use in
lightwaves and photonics. The specific issues which are proposed for
investigation include computational simulation, new super-radiant coherent
sources, the integration of a laser and a high frequency modulator on the same
chip, and the initial investigation of electron beam writing techniques for the
investigation of quantum optical devices. The team propagation technique will be
applied for the computation of quantum processes and will begin with the
calculation with quantum well devices and then will be extended to a calculation
of non-linear optical properties of artificial structures by applying this
technique to a computation of double Feynman graphs. One possibility is a
coherent emitter based upon super-radiant emission. This effort will be pursued
jointly with Tadashi Fukuzawa, IBM Research Laboratory, Japan. Simulations have
already been carried out for travelling wave GaAs modulators indicating that it
is possible to have a response to 40 GHz. If this is so, then it is of interest
to have an integrated laser-modulator within a single monolithic structure.
