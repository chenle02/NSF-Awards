This research studies the speech of several generations of Spanish-English
bilinguals in Los Angeles, California, and of a control group of Spanish
speakers in two communities in Mexico from which there is large-scale emigration
to Los Angeles. Questions addressed include precisely how the Spanish of the
immigrants changes under the direct influence of English and what changes are
the result of internally motivated processes, what type of lexico-syntactic
transfer occurs at each point across the bilingual spectrum, what types of
compensation are developed in response to loss and simplification, and how
changes proceed both in the linguistic and the social systems. Empirical answers
to these questions are of concern not only for linguistics but for social policy
and education as well. Comparison of the speech of immigrants in Los Angeles
with the speech of people who stayed behind in Mexico clarifies the issue of
which changes are the result of Spanish/English bilingualism and which are
processes with their roots in the language of the feeder communities.
