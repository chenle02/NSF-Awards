This award is one of a group of three in support of the research program at the
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) millimeter wave interferometer. A
consortium of three major universities, the University of California at
Berkeley, the Unversity of Illinois, and the University of Maryland have pooled
their resources, both financial and human, to develop an outstanding
astronomical facility, clearly a world leader in millimeter wave interferometry.
The program funded here will utilize the existing three-element array as it is
expanded to nine telescopes. Investigations will study objects ranging from our
sun and planets in our solar system to distant galaxies. The instrument and
software reduction packages will also be made available to users outside the
BIMA consortium.
