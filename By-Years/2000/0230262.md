North Carolina State University (NCSU) and North Carolina Agricultural and
Technical State University (NC A&T) are collaborating in developing a program
designed to increase the number of graduates in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM). Specific program elements include a summer camp at NCSU
for graduating high school students who have not selected their majors, summer
bridge programs at both NCSU and NC A&T designed to prepare new STEM students
for introductory college science and math courses, undergraduate research
programs at both schools, tutoring and mentoring of STEM majors and a faculty
exchange program between the two campuses. A comprehensive monitoring program is
included to track all students in the program and to provide the data required
to evaluate each program element. Success in the program will result in an
increase in the number of STEM graduates, through both an increase in the number
of entering majors and an increase in retention.
