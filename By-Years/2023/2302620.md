This project will investigate cluster algebras, which are certain algebras of
rational functions. Cluster algebras are central objects in modern algebraic and
geometric combinatorics because of their deep connections to a wide variety of
other mathematical objects that arise in algebraic geometry, representation
theory, topology, and other areas. They are also important in particle physics,
where they are related to scattering amplitudes in certain quantum field
theories. Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only
interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in
other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for
students through involvement in the research.

In more detail, when a topological space is expected to admit a cell
decomposition, it is desirable to find an actual decomposition. This project is
to find cell decompositions of quiver Grassmannians that can be used to give a
topological explanation for positivity in cluster algebras. The fundamental
notion of Schubert cell decompositions for usual Grassmannians will be
generalized. The project will develop new combinatorial and geometric objects to
reveal more concrete relationships between cluster algebras and other areas of
mathematics. This project is jointly funded by Algebra an Number Theory Program,
the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the
Combinatorics Program.
