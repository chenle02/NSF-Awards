The goal of this proposal is to improve the teaching of microbiology by
introducing the study of animal viruses into virology-immunology laboratories at
this institution with a large hispanic student population. The purchase of CO2
incubators, tissue culture enclosures, tissue culture microscopes and an EIA
microtitration plate reader allows animal virus to be cultured and detected.
