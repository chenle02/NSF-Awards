9317401 Peterson In order to evaluate two classes of food chain models (top-down
and bottom-up regulation of species abundance), this project includes continued
evaluation of moose and wolf population dynamics in Isle Royale National Park,
Michigan, an island in Lake Superior (544 km2 in area). Also included is
expanded monitoring of moose condition and vegetation status. The two food chain
model classes have opposing predictions for two trophic subsystems which are
evident on Isle Royale. These subsystems, attributable to differences in
postglacial history, differ in forage production rate for moose, a fact that
allows greater discrimination between contrasting predictions of food chain
theories. Food chain models also have opposing predictions following the
transformation of a three-trophic-level system into a two-trophic-level system,
a change now predicted for Isle Royale because of genetic deterioration in its
small wolf population. The research includes long-term aerial and ground
monitoring of wolves, moose, and vegetation, recognizing the two trophic
subsystems, through the expected period of wolf decline (about one decade). The
proposed study, building on an unprecedented database covering the past 35
years, will provide a critical terrestrial test of predictions of food chain
models, as well as contribute to a better understanding of the regulatory role
of wolves in this well-characterized ecosystem.
