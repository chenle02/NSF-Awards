9619256 Gangopadhyay Carbon nitride films will be grown using two growth
techniques, capacitive discharge chamber (CDC) growth, and plasma enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). These films will be characterized in an
extensive study of their physical properties. Growth using CDC is a novel
approach, and promises significant potential for producing crystalline B-C3 N4
films. ***
