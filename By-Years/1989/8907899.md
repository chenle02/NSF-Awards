This award provides funds to a group of botanists who are interested in the
processes that control soil nutrient availability in temperate and tropical
regions. The investigators study both agricultural and forest soils in efforts
to understand the role of microfauna, nitrogen-carbon-phosphorus interactions,
root dynamics, nitrogen fixation, decay of organic matter, and water dynamics in
the production or cycling of nutrients. The requested equipment is needed to
provide the accurate measurements of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur
needed for these types of studies, and for measurement and analysis of root
growth and of the microfauna in the soil. The nutrient properties of soil and
its relation to the ecosystem directly or indirectly dependant on it for
sustenance is a topic whose fundamental importance has been widely recognized in
recent years. There is now widespread concern about the continued conversion of
forest lands to agricultural purposes, now largely occurring in tropical areas,
and about the kinds of land management techniques needed to preserve existing
forest and to maximize the benefits gained from land where conversion has
already occurred. Key to the latter is a basic understanding of the formation,
use and recycling of nutrients in natural (forest) and artificial (agricultural)
ecosystems. The use of equipment of the types funded through this award is
crucial to this understanding.
