An equation of state of aqueous electrolyte solutions at finite concentrations
is developed in this work. The approach is based upon a new thermodynamic
perturbation theory in which the reference fluid is taken to be a mixture of
neutral and charged spheres. Interactions arising from solvent polarity are
treated as the perturbation. The properties of the new reference fluid are
obtained from numerical solutions of the Ornstein-Zernicke integral equation
using finite element methods. The direct correlation function for charged pairs
is approximated by the HNC equation and PY closure used for other pairs. The
accuracy of these correlation functions are tested by comparison with computer
simulations. This basic research is required in the development of a predictive
description of electrolyte solution thermodynamics and phase equilibria. The
work is partially motivated by a continuing interest in the application of
statistical mechanics to the description of fluid interfaces. Aside from the
role played in the development of interfacial science, a predictive description
of ionic solutions is urgently needed for the synthesis and optimization of
industrial processes, for the description of chemically complex aqueous
environments, and for an understanding of some biological systems.
