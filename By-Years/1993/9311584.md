This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Smith at the University of Notre Dame to study methods to regulate the binding
of small (amino acids, nucleosides, saccharides) and large (enzymes,
glocoproteins) biomolecules to abiotic, boronic acid-based receptors by two
avenues. The first involves the synthesis and study of a series of boronic acid
crown ether molecules designed to heterotopically bind and cotransport water-
soluble diol-ligands and metal cations across lipophilic membranes. This
approach is based on ionic strength controlled binding. The second approach
involves photoswitchable receptors and is based on the photochemically
controlled binding of the biomolecules. The synthetic receptors will be
lipophilic, photoswitchable boronic acid azobenzenediol carrier molecules which
will also be explored as light-powered transmembrane proton pumps. %%% In this
project Professor Smith will investigate methods of regulating the binding of
various types of biological ligands to abiotic, boronic acid-based receptors.
Both ionic strength controlled and light controlled binding methods will be
investigated. In the ionic based method the binding to the heterotopic receptors
is controlled by metal ions, while the light controlled method involves
photoswitchable receptors. This research may have technological applications
such as (bio)chemical purification devices, carriers for transport through
lipophilic membranes, and controlled release materials.
