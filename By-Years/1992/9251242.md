This project will create a laboratory-based polymer chemistry course for
advanced chemistry majors. The equipment to be acquired includes a gel
permeation chromatograph (GPC) a Digital Viscometer, a constant temperature
viscometer bath, and accessories for a thermomechanical analyzer. The
instrumentation requested will serve with existing equipment as the instrumental
basis for a newly offered polymer chemistry laboratory/lecture course. A large
proportion of the experiments in the course will use the equipment for polymer
physical property measurements and polymer characterization. Further, the
equipment will be utilized in instrumental analysis, and three physical
chemistry laboratory courses.
