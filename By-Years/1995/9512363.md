9512363 Kam This proposal request equipment requests equipment for hierarchial
and distributed industrial control centered around a new Honeywell TDC-3000
process control system, which has been donated to Drexel University. This
equipment will help the PI's expand their research and education into power
systems, robotics and manufacturing. The TDC-3000 is a real-time industrial
control system which is currently operating in power-generation stations, oil
refineries, chemical factories and manufacturing plants. The architecture of the
system permits sensing (monitoring) and control of various processes with
special purpose programs for optimal control. The request is to acquire and
configure the TDC-3000 system (with Honeywell participation) and to design,
construct and install new process-control and robotic plants which will be
controlled by the configured system. This equipment will establish a facility
for industrial process control at Drexel and extend their E4 curriculum to the
junior and senior level as well as first-year graduate school. ***
