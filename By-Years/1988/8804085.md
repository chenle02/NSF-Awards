This project concerns itself with a means of both formalizing and automating the
specification process. It proposes a model of specification design that a) is
evolutionary, b) is based on collaborative problem solving by both analyst and
client c) represents conflicting goals, and d) is knowledge-based. Efforts are
divided along two broad fronts: 1) the definition of a process model of problem-
acquisition and specification-construction, and 2) a characterization of the
form and content of the knowledge underlying such a model. The long range goal
is to approximate the type of expertise seen in a competent, experienced,
software analyst as he or she interacts with a client to construct a software
specification. The project continues a) the experimental study of expert, human,
software analysts and b) the construction of a system for specification
critiquing derived from such studies, and proposes new work in the areas of c)
conflict and compromise in specification construction, and d) models of design
that extend that of traditional top-down refinement.
