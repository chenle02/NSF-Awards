Present theories of magnetic reconnection fail to account for magnetospheric
substorms. Recent measurements of impulsive, short duration, high velocity flow
bursts directed towards the Earth also do not conform to the standard picture of
magnetospheric convection at quiet times. This grant is for support to study
observationally and theoretically the small scale dynamics of the plasma sheet
prior to substorm breakup. The observational part will characterize individual
flow bursts using AMPTE satellite measurements so as to deduce information that
might lead to a better understanding of the their dynamics. The theoretical
objective will be to develop a one-dimensional nonlinear travelling wave model
of an individual flow burst incorporating the effects of non-adiabaticity in the
ion dynamics.
