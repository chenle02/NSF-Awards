Undergraduate students currently struggle to understand the importance and
utility of frequency domain analysis due to a lack of equipment to demonstrate
key concepts. This project seeks to alleviate this major weakness by providing
students with laboratory experiences in the characterization of signals in the
frequency domain and in the measurement of network frequency response
characteristics. The equipment consists of function generators for producing
signals and dynamic signal analyzers which display frequency domain magnitude
and phase information for signals and systems. This equipment will be used in a
required introductory laboratory course to confirm phasor analysis concepts, to
study Fourier series, and to develop an understanding of basic filters. Of equal
importance, the equipment will be used by students in a three semester design
course where they propose, implement, and document some electrical apparatus of
their choosing. Additionally, the equipment will be used to support the
development of laboratories for undergraduate control systems and analog filters
courses, and for classroom demonstrations.
