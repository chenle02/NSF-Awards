Abstract for award DMS-0355496 of Katz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
principal investigator proposes to continue work in arithmetic algebraic
geometry, especially the l-adic cohomology of varieties over finite fields, the
l-adic theory of exponential sums over finite fields, the locations of the "low-
lying zeroes" of &lt;br/&gt;L-functions over finite fields, the determination of
monodromy groups, and the application of that determination to the earlier
questions. Some of the main tools are group theory, Fourier Transform, and the
theory of perverse sheaves. Particular topics &lt;br/&gt;of investigation
include the calculation of monodromy groups, questions about the
&lt;br/&gt;L-functions of elliptic curves, and the equidistribution of character
sums as the &lt;br/&gt;character varies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader
impact of this project is three-fold. While it is too soon to appraise the wide
societal impact of this particular project, the last two decades have seen
stunning practical application in many fields (e.g. telecommunications,
cryptology, and computer security, to name just a few) of a great deal of
algebraic geometry over finite fields, some of which goes back to the nineteenth
century, and all of which seemed quite arcane at the time it was being done. On
a more immediate scale, the project will lead to a great deal of interaction
with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates, both
in theoretical collaborations and in the carrying out of computer experiments.
From the narrowest point of view, the project will advance our knowledge in a
vital area of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
