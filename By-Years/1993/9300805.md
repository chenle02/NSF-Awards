Optimal control of solutions of dynamical systems which may not exist globally
in time will be the focus of this project. The maximum time for which the
solution exists is called the blowup time. When the dynamics contain a control
the blowup time depends on the control. It is natural to pose the problem of
optimally controlling the blowup time. The main direction of this research will
be to characterize the blowup time and associated blowup set, that is, the set
on which the blowup time is finite, as a function of the initial conditions of
the problem. Additional problems of interest include optimal control of
extinction time, that is, the first time the system reaches the zero state,
which is related to classical questions of controllability, and optimal control
of the quenching time, that is, the first time the derivative blows up but the
function remains bounded. This project is concerned with controlling the onset
of unbounded behavior in singular systems. Mathematical models of phenomena such
as thermal combustion exhibit this behavior, which is known as blowup. In such
problems the solution of the model problem becomes unbounded in finite time. As
a practical matter, it may be desired to delay the onset of blowup for as long
as possible in order to allow, for example, the temperature to increase as much
as possible prior to combustion. Similarly, certain biological and economic
problems can be described by equations which exhibit blowup in finite time.
Maximizing the blowup time in a system governing the growth of tumors, for
example, would be effected through the use of chemotherapeutic or radiation
therapy as the control. Controlling the extinction time of such a system would
amount to minimizing the time at which the tumor size decreases to zero.
