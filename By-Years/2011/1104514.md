The ninth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held
April 2-3, 2011, at Michigan State University in East Lansing. The conference
will take place over two days and involves more than 140 graduate students of
all levels from all over the country. The conference will consist
of:&lt;br/&gt;1) 24-32 graduate student talks on expository and original
research topics in geometry and topology; &lt;br/&gt;2) Three plenary speakers
who are prominent in their respective fields and excellent expositors: Ralph
Cohen (Stanford), John Etnyre (Georgia Institute of Technology) and Karsten
Grove (University of Notre Dame); &lt;br/&gt;3) Four talks meant to introduce
graduate students to a selection of open problems led by young
faculty:&lt;br/&gt;Dave Futer (Temple University), Teena Gerhardt (Michigan
State University), Matthew Hedden (Michigan State University) and Jean-Francois
Lafont (Ohio State University).&lt;br/&gt;There will be talks in many subfields
of topology and geometry, which may include hyperbolic geometry, three-
manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory, category
theory, Teichmuller theory, four-manifolds, differential topology, geometric
group theory, and algebraic K-theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians from
different geographic regions. Participants come from dozens of different
schools, and include graduate students at all years of study. Although there are
many conferences dedicated to topology and geometry, this is the only one (that
we are aware of) dedicated to graduate students. The experience of presenting at
this conference allows graduate students to refine their speaking skills and
grow into more effective communicators. Because of the opportunity to meet other
students in related fields, the environment also encourages collaboration now
and throughout the participants' careers. Additionally, both geometry and
topology are growing mathematical fields with deep connections to many other
areas of research, including dynamical systems, physics, computer science and
mathematical biology. This conference serves to further communication about
research in these areas, and to enable and encourage graduate students in these
fields. More information about the conference can be found at
