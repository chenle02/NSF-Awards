This project will combine summative and formative evaluation techniques to apply
to completed Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 Model Institutions for Excellence
awards. The evaluative study will interpret the quantitative and qualitative
outcomes and the elements of the program that led to success or failure to
accomplish the goals of the MIE program. The outcome of the study will be a
document describing the successes and failures of the MIE projects, the factors
that led to success and failure, and a summation of the MIE projects that can be
used to guide other institutions in developing models to increase participation
of under represented groups in SMET undergraduate and graduate programs. This
research will be of value in determining how to assess and disseminate
successful models that lead to institutional change in promoting the
participation in SMET careers of under represented groups.
