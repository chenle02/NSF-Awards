This experimental research program focuses on the study of the physics of
quantum entanglement in macroscopic systems. The investigators will analyze a
class of systems that uses a macroscopic ensemble of atoms to represent quantum
information. The atomic ensemble is excited in a way that lends itself to a
description as a collective harmonic-oscillator mode, represented by a Bosonic
degree-of-freedom. As such, the concepts of continuous-variable quantum
information will play a role. The goal of this work is to create quantum states
of collective atomic ensemble variables by conditional measurement and to create
entanglement between two such distant ensembles. This will set the stage for
further development of quantum communication networks over long distances. The
broader impact of the program involves student education as well as new course
development.
