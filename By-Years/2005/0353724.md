The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of North Carolina, Pembroke, for the summers of
2004-2006. The Physics Division cofunds this site. Paul A. Flowers is the site
director. This site will provide research experiences for 6 students for 10
weeks each summer. The research projects feature fundamental studies relevant to
the development of chemical and radiation sensors for in situ measurements.
Equal numbers of UNC Pembroke and community college students will be recruited
to work in pairs with a chemistry or physics faculty mentor. Recruitment will
target the Pembroke students and regional community colleges with diverse
student populations. Pembroke is a historically Native American institution. The
program will conclude each summer with a student research symposium. Following
their summer research, student researchers will participate in an on-line course
of readings and assignments involving the scientific literature and
communication of research. Assessment data will be compiled from surveys,
evaluations of student presentations, the on-line course, and post-program
tracking.
