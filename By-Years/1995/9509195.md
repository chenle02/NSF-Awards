9509195 Zelditch This research will extend studies of the ontogeny (the
development of single individuals from egg to adult) of body form to be
informative about phylogeny, and to provide information that was not available
from comparisons of other body features. The proposed research will extend these
studies of the ontogeny of body form, as part of an ongoing revision of piranha
fishes. %%% The significance of the work is that it involves use of a novel
morphometric method and investigation of the strengths and weaknesses of this
method and its utility to systematic biology. Specifically, the research will
address general questions regarding the relationship between ontogeny and
phylogeny. One general question concerns the potential constraints that ontogeny
may impose on morphological evolution. A commonly invoked constraint is
Odevelopmental integrationO the association among the parts of an ontogeny. One
specific hypothesis is that developmentally integrated features will exhibit
congruent phylogenetic patterns because, in effect, they are not independent
characters. This has been an important issue in systematics and evolutionary
morphology and will be examined in this research. ***
