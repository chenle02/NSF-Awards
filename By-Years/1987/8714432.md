Experimental programs throughout the world are generating increasingly detailed
information about ion-ion collisions which require more theoretical effort
directed toward determination of the operative dynamical principles. The
proposed research will seek to explain the linear transfer of momentum in mass
asymmetric collisions, to describe and to predict fluctuation phenomena, and to
explore signatures for a quark-gluon phase transition in ultra-relativistic
collisions. The other major thrust of this theory program is the development of
a comprehensive and consistent description of nuclear structure at low
excitations which gives a complete and reliable account of experimental
information available from a variety of probes.
