New Tools for Teachers Through Secme Network Training is a one year pilot
program to tryout the ideas contained in the three-year proposal that was
submitted. The project will provide a series of three-day workshops with one-day
follow-ups locally at school systems throughout the Southeast. Precollege and
university resources available from within SECME will be utilized to enhance the
skills of less expert teachers. SECME Institutes had previously readied teachers
for participation in the program and this new project will provide advanced
inservice of subject-matter science related training. An amount equivalent to
6.2 percent of the NSF award is being contributed by SECME as cost-sharing.
