In a not too distant future, assistive robots will become a natural part of the
human society, in hospitals, schools, elder care facilities, inner city urban
areas, and eventually homes. While wheeled robots, e.g., a humanoid torso on a
mobile platform, can cover a range of tasks that assistive robots will be needed
for, eventually, legged robots will be the most suitable, as legs increase the
effective workspace of a robot and allow maneuvering more complex terrains like
steps, curbs, and cluttered and rough terrains in general.&lt;br/&gt;This
project investigates biped locomotion with a Sarcos humanoid robot. In contrast
to most other projects in biped locomotion, it emphasizes walking over uneven
and rough terrain, obstacle avoidance, recovery from unexpected perturbation,
and learning methods for motor control, as these issues seem to be the most
important for working in dynamic and partially unpredictable human environments.
Another focus is on dexterous movement control, i.e., control with a maximal
amount of compliance and minimal negative feedback gains, using advanced
operational space controllers with internal model control. Dexterous, compliant
control will increase safety of the robot when accidentally impacting with
humans or obstacles, and it will also allow the robot to recover more easily
from external perturbation simply by ?giving in?. Such a control approach
requires departing from the traditional high-gain position controlled humanoid
systems, and focuses on torque control, reactive instantaneous control instead
of finite horizon optimization, as well as efficient motion planning and
learning methods. &lt;br/&gt;
