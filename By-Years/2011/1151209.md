Finding the ketchup in the refrigerator is an everyday activity that requires
the use of visual attention. When faced with a cluttered visual environment (the
refrigerator), the human visual system can isolate a single, behaviorally
relevant item (the ketchup). Visual attention reduces the complexity of the
visual world, enabling us to successfully navigate and function without being
overwhelmed with the sheer amount of visual information. But how does attention
know what to select? Some theoretical accounts propose that attention is
directed toward salient (conspicuous) objects, whereas other accounts state that
attention is directed toward goal-relevant objects. One limitation of both of
these accounts is that they fail to acknowledge that attention is typically used
in conjunction with action, which involves coordinating your body with objects
in the environment. The goal of this research project is to understand how the
body and its position (such as an outstretched arm reaching into the
refrigerator) controls visual attention. The research team will investigate this
notion of 'embodied attention' using both behavioral and brain imaging (event-
related potential) methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on embodied attention
is important in providing a fuller account of how the mind and body interact to
function successfully in the world. The research also offers the possibility to
improve the lives of older adults and those with neuropsychological deficits,
because these people often have impairments in both motor function and the use
of attention. It may be that understanding the connection between body position
and attention will lead to treatments that increase the ability of these target
populations to function in the world.
