Boiling of water to transfer heat has applications in our day-to-day lives,
e.g., in power generation, water purification, and cooking. When water boils
over a surface, substantial amounts of heat can be transferred from the surface
to the water without causing a significant increase in the surface temperature;
hence, boiling is also used in applications such as cooling of electronics where
large temperature rises are prohibitive. However, when a large amount of heat
must be removed from a small area through boiling, it encounters a crisis called
the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) limit. At this limit, the rapidly generated vapor
bubbles merge to form a vapor film on the hot surface which prevents liquid
water to contact the surface. This project pursues a new type of surface, called
the Binary Surface(s) (BiS), for extending the current CHF limits for the
boiling of water. The underlying science that enables enhanced boiling
performance of water on BiS will be shared with the public through YouTube
videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A BiS is a highly wetting surface with many sub-
surface micro-/nano-cavities, which are filled with a Non-Boiling Liquid (NBL)
creating puddles around solid islands. The goal of this research project is two-
fold: (1) to experimentally measure the CHF and the Heat Transfer Coefficient
for the pool boiling of water on a copper-oil BiS (oil is the NBL) and compare
them with those obtained on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces and (2) to
obtain evidence for the hypothesis that heterogeneous bubble nucleation occurs
on a BiS. Two tasks are planned to realize this goal and they include pool
boiling experiments and BiS surface preparation and analysis before and after
the experiments. This project helps to establish the feasibility of a new
boiling enhancement mechanism that could have a significant impact in many
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
