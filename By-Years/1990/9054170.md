Thirty college mathematics faculty are exploring differential equations as they
are applied to a variety of different topics, with an emphasis on mathematical
modeling in ecology. During the three week workshop selected fundamental topics
from differential equations will be discussed and it will be shown how these
topics can be useful in contemporary mathematical modeling problems,
particularly problems in population dynamics including those factors which lead
to the extinction or survival of endangered species. The emphasis will be on
basic new theoretical results and their uses as well as mathematical modeling
techniques. Participants will submit reports indicating how these ideas were
incorporated into, or affected, their courses or their research during the
following year and reports will be distributed to all participants.
