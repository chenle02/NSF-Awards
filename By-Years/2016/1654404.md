In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-A
Program, Professor Sean Roberts and his students at the University of Texas at
Austin are developing new laser-based optical tools which enable the study of
electric charge transfer processes occurring at the interfaces of films composed
of semiconducting organic molecules. The research advances our knowledge about
the properties of electrically conductive molecules, and may also advance the
application of this class of molecules in solar energy technology. The project
provides a vehicle for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in
chemistry, optical physics, and materials science. A significant part of the
undergraduates' involvement occurs through a collaboration with Austin Community
College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to establish
the structure-function relationships that guide interfacial charge and energy
transfer at two model organic semiconducting (OSC) interfaces: (1) squaraine
dye:fullerene heterojunctions used to separate charge in organic photovoltaics,
and (2) silicon and Indium-Gallium-Arsenic (InGaAs) surfaces that have been
sensitized with singlet fission-capable acene molecules. To measure the
electronic structure and dynamics of these interfaces, the Roberts groups is
employing steady-state and time-resolved measurements based on an interface-
specific technique, Electronic Sum Frequency Generation (ESFG). ESFG allows for
selective viewing of energy and electron transfer at OSC interfaces. By using
these spectroscopic methods in conjunction with conventional thin film
characterization tools and material processing methods that can alter molecular
packing at heterojunctions, the project allows the research group to establish
structure-function relationships that can improve the efficiency of energy
transfer and charge separation at buried OSC interfaces and potentially advances
photovoltaic technologies.
