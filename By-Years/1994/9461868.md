Programmable Calculators with a computer link are now affordable for individual
student use. It is possible to design calculator software that transforms these
calculators into personal computers for every elementary school student to use
as conveniently as a textbook. Programs can be stored on a computer disk and are
easily loaded into a class set of calculators to meet individual or class lesson
needs. The advantages of computer aided instruction are accessible to every
student for school and home use. Early age student use of this individual
technology, parent involvement at home and better open ended problem solving are
now possible. CalcuSoft, Inc. proposes initially to develop calculator software
for fourth grade mathematics by linking our pilot test in one classroom to six
more classrooms, funded by this Phase I research project. The outcomes will
guide development of their product and a Phase II proposal that includes
applications in science and special education.
