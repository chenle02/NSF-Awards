The 1997 Nuclear Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will provide an
international community of nuclear scientists with a forum for the exhibition of
the newest developments at the forefront of nuclear reactions initiated by
heavy-ion beams at relativistic energies. Mechanisms for break-up in heavy-ion
reactions such as multifragmentation and fusion- fission will be discussed.
Within the realm of these topics will be presentation of the latest results on
super-heavy elements and the determination of time scales in nuclear fission.
