Dr. Glenn Nagel and other members of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry of the California State University at Fullerton are being supported
to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry.
For the period 1995-97, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects in traditional areas
of chemistry and biochemistry. The program is designed to enhance the students'
interest and fascination in chemistry and biochemistry; the students' technical
skills in the laboratory; their ability to design and interpret experiments; and
their ability to communicate verbally and in writing. A unique feature of this
program is the ethics component -- a seminar series entitled `Science, Ethics,
and the Environment` which examines ethical and environmental issues related to
the students' research.
