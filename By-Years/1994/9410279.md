This research examines the question of how synchronization affects the temporal
behavior of concurrent systems. The main problem addressed is that of
determining tight bounds on separation times between system events. The
concurrent system model used is a directed graph whose vertices represent events
(synchronizations) and whose edges are annotated with delay information (bounds
on computation times). The approach is to use algebraic techniques for
manipulating an infinitely unfolded graph to implicitly examine the entire set
of temporal behaviors. The research is extending the types of temporal analyses
that can be preformed, as well as extending the classes of concurrent systems
whose timing behavior can be efficiently verified. Applications in the area of
asynchronous circuits are also being investigated.
