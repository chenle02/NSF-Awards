It is proposed to study the behavior of simple atoms in very intense
oscillatory microwave electric fields. The objective is an understanding of
quantum chaos, quantal systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic.
Experiments will be conductive in the 1011 Hz range, using for example, sudden
turn-on, in various one-frequency and two-frequency configurations to
investigate dynamical behavior of electrons relatively weakly bound in hydrogen
and helium.
