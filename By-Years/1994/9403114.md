9403114 Deem Dr. Michael W. Deem has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Deem received his doctoral degree at the University
of California at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor David Chandler. Dr.
Deem will continue his research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of
Professor David Nelson. His postdoctoral research will focus on the dynamic
properties of polymerized two-dimensional membranes. Longer term, he plans to
study the statistical mechanics of entangled polymers such as rubber or carbon
nanotubes. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
