Over the past 20 years, student interest in science, math, and engineering (SME)
education has dropped precipitously. Additionally, retention is a continuing
problem for SME majors; the problem, according to research is not primarily the
ability of "switchers" but instead is the lack of a cooperative environment and
appropriate support. This project uses an Honors program, which has well
prepared students and a demonstrated record of retention, to assist in
increasing SME interest and retention. The project builds an Honors
Communications and Simulation Laboratory to house a revised Honors curriculum
which immerses freshman students in lab-based courses. The primary course fall
term is a communications and simulation course in which students actively learn
communications and the pleasures of simulating natural and imaginary phenomena.
The rest of the revised curriculum uses the Lab as the primary classroom for the
Program. If an Honors program can be effectively used this way, it can have
national implications for how SME enrollments can be increased.
