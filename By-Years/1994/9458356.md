94598356 Thompson This NYI award is to support LuAnne Thompson to undertake
various process studies of isolated dynamical features (fronts and deep western
boundary currents), the kinematics and dynamics of the western equatorial
Atlantic and interannual variability in the tropical ocean circulation. Many of
her new research areas are more physically oriented than theoretical. She has
demonstrated her ability as a teacher by receiving a Danforth Distinction for
Teaching award while she was at MIT. She also taught seminars as a post-doctoral
fellow, and she has clearly defined her teaching plan for the University of
Washington.
