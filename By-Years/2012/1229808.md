ABSTRACT The objective of the proposed study is to develop a new type of
nonlinear scattering microscopy based on stimulated Rayleigh/Brillouin
scattering that will enable measurement of thermal and elastic properties of
cells. A central part of this work is assembly of a novel laser system that will
provide very rapid tuning and excellent noise properties. In this effort SRI
will (1) assemble the laser system, (2) combine the laser system with its
associated electronics, and (3) evaluate instrument performance and operation
through imaging of cells. This work will bring a new type of nonlinear
microscopy to biology and medical research that will complement existing
nonlinear microscopy techniques, including multiphoton microscopy using
fluorescence, second-harmonic and third harmonic generation, coherent anti-
Stokes Raman (CARS) microscopy, and four-wave mixing. SRI has recently developed
new advances in stimulated Rayleigh/Brillouin scattering that will enable rapid
imaging of cells without causing damage to the cells. The microscope SRI
proposes to develop will allow a new look at effects such as signal transduction
through mechanical forces, cell motility, cell division, and other aspects
involving changes in cellular viscoelastic properties.
