The Organic Dynamics Program will support Professor William J. le Noble's study
of "Electronically Driven Stereogenesis" in the Chemistry Department at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. He will explore the principle that
bond formation at trigonal carbon and bond cleavage at tetragonal carbon are
favored in face selectivity on that side which has the most electron-rich sigma
bond in the antiperiplanar position. In this project, Professor le Noble is
pursuing three major areas of research that will exploit unique advantages of
2,5-disubstituted adamantanes as probes to study stereoelectronic effects in
diastereofacial selection. One area of study will involve examination of the
scope of a simple rule according to which bond formation (addition reactions:
electrophilic addition, nucleophilic addition, pericyclic reactions, etc.) at
trigonal carbon and bond cleavage (decarboxylation, fragmentation, solvolysis,
etc.) at tetragonal carbon occur at that face which has the most electron rich
bond antiperiplanar. The rigidity of the adamantane skeleton guarantees that no
rotational motion will shroud the observed face selection in conformational
uncertainty. Another area of study deals with the transfer of chirality, and the
third area deals with the kinetic studies of solvolysis of 2- and 5-tosyl
adamantanes.
