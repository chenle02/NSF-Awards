This project involves acquisition of a refrigerated centrifuge for use in the
undergraduate biochemistry program. The centrifuge permits the preparation of
materials for a wide variety of experiments that illustrate basic biochemical
techniques used in laboratories associated with regular coursework. This
acquisition also opens to undergraduates an array of additional independent
research projects in biochemistry, providing valuable preparation for the large
percentage of students from this department who pursue professional education
beyond the baccalaureate. These increased opportunities, while not novel, fill a
gap in the previous biochemistry laboratory program, strengthening it in
significantly ways. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with a
slightly greater sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
