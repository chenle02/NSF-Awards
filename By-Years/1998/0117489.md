The long-term objective of this project is to establish effective techniques for
"fingertip haptics" - the direct fingertip exploration of virtual surfaces. This
includes "direct" touch of objects as well as distal attribution (touching using
an intermediate object such as a pencil or knife). In the course of the work,
two novel devices will be built and studied, a tactile-haptic device with
"contrary motion", and a novel "tangent plane" device, to help achieve the
tangent position of the operator's finger relative the virtual surface.
