This collaborative award will support formation of a Physics of Living Systems
Graduate Student Research Network, a trans-institutional community-based network
of graduate students and graduate student educators all working on the physics
of living systems. The initial participating institutions are the University of
California, San Diego (which will coordinate the program), the University of
Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Princeton University, Yale University, Cambridge
University, and University College, London. The network structure will allow
students at participating institutions (and a select number of other students)
to meet their peers (both in-person and in-silico) and collectively help define
the research agenda for this field. It will also allow for the creation of
visiting internships, which will serve both as a way of broadening students
perspectives on possible approaches to difficult research topics and as a way of
creating collaborative ties between groups at the various sites. This structure
will also enable the exploration of various means of educating these students in
biology, while also ensuring that they develop and maintain a firm grounding in
physics. This award is supported by the Physics of Livings Systems Program in
the Physics Division in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences,
as well as Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological
Sciences, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
