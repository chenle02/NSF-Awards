The goals of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program are to synthesize new transition metal-sulfur compounds, and
to characterize these new compounds structurally and with respect to the
reactivities of the M-S bonds and the coordinated sulfur ligands. The important
role of metal sulfur complexes in industrial and enzymatic catalysis is well-
recognized. Previous studies have provided reliable and systematic methods for
the synthesis of molybdenum complexes containing Mo=S bonds or eta-2-bonded
disulfur or tetrasulfur ligands. Analogous methods will be used to synthesize
similar sulfur complexes of other early transition metals, such as Zr, Nb and
Ta, and the structures and reactivities of the new complexes will be determined.
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies of heterometallic
clusters that contain various M-S functional groups will be carried out in
attempts to evaluate the importance of bimetallic cooperative effects in the
activation of specific molecules.
