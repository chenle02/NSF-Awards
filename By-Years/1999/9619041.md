9619041 Nelson This five-year project, sponsored by the American Association of
Physics Teachers, will carry out an extensive teacher enhancement program
serving primarily teachers of physics in the nation's urban areas. The project
will be based upon the successful Physics Teaching Resource Agent (PTRA) model.
Teachers will be selected from urban schools throughout the country to
participate in an intensive one-week program each summer for five years. In the
program, project staff will teach teachers physics content and innovative
teaching strategies. The workshops will take place just before the AAPT summer
meetings which these teachers will also attend. In each of the academic years of
the project, these teachers will carry out in-service programs with colleagues
in their districts who teach physics or physical science so that the knowledge
gained in the summer program will be disseminated throughout the urban area.
This in-service activity will be supported by project staff and lead PTRA
teachers from their geographic area. Altogether, 575 teachers will be served by
the project. Matching funds constitute 7% of the NSF award.
