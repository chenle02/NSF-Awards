This project is to improve the accessibility of the Novell microcomputer
network's "'Virtual Social Science Laboratory" to Sociology majors. The lab can
only be accessed in one building on campus, Evans Hall. Sociology classrooms,
graduate assistants and professors' offices are all in Arkansas Hall. Upgrading
the display capabilities in the proposed Arkansas Hall node of the lab will
include color, and classroom pedagogy will improve by providing professors the
ability to demonstrate laboratory findings "live"' in the classroom with the use
of an overhead display. The three required core classes of Statistics, Research
Methods, and Theory will become better integrated by using a networked common
body of databases, research simulations, computer conferencing and expert
systems. Students will gain hands-on experience in creating, storing, and
manipulating data files. With the electronic mail capabilities students can gain
valuable experience in scientific collaboration by communicating with sociology
majors at other institutions in the state over ARKnet.
