Algebraic geometry is concerned with understanding solutions of polynomial
equations. It has long been known that in general one cannot hope to find exact
solutions to polynomial equations, even for a single equation in one variable.
Nevertheless, it is often possible to answer more qualitative questions about
the set of solutions. In particular, one of the most fundamental and notoriously
difficult questions in algebraic geometry is whether solutions exist at all.
Motivic homotopy theory is a relatively new approach to such questions, and it
has already helped solve many open problems in the past twenty years. It borrows
many ideas and techniques from a different field of mathematics, topology, and
successfully applies them to algebraic geometry in unexpected ways. Following
this trend, this project aims to bring several fruitful ideas from topology to
the world of algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of
two parts. In the first part, the PI will develop equivariant motivic homotopy
theory from the point of view of parametrized homotopy theory. In the second
part, the PI will study highly structured commutative algebras in motivic
homotopy theory and hopes to address the problem of recognizing motivic loop
spaces. More specifically, the PI will lay solid foundations for equivariant
motivic homotopy theory by constructing Grothendieck's six-functor formalism for
fiberwise homotopy theory over algebraic stacks. The mere existence of this
formalism has interesting consequences for classical invariants of stacks, like
algebraic K-theory; it can also be used to construct new well-behaved
cohomological invariants of algebraic stacks, and to better understand the
relations between them. In the second part of this project, the PI will
introduce a motivic refinement of the notion of E_infinity ring and show that
many classical cohomological invariants of algebraic varieties possess this
refined multiplicative structure. The PI will also introduce the related notion
of motivic E_infinity space and investigate their role in a potential
recognition principle for infinite motivic loop spaces. To achieve these goals,
the PI will use existing as well as new methods from equivariant algebraic
geometry, ordinary motivic homotopy theory, classical algebraic topology, and
higher category theory.
