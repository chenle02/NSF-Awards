Engineering design has increased in complexity to the point where interactive
computing has become an indispensable part of the design cycle. Even with
computers, design can be very difficult when it involves the selection of many
interdependent parameters. this is a proposal for continued research on a
general purpose, optimization- based computer-aided-design methodology which
will supplement and eventually displace many heuristic design techniques. Such a
methodology is possible because a large variety of engineering design problems
are transcribable into the form of a very small number of standard, semi-
infinite optimization problems and because new system theoretic results
facilitate the use of optimization in engineering design. The proposal is in
three parts: the first deals with optimization algorithms for engineering
design, the second one deals with topics in optimization-oriented system theory,
and the third one deals with the development of an interactive software system
which provides an appropriate environment for optimization-based computer- aided
design.
