Recent findings indicate that community college graduates in information
technology (IT) face substantial competition for technician level jobs due to
preference for four-year graduates by hiring managers, the trend to outsourcing
IT positions and also sending them off-shore. Through surveys and interviews,
the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) and the
Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) collaborate to identify and
analyze hiring managers' perceptions of community and technical college
graduates in this employment context. The results are disseminated in a report,
Staying Competitive by Strengthening Connections, that provides a foundation for
educators to better understand how industry views two-year college programs and
graduates, and helps hiring managers understand the capabilities of graduates of
two-year college programs. The report should also help change the perceptions of
hiring managers and help two-year colleges modify their programs. The research
design and implementation are contracted to Market Decisions Corporation.
