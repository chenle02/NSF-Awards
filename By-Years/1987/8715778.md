Taxonomic research is the basic tool by means of which all evolutionary,
ecological, and other biological studies on species can be accomplished. Also,
for studies of endangered species and for the numerous biological inventories
now in preparation, misidentifications or misinterpretations, undocumented
findings, and incorrect species names can produce confusion and disaster. Dr.
Rupert Barneby of the New York Botanical Garden and his colleague Dr. James
Grimes are conducting a basic taxonomic study of the tropical legume genus
Pithecellobium and other genera associated with it, in an attempt to find stable
morphological features that will permit reliable identification of all species.
They will conduct field work in South America to gather new material, to
supplement existing herbarium specimens, and they will add new data from
scanning electron microscopy of pollen, known to show extensive variation among
these plants. To begin the project, they will focus on a number of segregate
genera with 50 or so species, before tackling the whole genus, estimated to
include over 160 species, mostly in the New World tropics. Resources at New York
Botanical Garden are excellent for this project.
