The award will partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-
doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members from institutions in the United
States to participate in the conference entitled, "American Physical Society,
Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD), 75th Annual Meeting of the Division of Fluid
Dynamics,' which will be held in Indianapolis, IN, November 20-22, 2022. This is
the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with
3,000 anticipated attendees.

The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of
scientific ideas, presentations of cutting-edge research, and exposure to a
richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid
dynamics. The conference will be attended by both prominent and young scientists
in fluid dynamics from around the world, who will discuss present and future
directions of research and research challenges. The conference will foster
cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in cutting edge areas of fluid
dynamics and will address challenges involved in advancing the field.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
