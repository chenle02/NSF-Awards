This is a project to bring abstract and often foundational aspects of number
theory, algebra, geometry, topology, and combinatorics to bear on concrete and
explicit questions in arithmetic, geometry, and classical number theory. The
basic problem is to find or describe all integer solutions of polynomial
equations that arise in mathematics, especially cryptography, and the physical
sciences. The simplicity and intrinsic beauty of these problems, and the
disproportionate depth and effort of their resolution, has inspired their study
since ancient Greece. The central questions that arise naturally stratify as
follows: Qualitative questions: Does there exist a solution? Do there exist
infinitely many solutions? Does the set of solutions have some extra structure
(e.g. geometric)? Quantitative questions: How many solutions are there? How
large is the smallest solution? How can we explicitly and with certainty find
all solutions? Implicit questions: Why do equations have (or fail to have)
solutions? Why do some have many and some have none? What underlying
mathematical structures control this? The research in this proposal is
complemented by educational and outreach activities, including the creation of a
summer graduate research workshop on arithmetic geometry and the continued
development of the open, collaborative MathOverflow web site.

This proposal aims to attack the problems described above with tools from less
concrete, often foundational fields (e.g., non-archimedan geometry, algebraic
stacks, non-abelian methods, perfectoids), with the goals of proving new results
on the generalized Fermat equation; developing techniques to find, with
certainty, all solutions to a given equation; developing techniques to bound the
number of solutions to a given equation; and building new tools
(geometric/cohomological) to study the structure of solutions of equations.
