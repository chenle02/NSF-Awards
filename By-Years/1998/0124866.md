Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The recent sequencing of the human genome and
continuing efforts to sequence and analyze genetic sequences of many species
demonstrate the need for effective pedagogies in genomic studies. This project
acquires the equipment and develops the materials necessary to engage
undergraduate students in a novel genome project adapting and implementing
materials from James Madison University. A DNA sequencer and sequence analysis
software are being used to initiate the Lynx Genome Project as a unit in the
Molecular Biology Laboratory course. Students are sequencing cDNA clones from
lynx species (the Rhodes College mascot) and using the resulting data in
evolutionary and functional prediction analyses. Results are expected to lead to
insights in efforts to conserve these threatened species. High school students
and teachers, a significant number of whom are members of groups
underrepresented in the sciences, are participating through a Summer Scholars
Program.&lt;br/&gt;
