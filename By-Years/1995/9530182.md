This research will examine the long-term labor market effect of neighborhoods on
thousands of former public housing residents who received subsidies to move to
various neighborhoods in the Chicago area through the Gautreaux housing program
from 1976 to 1995. The correlation between residence in a very poor neighborhood
and negative labor market outcomes is very strong. The question is to what
extent these labor market outcomes are the result of low skills and low
motivation of individuals alone as distinct from neighborhood effects. The
Gatreaux housing program moved similar families to a variety of neighborhoods in
a quasi-random manner, therefore the labor market experiences of the individuals
in these families can be used to separate individual effects from neighborhood
effects.
