Mercury (Hg) is an important neurotoxin that is present throughout the
environment. Currently, there are significant gaps in our ability to measure
mercury in the atmosphere. This workshop will gather national and international
experts on atmospheric mercury measurements to discuss questions concerning
current measurement capabilities and develop a strategy for the community. It
will take place in Seattle, Washington in October, 2008, and the final product
will be a written report for NSF and the community. The workshop will address
questions related to the ability to quantify mercury, the meaning and
uncertainty associated with mercury speciation measurements, the availability of
calibration systems for mercury, the capability and comparability of current
aircraft measurements, and the need for new mercury
intercomparisons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding mercury is an important
subject for environmental chemistry. This workshop will help move mercury
science forward by facilitating discussions among leading mercury scientists,
including international participants. It will lead to a report regarding future
mercury measurements in the atmosphere and possible new measurement techniques.
