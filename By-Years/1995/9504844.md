9504844 Madison Theoretical calculations of excitation and ionization are
undertaken for a number of effective one and two electron atoms. The approaches
range from the use of the distorted wave Born approximation to direct time-
dependent solutions of the Schr dinger equation. The results of these
calculations are important to further our understanding of the interaction of
charged particles with atoms and for a number of more applied problems in gas
discharges and plasma physics. ***
