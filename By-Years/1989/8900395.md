This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning in April 1989, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in research, under the
direction of seven (7) members of the chemistry faculty. At least six of the 8
REU Program participants will be chosen from a pool of applicants who attend
institutions other than Trinity University, and every attempt will be made to
bring four students from underrepresented minorities into this program each
year. The research programs in which these students will be engaged are designed
to offer them operational knowledge of modern chemical instrumentation,
opportunities for contributions to publishable research, and experiences in
effective communication of their results. As a result of their experiences, REU
student participants will understand in greater depth the wealth of choices
available to them in the chemical profession, and they will have an increased
orientation toward further education in the chemical sciences.
