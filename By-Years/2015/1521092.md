With the rapid expansion of computer networks and mobile devices, technologies
are in great demand for managing and making best use of large collections of
images. Semantic content analysis of images is at the heart of these
technologies. The objective of this project is to develop new mathematical tools
to tackle crucial and perplexing problems in image understanding. The
statistical learning methods and the prototypical system to be developed in this
project will have wide applications, valuable for both academia and industry.
Software packages will be distributed and maintained for public access. This
project will involve undergraduate students in research, and expose graduate
students to a broad range of mathematical topics and interdisciplinary topics.

Although advanced statistical learning methods have been exploited to annotate
images automatically, existing approaches suffer from both flaws in the
mathematical characterization of images and limitations in the modeling of
annotation words and image components. In this project, new statistical models
will be proposed for images and their semantics. Computationally efficient
estimation methods will be developed for these models. Advanced optimization
techniques will be used to better characterize images. New large-scale
clustering algorithms will be developed for sets of weighted and unordered
vectors under the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. It is envisioned that the
clustering and statistical modeling methods developed in this project will have
broader applications than image content analysis.
