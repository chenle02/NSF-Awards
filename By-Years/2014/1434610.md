The grant provides student travel support to the Symposium on Foundations of
Software Engineering (FSE 2014), to be held on November 11-16, 2014 in Hong
Kong, China. This is one of the flagship conferences in the Software Engineering
field for researchers and educators to present and discuss the most recent
innovations, trends, experiences, etc. Funding for student travel has
significant broader impacts because of the opportunity it gives the students to
become part of the research community, discuss their research with others,
listen to and meet with leaders in the field, and so on. This conference is
international and takes place in China, which provides an international
dimension, because students will have experiences relevant to becoming part of a
global workforce.
