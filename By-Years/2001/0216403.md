0216403&lt;br/&gt;Izatt&lt;br/&gt;Over a three year instrument development
program, a new generation of noninvasive quantitative three-dimensional
microscopy technology specialized for longitudinal (nondestructive) studies of
development and gene expression in small animals will be developed. This
instrument will integrate recent developments in optical coherence tomography
(OCT) and optical coherence microscopy (OCM), which employ cutting-edge
ultrahigh-bandwidth optical communications technologies for micron-scale
resolution non-contact imaging in translucent materials including living
biological tissues. &lt;br/&gt;
