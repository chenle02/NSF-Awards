9730964 Crawford Seafloor compliance inversion is one of a very few techniques
for determining the melt distribution at oceanic spreading centers. Existing
measurements provide evidence for melt in the lower crust and upper mantle
beneath the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees north. Existing computational
algorithms designed to calculate compliance over laterally varying basement will
be improved and tested, and two- and three-dimensional data inversion routines
for complicance data will be developed.
