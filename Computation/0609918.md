The PI and colleagues study the numerical simulation of an incompressible The PI
and colleagues study the numerical simulation of an incompressible viscous
fluid, obeying the Stokes equations. The research will study the effect of an
additional stochastic forcing term, random viscosity and random boundary values
. Methods of constructing families of solutions will be used and compared. The
PI is interested in the relationship between uncertainty in the input (forcing
term) to the uncertainty in the output (solution values used to estimate
expected values.) The research has three major components: 1. Monte Carlo
methods enhanced with sensitivity derivatives, for the stochastic Stokes
equations with random input parameters; 2. finite element approximation of
stochastic Stokes equations with white noise forcing terms; 3. the stochastic
spectral finite element method with polynomial chaos spaces, with random
coefficients and boundary conditions.

Computer calculations can seem deceptively precise. But scientists have
discovered that there is a significant amount of uncertainty in all physical
systems; not just when something is measured, but even when an attempt is made
to describe how the system changes. No computer calculation can possibly
consider every slight variation in the measurements and dynamics of a system
under study. And yet it is known that, at least in some cases, small amounts of
uncertainty can lead to significant, and even disastrous, errors in the computed
results. The proposed research is one example of the effort to understand,
quantify and control the effect of uncertainties, in this case, for a standard
physical computation involving the flow of a fluid. An important bonus of this
research is the involvement of a group of largely minority students, who will
receive the support, guidance and training necessary to begin scientific
careers.
