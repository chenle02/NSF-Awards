The proposed study will employ cross-sectional survey data to explore a variety
of social and psychological factors associated with marital infidelity. The
study has three goals: (1) to develop and test hypotheses linking sexual
infidelity to a) sexual values and tastes, b) risks to the primary relationship,
and c) opportunities for illicit sex; (2) to investigate well-documented gender
differences in sexual infidelity; and (3) to analyze characteristics of
secondary sex partners to illuminate gender differences and matching processes.
This study integrates piecemeal findings into one theoretical framework. Sexual
behavior is considered in the context of decision-making, an approach directing
attention to preferences, constraints, and opportunities. From this follows a
set of testable hypotheses on the factors associated with infidelity. The 1992
National Survey of Health and Social Life (NSHSL) will provide data. It offers a
large, nationally representative sample using several different measures of
infidelity. Although the project is motivated by a broad theoretical issues,
i.e., the mechanisms which two-party unions use to foster cooperation and manage
conflict, the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases via
secondary sex partners underscores the study's pragmatic importance.
