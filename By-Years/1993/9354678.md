9354678 Cook Students first learn statistical thinking through simple graphics
like bar charts and histograms. At the college level a graphical approach to
statistics is less often used. This is so in part because good graphics have
only just become available on computers. Possibly a more important reason is
that while numerical methods have a firm mathematical footing, graphical
statistics have consisted primarily of methods of graphing, without any
accompanying theory. In this project, a theoretically sound graphical approach
to statistics is being developed. Lessons concentrate on regression modelling or
curve fitting as well as other statistical ideas which can be used in courses at
all levels. What differentiates this project from others on graphics is the
development of a unified theory to make graphs more comprehensible and much more
useful in the analysis phase of a study.
