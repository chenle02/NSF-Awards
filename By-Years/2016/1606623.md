This research project explores questions in algebraic topology, a branch of
mathematics that concerns shapes in higher dimensions. Despite its abstract
nature, algebraic topology has proven to be useful in a variety of applications,
including theoretical physics, where the subject arises naturally in attempts to
reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, and data science, where the
subject has had considerable impact in the analysis of large data sets. A fifty-
year-old question in the field known as the Kervaire invariant problem was
solved in 2009; the answer to the question at the heart of the problem was the
opposite of what most experts had expected, and surprising new techniques,
potentially useful in other areas, were required in the proof. The research
project aims to amplify this discovery and adapt it to further
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to follow up
on this advance in two ways. First, a book in progress is designed to make the
solution methods accessible to graduate students and other interested non-
experts in the field, amplifying the mathematical infrastructure in equivariant
homotopy theory and category theory for the Kervaire invariant problem with
illustrative examples and explanations. Second, the tools developed to solve the
Kervaire invariant problem are being adapted to further applications. In
particular, there is a counterpart to the problem for each prime number. The
recent solution of the original, geometrically motivated, problem was for the
prime 2. The algebraic analog for primes 5 and larger had been solved in the
late 1970s. The algebraic problem remains open for the prime 3, and the
principal investigator has a plan for solving it. In addition, the surprising
nature of the solution to the 2-primary problem raises more questions than it
answers, implying in particular that certain predicted patterns in the homotopy
groups of spheres cannot occur. The question of what might replace them is wide
open.
