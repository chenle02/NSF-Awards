The mechanics of human motion is taught through the use of a video/computer
motion analysis system. This system is incorporated in laboratory
experimentation in courses in undergraduate Kinesiology. The motion analysis
system is applied directly directly to the teaching of kinematics and indirectly
to the teaching of kinetics. The equipment consists of a 2D video analysis unit,
a computer subsystem and a video subsystem. The grantee provides funds for this
project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
