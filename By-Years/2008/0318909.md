This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
innovative solar cell design that combines nanotechnology with conducting
polymer photovoltaics to achieve low weight, flexible solar cells of almost any
size and shape that far surpass current solar cell efficiencies. This project
demonstrates the potential of this design for increased efficiency and low cost
by prototyping single-layer solar cells with spectral responses tuned to the
solar spectrum. The research develops approaches to explore the four main
technical areas that are currently limiting nanocomposite photovoltaic cell
performance: illumination intensity saturation, conduction efficiency, charge-
separation efficiency and dispersal control of nanomaterials in a host matrix of
high concentration. In Phase I, these technical areas are explored to determine
the magnitude of potential performance improvements that can be achieved by
optimizing these parameters in Phase II; and compare these projections to the
maximum performance predicted by theory. In Phase II, the information gathered
in Phase I will be used to produce a prototype of an optimized, lightweight,
low-cost, flexible solar cell with efficiency greater than 10%; amenable to
large-scale, low-temperature manufacturing.

Commercial applications exist for high performance, low-cost solar cells that
can provide an alternative power generation source. Specific examples of use
include on-grid building integrated electricity generation systems; on-grid
wholesale power generation; remote off-grid power generation; and portable power
generation.
