The determination of species specific growth rates in natural populations is
one of the most sought after measurements in phytoplankton ecology. This
research program will investigate the response of diatom growth rates to
perturbations in dissolved silicate supplies using a fluorescent dye (Rhodamine
123). Diatoms incubated in Rhodamine 123 actively accumulate it into the silica
deposition vesicle and Rhodamine 123 is co- deposited with silica. The resulting
valves and girdle bands become fluorescent and provides a marker for cell
division in diatoms; thus allowing for the estimation of species specific growth
rates. Experiments will be performed to investigate the potential of low
dissolved silicate concentrations to limit the uptake of dissolved silicate and
to limit diatom growth rates, ultimately influencing species succession with
changes in ambient dissolved silica supply rates. The ability to distinguish
between the limitation of uptake and the limitation of growth rate is critical
to our understanding of nutrient limitation in aquatic systems. In addition,
experiments will be performed to investigate the response of diatom growth rate
may be a key factor governing the phytoplankton production to new nutrient
input.
