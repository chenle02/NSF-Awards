In undergraduate material courses, the lectures and textbooks emphasize
qualitative and quantitative structural aspects of materials, while the
laboratory portions concenrate on the more macroscopic, quantitive properties.
It is imperative that students understand that the macroscopic properties are a
result of the microstructures, and that microstructural features can be
quantitatively analyzed. This project enhances the quantitative analysis of
structures through the addition of a computer-based analysis system. An
additional benefit is that this system enables students to prepare better
samples in a reduced time period, thereby permitting more time for observation
and understanding. The award is being matched with a greater amount (113
