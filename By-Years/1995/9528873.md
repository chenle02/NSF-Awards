This dissertation research project studies the barriers to and ramifications of
providing Internet access to traditionally underserved (minority, low income,
limited English proficiency) populations. The examination will identify (1)
strategies, activities, and materials that can be used to encourage entry into
technology by these groups, (2) barriers to access, and (3) support services
required for continued participation. Qualitative methods, specifically
naturalistic inquiry, will be used to acquire the information and to evaluate
particpants' interactions with the Internet over time. The study will provide
data that can be used to help to narrow the gap between information `haves`
(those capable of accessing and using information productively) and `have-nots.`
Results can be used to inform designers and decision makers of the National
Information Infrastructure about processes by which underserved individuals and
groups come to understand, use, and participate in global networking.
