9604499 Miledi Understanding how the brain works is, undoubtedly, one of the
major scientific challenges of this century. This task is daunting not only by
the sheer number of nerve cells that compose the nervous system, but also by the
complexity of their interactions. Such interactions are fundamental to all
functions of the brain. Therefore, it is imperative to understand fully how
nerve cells communicate with one another in order to comprehend how the brain
functions. Nerve cells (also called neurons) communicate by sending chemical
signals termed neurotransmitters. The "sending" cell releases neurotransmitter
molecules, which act upon neighboring "receiving" cells. There,
neurotransmitters bind to specialized proteins called receptors.
Neurotransmitters and receptors act much like a key and a lock: if there is a
match, the receptors are activated, and the neuron is excited or inhibited.
Neurons possess various types of receptors, each specific for a given
neurotransmitter. The major type of inhibitory receptor in the brain is called
GABAa, because these receptors recognize the neurotransmitter GABA. GABAa
receptors are the target for a great variety of pharmaceutical drugs, including
benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Recently, a new type of GABA receptor was
discovered in the eye (which is an extension of the brain). This new type of
receptors, called GABAc, features properties that make it very distinct from the
two other types of GABA receptors that were known. Although GABAc receptors
recognize GABA, they are not affected by benzodiazepines or barbiturates, unlike
GABAc receptors. The aim of this project is to understand how the GABAc receptor
works, by studying how its molecular structure influences its properties. This
project will eventually lead to a better understanding of the role of this
receptor in the eye and in the brain. In addition, this knowledge could prove
very useful to rationally design new medicinal drugs that target specifically
given types of GABA receptors.
