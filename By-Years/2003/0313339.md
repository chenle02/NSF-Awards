Many domains of human activity are characterized by directed
graphs:&lt;br/&gt;interactions in social networks, citation networks,
hyperlinked&lt;br/&gt;domains like the web, trade relations between companies,
patterns of&lt;br/&gt;air travel. Clustering is a general technique to discover
global&lt;br/&gt;structure in such networks of local interactions. Presently,
networks&lt;br/&gt;with asymmetric relations are first symmetrized then
clustered by&lt;br/&gt;methods applicable to undirected graphs. This proposal
shows that&lt;br/&gt;symmetrization often loses the information about structure
and propose&lt;br/&gt;to develop a theoretical framework and algorithms for
clustering of&lt;br/&gt;directed networks. I will approach the task using the
random walks&lt;br/&gt;view that I developed and which has proved successful at
clustering in&lt;br/&gt;undirected graphs. &lt;br/&gt;
