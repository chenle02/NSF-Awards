The aim of this project is to determine how proline-rich left-handed
polyproline II (PPII) helices form. PPII helices are common in proteins and
often play vital roles in critical processes including signal transduction, cell
motility, transcription and immune response. PPII helices are involved in both
structural roles (e.g., as adopted by collagen) and molecular recognition (e.g.,
protein-protein interactions mediated by SH3 domains). It is commonly assumed
that many proline-rich regions of sequence (PRR's) adopt this confirmation. The
goal of this project is to determine the physical basis for PPII helices. This
will be achieved via systematic host-guest experiments using a
poly(proline)-based host peptide known to form a PPII helix. A combination of
experimental and computational methods will be employed. Circular dichroism will
be used to measure average PPII helical content of host-guest peptides in order
to determine contributions of both individual residues and pairs of residues to
the formation of PPII helices. High resolution nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics computer simulations will be used to
examine the atomic-level interactions that lead to the favoring or disfavoring
PPII helix formation. The data obtained from all of these experiments will be
combined to form a comprehensive atomic-level picture of PPII helix formation by
PRR's. The results of this project will be applicable to studies of a multitude
of critical physiological processes ranging from signal transduction to
transcription to cell motility. This project lays essential groundwork for
future studies of protein-protein interactions involving PPII helices formed by
PRR's.
