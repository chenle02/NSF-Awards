0331796&lt;br/&gt;Jafari&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the PI, co-PI, students
to collaborate with Hans-Michael Hannisch of the Department of Engineering
Science at the University of Halle, Germany. The US and German sides will work
together to develop distributed plug-and-play design formalisms and technologies
for enterprise integration. This will include integration from the shop floor up
through the supply chain network. On the shop floor, they will design
distributed plug-and-play components with embedded controllers synthesized from
control specifications. Beyond the shop floor, they will design distributed
plug-and-play components and verification formalisms based on business rules.
The proposed collaboration will enable the development of an inter-level
standardized formal approach to integration of distributed systems.
International standardization is important to acceptance by industry acting in
global markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this collaboration
are that it increases interactions between US researchers and those in Germany,
it promotes collaborative opportunities and career development for US junior
faculty, and the results of the research will be directly relevant to the needs
of industry.&lt;br/&gt;
