An REU site is established to involve ten seniors at this institution in a
program of research full-time for ten weeks during the summer and five hours a
week during the following academic year. A current undergraduate senior research
projects course serves as the basis for the REU which when implemented
eluminates a number of the deficiencies of the extant course. The focus of the
research will be in the investigation of fluids, automatic controls, materials
and structures found in aerospace systems. A careful management plan is
described and a strong student selection plan is evident.
