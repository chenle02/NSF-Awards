This request is for support to broaden and diversify the student participation
in the 15th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and
Storage (NAS), a premier international forum for the presentation of research
results in networking, high-performance computer architecture, and parallel and
distributed data storage technologies. It seeks to increase student
participation in the conference and the field. The proposed funding would
support the travel of eligible US students to the conference. Travel grants
encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field
who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in
the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort is made to reach
out to women and under-represented minorities. Preference is given to students
who will present their research at NAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
