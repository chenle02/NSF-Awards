9409519 Johnson This research is aimed at developing supply chain models to
facilitate the analysis of the delivery performance of a product. The supply
chain of a product is the interdependent network of activities from procurement
of raw material through final distribution. Supply chain models are analytical
tools for analyzing the delivery performance of a product. To buffer against
uncertainty in demand, manufacturers often hold excess inventory or maintain
excess capacity. The models to be develop will analyze tradeoffs between
buffering with capacity and inventory. These models will aid in capacity
planning and inventory control. The outcome of this research will contribute to
supply chain theory through the development of models which reflect
manufacturing capacity limitations. The results will provide some guide to
engineers and production managers in the design of supply chain software.
Furthermore, knowledge will be gained as to when supply chain models are
applicable and how model results should be interpreted by management.
