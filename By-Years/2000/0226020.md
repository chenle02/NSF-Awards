0226020&lt;br/&gt;Carter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award for U.S.-U.K.
dissertation enhancement research in novel materials involves Ms. Shelley
Gilliss, a graduate student and Ms. Nicole Munoz, an undergraduate student in
materials science at the University of Minnesota. Both students will travel to
University of Oxford to participate in research in glasses and ceramic oxides
under the guidance of the US investigator, Dr. C. Barry Carter and his U.K.
counterpart, John L. Hutchison. Ms. Gilliss will iinvestigate interactions in
the materials system, cerium oxide and silicate glass, cerium oxide and glass-
ceramics. Glass/oxide interactions play a critical role in a variety of
processes, from liquid-phase sintering to chemical-mechanical polishing of
glass. She will use scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and
transmission electronic microscopy to elucidate the chemistry, structure,
dimensions and morphology of these materials. The project takes advantage of
British expertise in microscopy in general and specifically in high-resolution
microscopy of oxides and glasses. &lt;br/&gt;
