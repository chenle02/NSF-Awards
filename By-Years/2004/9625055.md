Constraint databases are a recent generalization of relational databases.
Constraint databases have greater flexibility and expressive power than
relational databases because they allow complete information (unambiguous data)
to be described implicitly. The project addresses the development and
implementation of new methods for the (1) representation and querying of
incomplete information (ambiguous data) in constraint databases, (2) updating
and revising single constraint databases, and (3) combining and in case of
conflict arbitrating between or among several constraint databases. Approaches
for representing incomplete information will be analyzed for time and space
efficiency, while update, revision, and arbitration operators will be tested for
the least change property as expressed by the Katsuno-Mendelzon and related
axioms. A constraint database query and transformation language allowing both
representation of incomplete information and update, revision, and arbitration
operators will be implemented and tested on applications in spatial databases,
telecommunications, and refinement-based modeling of objects. This project will
greatly increase the real-life applicability of constraint databases.
