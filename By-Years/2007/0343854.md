This project continues modeling analyses of the observations acquired during the
Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiment in
order to better understand controlling influences on the seasonal cycle of
tropospheric ozone at high northern latitudes. Seasonal trends, dynamics and
latitudinal distributions of ozone and selected photochemically important trace
gases measured from aircraft during TOPSE will be characterized, and further
analyzed to identify specific factors controlling the observational data. By
combining multi-scale modeling approaches global-to-regional coupled chemistry-
transport simulations will be conducted to better understand the relative
contributions and interplay between natural and anthropogenic precursor emission
sources on observed tropospheric ozone - still a critical issue with respect to
atmospheric chemistry on larger spatial scales. Results from this study will
improve our understanding of how natural and human-induced emissions are
affecting the atmosphere and a better characterization on the seasonal cycle of
tropospheric ozone at high northern latitudes will offer improved insight on how
human activity impacts the chemistry of the troposphere and global climate. Two
graduate students will be supported to conduct the modeling and analyses under
the direction of the P.I., as will undergraduate students who participate in the
project through a program of intensive summer research experience.
