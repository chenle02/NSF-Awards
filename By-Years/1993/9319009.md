Jahn 9319009 The proposed experiments aim to understand how chromatin structural
changes influence in DNA rearrangements during macronuclear development and
include the following. The timing of replication, transcription and appearance
of major histone and non-histone proteins will be determined by labeling
studies. Chromatin proteins whose synthesis and deposition in the developing
macronucleus correlate with excision will be identified. Relationships to Tec
excision will be determined by nuclease digestion to identify alterations in the
Tec element chromatin structure. The extrachromosomal circular forms of Tec
elements will be purified as chromatin to determine whether proteins involved in
excision remain associated. Specific non-nucleosomal protein interactions will
be further identified by footprinting. %%% Ciliated protozoa contain two types
of nuclei, the micronucleus which serves as a transcriptionally inert germline
nucleus and the macronucleus which transcriptionally directs cell functions. A
variety of DNA rearrangements and DNA processing events are involved in the
formation of the macronuclear genome from the micronuclear genome during the
sexual phase of the ciliate life cycle. This project has as its goal an
understanding of how chromatin structural changes influence the DNA
rearrangements during macronuclear development. ***
