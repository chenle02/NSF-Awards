9416314 McLaughlin This research is to use 3-D computer simulations to
investigate the interaction of the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake
source with the three-dimensional geologic structure of the San Fernando Valley
and surrounding region. The project will be a collaboration between San Diego
State University and S-CUBED Division of Maxwell Laboratories. The San Fernando
valley is an extensive, low seismic velocity sedimentary basin. A central
objective is to assess the role played by this geometry in controlling the
frequency content, duration, and intensity of horizontal and vertical strong
ground motions. In order to draw the correct engineering lessons from the
earthquake, we need to understand what characteristics of the ground motion
arose from the specifics of this event versus which characteristics of the
ground response are likely to be repeated in future earthquakes. This project is
a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is
supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
