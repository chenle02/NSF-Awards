This project is developing techniques and tools for synthesizing three-
dimensional layouts of electromechanical systems. Research in this project is
exploring new combinatorial algorithms for the arrangement of mechanical
components that will satisfy a large number of conflicting design constraints,
including volume, shape, weight, thermal interactions, structural support, and
accessibility for repair. These algorithms are being incorporated into tools for
the design of wearable computers, to be fabricated under the auspices of other
NSF-supported research at Carnegie Mellon University. To improve the educational
aspects of this project and the connection to the realities of product design,
each graduate student on the project will work as a summer intern for industrial
supporters of the project in the thermal analysis and project layout groups.
