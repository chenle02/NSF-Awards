The objective of this research is to study the process-structure-property
relationship in the solidification of Mg-Zn-Y alloy droplets, with the ultimate
goal of developing a safety-proven enabling technology for the processing of
high-performance magnesium alloy particulate and bulk materials. The approach is
to use controlled capillary jet breakup to enable processing with mono-size
molten Mg-Zn-Y droplets large enough (&gt;50 mm) to avoid pyrophoric explosions
intrinsic to conventional droplet-based magnesium processing, yet small enough
(&lt;500 mm) to produce useful rapid solidification effects. This approach is
novel in that it offers the only safe and effective means to produce rapid-
solidification Mg-Zn-Y microstructures that exploit the stable quasicrystalline
Mg42Zn50-Y8 phase for strengthening at the maximum level. An ability to control
the droplet solidification microstructure is essential, which, in the present
approach, is achieved by developing a numerical microstructure-predictive
control model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research bears societal importance as
it provides a unique approach to light materials processing which is critically
desired in core manufacturing industries such as automotive, aerospace and
electronics industries, particularly for the production of moving parts that
require high specific-strength at room and elevated temperatures and parts for
portable audio-video-communications-computer equipment. The knowledge acquired
through this research, disseminated through presentations and publications, also
apply to various other non-ferrous and ferrous alloys, functionally graded
materials, metal matrix composites and near-net shape intermediate products.
Student education is enhanced through providing graduate research
assistantships, involving undergraduate students of underrepresented groups in
hands-on projects, and organizing seminars and workshops on droplet-based and
thermal materials processing. &lt;br/&gt;
