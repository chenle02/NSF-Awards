To extend the life of many products that deteriorate with time and environment,
many wear and/or corrosion resistant coatings were developed. This proposal
deals with a simple, inexpensive novel coating process termed Electro-Spark
Alloying (ESA). It is a surface deposition and alloying process that utilizes
high current, short duration (5 s), high frequency (2500 Hz) pulses and axial
oscillation of the electrode that stays in constant contact with the substrate.
The PI proposes to develop the engineering and science base for the superior
performance of these coatings for metal cutting tools.
