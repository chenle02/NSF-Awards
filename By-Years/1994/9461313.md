The early detection of incipient failure in a Mechanical System is of great
practical importance as it permits scheduled inspections without costly
shutdowns and indicates urgency and locations for repair before a system will
incur any catastrophic failure. One of the most commonly used approaches in
failure detection is vibration signature analysis. This project aims at the
development of a joint time-frequency vibration analysis methodology that uses
Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) function to identify incipient mechanical
faults. In order to develop an accurate signature pattern recognition procedure,
a complete database of vibration signal has to be generated. Experimentally
validated analytical/numerical models will be developed to generate vibration
signal database for both normal and abnormal operating conditions (Experimental
generation of the database will be too costly). The main thrusts of this study
are: a) development of accurate analytical models to simulate a variety of
faults in engine and transmission systems and verification of the models using
experimental data, b) comparison and verification of analytical simulations with
the Wigner-Ville distribution results to experimental WVD results, c) create a
comprehensive data base using analytical modeling to supplement the experimental
data for fault pattern recognition, and most significantly d) development of a
machine health monitoring system for identification of wear and failures in
machine components. Some initial success has been accomplished by the P.I. in
using the WVD to determine gear surface pitting and tooth fracture -1921 from
both experimental and analytical study. However, before an accurate pattern
recognition procedure can be developed, a complete vibration signal databa s has
to be generated and more in-depth examination of the vibration signature is
required.
