9310184 Wasserman The investigator will continue the development of statistical
methodology for social networks. The focus of this project is to integrate and
merge the statistical and algebraic analyses of multirelational networks, and to
develop statistical models for complete and local networks. Data will be
analyzed from egocentered or local networks. This type of data is rarely
analyzed extensively because of a lack of appropriate methods and models. The
investigator will work to construct statistical relational algebras to model
complex relational structures using logistic regressions. %%% The research will
provide a statistically sound approach to estimating, from data, the magnitude
and relative importance of dyad-dependent effects in real networks. The tools
developed will be useful for understanding wide-ranging problems in fields
(i.e., epidemiology, social work, social and community psychology, anthropology
and sociology) where either behavior or evolutionary dynamics depend on the
pattern of contact between individual actors. ***
