Scenes composed of surfaces with similar colors and textures (for example,
forest scenes) may appear as a continuous mass to a stationary observer. Once
the observer starts moving, however, the surfaces segregate from one another.
How does our visual system use motion to organize such scenes? There is
considerable evidence that observers use motion discontinuities to locate the
boundaries between surfaces. But this approach can only cut the scene into
patches. A partially occluded surface may appear as many disconnected patches in
the image and to recover this surface, the visual system needs a way to group
patches. Recent evidence indicates that the visual system may group patches of
motion by fitting the visual stimulus with a global motion pattern. Motions that
are consistent with the pattern are grouped and segregated from motions that are
inconsistent with the pattern. The goal of this research is to characterize such
global segmentation strategies. One set of experiments examines whether the
visual system treats motion patterns in much the same way that it treats static
patterns. These experiments look for evidence that the visual system applies the
Gestalt grouping rules of `good continuation` and `bilateral symmetry` to motion
stimuli. A second set of experiments considers global motions not as simple 2D
patterns, but rather as the result of imaging 3D surfaces. These experiments
compare performance on patterns that have similar 2D image properties but very
different 3D interpretations. And finally, since the vast majority of natural
flow patterns evolve over time, a third set of experiments examines the
segmentation of motion patterns that vary over time and space. The building of a
surface representation is thought to be the fundamental goal of mid-level
vision. Thus to understand human vision it is essential to understand how the
visual system organizes scenes with multiple surfaces. This research is
important because it examines an unexplored and potentially powerful approach to
this segmentation problem.
