This one and one half year project intends to establish a California State
University (CSU) - wide collaboration among the colleges of science and the
colleges of education, each campus (20) and system-wide, to coordinate and
assist the reform of science teaching development programs (preparation and
enhancement) appropriate for science education k-12. TRIADS of a scientist,
science educator, and science teacher (elementary and secondary science teaching
leaders) on each campus will function as collegial teams for improving
university science teaching development (STD) programs. Current restructuring
efforts such as the Scope and Sequence and Coordination project will be
incorporated into teacher preparation and enhancement programs throughout the
CSU system. In addition, a CSU-wide Collaboration Council for Science Teaching
Development will be established. The project's primary focus is to improve the
science teaching development programs (pre and inservice) for educating
professional teacher able to function as change agents for ongoing renewal of
science education (K-12).
