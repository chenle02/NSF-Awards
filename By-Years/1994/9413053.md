9413053 Grabrowski Gannon University requests support from NSF for connection of
its campus network to PREPnet. PREPnet is the midlevel network located in the
state of Pennsylvania. PREPnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Gannon University connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The university needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
