This project aims to enhance our understanding of the energy implications of
urban form by connecting transport with the use of different types of buildings
resulting from that transport. Urban form is intertwined with energy use and
carbon emissions. Energy use per person in dense mega-cities, where residents
live in apartment buildings and use public transportation, tends to be much
smaller compared with urban sprawl areas, where residents live in detached
houses and drive long distances. The division of urban areas into residential,
commercial and industrial spaces also affects energy use. More energy is needed
when homes, work places and shopping areas are separated as opposed to closer.
One can think of the energy use of a given workplace or store as a network
defined by how users of the building are coming from different areas. This
networked energy model is developed for the Phoenix metropolitan area and also
tracks how transport and building use changes over time as a community evolves.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will help urban planners
understand how to design more energy efficient and livable communities. For
example, mixing residential, shopping and work areas can shorten driving
distances, saving fuel and time. Even in an urban sprawl model, distributing
home and shopping areas near one another can make walking and biking an
attractive alternative for some trips. To make the results of the project usable
and known to a broader group of stakeholders, a visualization tool is developed
and integrated with educational and networking activities reaching urban
planners.
