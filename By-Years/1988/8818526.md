A previous NSF award (CES-8606118) examined the potential of recent advances in
Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI) to provide a low-cost high-
technology device for measuring environmental loads and effects. Specifically,
the objective was to (1) define the requirements for a data acquisition system
to measure environmental loads and effects, and (2) to interact with researchers
and producers of VLSI Circuits in order to design and construct a prototype VLSI
Circuit to implement this data acquisition. This action is a specific outcome of
that award, and it involves the GEOS (General Earthquake Observation System)
technology developed by the U.S. Geological Survey to measure earthquake ground
motions, including the strong ground motions of interest to earthquake
engineers. The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) is working with the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) toward the development of a plan to introduce modern
microelectronics technology in to the GEOS data acquisition system. The
objectives are: 1) to study the hardware and software of the GEOS system, (2)
identify the parts of the GEOS system that can be implemented with Application
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) using VLSI technology, (3) determine the
impact of VLSI technology insertion on the system size, power requirements,
reliability, and production costs, and (4) identify the performance enhancements
that can be made using modern microelectronics technology and additional
application areas that can be served by the enhanced system.
