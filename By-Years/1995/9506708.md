9506708 SONG This research is to model recordings of seismic waves travelling
through the earth's core to recover its detailed structure. The inner core, from
earlier work, is confirmed to be anisotropic, possessing a cylindrical symmetry
around the earth spin axis with the N-S direction 3% faster in P-wave velocity
than the E-W direction. The very top 60 km of the inner core appears not to be
anisotropic with the interval from 60 to 150 km being a transition region.
Several questions remain including the details of the anisotropy and the nature
of the isotropic region near the inner core boundary. The theoretically
possible, but undetected, phase PKJKP will be sought again in light of the new
information on anisotropy. The answer to these questions bear on the nature of
the earth's magnetic field, and the composition and physics of the core's
material. ***
