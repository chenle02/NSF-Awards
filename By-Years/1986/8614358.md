This is an "accomplishment based" renewal proposal to study polymers at
interfaces, dynamics of polymers in concentrated solutions and dense polymeric
systems using state-of-the-art sophisticated theories. The proposed problems are
important and may have significant impact on applications from biology to
technology. Professor Freed is an outstanding chemical physicist and is
eminently qualified to carry out the work. His past work has been exceptional
both in quality and quantity (62 research publications and one book during the
previous funding period). This work was previously supported by DMR-8318560.
