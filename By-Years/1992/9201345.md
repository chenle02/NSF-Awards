This research concerns formal systems that have arisen as models of biological
processes. The proposed research is divided in three parts as follows: Part I.
Splicing Schemes and DNA Part II. The Dynamics of Piece-wise Endormorphisms Part
III. Cellular Automata Although the underlying formal systems are distinct for
these three Parts, the proposed research is unified by the fact that the tools
to be used throughout are finite state concepts: regular languages, finite
transducers, and sofic subshifts.
