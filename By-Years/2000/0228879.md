Smith College, the nation's largest liberal arts college for women, hosts a
faculty and student body with strengths in the natural and physical sciences,
mathematics and, more recently, engineering. The College's most ambitious
faculty research projects and conscientious efforts to prepare undergraduates
for successful graduate study often employ research collaborations that enable
access to data, laboratory facilities and experimental design partners at
cutting-edge, national research facilities. Proposed Smith College research
applications of high-speed Internet 2 access include, among others, multi-
disciplinary, collaborative employment by a molecular biology research group of
key, large-file genetic information and analytic resources; application of GIS
data and high-resolution topographic imagery by Geology Department spatial
analysts; remote manipulation of laboratory instrumentation including nuclear
magnetic resonance machines, telescopes, and a linear accelerator; analysis of
static and dynamic high-resolution imagery from a variety of sources; real-time
human-machine interactivity; and teleconferenced collaborative research.
Substantial institutional and external grant resources have already created top
quality video conferencing, high-resolution image manipulation and distribution,
and GIS/GPS-based spatial analysis facilities on campus. Combined with the
independent applications described above, these shared resources in particular
will benefit from high-speed access and, at the same time, enable the widest
possible employment of a campus Internet 2 network connection by Smith faculty.
