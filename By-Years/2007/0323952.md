Intellectual Merit: Stone Child College (SCC) has done significant planning to
enhance the computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) infrastructure
of the college. One of the major needs identified was student support. The
Computer and Science Professionals in Native Society (CSPINS) project offers
scholarships and other services to CSEM majors.

Broader Impact: SCC is introducing numerous elements that makes this a model
project, including: student support structures, student tracking, evaluation,
dissemination, cohorts, research and internship opportunities, strong faculty
support, and commitment to infrastructure improvements. Results of the project
are being broadly disseminated and serve as a model project for all Tribal
Colleges and Universities. In addition, research opportunities are available in
subjects which address the needs of the reservation. As SCC develops as an
institution and moves into a new campus, they can offer a stronger curriculum in
the CSEM fields.
