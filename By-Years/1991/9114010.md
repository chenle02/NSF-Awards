This award is part of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program, a U.S. Global
Change Program. This research project will emphasize spatial and seasonal
variability in the radiation budget and the roles of surface reflectivity
(albedo) and cloud cover in regulating solar and terrestrial radiation in the
lower atmosphere. Planetary albedo and brightness temperature data will be
obtained from AVHRR satellite measurements. Other satellite measurements,
obtained using Synthetic Aperture Radar, will provide surface type
identification and albedos. Data entries will be derived using theoretical and
field research results. These data will be used in modeling efforts to evaluate
irradiance and heating rates in the lower atmosphere. Existing radiation
measurement programs at Barrow, Alaska, will provide validation for theoretical
and modeling aspects of the study.
