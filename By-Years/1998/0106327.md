Anderson&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0106327&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
focusses on the Orunaui rhyolitic ash-flow tuff, a geologically young and
contrasting counterpart to the Bishop Tuff. We plan to test whether the
preeruptive Oruanui magma was stably stratified. If the unsystematically erupted
Oruanui pumice compositions nevertheless derive from a density stratified magma
body, then the case will be strengthened that many big bodies of silicic magma
probably achieve a stable density stratification by natural processes of magma
formation, emplacement, crystallization and exsolution of gas. We will study the
preeruptive state of the magma by studying inclusions and reentrants of glass in
quartz and other phenocrysts, because these plausibly preserve a record of the
preeruptive conditions, little modified by eruptive decompression, gas
exsolution and crystallization. Our study will help understand the formation of
silicic planetary crusts as well as the behavior of active bodies of silicic
magma including their propensity for eruption and interactions with geothermal
systems, which are sites of ore deposition and energy production.&lt;br/&gt;
