9514244 Barker This award supports the participation of ten American
researchers at a workshop on Large Molecule Energy Transfer to be held at
McLaren Vale, South Australia, July 7 through 12, 1996. The American organizer
is Prof. John Barker from the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space
Sciences at The University of Michigan. The Australian organizer is Prof. Keith
King of the Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Adelaide.
The workshop will focus on collisional energy transfer involving highly
vibrationally excited molecules. The objectives of the workshop are: 1) to
acquaint energy transfer researchers with the current state of theoretical and
experimental knowledge in dealing with large and small molecular systems; 2) to
identify experiments and theoretical developments which will have the greatest
impact on advancing knowledge about large molecular vibrational energy transfer;
and 3) to foster further collaboration and communication between U.S. and
Australian scientists in this area of research which should be of mutual benefit
to investigators in both countries. The Australian support for the workshop is
provided by the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST).
The existence of a final report, to be made available at World-Wide Web sites in
both the United States and Australia, will be announced through the "Molecular
Dynamics Newsletter", distributed internationally, and in "Chemistry in
Australia", which is distributed in Australia.
