Plotnick plans to investigate relationships between combinatorial and geometric
properties of certain groups, as reflected in their growth functions. The main
objects of study will be discrete groups such as hyperbolic groups, especially
in dimensions 2 and 3, and Coxeter groups. Methods used will be combinatorial
(attempting to generalize work of Floyd/Plotnick in dimension 2), geometric
(following Cannon), and homological (applying the theory of Kac-Moody Lie
algebras, including Bruhat decompositions and flag manifolds, to certain
topologically interesting classes of Coxeter groups). In particular, he seeks to
understand certain symmetry properties enjoyed by these growth functions, and
also the connection between growth functions and Euler characteristics of
certain discrete groups.
