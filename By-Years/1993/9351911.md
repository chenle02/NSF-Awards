This proposal is to equip a laboratory that will be used for programming
exercises in several undergraduate courses and for senior-level projects of
honors students. The laboratory is intended to be multi-purpose in supporting
programming exercises for courses in real-time control, distributed programming,
operating systems, parallel programming, and expert systems. The proposed robots
include two mobile Nomad 200 robots and a used stationary robotic arm, an IBM
7545 Manufacturing System. A configuration of a PC and a Sparc station connected
with TCP/IP will provide a basis for programming.The control laboratory can be
used to demonstrate issues in real-time programming, distributed programming,
protocol design, operating systems, interfaces, expert controls, and software
engineering. We expect this laboratory to have a large effect on the way several
of our undergraduate courses are taught. These courses will become much more
engineering oriented and will give our undergraduate students an excellent
opportunity to apply their knowledge.One product of this project will be a
summary of projects that use the laboratory and the effect of the laboratory on
these courses, including student interest, participation and performance on
exams. We will also investigate how to integrate these robotic projects into
these diverse courses and describe our experiences with the courses and the
laboratory in education- oriented articles.
