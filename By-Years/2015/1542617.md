The International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA)
seeks to contribute to the rapid dissemination of latest research results and to
foster the formation of research teams with the multidisciplinary expertise
required to analyze the enormous datasets accumulated through genome sequencing,
proteomic studies, phylogenetic analyses, and systems biology. Furthermore,
ISBRA seeks to provide important formative experiences to graduate students and
post-doctoral scholars, helping them to become future leaders in the field. The
11th ISBRA will be held at the Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia from
June&lt;br/&gt;7h to June 10th, 2015. Accepted extended abstracts will be
published as volume 9096 in the Springer Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Bioinformatics (LNBI) series. To ensure broad dissemination of research
findings, full versions of 20-25 selected abstracts presented at the symposium
will be published in peer-reviewed special issues of IEEE/ACM Transactions on
Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics.
