9319206 Borst Crustaceans are economically important animals, both as fishery
products and as fouling agents of marine structures. The research described in
this application will study hormones that affect the growth and reproduction of
these animals. One such hormone is methyl farnesoate (MF), a crustacean compound
related to juvenile hormone, an important regulator of insect growth and
reproduction. The goal of this research is to identify those factors that
regulate MF production in crustaceans. The isolation and characterization of
these compounds will allow us to better understand the processes regulating
crustacean growth and reproduction, and may yield products useful in the
stimulation and/or inhibition of growth by these organisms. ***
