In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Colin Nuckolls, Latha
Venkataraman, and James L Leighton of the Columbia University Department of
Chemistry are creating and studying the physicochemical properties of Group 14
based sigma-conjugated molecular materials such as wires and cyclic and
multicyclic structures to demonstrate unusual electronic, electronically driven
catalytic and quantum mechanical properties. This project can increase
understanding of nano-scale silicon electronics, which is at the heart of the
information age. The project also contains broader impacts objectives that aim
to increase the number of scientists. It plans to do so by a coordinated effort
that spans K-8 outreach, curriculum development, and research training for
undergraduate and graduate students. In each of these efforts, the researchers
are committed to increasing the participation of historically underrepresented
groups in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research areas
for this project consist of three integrated components studying silicon and
germanium-based molecular components through a combination of synthesis and
single-molecule measurements to (1) understand fundamental structure/function
properties in new designed systems; (2) understand how bonding interactions
across atoms impact molecular properties; (3) create in situ chemistry that is
catalyzed by bond strain and/or the electrostatic field applied to these
molecules. The overall objective is to create novel Group 14-based molecular
structures, interrogate them, and catalyze reactions across selective sigma-
bonds at the single-molecule level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
