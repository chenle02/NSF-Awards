This research program focuses on the study of quantum interference and
entanglement using a narrow band entangled two-photon state of light. The major
objectives of the research program are: (1) to develop a reliable and stable
source of narrow band two-photon state in both degenerate and non-degenerate
modes; (2) to employ the new source in a number of experiments involving quantum
interference between independent sources; (3) to explore the direct interaction
of the entangled source with atomic transitions or strong interaction through
cavity QED. The broader impact of this work will be to develop useful tools and
to train young scientists for quantum information science and engineering.
