The project study involves exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics and
condensed matter. Many important phenomena in physics can be described by low
dimensional models. Strongly correlated electrons provide an important example.
The project study involves the Hubbard model, quantum spin chains, Sine-Gordon
and Bose gas with delta interaction (Nonlinear Schroedinger equation) in one
space and one time dimensions. Quantum fluctuations are strong in one dimension,
so it is difficult to understand physics without exact solutions. The main
objective of the project is to calculate form factors and correlation functions
of the models. Especially interesting are time and temperature dependent
correlation functions and form factors of non- relativistic models.
