9312416 Zhou This award is for experimental studies of electroweak symmetry
breaking. These efforts are concentrated on the search for the neutral Higgs
boson of the minimal standard model. They include data analysis with the L3
detector at CERN and simulations of the Higgs boson search at LEP 200 and the
SSC. Continuing searches for the Higgs boson using the LEP L3 detector and
further studies of Higgs detection methods with the GEM experiment at the SSC
will be carried out. ***
