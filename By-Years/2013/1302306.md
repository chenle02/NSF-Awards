A key problem faced by organizational decision-makers is uncertainty regarding
the relative value of alternative courses of organizational action. Two
different streams of research in sociology have emphasized different mechanisms
of dealing with such uncertainty. Research in neoinstitutional theory indicates
that uncertainty leads organizations to imitate others in their field. The
literature on identity theory suggests that people's group membership or
organizational identity strongly informs how they behave in the presence of
uncertainty. This dissertation research synthesizes the two theories to show how
organizational identity affects the degree to which organizational decision-
makers imitate others in their field.

Several studies will be conducted using laboratory and web experiments with
student and non-student samples. These studies not only test the relationship
between organizational identity and resistance to imitation, but also examine
performance feedback and identity type as potential contingencies. The positive
link between organizational identity and resistance is expected to become
stronger when performance feedback is positive (rather than nonexistent or
negative) and when the organizational identity is of a normative (rather than a
utilitarian) type. The knowledge created by the research advances theoretical
understanding and heeds repeated calls for investigations into micro-level
sources of organizations' responses to their institutional environments.
Findings will contribute to identity theory by introducing environmental
resistance as a new dimension on which decisions made by an individual differ
from those made by a representative of a larger collective.

Broader Impacts

The research makes a methodological contribution by re-incorporating
experimental research into neoinstitutional analysis, thus allowing for an
approach to institutionalism that focuses on members of organizations and
complements existing insights. Study findings will contribute to a better
understanding of factors that drive organizational resistance to environmental
pressures.
