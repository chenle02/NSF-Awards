9724237 Wilhelms, Jane University of California, Santa Cruz Acquisition of a
UCSC Scientific Visualization Laboratory The University of California, Sanat
Cruz (UCSC) will be acquiring a high-speed multi-processor graphics system with
associated large disk array, video equipment for high-quality illustration, and
a virtual workbench for large stereo display to support research in astronomy,
biology, chemistry, computer science and engineering, earth science, ocean
science, physics, and science communication. This facility will support the
development of new scientific visualization techniques to speed up
visualization, to analyze validity and usefulness of final images, to compare
formally alternative visualization methods, to represent data uncertainty, and
to explore physically justified data-interpolation methods. Collaborative and
remote visualization systems will be developed, along with appropriate user
interfaces. The equipment will be available to graduate students and
undergraduate students working on research in computer science and the natural
sciences. An existing teaching laboratory will be connected to the scientific
visualization laboratory for classes and laboratories. USCS has experience in
outreach to the larger public audience through film and TV documentaries using
computer visualizations of simulations and data. The scientific visualization
equipment will enhance these existing efforts.
