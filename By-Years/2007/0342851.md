OIA-0342851 Harvey American Council on Education

This award will enhance mutual goals of advancing the participation of all
Americans in higher education, including science, mathematics, and engineering.
The "Educating All of One Nation" conference, sponsored by the American Council
on Education, will convene an action-focus summit on October 23-25, 2003,
promoting diverse participation at all levels of higher education. Senior-level
administrators, faculty members and other higher education decision makers will
assemble in Atlanta, GA to explore critical topics related to the current status
of underrepresented participation in postsecondary education, and to develop
strategies on how to sustain, expand and replicate successful models that
provide opportunities for a diverse population of students. By contributing to
the development of a diverse, internationally competitive and globally engaged
workforce that includes the STEM workforce, and a well prepared citizenry, will
enable the US to remain competitive and preserve its leadership in the vast,
rapidly, changing world economy.
