The Massachusetts Computing Attainment Network (MassCAN) at Education
Development Center, Inc. (EDC), proposes to address the national need for a more
strategic and systemic approach to computer science (CS) education by bringing
together multi-sector teams from 10 states that have demonstrated leadership in
developing strategic approaches to effect statewide impact on K-12 CS education.
The MassCAN/EDC project team will synthesize the states' strategic approaches
and develop multi-dimensional models for effective strategic action, which they
will then be disseminated to other states.

During the two-day Workshop and four one-day follow-up sessions (spread out over
the year), the 10 teams will share Best Practices, address common challenges,
and build their capacity for continued leadership. The Workshop will focus on
four dimensions that states have identified as key to a strategic plan: (1)
informing state-wide leadership, (2) engaging business leaders, (3) creating
broad-based coalitions to lead state K-12 CS education, and (4) ensuring that
equity is a central principle of all implementation strategies.
