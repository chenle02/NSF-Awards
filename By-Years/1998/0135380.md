Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for Carbon Cycle Interagency Working
Group&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am writing on behalf of the Carbon Cycle
Interagency Working Group to request funding for scientific coordination
activities for the carbon cycle interagency initiative
in&lt;br/&gt;FY2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities will include two
meetings (calendar year 2001) of the Carbon Cycle&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Working
Group, chaired by Chris Field, one workshop to develop a comprehensive approach
to quantifying and understanding the North American component of the Northern
Hemisphere terrestrial sink, and support for a half time person to serve a
project office function at the USGCRP office. The total budget request for the
FY2001 activities is $196,000. We are requesting $34,000 from NSF for their
share of this integrated activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
