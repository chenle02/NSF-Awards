This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will develop an
innovative technique for ultrahigh sensitivity trace contaminants analysis on
the semiconductor surfaces based on laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry (LDI-MS). An important analytical capability that this proposed
project addresses is the capability of performing high speed chemical mapping of
whole wafers at mm spatial resolution. The technique will quantify trace
contaminants on the top surface of the target materials by (1) desorbing surface
contaminants with low power laser pulses, (2) ionizing the desorbed neutrals
using a high power density pulse, and (3) measuring the photoions by a high
resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The goal of this Phase II research
is to achieve detection limits of 108 atoms/cm2 and quantitative analysis over
surface concentrations ranging between 108 and 10'Ý atoms/cm2 for a variety of
technologically important elemental contaminants. This project will result in an
ultrahigh sensitivity technique for trace contaminant analysis on semiconductor
surfaces. ó ¬ñ«¬^áúú¬^¼»| +▒+¬ ó ¬ñ«¬^áúú¬^¼º¬ññ +▒¬ ó ¬ñ«¬^áúú¬^Ñ|¡¬ +▒+¬ ó
