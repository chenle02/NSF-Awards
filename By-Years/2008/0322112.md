There is a great deal of anticipation that nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing
will usher in the next phase of industrial revolution. Yet, the crystal ball is
less than clear. Although much work is being done to create a variety of
nanoproducts, there are many issues related to the manufacturing of these
nanoproducts at an acceptable cost. The proposed conference will address issues
related to the manufacturing of nanoproducts to accelerate the introduction of
nanotechnologies as viable industrial products and processes.

The proposed conference will be held at the University Park Hotel @ MIT in
Cambridge, MA in April 24-26, 2003 for attendees from academia, industry and
government. It will be a single-track conference with an invited-speakers-only
format. Distinguished invited speakers from two disparate groups -
nanotechnology and manufacturing - will share their vision on nanotechnology and
nanomanufacturing. In order to foster interactions between the participants, a
poster session is also planned. The conference is expected to provide an
opportunity to identify important technologies and manufacturing issues in
nanomanufacturing among participants.
