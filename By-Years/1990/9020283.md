This proposal is to perform theoretical research in support of experimental
efforts to modify the ionosphere with high power radio waves in the HF band. The
research focusses on efficient mechanisms to accelerate electrons, thereby
inducing artificial airglow, and on non-linear plasma wave generation. Basically
this proposal advances the so-called "strong turbulence" theory to explain HF-
modification effects. Presently, studies of strong turbulent processes are on
the forefront of basic plasma research.***//
