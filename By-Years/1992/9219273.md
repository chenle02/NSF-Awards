Many cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce a yellowish pigment in the sheaths
surrounding their cells. We have shown that the pigment (scytonemin) is an
effective sunscreen, shielding the organism from the damaging effects of ultra-
violet (UV) radiation. It is that this protective system evolved during the
early periods of life on earth (i.e. the Precambrian) when UV radiation was
higher. Over the next three years we will continue to try understand the
chemical nature of this pigment, the biochemical steps in its production, how
its quantity is regulated, and to what extent it may work in harmony with other
UV-absorbing substances within the cells (i.e. mycosporines). We will
experimentally determine the importance of these mycosporine-like compounds with
those that do not, and in fact try to determine what other means are used to
survive under high UV radiation by those species lacking sunscreens. This
research is particularly relevant now when stratospheric ozone depletion is
threatening to increase damaging levels of UV at the earth's surface.
