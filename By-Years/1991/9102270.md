Dr. Pamela Chu has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. Chu's doctoral degree was from the University of California at Berkeley
under the supervision of Professor Yuan Lee. Dr. Chu intends to continue
research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the
sponsorship of Dr. Richard Cavanagh. Dr. Chu's area of postdoctoral research
will be the photoexcitation and fragmentation/desorption mechanisms of metal
carbonyls on metal and semiconductor substrates. Longer term, she plans to study
laser-induced photochemistry at surfaces and surface-mediated reactions probed
by two-photon photoemission. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
