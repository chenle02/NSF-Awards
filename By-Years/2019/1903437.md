This award supports research on the mathematical side of the interaction between
theoretical particle physics and mathematics. This interaction started with the
advent of string theory in the 1980's and has become a huge source of
inspiration in mathematics, often connecting hitherto disconnected areas of
research. The Donaldson-Thomas invariants under investigation in this project
are a mathematical version of the count of certain D-branes, which are higher-
dimensional objects in string theory providing boundary conditions for open
strings. The importance of such counts comes from the multitude of relations to
other mathematical objects and notions, such as quiver representations,
instantons, stability conditions, and Gromov-Witten invariants. Donaldson-
Thomas-type invariants are also central to a long list of questions and
conjectures posed both by physicists and
mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and test a theory
of a logarithmic framework for Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The logarithmic
version is designed for treating situations relative to a divisor and for
studying degenerating families. This extension is of importance for the
interpretation of the invariants, for computations, for new applications, and as
a proof-theoretic tool, thus greatly expanding the scope of Donaldson-Thomas
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
