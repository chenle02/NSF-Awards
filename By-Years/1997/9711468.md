This Professional Development Fellowship will allow a research who has worked on
philosophical and theoretical issues in the cognitive and brain sciences to
visit, study, and participate in the laboratory activities of two major,
interrelated neuroscience laboratories at the National Institutes of Health. In
the course of the fellowship the PI will pursue two specific philosophical
studies of neuroscience research. The first study concerns interlevel
constraints in interdisciplinary cognitive science, examining how different
disciplines studying the brain tend to inform, shape, and constrain each other.
Among the constraints considered will be logical, mathematical and other
technical constraints on theories and models, as well as informal ways that
research perspectives, techniques, methods, results and models at one level of
inquiry tend to suggest limitations or openings at another. The second study
examines how multiple, related, ongoing projects of a laboratory tend to
reinforce each other and their results, both through replication in the
narrowest sense and through replication and extrapolation more broadly
understood. Beyond these specific projects, the fellowship year will allow the
PI to improve his understanding of the substance and practice of neuroscience,
thus better informing his philosophical work, and, in exchange, to lend the
ideas and perspectives of philosophy to the scientific investigations of the
laboratories.
