The peripheral nervous system is formed, almost in its entirety by neural crest
cells that migrate and associate in specific areas of the developing embryo.
During the process of gangliogenesis these cells acquire particular traits and
eventually differentiate into the various phenotypes found in the adult. The
aims of this research are: (1) to document the development of peptidergic
phenotypes in the sympathoadrenal branch of the peripheral nervous system, from
neural crest cells to the terminally differentiated state found in the chicken
and quail adult and (2) to examine the influence of extrinsic factors on
peptidergic expression by culturing neural crest cells and dissociated embryonic
ganglion cells in the presence of conditioned media, cell free extracts, or
hormones, and other factors likely to be encountered by developing crest cells.
Results from this project will provide a precise map of the peptidergic cell
populations in the developing peripheral nervous system and the time course of
their appearance. They will also define the contribution of environmental
mechanisms to the induction and maintenance of peptidergic phenotypes. In
addition, these results will provide basic embryological information that could
aid considerably our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development
and plasticity of peripheral nervous system.
