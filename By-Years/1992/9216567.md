The principal investigator will study three dimensional excitable media, both in
terms of chemical reactions but also are related to the electrophysiology of the
heart. The key ideas of the project are 1) the normal heart muscle is an
excitable medium; 2) some aspects of the dynamics of excitable media are
generic, notably their vortex excitations; 3) these aspects are inherently
3-dimensional; 4) in heart muscle these vortex excitations are responsible for
the most pernicious arrhythmias, but are almost impossible to study
3-dimensionally in living heart muscle; 5) they can be studied computationally
and in chemically excitable media, both of which support action-potential-like
propagation in three dimensions; 6) the utility of this comparison has been
validated in two dimensional studies; 7) the pure computation for equations of
mechanism should be complemented by experiments; 8) such experiments can be
implemented by adapting existing computational procedures in optical tomography
to existing computational procedures for analysis and display of the data that
are currently obtained by supercomputer solution of the mechanistic equations of
cardiac electrophysiology and of the analogous chemical kinetics. The
investigator will solve the "three- dimensional" for the mechanisms and use
computer-assisted optical tomography to observe three dimensional activation
wavefronts in the chemical medium during the analog to these arrhythmias. The
current project is being supported by four programs at the National Science
Foundation: Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Applied &amp; Computational
Mathematics, Physiology, and Computational Biology Activities.
