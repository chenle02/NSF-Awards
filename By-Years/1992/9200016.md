This grant will support the participation of this young assistant professor,
who will work with another group at the University of Michigan in studying the
physics of the particle responsible for the weak interaction - the Z0. The
machine called LEP at CERN in Europe which makes Z0's has been running now for
almost three years, and the group at Michigan was responsible for building an
important component of the spectrometer called L3 which is used in the detection
of the Z0 decay products. These decays reveal details of the theoretical
"standard model" for the interactions of nature (including the weak interaction)
with great precision.
