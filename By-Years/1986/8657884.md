This grant provides support for Prof. Wakefield under the Foundation's
Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program. His research centers on power
spectral estimation which has a wide range of applications across the breadth of
science and engineering. He seeks to provide better estimates of distribution of
power versus frequency in the particularly important case of a small data
record. This research combines theory and practice in a balanced manner. The PYI
Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most outstanding and
promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to
improve the capability of U. S. academic institutions to respond to the demand
for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and
industrial research and engineering. This PYI has made significant contributions
to his field of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic
research and education. The diary note describes the rigorous selection
procedure. A basic grant award of $25000 is highly recommended.
