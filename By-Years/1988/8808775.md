RESEARCH INITIATION AWARD: NEUTRALIZATION OF OXYGEN TOXICITY IN MAMMALIAN CELL
CULTURE USING A REDUCING ENVIRONMENT AND FREE RADICAL SCAVENGERS ABSTRACT The
proposed work will serve to define problems of oxygen toxicity in mammalian cell
culture and lead to the development of cell culturing strategies to decrease
oxidative damage and thereby increase reactor productivities. The use of redox
potential and fluorescence as metabolic state sensors will further the
understanding of cellular metabolism and assist in the development of the
important non-invasive, online analytical monitoring methods. Additionally,
through collaborative efforts, somatic mutagenesis in hybridomas caused by
propagation as well as by free radical damage will be examined.
