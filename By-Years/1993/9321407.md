9321407 Nishiizumi This award supports a program to measure Beryllium-10,
Aluminum-26, and Chlorine-36 in samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two
(GISP2) ice core. A continuous profile of cosmogenic nuclide concentrations from
the surface to the bottom of the core will be measured and the resulting time
series of nuclide concentrations will be applied to deducing the history of
solar activity, deducing the history of variations in the geomagnetic field and
dating of ice cores. The time series will also be used to study climatic history
through the effects of atmospheric circulation and of atmospheric chemistry on
nuclide deposition. The successful coring of the sub-ice bedrock has also
provided the opportunity of studying the exposure age of the sub-ice surface.
