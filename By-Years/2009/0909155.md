The position of the arctic treeline has important implications for surface
energy budgets and carbon cycling in a changing climate. Modeling efforts
suggest these effects are relevant on regional and global scales. Our
understanding of the controls on tree growth at the arctic treeline has been
developed using tree ring studies, which are necessarily correlative and not
mechanistic in nature. These tree ring studies have identified both positive and
negative radial growth responses to warming in the later half of the 20th
century. Investigators have speculated that negative growth trends reflect an
increasing importance of temperature-induced drought stress and that treeline
advance may be expected in mesic and wet areas, but not in dry areas, with
future climate warming. Recent work has revealed several important complexities
that clearly show we have oversimplified the relationships between climate and
tree growth at the arctic treeline. Detailed measurements of seasonal changes in
tree physiology and growth in response to changes in resource availability are
now required to take our understanding to the next level. This work will
coordinate continuous measurements of white spruce canopy gas exchange with
weekly measurements of branch gas exchange and leader, branch, radial and fine
root growth in trees receiving factorial nutrient and water supplements along a
gradient of parent material depth. Results of the study will, for the first
time: resolve the seasonality of C uptake and water loss in treeline white
spruce; compare the seasonality and magnitudes of growth in all major organs;
articulate the consequences of changes in resource availability for white spruce
gas exchange physiology and growth along a gradient where resource availability
varies naturally; and identify a process-based model that accurately describes
the relationships between climate and tree growth at the arctic treeline.
