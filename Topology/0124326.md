In recent years ideas from geometry have driven some of the most exciting
developments in combinatorics such as Gromov hyperbolic groups and CAT(0)
spaces, combinatorial Morse theory, combinatorial Ricci curvature, combinatorial
differential manifolds and matroid bundles. The central unifying notion in
geometry is that of curvature. Now, through these diverse geometric and
combinatorial theories, curvature is emerging as a powerful tool and fundamental
unifying concept in combinatorics as well. This Focused Research Group will
explore some of the specific notions of combinatorial curvature driving current
combinatorial work, and also the role of curvature as the basis for a coherent
geometric vision of combinatorics itself.

The notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying concepts in geometry
and physics for well over a century. For example, Gauss, the originator of our
modern understanding of curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was
distinguished from other geometries as being the geometry of a space with zero
curvature. As an application he showed that it is precisely the curvature of the
surface of the Earth which makes it impossible to draw a map of the Earth's
surface (on a flat piece of paper) that accurately portrays all lengths and
angles. Riemann generalized Gauss's work to smooth spaces of higher dimensions,
and Einstein observed that Riemannian geometry was precisely the right setting
in which to describe his theory of general relativity (in which the curvature of
the universe is the result of gravitational forces). Partly as a result of
Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the
curvature of smooth spaces. Combinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of
objects which can be described by a finite amount of information. This is
precisely the mathematics that computers can do. This type of mathematics seems
far removed from the geometric investigations of Gauss, Riemann and countless
others. However, there is a growing collection of combinatorial phenomena which
can best be viewed as being finite analogues of facts about the curvature of
smooth spaces. The goal of this proposal is to come to a coherent understanding
of curvature as a combinatorial notion. In addition, bringing together
researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the
chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature as
the unifying theme.
