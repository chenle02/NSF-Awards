This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to produce thick film
piezoelectric material for high frequency devices. The plan is to develop a sol-
gel nanocomposite thick PMN-PT film technology with low temperature processing.

Currently, high frequency ultrasonic transducers are fabricated from single
crystals and ceramics by grinding down thickness or dicing method. This limits
the minimum thickness possible. By producing thinner films the frequency
response of devices will be extended. The proposed films may find applications
in ultrasonic imaging arrays.
