A combination of scanning electron microscopy, high-speed video microscopy, and
manipulation of particle characteristics will be used to experimentally
investigate and analyze prey capture and selection by bivalve larvae.
Specifically, the research will address the following questions: 1) What are the
relative roles of direct interception and hydrodynamic processes in particle
capture by the cilia of bivalve larvae; 2) How do the physiochemical properties
of particles (size, electrostatic charge and density) effect particle capture
and selection; 3) Does post-capture selection occur? This integrated approach
includes functional morphology, hydrodynamics and biophysics, and should be
useful in better understanding the feeding biology of bivalve larvae and other
planktonic ciliary suspension feeders.
