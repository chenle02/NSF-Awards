Most island biogeographic studies suffer because they lack information on
island habitats relative to mainland sites and they record only species
presense-absence rather than density. In a limited number of previous studies,
plants have been shown to have high immigration and low extinction rates on
continental islands generally, and hence such islands are relatively species
rich with low endemism. This study proposes to extend work begun in 1981 on the
plant diversities, densities, and distribution on islands in Barkley Sound,
Vancouver Island Canada. The new research will examine plant distributions as
functions of habitat availability on various islands, turnover dynamics as
functions of both biotic and abiotic factors on islands, and the short-term
population and evolutionary consequences of the more dynamic species in the
system. With a range of 185 islands from inshore rocks to over 30 km distant
from "mainland", varying in size over 5 orders of magnitude, and with a very
diverse flora with widely different growth forms, habitat requirements,
dispersal and reproduction dynamics, the Barkley Sound system is ideal for a
closer examination of many of the questions that currently cause dissent among
ecological biogeographers. Proposed research will focus on habitat definition
and quantification, classification of habitat quality for plant species,
assessing the causes of species turnover, quantifying dispersal variables in two
plant groups, soft-fruited species that are bird-dispersed and parachuted
species that are wind-dispersed, and examining the effects of herbivory on
colonization and the evolutionary consequences of island life to dispersal-
related morphology and herbivore resistance.
