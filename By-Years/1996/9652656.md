9652656 Urban Interactions among physical site features, biological processes,
and human influences confound our ability to predict ecosystem response to
environmental change. Because of these complications, correlational approaches
to impact assessment may be irrelevant at the time scales required for resource
management and mitigation. This study will elucidate the mechanisms of forest
response to environmental constraints, and scale these responses from stands to
landscapes. Field studies will be conducted for four contrasting regions: the
Pacific Northwest, the Sierra Nevada, the Northeast, and the Southeast. We will
explore the sensitivity of these forests to simulated changes in climate using
stand- and landscape-scale models. A common modeling framework will be used
across all sites to provide an explicit, structured method for assessing
differences in forest response among sites. The results of this study will
provide new site- and regional-scale insights into the environmental control of
transient forest responses to climatic change.
