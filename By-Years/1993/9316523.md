9316523 Schedl Late Paleozoic tectonism along the Appalachian orogen resulted in
widespread remagnetization and Mississippi Valley Type mineralization, both
thought to be the result of hydrothermal fluids. This project will attempt to
establish the timing of remagnetization and characterize the mineralogic, fluid
inclusion, stable isotope and radiogenic isotope aspects of the system. Results
will help determine if the remagnetization is related to Mississippi Valley Type
mineralization or to a separate fluid flow event.
