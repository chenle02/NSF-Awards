This award provides funds to support expenses for participants of the 4th Annual
Kliakhandler Conference on Graph Decompositions, which will be held on August
9-11, 2018 on the campus of Michigan Technological University. The purpose of
this conference is to stimulate research activity and collaboration between
members of the mathematical sciences community. The conference is focused in the
area of graph decompositions. Graph decomposition problems regularly appear in
the fields of graph theory, design theory, and algebra and have applications to
communication, optimization, and algorithms.

The conference will also include a special session titled "Everyday
Combinatorics", which will focus on combinatorics at the high school level. A
combinatorics specialist with an interest in math education will organize the
session, and local high school teachers will be invited to attend. The website
address for the conference is http://kliak.mtu.edu/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
