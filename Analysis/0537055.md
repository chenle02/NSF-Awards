Abstract: Conference on Mathematical Physics and Spectral Theory

California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Ca, March27th-31st, 2006.

This grant will enable graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and invited
speakers to attend a week-long conference on Mathematical Physics and Analysis.
The main topics will include Statistical Physics and Quantum Field Theory,
Nonrelativistic Quantum mechanics, Spectral theory of Schroedinger Operators and
Orthogonal Polynomials. There will be about 30 invited 1-hour talks on these
topics with each day devoted to a different area of concentration. Most of the
speakers have been asked to give surveys of specific topics and perspectives on
possible future research directions. An aim of the conference is to provide a
broad overview of the current state of mathematical physics
