The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.

A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the Research Vessel
Savannah, a 92 foot coastal research vessel, owned and operated by Skidaway
Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.

Since being put into service in the fall of 2001, this coastal/local class
research vessel has proven to be a capable and cost-effective platform for a
range of research and education projects. The primary working area for the
vessel has been the continental shelf, coastal and estuarine environments of the
Southeastern United States. The ship has also conducted cruises that have
crossed the Gulf Stream into the western Sargasso Sea and as far as Curacao in
the SE Caribbean. The R/V Savannah has been specifically designed with a large
science berthing capacity to provide learning opportunities in ocean and
estuarine environments and to demonstrate oceanographic research methodologies
to diverse and often under-served student populations. In 2016, the R/V Savannah
completed 205 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 60 days (35%) of
the total sailing schedule. In 2017, the vessel currently has 151 days
scheduled, of which 59 days (40%) are for NSF. With this proposal, Skidaway
provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the
following Oceanographic Instrumentation:
