9630369 Jacobs-Lorena The ultimate goal of this project is to understand the
role of mRNA stability in cell differentiation and in the establishment of the
embryonic body plan. The focus is on the Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) mRNA,
whose instability is likely to play a major role in the establishment of the ftz
expression pattern in seven stripes that encircle the embryo. Previously, a
destabilizing element was mapped to the 3'-untranslated region of the message,
close to the polyadenylation site (named FIE3 or ftz instability element in the
3'UTR). At least one more destabilizing element (named FIE5) is located in the
5'-one-third of the mRNA. The research plan has the following aims. 1) To probe
into the FIE3 structure-function relationships. The FIE3 will be modified by
site- directed mutagenesis and the stability of mRNAs carrying mutant FIE3s will
be assessed in embryos by use of the in vivo assay. 2) To map and characterize
the 5'-instability element. The location of the other instability element, FIE5,
will be determined by deletion-mapping. Its sequence and structure will be
compared to that of FlE3 and of other unstable embryonic mRNAs. 3) To determine
the importance of ftz mRNA instability for early embryonic development. Genes
bearing ftz mRNAs with altered instability elements but encoding the wild type
protein will be transformed into the germ line and the phenotypes of the
resulting transgenic flies will be analyzed. The functional importance of each
FIE will be assessed by measuring ftz expression patterns, and embryonic and
adult phenotypes, of flies lacking one or both FIEs. 4) To determine whether the
activity that degrades the ftz mRNA is developmentally regulated.. Previous
experiments have shown that a mRNA carrying FIE3 is stable in the ovary and
unstable in the embryo. Possible developmental regulation of ftz degrading
activity will be investigated by measuring the stability of FIE containing mRNAs
at different developmental stages and in different cell type s.
