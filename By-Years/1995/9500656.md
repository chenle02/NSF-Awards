ABSTRACT CTS-9500656 The plasma activated sintering process, and in particularly
the optimization of the microstructure and properties of tungsten-based powders
including carbides and heavy alloys, will be investigated. The mechanisms of
consolidation and plasma occurrence in the gas and liquid phase sintering will
be analyzed. The research will be performed in collaboration with Teledyne Co. A
main goal is the optimization of the plasma activated sintering manufacturing
process from powders. ***
