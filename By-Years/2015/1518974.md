This award provides support for junior speakers to attend the second "Future of
Astronomy" conference in Evanston, IL. The conference follows on from a highly
successful meeting held in 2011, and is designed to bring together a significant
fraction of the top postdoctoral researchers in astronomy in North America. A
key goal of the workshop is to create a venue where leading postdoctoral
researchers from across the country, working in much different programs and in
different areas, can come together to share their excitement and ideas on future
key research areas. This is a significant opportunity for the attendees to speak
about, and survey, the frontier of astrophysics, and the workshop will
undoubtedly lead to numerous new collaborations being formed. Funding will
additionally be targeted toward, although not limited to, women and under-
represented minorities.
