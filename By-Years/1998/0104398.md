MPS-0104398 Maura McLaughlin

Dr. McLaughlin will carry out a program of research as an MPS Distinguished
International Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Jodrell Bank Observatory. She will
study pulsars, the rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars which emit
pulses that are detected once per rotation. Pulsars have many astrophysical
applications, including strong-field gravity, condensed matter physics, particle
physics, planetary astronomy, and even cosmology. While pulsars radiate across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum, there are over 1100 known radio pulsars and
only 40 known X-ray and/or gamma-ray pulsars. Consequently, the relationship
between low- and high-energy emission and the emission processes themselves are
not well-understood. This research program will lead to a more complete census
of the pulsar population, a better understanding of emission mechanisms, and the
discovery of unique individual objects. Techniques for discovery will include
radio searches for counterparts to high-energy sources and pulsars that are
likely to be detectable at high energies, as well as high-energy searches,
spectroscopy, and imaging. This research is funded through the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences. ***
