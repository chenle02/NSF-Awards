A study is proposed of the microscopic sulfur isotopic variability of sulfide
and anhydrite crystals in the eruption products of recent SO2-rich volcanic
eruptions (El Chichon, Nevado del Ruiz, Mt. Pinatubo). Anhydrite is now
recognized as an important phase in the eruption products of many SO2-rich
silicic magmas, but questions still remain about the juvenile vs. xenocrystic
nature of the anhydrite and the mechanism of SO2 release from the melt. The
answers to these questions require data on the sulfur isotopic composition of
anhydrite and sulfide crystals in the eruption products. The SHRIMP is an ideal
tool to apply to these problems. Preliminary SHRIMP results rule out formation
of all anhydrite in a single-stage magmatic crystallization process. The SHRIMP
will be used to assess whether anhydrite is generally of mixed origins in these
eruptions. The study will help constrain pre-eruptive magma S chemistry and
degassing behavior, as well as resolve whether fortuitous remobilization of pre-
existing extraneous sulfur is a critical component of past and present volcanic
eruptions which injected significant amounts of climate-altering SO2 into the
atmosphere.
