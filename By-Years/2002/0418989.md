This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the technical feasibility of enhancing isoprenoid biosynthesis by mevalonate
pathway addition to plastids of a eukaryotic model. Isoprenoids, as carotenoids,
serve as natural colorants in plant products and also have a market as human
dietary supplement. Increasing the output of carotenoids in cultivated plants
and microalgae is of considerable interest as a way to provide these isoprenoids
as natural products from renewable sources rather than from chemical synthesis.

The commercial application of this project will be on the aquaculture and the
ornamental horticulture industries.
