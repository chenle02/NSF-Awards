9317528 Gea-Banacloche Quantum-classical correspondence is studied in the
context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. The objective will be to examine
models which run the gamut from known quasi-classical cases to fully quantum
mechanical ones in order to characterize those aspects of the dynamics which are
only well described using the quantum theory. The work has interesting
implications for the concept of quantum chaos. ***
