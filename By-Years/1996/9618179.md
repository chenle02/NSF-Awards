9618179 Seewald Although it is known that much of the organic matter in the
marine environment is generated at high temperature and that organic species
play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological
processes in the seawater, sediments, and vent systems, virtually nothing is
known about the high- temperature and high-pressure stability or rates of
production and reaction of such organic compounds. One reason for this lack of
understanding is the relative inaccessibility of marine hydrothermal systems to
detailed organic chemical analysis in the field. In this study the principal
investigator will get around this limitation by studying stability relationships
of several types of organic compounds (especially aromatics) and the
reversibility of their reactions in a laboratory especially designed for high-
pressure, high-temperature work. The principal investigator expects that these
studies will greatly increase our current understanding of the processes and
conditions responsible for the occurrence of these substances in marine
hydrothermal systems. ***
