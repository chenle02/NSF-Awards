This project involves studies of chlorine atom (Cl) initiated oxidation of
volatile organic compounds (VOC) and subsequent formation of secondary organic
aerosol (SOA). Laboratory studies will be carried out in a smog chamber where
reaction will be initiated by photolysis of molecular chlorine, and products
will be studied using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and other types of
detectors. Field studies will be carried out with the goal of finding unique
markers of Cl-initiated chemistry. Computer models will be modified to include
detailed chlorine chemistry, and will be used to interpret the laboratory and
field data. This research project will develop new tools to study the chemistry
of chlorine in the atmosphere and provide new information on the role of this
potentially important oxidant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the education component
of this project, the PI will develop innovative coursework, integrate the
results of his research into his teaching, and provide research opportunities
for undergraduate students. The PI will also participate in a Summer
Environmental Enrichment Program (SEEP) designed to encourage the participation
of women and members of underrepresented minorities in the environmental
sciences and engineering. Efforts will also be directed towards improving
retention of engineering students at Duke University.
