This award provides 59% of the funds required for the acquisition of equipment
components to upgrade the neutron activation laboratory in the Department of
Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. MIT is committed to providing the remaining 41% of the required
funds. The neutron activation laboratory at MIT is dedicated to the chemical
analysis of rocks and minerals. It is one of a small number of such facilities
in the U.S. and is available for use by off-campus as well as MIT researchers.
The neutron activation method is the method of choice for rapid and accurate
determination of the rare-earth elements, thorium and many other elements of the
periodic table. Such analyses constitute the core data in geochemical studies of
earth materials.
