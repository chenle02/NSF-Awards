We seek to marry rate-distortion theory with perceptual science in order to
develop improvements in fidelity criteria and techniques for the compression of
video and other natural data sources. The information theory of Weber-Fechner
(WF) and root law (RL) fidelity criteria will be studied, with emphasis on their
application to lossy compression of video signals and on calculating lower
bounds to their rate-distortion functions. Multiterminal source coding models
will be employed to deal with perceptual considerations, such as just-
noticeable-differences and masking, that arise when sequences of video frames
are viewed. Also, we shall explore novel video compression schemes grounded in
WF/RL theory that provide dramatic computational simplifications relative to
competing algorithms at high data rates and promise better quality in the low-
bit-rate regime for such appications as video telephony and distance learning.
Low-latency video compression and transport will be performed on facilities in
the DISCOVER Lab to test our perceptually based algorithms.
