The Geological Society of America (GSA) Graduate Research Grants Program has
become one of the largest and most prestigious funding programs for graduate
students in the geosciences. The program helps fund field and laboratory costs
of geoscience projects proposed and conducted by masters and doctoral students
at universities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.

NSF funds would cover about 23% of the Program's total costs. GSA and GSA
Foundation will contribute the Program's administration costs; so all NSF
funding will go directly to students. GSA is also committed to seeking
additional funding from non-NSF sources to allow the Program to expand in the
future.
