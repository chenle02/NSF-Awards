The application of this state-of-the-art Solid State NMR Spectrometer is for
the characterization of traditional and unique materials formed from various
types of composites, polymer blends, glasses, and ceramics. Detection of various
nuclei of H, C, N, Al, Si, and P isotopes are included, along with studies of
polymers used in non-linear optics and membranes for separation technology.
Other materials include organometallic precursors to nitrides and carbides,
organic precursors to inorganic ceramics, and various intermediates involved in
the calcination process.
