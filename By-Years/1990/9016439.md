This study will attempt to determine the essential properties of the coronal
force field and its interaction with circumsolar dust, including ion drag and
Coulomb drag from the solar wind plasma, sudden orbital changes during coronal
mass ejections, interaction of the local magnetic field with the electric charge
on the dust particles, and orbital changes due to evaporation and sputtering.
These studies will attempt to determine whether these orbital changes give rise
to the observed dust "rings" around the sun, and how the distribution of dust
relates to solar activity. These relationships will allow observations of
F-coronal dust, such as those to be carried aboard the Solar Heliospheric
Observatory spacecraft, to be used as an indicator of the coronal plasma
environment. Numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of dust particles
released from comets and asteroids will be carried out. These computations will
form the basis for identifying the source distribution of coronal dust.
Calculations of the force field in the F-corona, and the numerical techniques
and analytical solutions developed and refined here, will provide powerful tools
in a wide range of non-Keplerian dynamical problems, such as cometary dynamics
and disintegration, planetary accretion, stability of asteroidal satellite
orbits, and interrelations between the distribution of dust and solar activity.
This work also relates to studies outside the solar system, including stars with
dust envelopes, plasma-dust interactions in flare stars, and dust escaping
stellar systems into the interstellar medium.
