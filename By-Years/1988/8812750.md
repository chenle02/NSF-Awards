This study examines the tense/modelity/aspect system of Papiamentu, the
Portuguese- and Spanish-based creole of the Netherlands Antilles. Papiamentu has
been considered to deviate from the expected features of creole languages, but a
pilot study has shown that Papiamentu conforms more to the prototypical creole
TMA system than previously thought. This study extends the pilot study and
involves new collection as well, incidentally creating a computer data base. The
results are expected to clarify the status of Papiamentu among creole languages
of the world and provide a model for more detailed study of TMA systems in
creoles and natural languages in general, which in turn has relevance to the
debate concerning Bickerton's bioprogram hypothesis concerning the origin and
structure of creole languages.
