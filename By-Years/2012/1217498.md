In order to address the performance and programmability challenges of massively
parallel systems new innovative approaches are needed. This research continues
earlier work on the Fresh Breeze model of computation for which basic simulation
results have demonstrated applicability to linear algebra kernels as well as the
Graph500 challenge application with competitive performance. The merits of the
programming model developed in the proposed research are demonstrated, and
evaluated for usability and performance, using a new distributed simulation tool
based on packet communication architecture.

This project proposes innovative combination of a general tasking model, a
proposal for global virtual memory, and the matching system architecture. The
innovations are expected to serve as the basis for systems that are more energy-
efficient and resilient. The form and structure of computer programs for
massively parallel computation are studied and implementation challenges
analyzed and resolved. The three components of the project concern: general
support for the major forms of parallelism found in sound and well-structured
concurrent programs; structured means for expressing transactions on shared data
such as data bases; and demonstration of a global virtual memory based on use of
tree structures to represent all data objects. This is expected to reduce
development effort and increase performance of software needed to address
current and future scientific, environmental and social problems.
