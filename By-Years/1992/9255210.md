The objectives of the proposed project are summarized as follows: (1) Develop
and implement a decision support system for resource management on the NAPI,
which will increase the understanding and effectiveness of problemsolving,
information processing and decision-making analysis related to water, land,
human resources and environmental protection for the NIIP. (2) Provide an
education program for Native American, Hispanic and other minority students to
obtain the B.S. degree and to go on to graduate work in the areas of improving
resource management. This program will focus on: (a) Increasing the
participation of minorities, women and under-represented groups in the science,
engineering and agricultural economics disciplines, and encouraging more
students to pursue graduate studied (This will include implementing summer camps
for middle school students and a regional conference for high school, community
college, and university students in the four corners area to encourage them to
pursue a career in science and engineering and to inform them about the project,
to be funded by Summer Science Camps Program) and (b) Developing a teamwork
learning environment that includes undergraduate students, graduate students,
faculty and outside corporations (NAPI).
