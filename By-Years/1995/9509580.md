ABSTRACT CTS-9509580 The objective of this effort is to relate the energetics of
carbon-chlorine bond dissociation in hydrodechlorination to catalyst performance
under industrially relevant conditions. This is a collaborative effort combining
surface-science measurements of reaction kinetics on palladium (111), done at
Carnegie Mellon University, with reaction studies at atmospheric pressure
catalyzed by supported palladium particles, performed at the University of
Pittsburgh. A common set of selectively fluorinated chloromethanes and
chloroethanes serves to link the surface-science and catalytic investigations.
Both studies measure heats of adsorption, apparent activation energies,
intrinsic activation energies, and rate constants. Linear free-energy
relationships are used to determine whether carbon-chlorine bond dissociation is
homolytic or heterolytic, and predict the effects of modifiers. This is a study
of the conversion of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into hydroflourocarbons (HFCs).
The results are also applicable to the destruction of chlorocarbons at low
temperature. Thus the study has direct impact both on the manufacture of
refrigerants and blowing agents and on the environmental management of cleaning
agents.
