In recent years significant steps have been taken by Shepherd College to update
the curriculum of its chemistry majors. These include the Computers in Science
course required for graduation, the team teaching of Instrumental Analysis and
the introduction of a Chemical Safety course. In this project a UV/Vis
spectrometer was purchased. This instrument is used across the curriculum in
Instrumental Analysis, Biochemical Techniques, Organic Chemistry, and Computers
in the Chemical Science (for future teachers) course. In addition this new
instrument has freed up the department's old instrument for loans to the local
high schools extending the current successful program of lending out our old
infrared spectrometer. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
