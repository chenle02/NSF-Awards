"Community Science Workshops: Beginning a National Movement" is an extension of
a successful, NSF-funded project that created a network of community science
centers in California. Green Mountain College has now taken this successful
venture to a national level by working with partner organizations throughout the
country to establish new Community Science Workshops (CSWs) in underserved
communities. Once sites are selected, CSW directors participate in an intensive
two-week training program. This is followed by visits by site mentors, annual
meetings, and ongoing support through the Internet and other media, which
contributes to the establishment and eventual sustainability of the centers.
Each site partners with local, established museums, science centers and
community-based nonprofit organizations to gain much needed assistance with
exhibits and education programs. Community Science Workshops contain permanent
exhibit space, a workshop area for student projects and classroom/storage space.
They serve a variety of audiences through after school, family, school and
summer science programs. National CSW locations include Miami, Houston, New
Orleans, Boston, and Washington, D.C. A CSW program is also in development in
Biloxi, MS. "
