A wet thermal oxidation process for direct conversion of Refuse Derived Fuel
(residual material following separation of paper, cardboard, glass, plastic
bottles, and steel and aluminum cans from raw Solid Municipal Waste) to energy,
saving dewatering and drying expenses encountered in more conventional methods,
under conditions highly conducive to destruction of gaseous pollutants will be
studied. Phase I efforts will center on concentration of the Refuse Derived Fuel
slurry to a maximum pumpable solids loading of about 15%, followed by heating
under pressure to carbonize the organic material, reducing its water affinity
and permitting further concentration to approximately 45% solids loading (this
level to be confirmed in batch carbonization tests in this study phase).
Following successful completion of these tasks, Phase II efforts will be focused
on thermal oxidation of the carbonized slurry from Phase I at high pressure and
temperature in a continuous process, with the liberated heat being used to
generate and superheat steam for power generation. Specific objectives of the
Phase I effort are: (1) Establish maximum solids concentrations for a pumpable
raw RDF/water slurry; (2) Establish optimum conditions for RDF wet carbonization
to supply high concentration slurry for subsequent wet oxidation; (3) Evaluate
effects of wet carbonization on the chemical and physical properties of the RDF;
and, (4) Characterize gas and water effluent streams from wet carbonization.
Municipal Solid Waste is a growing national problem, currently without a good
solution. The energy contained in Municipal Solid Waste produced in the United
States is roughly equivalent to a million barrels of imported oil per day. The
combination of wet resource recovery and wet thermal oxidation to be studies in
this program offers a potential of neatly and economically disposing of
Municipal Solid Waste with negligible pollution with recovery of significant
anergy resources.
