Social computing systems bring enormous value to society by harnessing the data
generated by members of a community. While each individual alone can offer only
limited knowledge, time, and effort, a crowd together can solve challenging
societal problems. General approaches to aggregate such data from crowds exists,
but are typically suboptimal and inefficient. This project applies information-
theoretic techniques to explore the fundamental sample/computation/accuracy
trade-offs in social computing. The success of the proposed research will make
progress towards a society that efficiently learns from the activities of its
members for greater societal good. The proposed research is strongly integrated
with an education plan that aims to develop a new graduate course on algorithmic
foundations of social computing and innovative adaptive learning platforms that
integrates the technology of social computing into the domain of education.

The project will investigate several topics: (1) characterizing the fundamental
trade-offs between the available budget and the accuracy of the answers in
crowd-sourcing platforms, by applying information-theoretic tools and methods;
(2) designing efficient algorithms achieving this fundamental trade-off using
techniques from spectral graph theory and coding theory, as well as by applying
a family of novel rank-breaking approaches to reduce complexity; and (3)
characterizing the three-way fundamental trade-offs between computational
complexity, sample size, and accuracy in aggregating preferences from partially
observed traces of online and mobile activities.
