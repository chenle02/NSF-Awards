The factors that contribute to a person's willingness to give his or her life
for altruistic or nationalistic reasons is the focus of this research. In this
study, the PI will interview 75-100 Janbaz - Iranian soldiers who volunteered
for repeated suicide missions, and survived. Autobiographical reports, trait
measures, and other inter- and intrapersonal assessments should yield some very
interesting and potentially useful insights into behavior under extreme
environmental stress. Equally of interest will be the soldiers' rationalizations
of their "failure," along with their retrospective accounts of their
contribution to their country. This population offers a very rare opportunity to
study first-hand the antecedents of exceptional altruism. Most populations of
this type do not survive the activity for which they volunteered, of course, and
thus, the Janbaz offer a rare and important opportunity for research. This study
has the potential to contribute to the store of fundamental knowledge about
behavior under extreme stress, and the antecedents of this form of selfless
altruism. It promises to enrich the insights of researchers across many of the
social sciences.
