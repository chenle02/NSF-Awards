When dealing with massive quantities of data, ranking and
aggregate&lt;br/&gt;queries are powerful techniques for focusing attention on
the most&lt;br/&gt;important answers. Many applications that produce such
massive&lt;br/&gt;quantities of data inherently introduce uncertainty in the
same time,&lt;br/&gt;for example, probabilistic match in data integration,
imprecise&lt;br/&gt;measurements from sensors, fuzzy duplicates in data
cleaning,&lt;br/&gt;inconsistency in scientific data. Hence, the importance of
these&lt;br/&gt;queries is even greater in probabilistic data, where a relation
can&lt;br/&gt;encode exponentially many possible worlds. Uncertainty opens the
gate&lt;br/&gt;to many possible definitions for ranking and aggregate queries.
This&lt;br/&gt;project systematically examines the underlying properties
associated&lt;br/&gt;with the rich semantics of ranking and aggregate queries
for large&lt;br/&gt;amounts of probabilistic data. More importantly, this
project&lt;br/&gt;investigates the issue of how to design novel and scalable
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for processing these queries efficiently in various
settings, such as&lt;br/&gt;the offline, centralized environment, distributed
systems and the&lt;br/&gt;streaming model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the
emergence of probabilistic data in many important application&lt;br/&gt;domains,
the demand for understanding and processing the ranking and&lt;br/&gt;aggregate
queries efficiently from the scientific community and beyond&lt;br/&gt;(e.g.,
government and military agencies) is expected to intensify in&lt;br/&gt;the
coming years. The results of this project lay down a firm&lt;br/&gt;foundation
for this important problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, such
