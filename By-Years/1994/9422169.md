9422169 Blum This award provides partial (60%) funding for the acquisition of a
multi-collector thermal ionization source mass spectrometer to be installed and
operated in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. The
institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this
instrument acquisition. The equipment is to be used primarily in the research
and teaching programs of nine faculty members in the Department of Earth
Sciences at Dartmouth who have a need for accurate measurements of radiogenic
isotopes. Their current research projects include: (1) Mineral weathering
studies, soil formation processes and marine strontium evolution; (2) Base
cation cycling in forest ecosystems; (3) Anthropogenic lead mobility in soil and
ground water; (4) Geochemistry of terrestrial impacts; (5) Petrogenesis of
granite and metamorphic rocks; and (6) Establishment of migratory patterns for
long-distance migrant songbirds. ***
