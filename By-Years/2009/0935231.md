An award to Chicago Botanic Garden is made to support a series of three
workshops to discuss progress, priorities, and future directions in
biodiversity, taxonomy, and systematics research. Taxonomists and systematists
work to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the Earth's biological
diversity and its evolutionary history, but the research is labor intensive and
is replete with logistical, theoretical, and analytical challenges. These
workshops will assess what has been achieved in biodiversity inventory, taxonomy
and systematics research and what the most pressing research questions and
priorities are today. The workshops will explore what the most exciting new
research opportunities are, especially those that intersect with other
disciplines. New tools, new technologies, and refined analytical methods will be
discussed. Each workshop will be three days in length and will include 25
participants. Participant selection is based on multiple criteria: maximize
taxonomic diversity representation; balance between specialists working on
biodiversity inventory, taxonomy, and phylogeny; representation of museums,
botanic gardens, universities, colleges, and other institutions. Workshop
management will be handled by three co-organizers and a steering committee of
six. The workshops will have essentially identical agendas for discussion topics
and will be organized geographically, with one in the East, one in the Midwest,
and one in the West. After the workshops are concluded the organizers and
steering committee will prepare a comprehensive report. The report will be made
available on appropriate web sites and a manuscript will be prepared for
publication in an appropriate journal to explain the importance and relevance of
research in biodiversity, taxonomy, and systematics.
