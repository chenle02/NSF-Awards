9414515 Berman This international collaboration between Berman and FSU scientist
Kilin is to develop the theoretical tools to study the single spectroscopy of
impurity atoms in solids. Recent experimental advances coupled with the
theoretical research supported by this grant will lead to a greatly improved
understanding of the interaction of single molecules with optical fields of
arbitrary intensity in solid hosts. ***
