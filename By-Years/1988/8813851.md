This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to investigate the dynamics of van der Waals complexes. The results of this
program will be useful in understanding the bonding and dynamics of loosely
bound chemical complexes. A series of experiments will be performed to study the
vibrational-predissociation of nitrogen rare gas van der Waals complexes at the
state-to-state level. Double resonance laser methods will be used to determine
the time evolution of the unimolecular dissociation process and the internal ro-
vibrational state distribution of the nascent photoproducts. The final
rotational distribution of the nitrogen product will reflect the anisotropy of
the intermolecular potential along the reaction coordinate.
