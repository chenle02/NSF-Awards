9628840 Nnaji This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award investigates ways
that technologies used in manufacturing automation can be used in health fields,
specifically in the treatment of burns. Burn debridement is the process where
burn damaged skin is removed to determine the depth of a burn and the presence
of viable skin tissue. Today a surgeon uses lasers to perform this task by
vaporizing burned tissue. This is a tedious task for the surgeon and dangerous
for an already weakened patient because of the difficulty in controlling the
depth of penetration of the laser. This award will investigate the integration
of technologies used in manufacturing to perform the burn debridement task. The
technical approach uses structured light scanning to construct a Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline (NURBS) model of the treatment area, NASA developed sensing
technology for burn depth sensing, and Numerical Control (NC) programming to
guide the surgical laser mounted on a robotic end effector. The high risk, high
payoff aspects of this research are the technical challenge of being able to use
the scan data, even with a surgeon's interaction, to determine the required
treatment and laser energy levels, and once that is determined assure a constant
stand off distance if the patient moves, however, the payoff is faster and less
traumatic wound preparation. This also presents a new opportunity for designers
and integrators of manufacturing automation equipment and systems.
