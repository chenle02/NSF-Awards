The overall thrust of the research objectives is to make progress towards
providing, for a wide variety of applications and experimental designs, a
semiparametric alternative to the popular parametric regression methods used in
the analysis of data. Methodology is proposed for discrete and continuous data
as well as for independent and correlated responses. The objectives are to
study: i) nonparametric estimation of a regression function when the explanatory
variable is discrete, ii) estimation of the dose effect given observations over
time in a dose-response experiment, and nonparametric detection of interactions
between dose and time, iii) estimation in conditionally specified distributions.
Decisions and recommendations based on data analysis using the wrong parametric
model are not reliable. Therein lies the need for the development of methodology
for fitting semiparametric models to data. The basic research efforts outlined
in this proposal include: i) theoretical work, ii) computer simulations to
validate the procedures, and iii) application of the semiparametric methods to
biomedical data obtained from researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University -
Medical College of Virginia, The University of Texas - M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center, and The Eye Institute of The University of Wisconsin, Madison. This
project also includes an undergraduate student mentorship and community outreach
component. Undergraduate students in the Department of Mathematical Sciences
will assist with the research projects and with mathematics outreach activities
designed for the El Paso area Middle School students.
