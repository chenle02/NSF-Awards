The Workshop on Nonlinear Processes in Dense Plasmas will bring together the
leading scientists in this area of science from the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The
topic is particularly timely, and is of importance to both countries. The
workshop will make possible exchange of information and ideas, and will benefit
the research programs of the two countries. The organizers are recognized as
leaders in these studies.
