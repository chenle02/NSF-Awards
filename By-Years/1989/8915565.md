The objective of this research program is to evaluate the geotechnical aspects
of the Armenia earthquake of 7 December 1988. Every case history such as this
one has the potential for revealing new or unexpected phenomena which could
qualitatively change the thinking about earthquake effects. The research
activities focus on three areas of interest: (1) analysis of ground motion, (2)
site effects upon ground motions and building damages, and (3) other
geotechnical aspects including liquefaction, slopes, highway and railway
embankments, retaining walls, and pipelines. The major contributions of this
research are expected to include: (1) A comprehensive documentation of case
history data that will be useful in geotechnical earthquake engineering research
and practice, (2) Evaluation of the applicability and/or validity of current
analytical procedures used in geotechnical earthquake engineering, and (3)
Enhancement of current knowledge and understanding of near- and far-field ground
motions and their effects on soils and structures.
