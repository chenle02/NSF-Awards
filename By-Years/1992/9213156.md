Global changes, such as the internationalization of business, have a major
impact on the organization of the legal profession. At the same time, the legal
profession, like other professions that transcend national boundaries,
influences transnational movements, including the trend towards open markets and
democratic governance. This conference grant brings together an international
team of sociologists and historians to study the historical engagement of the
legal profession in transnational movements related to liberal democratic
governance. Specifically, the research team, drawn from North America and
Europe, devise a collaborative research strategy to investigate the
intersections between an evolving legal profession and the irregular expansion
of democratic governance, and complete a series of papers addressing a common
set of questions related to these intersections. The study of the engagement of
the legal profession in social and political movements has largely been confined
to local and national settings. This team project will add a transnational
dynamic by examining historical instances of the profession's involvement with
the struggle between universalizing and localizing political movements
associated with liberal democratic governance. These studies provide the basis
for devising a model to investigate the role of legal professions in
contemporary political transformations, especially those underway in Eastern
Europe, South America, and Africa. Therefore, the project provides a new
historical context for studying the political engagement of the legal
profession, and a model for investigating the profession's engagment in a new
wave of political transformations underway that have both transnational and
local roots.
