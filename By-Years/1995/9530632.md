AST-9530632 Galactic Structure and Kinematics from Absolute Proper Motions. Dr.
Jones and colleagues at the University of California at Santa Cruz will apply
the absolute proper motions derived from the Northern Proper Motion Survey (NPM)
to outstanding problems in galactic structure and kinematics. These include a
definitive study of solar motion and galactic rotation, a powerful probe of
changing stellar populations and kinematics away from the galactic plane, a
massive study of RR Lyrae luminosities and kinematics, and astrometric studies
of the corrections to precession and comparisons of NPM with other catalogs.
These researchers will also begin observations on an extension to the NPM Survey
toward low galactic latitudes. =================================================
