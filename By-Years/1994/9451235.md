Major departments in the College of Science and Technology at Western Kentucky
University continue their efforts to strengthen the undergraduate degree
programs in the sciences. A working knowledge of electron microscopy is an
essential component of the undergraduate curriculum, the most plausible avenue
for exposure is through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This grant requests
funds to purchase an SEM, specifically the JSM-5400 low-vacuum (LV) SEM by JEOL,
equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS/X-ray). This
instrumentation is ideal for the academic setting because it allows for
traditional high-resolution imaging of "fixed" samples or on-the-spot
observation of nontreated, noncoated, (even hydrated) samples. The LV/EDS X-ray
configuration will satisfy both the implicit time restraints of laboratory
instruction and the more stringent requirements for multidisciplinary
utilization. The primary goals are: (1) to train undergraduate students in
biology, chemistry, geology, and physics in the use and application of SEM and
EDS X-ray microanalysis, (2) to develop new laboratory exercises for several
courses, including Cell and Developmental Biology, Ecology, Geomorphology,
Sedimentology, Polymer Chemistry, Solid State Physics, and (3) to extend the
breath of investigative possibilities for undergraduate student/faculty
research.
