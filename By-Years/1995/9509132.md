This project uses biophysical techniques to analyze the molecular mechanisms
involved in the regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription,
which is catalyzed by RNA polymerase. The work is focused primarily on E. coli,
which is an ideal model system in which mechanistic studies can be carried out
using purified components. Several novel ribonucleotide analogs which are tagged
with photocrosslinking, fluorescent, or other tags have been developed in this
laboratory. These will be used for analysis of protein-nucleic acid interactions
in the E. coli transcription complex, using electron microscopy and fluorescence
polarization techniques %%% Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are
important in many cellular functions, including the regulation of gene
expression. This project uses biophysical techniques to study how the enzyme RNA
polymerase, which is a protein, attaches to the DNA of a bacterium and
transcribes the information in the DNA into RNA, which then becomes the
blueprint for protein synthesis. *** Oh +' 0 S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n
