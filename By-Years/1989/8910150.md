This research will examine the transfer of effects between neighboring plants
which may be inter-linked by mycorrhizal hyphae. Mycorrhizal associations are
generally beneficial and have mostly examined the effects of the fungus
association on the performance of individual plants. However, new evidence
suggests that the effects may be transmitted to and from neighboring plants via
a fungal connection. The principal plant to be studied is Lotus corniculatus but
interspecific linkages will also be examined. How the mycorrhizal linkages may
function and the plants response to grazing and various nutrient regimes will be
examined using greenhouse and garden experiments.
