The goals of this undergraduate laboratory improvement project are: (1) to
present a unified approach to the principles and practices of date acquisition
and control, and (2) to establish an "interactive experimentation" environment.
A new approach is taken for effective presentation of data acquisition and
control principles and practices in the laboratory. The equipment requested is
workstation-based, allowing significant enhancement of the laboratory experiment
sessions. This multi-user environment provides direct student participation in
the data acquisition and control process. Integration of the data acquisition
systems into the campus computer network provides additional access by the
student for pre- and post-laboratory activity. The objectives of the project are
also to create the "interactive experimentation" environment; one that allows
the students to acquire the data, to control the experiment, to reduce, analyze,
and present the data, and finally, to upload the results for later integration
into an engineering report. This approach represents a significant improvement
over a data taking session which often leaves the student frustrated and without
full comprehension of the material.
