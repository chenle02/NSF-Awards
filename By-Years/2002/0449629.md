In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Manish A. Mehta of Oberlin College and his
undergraduate research students will investigate the secondary structure of
small model peptides as a function of salvation with solid state nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) methods coupled with x-ray diffraction measurements and
ab initio quantum chemical calculations on Oberlin's new 64-node Beowulf
cluster. The stated goal of the research is to develop techniques and methods
that will be useful for determining peptide structure in a variety of research
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the potential broader impact of the proposed
research on other scientific areas, Prof. Mehta will provide his undergraduate
research students with significant hands-on experience with Oberlin's high-field
NMR spectrometer. Besides participating in undergraduate research, Prof. Mehta
is developing research collaborations with a local community college, and he is
establishing a new outreach program with local high schools, centered around the
theme of NMR.&lt;br/&gt;
