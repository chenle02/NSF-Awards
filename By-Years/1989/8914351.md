The unifying theme is the effect of randomness in phase transitions. A porous
medium imposes a random chemical potential on a binary mixture contained within
pores. The time required for such a system to reach equilibrium is increased by
metastability induced by the random medium. Another case is turbulent stirring
of a mixture near its phase separation temperature. Randomness can either
broaden or sharpen such a phase transiton. In another type of experiment there
is evidence that a transition exits from a disordered (chaotic) state of flow of
a fluid to a new domain where the velocity spectrum exhibits self-similarity.
The quenching effect of a small amount of polymer added to a turbulent fluid
will be studied.
