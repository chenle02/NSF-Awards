This program combines mathematical studies with computer modeling to better
understand how material gets mixed inside of stars. The results of these
detailed computational simulations will be translated into a form suitable to
guide computer models that are widely used by the astronomical community to
understand the entire life cycle of stars. This program will form the basis of a
PhD thesis and provide opportunities for UCSC undergraduates to gain valuable
research training. In conjunction with this effort, the PI and her students will
be involved with the next International Summer-Institute for Modeling in
Astrophysics, a 6-week long program to solve topical outstanding problems in
astrophysics. The program aims to train graduate students in a particular field
through intense research experience, and to catalyze long-lasting collaborations
between more senior researchers through shared mentorship of a student.

This proposal is concerned with obtaining robust quantitative estimates for
mixing (of heat, momentum, angular momentum and chemical species) induced by
hydrodynamic shear instabilities in stably stratified regions of rotating stars.
Numerical simulations will be run to measure, for given input forcing, rotation
rate, and given fluid parameters, global outcomes such as (1) the resulting
shear profile and stratification profile at equilibrium (2) the turbulent
Reynolds stresses and turbulent fluxes of heat and chemical species. The results
will be used to validate or invalidate existing mixing prescription and to
create new prescriptions as necessary. Finally, the model will be implemented
into stellar evolution codes (such as MESA), and applied to a few choice
dynamical problems (notably, the rotation profiles of red giants) raised by
recent asteroseismic observations.
