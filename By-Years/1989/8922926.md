The project objective is to develop a microrheological theory for foams, which
relates foam structure and the physical properties of constituent phases and
interfaces to macroscopic rheology. A collaborative work with Dr. A. Kraynic of
Sandia National Laboratory is proposed. Two- and three-dimensional foam flow
with spatially periodical structure will be simulated by both analytical means
and large scale calculations. The research will provide new insights into the
foam rheology and a computational approach for the constitutive laws of several
typical foams. This is a one year award to better formulate the problems and
research objectives. Foams and concentrated emulsions are of considerable
importance in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.
