Dr. Graham will use the funds awarded under this Research Opportunities for
Women Research Planning Grant to design and develop a computerized database on
United States manufacturing industries. The database will include information
such as industrial organization, technology and labor force characteristics,
financial character, labor-managment relations, industry-government relations,
and industry growth. Dr. Graham will use the date base for preliminary
explorations regarding spatial structures of production in different industries
in the United States, changes in regional production structure, and the
mechanisms generating changes in regional production. The results will
contribute to our understanding of industrial, trade, and regional change, and
will form the basis for submission of a regular NSF research proposal.
