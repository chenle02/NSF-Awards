9451747 Cameron The objective of the project is to develop a laboratory
component to a new course - Acoustics, Noise and Vibration. GMI students and
their employers represent a broad spectrum of manufacturers. For many of these
manufacturers the control of noise and vibration has become a major concern as
public demand has increased for smoother and quieter appliances, vehicals, etc.
Employees in industrial firms also require protection from potential harmful
industrial noises and vibrations. The intent of the Acoustics, Noise and
Vibration course is to convey physical insight into these processes by covering
the theory of acoustics and vibration while presenting practical examples of
solutions to frequently encountered noise and vibration problems. This project
supports this course by the creation of a laboratory which will have exercises
developed around a Modal/Spectrum analyzer capable of both bodal and acoustic
data acquisition and analysis. These exercises will give students hands-on
experience with the equipment and procedures used in industry for noise and
vibration measurement while demonstrating underlying physical principles.
Exercises will include tests to determine: noise generated by mechanisms and
machine components; noise attenuation in materials, and active and passive
silencers; and the cross-correlation of noise with modal vibrations in
structures.
