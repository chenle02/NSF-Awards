A variety of seismic data is available to image the structure associated with
the western U.S. Because each data type is sensitive to different aspects of
Earth structure, they tend to produce different images. The investigators in
this study are inverting all available seismic data to create a single image
that satisfies the combined data set. This best-possible image is being used to
understand (1) how previous geologic events - especially the Rocky Mountain
event - continue to influence western U.S. tectonic activity, and (2) where
there is a critical need for additional seismic data. This second point is
timely as the seismology community embarks on a major effort to improve the
quality of seismic imaging under the U.S. with the USArray component of
EarthScope. As USArray data become available, these data will be included to
provide an improved quality of seismic image. Software being developed by these
investigators to integrate different types of seismic data is to be made
available to the community, as are the images that they create.
