Five investigators will study related problems involving various aspects of
differential geometry, algebraic varieties, and dynamical systems. The first
will study variational problems arising from curvature considerations. The
second will study isospectral deformations, optimal structures on Riemannian
manifolds, and fibrations of spheres by great spheres. The third will
investigate Einstein metrics, isotropic irreducible Riemannian manifolds, and
the isotropy representation of symmetric spaces. A topologist will study
stratified spaces, particularly algebraic varieties. And the fifth will study
hyperbolic geometry in higher dimensions, representations of braid groups, link
groups, and invariant links. A central goal of the differential geometers
working on this project is to understand spacial curvature. In particular they
will study the relationship between curvature and the overall shape of the
space, or what sorts of functions may exist on the space. The topologist and
dynamical systems theorist will use their understanding of the shape of the
space and allowable dynamical properties to restrict curvature in various ways.
