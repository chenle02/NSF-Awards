The principal investigator will analyze the qualitative behavior of solutions
to several partial differential equations arising in the theory of phase
transitions. Of particular interest are the Cahn-Hilliard, Hele-Shaw, and Phase
field equations. The structure of the set of equilibria for each model will also
be discussed. Techniques involve the theories of singular perturbations,
invariant manifolds, and spectral analysis for differential operators as well as
classical estimates for solutions of partial differential equations. This
project is concerned with several mathematical problems associated with phase
transitions in solids. In this context different phases of a nonhomogeneous
material are distinguished by different concentrations of their components. The
mathematical equations involved in this project also arise in many other areas
of science and geometry and therefore it is expected that results here will have
far-reaching effects. Among the phenomena addressed by the principal
investigators are the spontaneous creation of a fine-grained structure,
nucleation whereby widely separated particles undergo rapid growth, and
coarsening of the micro structure of the material. All of these phenomena have
significance with respect to material properties such as the brittleness and
superconductivity of an alloy or ceramic.
