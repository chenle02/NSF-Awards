University network facilities, both those dedicated to research and those that
support core institutional activities, play a very important role in the Global
Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) project. Campus networks pose
interesting and unique challenges. GENI expects networked university research
facilities to exploit existing university networks using linkage mechanisms that
permit the use of experimental protocols down to the lowest layers in the stack
and nodes that are programmable by experimenters, all without disrupting
production use of the same networks. Deploying such infrastructure in a campus
environment requires close coordination with university IT
departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a workshop with researchers,
campus network leaders, and GENI and NSF staff to address concrete campus
implementation options. Meeting invitees will be among the top experts in
higher-education networking and information technology, representing
universities across the country. The purpose of the proposed meeting and other
activities is to promote effective, efficient communication between the GENI
staff and higher education CIO community. The report from this meeting will
assist GENI in determining the most effective means for connecting the higher
education research community to any future, experimental network
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will have broader impacts of at
least three types. First, it will lay the foundation for much more capable
networking than the current Internet protocols can support. Second, it will
enhance the ability of researchers to interact with network operators in ways
that balance robustness and flexibility. Third, it will enable EDUCAUSE to
disseminate information and conclusions from the meeting to a broader
constituency, thus, helping them to contemplate future networking opportunities
more efficiently.
