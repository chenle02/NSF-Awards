Mr. Weisend proposes to review the status of cryogenic research in the People's
Republic of China (PRC), one of just three countries which have successfully
developed a cryogenic third-stage space rocket. Mr. Weisend hopes to visit
several of China's major cryogenic laboratories--under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and at various universities--and discuss their research programs with
Chinese scientists and engineers there. He hopes also to visit one of China's
industrial cryogenic facilities. He would visit the sites over two weeks, during
vacation periods at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where he will spend a post-
doctoral year during 1989. Mr. Weisend's study would address three questions:
What are the current and future areas of research in Chinese cryogenics? Where
is that work being done and who are the key researchers? Where are the results
of that research published and can those results be made accessible to the U.S.
cryogenic community? Mr. Weisend hopes that his report will increase information
exchange between the U.S. and Chinese cryogenic communities and perhaps lead to
cooperative research. Mr. Weisend would distribute the results of his study
through the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM) cryogenics group's national
mailing list, which includes all major U.S. cryogenic researchers in industry,
government, and academia. A condensed version of the report would be submitted
as an article to CRYOGENICS. The report would also be announced in COLD FACTS,
the quarterly newsletter of the Cryogenic Society of America. Mr. Weisend
expects to receive his Ph.D. in December this year in cryogenics from the
Department of Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics at UWM.
