Research aimed at development of techniques for design of adaptive controllers
for generating unit excitation, governor and stabilizer loops. These are to be
digital designs for both identification of model parameters and the loop control
strategy. The designs are to be used on-line and in real-time. New techniques
for the design of generating station controllers.
