This Major Research Instrumentation grants support the development of a non-
contacting, non-destructive, laser acoustic tomography system for the study of
the physical properties of ice cores in support of climate dynamics and
glaciological research. The development will build upon a prototype instrument
design but it is hoped that the new instrument components and methods will allow
for differentiation of subtle changes in the distribution of ice crystal size
and orientation, fractures, bubble density and particulate matter density along
core to enable rapid and automated identification of seasonal layering of
glacial ice. Successful development could enable standard methods for rapid
pinpointing of seasonal layering of glacial ice and reduce errors inherent in
visual methods and manual thin sectioning and optical characterization of
glacial ice physical properties. The proposed development involves testing the
robustness of the method for dating ice via its elastic-wave signature and use
of the technique in simulated in situ pressure conditions via gas medium
pressurization. The technique may have other useful applications beyond studies
of glacial ice (e.g., biomedical imaging). Development will take place in the
Boise State University Physical Acoustics Lab and involve Geophysics graduate,
and undergraduate students in and outside the classroom at this non-Ph.D.
Granting institution.
