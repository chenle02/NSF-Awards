SBR-9422763 Boyan Jovanovic and Yaw Nyarko It is common practice in economics to
specify the production function of the firm independently of the process of
human capital accumulation. This research shows that many forms of technological
change-- learning by doing, learning by watching, learning by research and
learning by copying-- imply that output production function and the human
capital accumulation process must have common parameters. This, in turn, implies
that an understanding of how human capital grows requires knowledge of the
production process. Furthermore, (a) the level and growth of individual's
earnings will depend on the nature of the work done, (b) the level and growth of
productivity at the plant or firm level will depend on the nature of the
production process, (c) the level and growth of human capital of countries or
regions will depend on the sectoral composition of production. This research
sheds light on these relationships.
