New Haven Public Schools New Haven, CT "New Haven P.M.S.A. "Pathway" Project"
The New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) requests $2.5 million in NSF funds for a
five-year "Partnership for Minority Student Achievement." The project will
increase minority student participation in "gate-keeping" S&M secondary courses
and NHPS minority graduate enrollment in postsecondary SEM programs by a factor
of five. The project will contain these elements: (1) district-wide K-12 S&M
curriculum reform; (2) significant expansion of year-round minority student
enrichment activities; (3) creation of a District K-12 "path" for improved
minority student achievement (six Pathway Schools); (4) reallocation of
technology and other resources to strengthen instruction and student
participation; and (5) increased professional development and support for NHPS
S&M teachers at all levels. Strong emphasis will be placed on equitable gender
participation, parent involvement, and role modeling and mentoring for younger
students. The project will focus on "hands-on," interdisciplinary learning in
the classroom and complementary discovery approaches in a variety of K-12
enrichment activities. Project partners include: five Yale university schools
and departments, Southern connecticut State University, Gateway Community and
Technical College, the New Haven Chamber of commerce, the Connecticut Academy
(CT SSE), the Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program, the Eli Whitney Museum, the
Urban League, and the Center San Jose Center. Bank Street College's Center for
Education and Technology will evaluate the project. A total of 3,928 K-12
students and 250 teachers will be served directly through the New Haven PMSA
program. Eighty-four percent of NHPS students are African-American or Hispanic,
32 percent live in poverty.
