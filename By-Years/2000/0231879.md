Research in education and psychology has demonstrated that adults and children
often understand shared experiences in very different ways, but much less is
known about how teachers and their students understand shared lessons, or how
classroom learning occurs as teachers' and students' understandings interact
over sequences of lessons. The research proposed here will focus on the
interplay between teachers' and students' understandings of shared classroom
interactions, and on ways that teachers and students work together to shape the
teaching and learning of middle school algebra. The methodology used will be
qualitative in nature - employing the video analysis of lessons. Data will be
collected in three classrooms in Morgan County Georgia (a diverse racial and
social setting), and the study will have a longitudinal focus where students
will be followed over the course of their middle school algebra
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
