A rapid technique for computing electrostatic desolvation effects on the
interactions between biological molecules in a water environment is to be
developed. It is based on a model in which the biomolecules are taken to be low-
dielectric objects containing atomic charges, the surrounding water is assigned
the bulk dielectric constant of water, and the boundary between these two
dielectrics is determined by the atomic coordinates and radii of the
biomolecule. The electric potential is then found by solving the relevant
equation of macroscopic eletrostatics, typically the Poisson equation, using
finite numerical methods. Models of this kind are much less computationally
expensive than simulations in which water molecules are represented explicitly,
and they have been used successfully for calculating a variety of chemical and
physical effects in biomolecules, such as pKa shifts, solvation energy and
protein stability.
