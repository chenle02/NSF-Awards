This is an investigation of a novel approach to catalysis called supported
aqueous-phase catalysis. A catalyst dissolved in water is used to promote
reactions of a liquid substrate that is immiscible with water; thus any action
should occur at the liquid-liquid interface. In order to increase the area of
contact between the two liquid phases, the aqueous phase is immobilized in the
pores of a high-surface-area solid. Several potential aqueous-phase catalysts
are being synthesized and characterized; these are based on known homogeneous
catalysts. Test reactions include ring closure and hydroformylation. Activity
and selectivity are measured. Supported liquid-phase catalysts may offer novel
selectivities and will certainly provide more efficient catalyst separation than
do homogeneous catalysts. They could provide a major competitive advance for
pharmaceutical and specialty chemical synthesis.
