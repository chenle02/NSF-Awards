0302960&lt;br/&gt;Walden&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides instrumentation to significantly improve
the oceanographic research capabilities of the Alvin submersible and Jason II
remotely-operated vehicle, operated by WHOI's National Deep Submergence
Facility. The specific items supported with this award include frame-grabbing
upgrades to acquire still images from digital video and integrate it with other
data collected during dives, as well as two new high resolution digital cameras.
These improvements to the imaging and analytical capabilities will be of
substantial advantage to researchers using the NDSF vehicles in their research
during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
