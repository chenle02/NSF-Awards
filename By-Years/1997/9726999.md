This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support to Dr. James N. Demas of the Chemistry Department,
University of Virginia, for research on use of luminescent transition metal
complexes for sensors and molecular probes. Dr. Benjamin DeGraff of James
Madison University will collaborate on this research which will involve
undergraduate as well as graduate and postdoctoral students. New complexes
containing Ru, Re, Os, and Ir will be synthesized and tested as sensors for
oxygen gas, carbon dioxide, and acidity. Heterogeneous behavior in solution
(e.g., soluble polymers, vesicles) and in solid supports (e.g., polymers,
silicas) will be examined in order to understand microheterogeneous interactions
that affect sensor probe performance. Many methods will be used to determine the
photophysics and photochemistry of the new systems and how they are perturbed by
interaction with surfaces, including time resolved emission spectroscopy,
transition absorption spectroscopy, steady-state luminescence, global
luminescence decay analysis, gas solubility and oxygen diffusion measurements,
dynamic polarization anistropy measurements, solvatochromic probes, temperature
dependence studies, crystallography and molecular modeling. Oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and acidity levels change during many common biological and industrial
processes. By monitoring the levels of these chemicals, the amount of reaction
products or impurities can be determined. The goal of this research is to
develop stable, durable sensors that could be used in many industrial, medical,
and environmental applications. The luminescent compounds investigated are
potentially useful in biomedical monitoring, fluoroimmunoassay, industrial
process control, wind tunnel sensors, biological oxygen demand, bioreactors, and
environmental monitoring.
