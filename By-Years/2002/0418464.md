When people engage each other in conversation, a substantial part of their
message is conveyed by prosody, or 'the melody of speech.' Prosody includes
variation in the rate at which we speak, the volume of our voices, and the
rhythm and tune of our phrases. For example, prosody can change the string of
speech sounds that make up the two English words 'triceratops oil' into three
quite different words 'Try, Sarah, topsoil,' or even four words 'Trice, air,
atop, soil.' With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Shari Speer and Dr.
Kiwako Ito will explore the way speakers and listeners use prosody to
communicate in spontaneous dialogues in English and Japanese. The cross-
linguistic comparison addresses the question of whether prosody has the same
kind of communicative function in languages that are melodically very different.
What aspects of the melodies are most important for language understanding, and
are these common across languages? Do speakers pronounce certain melodies
because they will be helpful for listeners, or do they focus primarily on their
own interpretation of a message? These questions are motivated by a more basic
one: What is universal about prosody in human conversation, and how does it
reflect the structure of cognitive function during language use?
