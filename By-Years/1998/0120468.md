This project will characterize and quantify the feedback mechanisms among
terrestrial ecosystems, the climatic system, and air pollution involving cycles
of water, energy, and various chemical species. A coupled model that links
dynamic terrestrial hydrology and ecology, physical climate (atmosphere and
ocean), and atmospheric chemistry will be developed that also, and perhaps,
uniquely, includes two-way linkages with land-use change and emissions
prediction and policy. The model will be used to quantify the combined effects
of air pollution and climate change on the productivity and distribution of
vegetation globally. Recognizing the large uncertainties in various feedback
processes, the principal investigators (PIs), Drs. Prinn and Melillo, will
undertake a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of their conclusions, and
provide probability distributions for the key model output variables. The PIs
expect this research to provide significant information for understanding how
our future global environment will evolve under the joint effects of growing
world population, changing technological and agricultural practices, and
economic development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being supported
through the Biocomplexity in the Environment: Coupled Biogeochemical Cycles
Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
