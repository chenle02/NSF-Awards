Concurrency is a prevalent feature of almost all critical computing
infrastructure, including operating systems, databases, internet-routing tables,
and banking systems. Furthermore, several recent trends in technology, such as
the widespread adoption of multi-core processors, web-service-oriented
architectures, and peer-to-peer systems, are making concurrency more important
than ever in mainstream systems. Unfortunately, concurrent systems are hard to
build, because programmers have a hard time mentally accounting for the many
possible ways in which these concurrent systems can interact. The broad goal of
this research is to provide programmers with the tools they need to develop
concurrent systems that are reliable, efficient and
robust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will focus their efforts on one
particular kind of tool, namely static analysis tools. Indeed, advances in
static algorithms for program optimization and error detection have shown that
static analysis can dramatically improve the reliability and performance of
computer systems. However, most of these algorithmic advances are limited to
sequential programs and ignore the challenges introduced by concurrency, where
the need for static checking and potential for optimization are the
greatest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop scalable and precise
analysis techniques for concurrent programs. Achieving scalability and precision
at the same time, however, is difficult because there is a widely acknowledged
tension between these two goals. To address this challenge, the general
methodology will be to design analyses that are sound and scalable first (likely
at the expense of precision), and then to iteratively refine these analyses by
empirically identifying the common concurrent programming idioms where our
analyses lose precision, and developing analysis techniques targeted at these
idioms.&lt;br/&gt;
