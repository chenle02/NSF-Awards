Dr. Jeanne L. McHale is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to perform resonance Raman studies of electron donor-acceptor
complexes. Theoretical and experimental studies of intermolecular interactions
of this type play an important role in areas of biology, catalysis, and
photoinitiated chemical reactions. Resonance Raman spectroscopy will be employed
to investigate solvent effects on the ground and excited state structures of
weakly bound electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complexes. The vibrational
frequencies and intensities of donor-acceptor bond stretching overtones will be
studied in a variety of solvents. Geometry changes associated with the charge-
transfer electronic transition will be determined using transform theory to
relate the absorption spectra to the Raman excitation profiles of acceptor
vibrations. Additional theoretical studies will be performed of the
intermolecular potential energy surface with the goal of understanding
conformational flexibility of EDA complexes and its spectroscopic consequences.
