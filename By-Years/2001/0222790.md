With NSF support, Windward Community College (WCC) will conduct an assessment of
its science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and
infrastructure, and develop an integrated institutional plan to improve and
enhance WCC's STEM curriculum and infrastructure. The proposed 12-month effort
will be divided into three phases: Phase I - Development and application of
assessment tools for evaluation of WCC's STEM curriculum and infrastructure;
Phase II - Development of a long-term integrated STEM enhancement plan including
assessment instruments to evaluate progress; Phase III - Identify resources and
secure support to implement the STEM institutional enhancement
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;
