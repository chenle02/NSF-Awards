The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the most common computations in
processing Big Data and performing real-time analyses on data streaming-in to
enterprise data centers. For the same total cost, the technology advanced by the
proposed project is expected to increase performance by a factor of 12. As part
of this improvement, it is expected to reduce the energy per instruction by a
factor of 25 times or greater. This frees businesses to apply more advanced
analytics techniques and react more quickly to changing business
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project addresses the ever-growing need to process more data, but on a
fixed budget. The objective is to provide accelerator technology for an
increasingly critical set of applications that are currently underserved by
generic CPU technology. The project aims eventually to deliver a PCIe
accelerator card populated by silicon chips based on a new type of accelerator
micro-architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
