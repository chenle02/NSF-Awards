Probability theory is the mathematical theory concerned with the analysis of
random phenomena. Many of such phenomena may be modeled by continuous time
stochastic processes. The first stochastic process that has been extensively
studied is the celebrated Brownian motion, named in honor of the botanist Robert
Brown, who observed and described in 1828 the random movement of particles
suspended in a liquid or gas. The same process was later used in 1900 by the
mathematician Louis Bachelier to model stock prices on financial markets.
Finally, in 1905, Albert Einstein brought this process to the attention of
physicists by presenting it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of
atoms and molecules. The Brownian motion is an example of diffusion process.
Like their ancestor the Brownian motion, diffusion processes appear in many
different areas of sciences and economy and their theoretical mathematical study
has far reaching consequences in understanding and making predictions about the
phenomena they model. In this project, the PI will study several problems in the
theory of diffusion processes. In particular, questions about the deep
interaction between the diffusion process and the geometry of the ambient space
will be addressed and rates of convergence to equilibrium will be studied.

Mathematically speaking, the present project focuses on different aspects of the
theory of diffusion processes and diffusion semigroups. The PI will investigate
applications to sub-Riemannian geometry where diffusion methods turn out to be
very fruitful to study generalized Ricci curvature lower bounds. The PI will
also address several questions about hypocoercive diffusions. Hypocoercivity is
a concept recently introduced by Cedric Villani to obtain quantitative estimates
for the convergence to equilibrium of some highly degenerate hypoelliptic
semigroup. Hypocoercive estimates are in general very difficult to prove and the
PI will systematically study new methods which parallel the Bakry-Emery approach
to hypercontractivity. Some problems in the rough paths theory of Terry Lyons
will also be studied, in particular related to the properties of stochastic
differential equations driven by Gaussian processes. These projects will involve
the training of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The results will be
disseminated through publications in professional journals, lectures and on the
blog of the PI.
