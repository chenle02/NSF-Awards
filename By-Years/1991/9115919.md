This Research Opportunity Award funds a primarily Hispanic institution, the
City College of the City University of New York, to collaborate with Rutgers
University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics. The two year collaborative
project is "Pyrolitic Synthesis of Aluminum Nitride via Fluid Bed Calcination of
Metal- Organic Precursors" has been requested by the Center's Industry Advisory
Board. Rutgers University research team will synthesize and granulate aluminum
nitride polymeric resins that City College will calcine in a high temperature
fluidization laboratory. The Program Manager recommends the City College of the
City University of New York be awarded $100,000 for two years as a Research
Opportunity Award.
