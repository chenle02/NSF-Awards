0107830&lt;br/&gt;Aksay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award for travel support of
U.S. participants in a U.S.-Switzerland Forum in NanoBioSciences, in Princeton,
New Jersey, December 14-15, 2000, focuses on the role of nanoscience in
biological sciences and materials. The workshop will address: (1)
interdependence and synergism between scientific discovery and technology in
nanoscale research in biological sciences and materials; (2) the path from
fundamental discovery of new properties and phenomena to industrial
applications; and (3) ways to facilitate and best utilize current and expected
advances in nanobiosciences. The workshop is organized by Ilhan A. Aksay and
John T. Groves of the Princeton Materials Institute, University of Princeton and
Hans Leuenberger, University of Basel and Beat Butz of the Swiss National
Science Foundation. The meeting will bring together leading U.S. and Swiss
scientists, researchers in early stages of career development for the explicit
purpose of identifying a research agenda and future collaborative activities.
