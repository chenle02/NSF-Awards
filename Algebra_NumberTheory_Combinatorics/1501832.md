This research deals with the interactions between number theory and
representation theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers, and is the oldest branch of mathematics. Representation theory is the
systematic study of symmetry, through the development of simple mathematical
objects that encode the fundamental irreducible pieces of symmetry. A principal
aim of the proposal is to explore relationships between these two subjects in
the spirit of the "Langlands philosophy," which predicts deep connections
between number theory and representation theory. Today the questions and
phenomena addressed by these subjects serve as driving forces in much of
contemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the individual areas themselves
have contributed many applications in such diverse areas as coding and data
transmission, chemistry, physics, and theoretical computer science.

The problems that will be investigated in this project focus on arithmetic
groups and multiple Dirichlet series, objects that are intimately related to
automorphic forms. The first part addresses topics related to cohomology of
arithmetic groups and allied areas, such as the geometry of locally symmetric
spaces and the conjectures linking cohomology to arithmetic geometry and Galois
representations. A central goal of this part is the computational investigation
of torsion in the cohomology of various arithmetic groups and its relation to
arithmetic. The second part studies multiple Dirichlet series attached to Weyl
groups. These are infinite series in several complex variables that satisfy a
group of functional equations intermixing all the variables. The topics in this
part emphasize connections between these series and combinatorics,
representation theory, automorphic forms, and mathematical physics.
