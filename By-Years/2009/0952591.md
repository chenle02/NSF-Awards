Partial differential algebraic equations (PDAEs) have many important
applications, such as those in cellular biology, chemistry, mathematical
physics, mechanics and dynamical systems, control theory, differential geometry,
and analysis. Algorithms on PDAEs have been instrumental in simplifying and
solving practical problems but are increasingly taxed as the size of problems
increases. Improvements in efficiency will reduce the time for scientists to
find properties, and perhaps solutions, to the systems they are working on.

The research consists of developing a computational theory for systems of PDAEs,
including those with parameters, and to design algorithms that provide efficient
descriptions of their solutions. For non-parameterized systems, the PI will
first obtain complexity estimates for existing differential elimination
algorithms. For systems with parameters, he will study the structure of their
differential Galois groups, which are linear groups consisting of solutions to
PDAEs themselves, via representation theory. Better understanding of them can
then be applied to improve the efficiency of existing algorithms or create new
ones.

Despite over a century of numerous studies on PDAEs, as pioneered by Holder,
Janet, Riquer, Ritt, Kolchin, and recently furthered by Singer, Boulier, and
Hubert, among many others, there do not yet exist methods computationally
efficient enough to explore and understand the differential algebraic behavior
of solutions of these systems. As a result of the proposed research activities,
new improved complexity upper bounds will highlight some bottlenecks of existing
algorithms, allowing deeper exploration of designs for more efficient
algorithms. The research activities will further develop the theory of radical
differential ideals which is essential for any substantial progress in
theoretical and algorithmic developments. Among the open problems this project
will investigate is the Ritt Problem, which if solved, would provide unique,
irredundant, and effective representations of radical differential ideals.
