Outbreaks of infectious diseases in natural populations of plants and animals
arise when variation in climate influences density of hosts, contact and disease
transmission between hosts, and the size of insect populations that transmit
disease. Within these broad patterns, how a disease changes from outbreak
conditions to low-level persistence is unknown. Plague, a disease of rodents
caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, provides an ideal opportunity for
studying disease outbreaks interspersed within lulls when disease is almost
undetectable. After its introduction into North America, plague has affected
most rodent species west of the Great Plains. Black-tailed prairie dogs,
burrowing rodents living in social colonies on grasslands, suffer high mortality
during outbreaks. Long-term studies in Colorado show that plague outbreaks are
more common during El Nino years. This project aims to determine whether plague
persists in reservoir hosts (other rodents), remains at low levels within
prairie dogs or their fleas, or only moves into grasslands from other habitats
following weather-related increases in densities of other rodents. Routes of
infection will be studied by trapping rodents and fleas, combined with genetic
fingerprinting to identify plague foci. These data will provide values for
models that explore disease persistence and transmission.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plague continues to be a human health concern; up to 3,000
worldwide cases are reported yearly. This research provides key information for
minimizing disease incidence in the expanding populations of the western US. It
is also part of long-term plague surveillance through the Shortgrass Steppe
Long-Term Ecological Research project. Students from an urban, ethnically
diverse undergraduate institution (Cal-State Fullerton) will gain unique
experiences in field ecology, which increases the likelihood they will pursue
careers in science. &lt;br/&gt;
