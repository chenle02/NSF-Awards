Statistics curricula have required excessive up-front investment in statistical
theory, which many quantitatively-capable students in ``big science'' fields
initially perceive to be unnecessary. A research training program at Carnegie
Mellon exposes students to cross-disciplinary research early, showing them the
scientific importance of ideas from statistics and machine learning, and the
intellectual depth of the subject. Graduate students receive instruction and
mentored feedback on cross-disciplinary interaction, communication skills, and
teaching. Postdoctoral fellows become productive researchers who understand the
diverse roles and responsibilities they will face as faculty or members of a
research laboratory.

The statistical needs of the scientific establishment are huge, and growing
rapidly, making the current rate of workforce production dangerously inadequate.
The research training program in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon
University trains undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in
an integrated environment that emphasizes the application of statistical and
machine learning methods in scientific research. The program builds on existing
connections with computational neuroscience, computational biology, and
astrophysics. Carnegie Mellon is recruiting students from a broad spectrum of
quantitative disciplines, with emphasis on computer science. Carnegie Mellon
already has an unusually large undergraduate statistics program. New efforts
will strengthen the training of these students, and attract additional highly
capable students to be part of the pipeline entering the mathematical sciences.
