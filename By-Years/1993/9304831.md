9304831 Fisher PI will calibrate estimated density of later middle through early
late Cenomanian waters at a mid-Cretaceous ocean front in the Western Interior
Seaway to paleotemperature estimates from stable oxygen isotope analyses
measured on planktic foraminifera. Test porosity of planktic foraminifera, and
possibly of calcareous nannoplankton, will be used to estimate water density.
Specimens will be compared from Montana, Wyoming, and different paleolatitudes
from DSDP/ODP sites. This is a research planning grant; planned future research
would extend the methods toward the proposed hypersaline "Supertethys" sea of
this time period. ***
