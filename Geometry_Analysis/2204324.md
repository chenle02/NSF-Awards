The plane geometry we learn in high school gives us an introduction to Euclidean
geometry, one of the three classical geometries. Euclidean geometry has
applications to computer science and crystallography, as well as various
branches of modern mathematics. The other two geometries are Spherical and
Hyperbolic. Spherical geometry is central to the study of geophysics and
astronomy, and vital for navigation. Hyperbolic geometry has modern applications
to the theory of special relativity in Physics. Global Riemannian Geometry
generalizes these three geometries. One of the major challenges in this area of
study is to understand how local geometric invariants such as curvature, that
is, how the space under consideration "bends", relate to global topological
invariants such as fundamental group, which indicates whether or not the space
has 1-dimensional "holes". Manifolds with curvature bounds have been studied
intensively since the conception of global Riemannian geometry. One relatively
recent approach to the study of manifolds with lower curvature bounds has been
the introduction of symmetries and is the main focus of this project. The
project will also continue the PI's outreach work with middle and high school
students, as well as graduate training, and the organization of workshops and
conferences with an emphasis on the inclusion of women and under-represented
groups.

The project will pursue a program in which she carefully studies and analyzes
symmetries of Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bounds, considering
sectional, Ricci, scalar, and intermediate scalar curvature lower bounds and
some of their corresponding generalizations to Alexandrov spaces, with an eye to
gaining a deeper understanding of this largely unknown class of spaces. The
project will study not only how continuous and discrete symmetries relate to the
topology of such spaces, but also aim to find new examples of Riemannian
manifolds of positive Ricci curvature and almost non-negative sectional
curvature using symmetries and topology as tools to do so. The project also
includes training and mentoring of students as well as conference and workshop
organization with an emphasis on inclusivity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
