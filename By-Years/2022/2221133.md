Toolik Field Station (TFS), established in 1975, continues to be a premier site
for research in the Arctic to study tundra, lakes, streams and is a site for
atmospheric and space research. TFS is the site of many discoveries about how
arctic terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems function. The long history of research
at TFS enables studies of the impacts of climate change, how plants and animals
adapt to change, and how these changes will have broad, international impacts.
TFS supports the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research program (LTER), projects
in the Arctic Observatory Network program (AON), NASAâ€™s Arctic Boreal
Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), the Earthscope Transportable Array, and is a
core site for the National Ecological Observatory Network program (NEON). TFS is
a founding partner in the EU-sponsored International Network for Terrestrial
Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT), which links field stations
around the circumpolar Arctic, and a member of the Organization of Biological
Field Stations (OBFS). At least 1433 peer-reviewed journal articles, 176 books
or book chapters and 207 dissertations and theses have been published on
research based at TFS since 1975. Educational opportunities are offered for
graduate and undergraduate students and scientific outreach is facilitated
through visits from journalists, artist, writers, and educators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cooperative agreement provides funding to the
Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to operate TFS
in support of research year-round. The infrastructure to enable research
includes baseline measurements at the station available publicly, maps and
spatial analyses, data collection for researchers according to their
instructions, and access to laboratory, dorm and cafeteria services. TFS is a
remote station that must provide communication, power, water, and water
treatment. Best practices for field station management are used. The user
community is engaged through workshops, surveys, and advisory committees to
provide input on the operation of the station for continuous
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
