9354427 Kappelman This project expands and extends the reach of physical
anthropology by developing a first and second year curriculum for use at other
institutions nationally. The laboratories build on current course offerings and
provide materials mastered by undergraduates as stand alone modules on CD ROM.
These electronic laboratories permit students to work on specific problems using
high resolution color images, video clips, 3-dimensional animations, and sound.
It is also expected that the CD ROM will provide these materials in an easily
affordable instructional medium.
