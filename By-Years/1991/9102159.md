HiLog is an untyped logic with a higher-order syntax and a first-order
semantics. This project will extend the theory of HiLog, design a Horn-clause
logic programming language based on HiLog, and develop an efficient
implementation of this language. The goal is to develop a more powerful system
than is currently available for declarative programming. HiLog permits variables
over predicates and thus supports a more powerful programming and
metaprogramming style. It also lets the programmer construct new predicate names
using function symbols, which leads to a simple and clean methodology for
modular programming in HiLog. However, the semantics of the new language is
first-order so that an implementation of efficiency comparable to Prolog is
achievable. The eventual implementation will use newly developed indexing
techniques to increase its efficiency. It will support a low-level (WAM-based)
implementation of the extension-table evaluation technique to provide a complete
logical evaluation of queries. The extension-table techniques will be extended
to support a more complete implementation of negation in logic programs based on
the well-founded semantics. The system will be a powerful prototyping tool that
can help in the development of robust software more quickly.
