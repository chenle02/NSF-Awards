This research has three projects. The first studies a novel model of political
economy for a small open economy. The model incorporates a main political
friction (disagreement about the timing of expenditures) together with lack of
commitment to tax policy or debt repayment. It is a parsimonious modification to
the standard small open economy model and delivers rich dynamics driven mainly
by the political economy friction. The model is thus capable of generating new
and interesting predictions regarding the behavior of debt, growth and political
institutions. Several important theoretical extensions and an analysis of the
role of policies such as debt relief and aid are planned for future work. The
second project relates to the design of optimal policy under private
information. This project will extend previous economic techniques to be able to
solve policy design questions when the policy maker has biased preferences but
posses valuable private information. I will analyze two particular cases: (i)
the optimality of budget-balance rules for fiscal authorities, and (ii) the
optimality of tariff caps in trade agreements. Finally, the third project will
use a recently developed macroeconomic model of information and monetary policy,
to study the question of optimal public communication by a Central Bank.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project
contributes to the economic growth literature by introducing political economy
considerations into the basic toolkit of macroeconomists. It also deals with
more specific policy questions that have been at the top of the agenda of
several international organizations. For example, there is a large discussion
regarding the role of debt relief to emerging markets, as well as an ongoing
debate on the benefits (if any) of foreign aid to poor nations. The research
will provide a modern framework to analyze the role of such policies. The
project on balanced budget rules has important implications for policy, not only
for emerging markets but also in the developed world. The project on optimal
tariff rules has implications for how negotiations in GATT/WTO can be improved
to benefit all parties involved. Finally, the project on communication is
motivated by practical issues faced by the Federal Reserve and other Central
Banks.
