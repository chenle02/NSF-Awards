Paul Dalba is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to conduct a program of research and education at the University of California,
Riverside. Using high-precision radial velocity observations, Dalba will infer
the masses, sizes, and compositions of cold gas giant exoplanets. Comparing the
nature of these exoplanets with gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn would
lead to a better understanding of planet formation and evolution. Alongside this
research, Dalba will train undergraduate students in computer programming
applicable in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program seeks to advance our
understanding of cold gas giant exoplanets that are weakly irradiated by their
host stars. Dalba will use spectroscopic and photometric observations to
characterize these planets, test models of planet formation and evolution, and
place planets like Jupiter and Saturn in a galactic context. For the education
component of his work, Dalba will develop a series of workshops that will
provide community college students with a general knowledge of computer
programming and computational tools that are useful for STEM applications in
academia or industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
