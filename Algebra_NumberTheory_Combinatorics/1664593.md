A central area in combinatorics is the study of properties of graphs without
certain substructures. This project addresses substructures with respect to
three closely related graph containment relations: minors, topological minors,
and immersions. Problems related to these containment relations have been
proposed since more than 70 years ago. Great successes about graph minors were
obtained during recent decades and led to numerous applications to disciplines
other than combinatorics, such as theoretical computer science, electrical
engineering and biology. However, several problems about graph minors and their
strengthening or variations with respect to topological minors and immersions
remain unsolved. This project addresses major conjectures in this area. Positive
solutions will lead to immediate applications in theoretical computer science
and optimization. More potential applications are expected based on fruitful
applications of earlier work about graph minors. This project includes plenty of
research problems that are suitable for graduate students and advanced
undergraduate students.

Topics addressed in this project including graph coloring, Erdos-Posa property,
well-quasi-ordering and general structural properties. One objective of this
project is to solve or at least make significant progress on a group of
questions about variations or relaxations of Hadwiger's conjecture on coloring
graphs with no large clique minor, topological minor or immersion. Another
objective is to prove a relationship between the maximum size of half-integral
packing of topological minors and the minimum size of hitting sets, which is a
strengthening of Thomas' conjecture on half-integral packing minors.
Furthermore, Nash-Williams' conjecture on well-quasi-ordering graphs by the
strong immersion relation will be considered. The strategies for attacking these
conjectures are proving new structure theorems for excluding a fixed graph with
respect to these three containment relations and exploiting tools that were
developed in the PI's earlier work and in the literature for solving problems
about graph minors.
