This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and assess
electrochemical methods for recovery of the giant and insoluble fullerenes that
comprise the bulk of the fullerenes made by the hydrocarbon combustion route. Of
the fullerenes produced by the combustion system at TDA, ca. 10 0E 12 % of the
raw soot weight is recovered as fullerenes (C60, C70, etc.) by washing the soot
with o-xylene and filtering. Yet other analyses demonstrate that most of the
fullerenes are not recovered by straightforward washing techniques. In a prior
NSF SBIR Phase I, Diener and Alford (Nature 393, 688) demonstrated an
electrochemical method for separation of C74, giant fullerenes, and other
traditionally insoluble fullerenes from mixed fullerene sublimate. This Phase I
project is for the expansion of those ideas to processing of the extracted soot
and implementation on a kilogram or greater batch scale.&lt;br/&gt; The
recovered fullerenes will be useful for applications demanding a more robust,
but still fullerenic material or coating. One possibility is carbon coatings for
artificial biomaterials, where roughness on a nanometer scale promotes cell
growth and increases the already high biocompatibility of carbon. A thin, robust
film of higher fullerenes on steel implants potentially offers the high
performance of carbon implants, but with a fraction of the cost. It is also
possible that the small bandgap fullerenes could have roles that make use of
their postulated three- dimensional electrical conductivity, as optical
limiters, or as scaffolds for nanotechnological devices.&lt;br/&gt;
