Abstract The investigator proposes to work on questions that arise from tight
closure theory, local cohomology, and the theory of intersection multiplicities.
Tight closure theory was developed by Hochster and Huneke, and leads to the
notion of F-regular rings. This class of rings includes well-studied examples
such as determinantal rings and normal monomial rings, but several questions
about F-regular rings remain unanswered. The theory of local cohomology has
applications to fundamental questions such as determining the minimal number of
equations needed to define an algebraic set. Local cohomology modules often have
useful finiteness properties, and the investigator proposes to continue his work
on Lyubeznik's conjecture, which states that local cohomology modules of regular
rings have finitely many associated prime ideals. The work on intersection
multiplicities will focus on the recently developed theory of Roberts rings:
these rings provide a framework in which intersection multiplicities have
several desirable properties. Some of the questions described in the proposal
create possibilities for students to be involved in research by performing
computer verifications to suggest answers and plausible approaches. The
investigator will also be involved in curriculum development in areas related to
this proposal, and intends to enhance opportunities for students interested in
algebra in the Deep South.

This project is concerned with questions in commutative algebra. This is a field
closely related to algebraic geometry: while algebraic geometry focuses on the
geometry of solution sets of polynomial equations, in commutative algebra the
main objects of study are certain functions on these solution sets. It continues
to develop a fascinating interaction with several other branches of mathematics,
and is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in engineering, coding theory,
cryptography, and other applications of strategic interest.
