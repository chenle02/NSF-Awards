Working with Dr. Peter Galison at Harvard University, the PI is beginning a
major study of the history of biological electron microscopy. He is exploring
the introduction and impact of this machine as an instrument for life sciences.
Specimen preparation techniques, initially quite inadequate, were adapted from
light microscopy, from non-related disciplines, and invented outright through
the 40s and 50s. With each major change in preparative technique came surprising
appearances, necessitating related innovations in epistemological technique
(e.g. micrograph interpretation). Dr. Rasmussen is studying in detail a small
number of Americans in the 40s, at institutions such as the Rockefeller
Institute, Penn, MIT and especially RCA's New Jersey labs, responsible for many
of the crucial innovations. He is also examining dissemination of students and
practices from these labs in the first postwar years. For the period from the
mid-50s to the mid-70s, he is taking a selective approach to the burgeoning
field. To illuminate the epistemological roles of the electron microscope in
diverse biological disciplines, Dr. Rasmussen is examining several major
controversies involving the instrument. Finally, he is comparing the megavolt
electron microscope (introduced about 1970) in French and American life science.
This last undertaking provides insights into the issues of national context for
science and the prospects of "big science" in biology. Because of the importance
of this project for understanding the processes for introducing new
instrumentation in biology, this project is being supported both by the
Biological Instrumentation and Resources Division and by the Office of Studies
in Science, Technology and Society.
