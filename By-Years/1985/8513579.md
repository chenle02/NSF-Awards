Knowledge of the orientation of suspended particles in both Newtonian and non-
Newtonian fluids subjected to flow is important to a wide range of important
processes. These include composite materials processing and the addition of
additives to inks and paints. This research program will utilize two optical
methods which have been recently developed in the laboratory of the principal
investigator for the investigation of various fluid dynamics problems involving
suspensions of anasymmetric and/or deformable particles in both Newtonian and
non-Newtonian fluids. The experimental methods involve the use of polarimetry,
or the analysis of light polarization, and small angle light scattering.
