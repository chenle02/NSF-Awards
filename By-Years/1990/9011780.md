With this proposal the principal investigator will continue his analysis of
mathematical models of certain polymers and metals in order to predict the
failure of these materials when external forces are applied. The mathematical
models come from the theories of nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity, and
their analysis involves the study of singular solutions of hyperbolic and
elliptic systems and the use of techniques from the calculus of variations. The
most common way of testing when a polymer or metal will fail under the influence
of an external force is to subject the actual material to loading until it
breaks or deforms. This is fine if one is interested only in the gross
properties of the material, but if one wants to understand why the material
fails at a given load then one must have recourse to mathematical models of the
material. In this grant the principal investigator will use advanced mathematics
to uncover the mechanisms of failure and fracture in polymers and metals by
examining systems of partial differential equations from the theory of
viscoelasticity.
