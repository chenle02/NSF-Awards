Determining whether or not two shapes are the same is a fundamental goal in
Topology, an area of mathematics which has important applications to physics. In
two dimensions, this is a relatively simple question which was addressed in the
early part of the 20th century. In the 1980s and 1990s, the area of mathematics
known as Representation Theory had applications to this goal in dimension three.
In the late 1990s the program of categorification, which encompasses various
areas of mathematics, was introduced to tackle this question in dimension four.
This National Science Foundation funded collaborative project aims to further
this already deep connection between the two fundamental fields of mathematics.

Soon after quantum groups were introduced in the 1980s, certain knot invariants,
such as the Jones polynomial, were constructed from these objects. Specializing
the parameter of a quantum group to a root of unity led to invariants of three-
dimensional manifolds. Categorification is an interdisciplinary area of research
which seeks to "upgrade" certain structures in mathematics such as replacing
numbers with vector spaces and vector spaces with categories. A link homology
discovered in the 1990s categorified the Jones polynomial. This led a surge in
research in categorifying various aspects of quantum groups and their
representations at a generic value of the quantum parameter. In order to
categorify three-manifold invariants coming from quantum groups, one must try to
understand categorified quantum groups at a root of unity. The subject of
hopfological algebra was outlined in the early 2000s to accomplish this goal.
Quantum groups at roots of unity are associative algebras defined over rings of
cyclotomic polynomials. Such rings are categorified by stable categories of
modules over truncated polynomial algebras. The investigators will look for
module categories over these stable categories in order to try to categorify the
representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity including knot and
three-manifold invariants. In order to categorify the associated 3-dimensional
TQFT, one must work over a slightly larger ring where certain integers are
inverted. This ring has been categorified recently and the investigators will
attempt to incorporate this structure into categorical representation theory.
