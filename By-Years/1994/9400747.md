Vidaver 9400747 The 7th International Congress of the Bacteriology and Applied
Microbiology Division and the Mycology Division of the International Union of
Microbiological Societies will meet in Prague, Czechoslovakia in July, 1994. The
Congress serves as a forum for microbiologists throughout the world to discuss
recent advances in bacteriology and mycology. The topics to be covered in the
Congress include general bacteriology and mycology, industrial microbiology and
specific topics such as use of molecular probes and nucleic acid sequencing in
microbial systems, microbial ecology and microbial physiology. This meeting has
as its goal to serve as a forum for microbiologists throughout the world to
discuss recent advances in bacteriology and mycology. Scientists with different
backgrounds will interact so that each can benefit from the specialized
knowledge of the specific sub disciplines of microbiology. Participation of U.S.
scientists is vital to increasing communication and interaction with
microbiologists of other countries, especially in affording them an opportunity
to collaborate with their Eastern European colleagues.
