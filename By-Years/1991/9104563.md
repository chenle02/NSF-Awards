This grant is for support of research focused on projects to study the
properties and processes associated with pressure dependence of the elastic
properties of high-pressure phases. These experiments will be performed using
existing analytical facilities in the Mineral Physics Institute and the large-
volume, high pressure facilities of the Stony Brook High Pressure Laboratory.
