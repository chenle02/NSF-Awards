Studies of diversification at the level of populations of bacteria in the genus
Bacillus are proposed. These analyses will differentiate among alternative
models for population genetic structure, models of evolution, and the genetic
and phenotypic distinctness of bacterial species in the genus. The central focus
is on the evolutionary interplay of clonality and genetic recombination via
exchange of genes among cells, clones and species in Bacillus. The question of
how cosmopolitan the species are, i.e., the same everywhere genetically and
phenotypically, is also a key aspect of the research. Are the species truly
global? A great advantage of the proposed research is that direct
experimentation with genetic exchange between populations is possible. The
studies will involve Bacillus from three ecologically divergent geographical
areas: Sonoran Desert, high-altitude Rocky Mountains, and tropical lowland
rainforest. Such investigations will inform us about the processes and
consequences of evolution in a group of bacteria which have populated the earth
since the surface soils and waters became oxygenated about 2 billion years ago,
and about evolutionary mechanisms which continue at present among these
organisms in both altered and unaltered environments.
