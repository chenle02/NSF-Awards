The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a
one-step wastewater treatment technology to reduce energy requirements and the
need for added chemicals. The global wastewater treatment market that is
expected to cross $15 billion by 2025, driven by stringent government
regulations. Key market segments include: breweries that use huge amounts of
water (5-7 pints of fresh water per pint of beer produced); leachates from
landfills that would contaminate fresh groundwater if not treated; and
unconventional oil and gas drilling operations that used over 20 trillion
gallons of fresh water for hydraulic fracturing in 2018. For on-site processing,
whole wastewater treatment involves multiple steps including odor control,
removal of macrobiotic solid matter (primary), anaerobic digestion that produces
methane (secondary), removal of inorganics (tertiary), and addition of chlorine
and sodium hypochlorite. The alternative is to discharge process water directly
into the city sewer discharge system at a fee. The proposed project can achieve
pure water extraction is one-step with small footprint. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a one-step
wastewater treatment technology using a recyclable gas that reduces energy
requirements and eliminates the need for added chemicals. The proof-of-concept
study is completed in the laboratory, and an alpha-test unit is being built for
field testing. Preliminary techno-economic analysis indicates that the process
may reduce both the cost and space requirements by 70% over commercial
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
