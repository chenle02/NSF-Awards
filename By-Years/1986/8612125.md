Polar and surface active additives are usually added to lubricating oils to
provide desired functional properties. Generally, additive selection is based on
a trial-and-error procedure and no fundamental molecular understanding is
available, especially when a mixture of additives is used. The goal of this
research is to develop a molecular thermodynamic model for the action of polar
components in a hydrocarbon media, used as a lubricant. This exploratory program
is designed to determine the applicability of a thermodynamic model to
tribology. The model will incorporate the interaction among different additive
chemistries. The initial model will be checked experimentally with a few simple
additives.
