9713481 Gordis The objective of this proposal is two-fold. (1) The theoretical
and numerical-solution development of a high efficient, general and exact
integral equation formulation for transient structural synthesis for large
structural FE models with localized nonlinearities and (2), its implementation
in the optimization of nonlinear transient response of large structural systems.
This research will involve the theoretical and numerical development of the
nonlinear transient synthesis formulation. The linear formulation has been
developed (by the PI) and initial development of the nonlinear formulation is
currently under way. A full theoretical development of the nonlinear integral
equation formulation will be carried out to include formal proofs of solution
existence and uniqueness for the cases of localized nonlinear structural
modifications, substructure coupling with nonlinear interconnections, base
excitation through nonlinear elements, and semi-active control. Subsequently a
synthesis formulation will be further specifically developed as a re-analysis
methodology in structural optimization involving nonlinear transient response
constraints (or objective function). The optimization development will focus on
the application problems of passive and semi-active isolation for seismic
structural response and mechanical shock. Design issues will also be addressed.
