This grant supports basic theoretical research in nuclear/particle
astrophysics. One part of the project will study the dynamics of a QCD phase
transition in the context of the evolution of the early universe. Particular
attention will be paid to the heat and baryon transport and the evolution of the
fluid velocity field, as these will influence the subsequent calculation of
nuclear abundances. A second part deals with the weak interaction physics
required for understanding the lepton distributions produced by supernovae
explosions. The shock wave re-heating problem will be studied together with the
effects of allowing conversion between different types of neutrinos. The QCD
quark-gluon plasma phase is a new form of matter predicted by our current
theoretical understanding of the strong interaction. It is conjectured to have
existed at the earliest moments of the big-bang creation of the universe.
Supernovae are the pressure cookers which produce the nuclear matter in the
universe but their mechanisms are not fully understood. The problem of neutrino
conversion goes beyond the current theoretical framework for the weak
interaction and is related to a critical gap in our understanding of neutrinos
produced by the Sun.
