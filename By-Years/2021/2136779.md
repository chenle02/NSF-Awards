There is considerable interest in local-level data on election returns, and on
voting and turnout behavior, but collections of data at global scale are
incomplete or hard to access. This award supports two workshops as first steps
(building on the Constituency Level Elections Archive (CLEA) in developing an
enhanced, high-quality, and more comprehensive new resource, The Election
Archive (THEA) archiving local level election data from around the world. The
workshops will allow for the effective design of this new data resource, which
will help researchers and policy makers evaluate election processes in a large
number of political contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports two
conference workshops, one virtual and one in-person/hybrid, with two overriding
goals: first, to gather together experts on data from elections around the world
to share research findings and contribute their expertise and, second, to
broaden and diversify the network of researchers involved in The Election
Archive (THEA), to be introduced in 2022 or 2023. THEA will build on available
resources, especially Constituency Level Elections Archive (CLEA), which has
existed since 2006, and has been funded in part by NSF over multiple grants. The
workshops engage a wide range of social scientists and representatives of
potential user communities to advise on research community needs and priorities,
and provide opportunities for student participants to gain useful skills in data
analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the Accountable
Institutions and Behavior Program and the Security and Preparedness
Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
