9401579 Stein The work of all investigators supported by this grant revolves
around central issues of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations
with applications to mathematical physics, geometry, fluid mechanics.
Investigations into areas of Fourier analysis related to oscillatory integrals,
the Heisenberg group, Hardy-space theory, the theory of para-products and
several complex variables will be carried out. Among the problems to be
investigated are the asymptotic formula for the energy of the ground state of a
large atom, nodal domains for eigenfunctions of Laplacians, Navier-Stokes
equations, Szego-limit theorems for eigenvalues and the behavior of Bergman and
Szego projections. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical
modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much
to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods
for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations. Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics best
exemplifying the ideas of synthesis. One seeks to decompose complex problems
into fundamental components. These components are then analyzed for their basic
characteristics. Finally, the solution is reconstructed through a recombination
of the components. The Fourier series and Fourier transform are examples of
tools used in this context; one discrete , the other representing a continuous
decomposition. More recently the wavelet theory added new dimensions to some of
the more classical approaches to harmonic analysis. ***
