"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of

investigator studies vertebrate brains and how they have evolved to subserve
different behaviors and adaptations. In this project he will study the brain of
the African lungfish, with various techniques that will reveal its structure and
organization. We know that the animals that first emerged from the sea to live
on land were lobe-finned fishes, but we know little else about these ancestors
of all land vertebrates. Information on living lobe-finned fishes, however, will
allow us to infer a great deal of information regarding the biology of this
ancestor, particularly when that information is compared with data on
amphibians, which descended from these early land-dwellers. Brain organization,
particularly the organization of the forebrain, has been used to provide
valuable clues to an animal's biology and it's taxonomic relationships with
other animals. Little is known about brain organization in the living lobe-
finned fishes, as they are few in number and have not been convenient to study.
In addition to the infamous and elusive coelacanth, the living lobe-finned
fishes are only six species of lungfishes, native to Africa, South America, and
Australia. This project will generate such information and has the potential to
provide valuable insight into the field of comparative neuroanatomy. The newly
found information will be compared with existing information on amphibian brains
to test the hypothesis that the brains of living lobe-finned fishes are far more
like those of amphibians than has previously been believed. The similarities in
brain organization between living lobe-finned fishes and amphibians likely
existed also in their common ancestor, and thus will allow scientists to infer
much needed information about the first land animals to emerge from the sea to
live on land. This project will provide resources to continue dissemination of
this work among scholars and the lay public across the world.
