This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
novel state estimator for power system operations. The research objectives are
to develop a commercialized software package of state estimation and conduct
testing on different power systems including real systems. This research will
use techniques from graph theory, linear algebra, and high dimensional
statistics. The novelty of the research is in bringing together cutting-edge
ideas from these diverse disciplines to solve the problem of robustness in
current state estimators used in power industry. The anticipated technical
results include a commercialized software package that largely improves the
system monitoring and therefore the operation security of power
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project includes 1) the targeted problem (power system state estimator) is
extremely critical in modern power grids or smart grids and can help prevent
system-wide failures or blackouts if properly handled, 2) the certainty of
commercialization of the proposed approach warranting significant NSF support
because the provided solution is fast enough for the real-time application and
the new state estimator does not ask for additional inputs or requirements
comparing with the existing ones, 3) the research team is formed by technical as
well as marketing personnel which ensures the success of the sales of the
products, 4) the uniqueness of the proposed approach which provides competitive
benefits to the market that cannot be met by alternate technologies and can
attract further funding from non-SBIR sources and result in direct sales to
power industry, 5) the proposed approach develops a unique formulation/solution
of state estimation which very possibly leads to further innovations, 6) the new
procedure of the proposed approach based on unique formulation and unique
philosophy can promote teaching, training and learning in the area of state
estimation.
