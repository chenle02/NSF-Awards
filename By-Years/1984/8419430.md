Segmental bridges of various types are being built and have been built over a
period of time, without the benefit of research investigations. Some of the
existing bridges are showing signs of distress as a result of creep, shrinkage,
and temperature effects. This project will investigate analytically and
experimentally the effects of the factors noted above in conjunction with
applying external tendons as a prestressing method to remedy the adverse effects
and strengthen the structure as a whole.
