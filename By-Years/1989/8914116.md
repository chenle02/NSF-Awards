The objective of this research is the physics of most convection beginning with
the microphysics of precipitation production and extending to the dynamical
forcing on the mesoscale and synoptic scale. Existing cloud observations taken
by aircraft and radar will be analyzed to understand the formation of
precipitation embryos and their subsequent evolution. Finally, an attempt will
be made to investigate convective forcing as related to both mesoscale and
synoptic scale settings.//
