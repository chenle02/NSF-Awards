&lt;br/&gt;Financial support is requested to provide travel funds to ten
graduate students, ten postdocs, and ten junior operator theorists in the United
States who do not have support from NSF or other sources. The funds would allow
these thirty mathematicians to attend the International Workshop in Operator
Theory and Applications (IWOTA 2009), to be held at CIMAT (Center for Research
in Mathematics), Guanajuato, Mexico, during May 25-29, 2009. The PI is a member
of the Scientific Committee of IWOTA 2009. Primary consideration will be given
to requests for travel funds coming from women and members of underrepresented
groups in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;The International Workshop on
Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA) has met biannually since 1981, and more
frequently in recent years (starting in 1995), rotating among twelve countries
on four continents. The original concept of the workshop was as a satellite
conference for operator theorists to the broader based international symposia on
Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS). While this concept is still
in place, the scope of IWOTA has broadened considerably in recent years and the
Workshop has now attained an independent identity as a major world-wide
conference for recent developments in core operator theory and its
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being co-funded by the Office
of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
