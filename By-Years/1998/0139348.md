&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This USF/NSF STARS GK-12 project focuses on K-5 students.
The objective is to engage graduate and senior level undergraduate students in
the challenge of infusing engineering and science principles in such cutting
edge areas as nanotechnology, optics, and advanced manufacturing into the
elementary school environment. The partnerships involve five area elementary
schools, three of which predominantly serve minority students. 15 graduate and
undergraduate students from diverse ethnic backgrounds will be selected as
Fellows. Fellows will be trained in both pedagogy and in communication skills.
The project will work closely with the School District science and mathematics
coordinators and the school principals in developing and implementing a plan to
help the Fellows become valuable resources to the teachers. In addition to a
stipend, each mathematics and science teacher will also participate in
professional development scheduled for the summer of each year. As part of the
professional development, teachers will have the opportunity to participate in
research experiences with researchers in engineering and the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
