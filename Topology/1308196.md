The first main theme of the proposed research is further exploration of the
Principal Investigators (PI) re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev 3-manifold
invariants. In particular, the PI will draw connections with these re-normalized
invariants and other topological objects including Reidemeister torsion,
Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) and mapping class group
representations. The proposed research will also focus on continuing the PI's
development and research of generalized Kashaev quantum 3-manifold invariants.
These invariants are modeled on Kashaev's foundational work that led to the
original formulation of the Volume Conjecture. The final topic of the proposed
research is to generalize his re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants by
defining 3-manifold invariants via surgery presentations of links with flat
connections in their complements. This work is both geometric and physical in
nature and related to Chern-Simons theory.

One of the fundamental ways mathematics arises in nature is through geometry and
more generally topology. In particular, geometric objects called manifolds are
used to model space and time in general relativity. Surprisingly, several
features of manifolds can be studied via their underlying topology. The
discovery of the Jones polynomial by V. Jones in 1984 and its 3-dimensional
quantum field theory interpretation by E. Witten in 1989 have opened the door
for the use of new algebraic techniques to study topology. These developments
led to a new branch of mathematics known as "quantum topology." This area has
connections to theoretical physics, including quantum gravity, topological
quantum field theory and quantum computing. Many established techniques in
quantum topology become zero when quantum dimensions vanish. This project
focuses on developing and studying new systematic strategies to re-normalize
topological invariants when quantum dimensions are zero.
