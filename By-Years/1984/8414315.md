Although ultrasound imaging is a well accepted clinical, diagnostic tool in
medicine, there is still a lack of understanding concerning the mechanisms of
interaction. This research effort will characterize ultrasonic wave propagation
by means of mathematical modeling and experimental verification. Both
statistical and deterministic approaches will be employed to examine parameters
such as wavefront distortion and refraction errors to better characterize the
ultrasonic field in tissue. The results of this investigation are expected to
help define limits of resolution for ultrasonic imaging systems.
