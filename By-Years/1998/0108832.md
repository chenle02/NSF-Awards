Defining Hydro-Ecological Research Priorities

This workshop will bring together 20 riverine scientists in July 2001 to focus
on linkages between river flow regimes and biota. The workshop has a science
focus, and will precede a large conference entitled Managing River Flows for
Biodiversity. Objectives of the workshop are to: 1) identify key knowledge gaps
and 2) develop a prioritized research agenda. The organizers, Dr. Richter of the
Nature Conservancy and Dr. LeRoy Poff of Colorado State University, plan to host
an electronic forum among participants in advance of the workshop. The product
of the workshop will be a white paper posted at the conference web site
identifying critical uncertainties and knowledge gaps and research priorities.
The workshop report will also be published as part of the conference
proceedings.
