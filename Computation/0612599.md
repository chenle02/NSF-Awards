The proposed study is concerned with several aspects of the analysis of the
finite element method. To begin with the problem of a posteriori error
estimation that can accurately predict the error on a single element using a
class of averaging operators will be considered. These methods do not seem to
work well for problems on polygonal domains for which the pollution error
dominates. Accurate local estimators and indicators will be sought to correct
this not only for quasi-uniform meshes but also for refined grids. In order to
carry out the above programs, it is necessary to develop fundamental technical
tools such a sharp a priori estimates, both local and global, both for smooth
and nonsmooth problems where both quasi-uniform and highly refined grids are
present. These problems are an integral part of this proposal. The socalled
superapproximation property of many finite elements has proved to be a powerful
tool in the analysis of the finite element method. Applications will be sought
for a new form of this property that does away with mesh restrictions for some
problems.

There are a very large number of important physical problems that arise in
science and industry. For many of these problems it is cost effective to make a
mathematical model and to solve the problem on a computer. For example consider
the problem of designing an aircraft (or an automobile) so that is as fuel
efficient and fast as possible. Suppose that in order to achieve this we wish to
minimize the drag and still give the aircraft enough lift to do its job. Instead
of making a physical model that may be difficult and costly to change in order
to arrive at an optimal design, many aircraft companies now almost completely
design airplanes inside and out on computers. The mathematical equations that
must be solved are complicated but at the heart of many solution methods there
is required the solution of a socalled elliptic differential equation. This type
of equation arises in a very large number of applications. This project is
concerned with obtaining more cost effective and efficient solutions of elliptic
problems in order to obtain more accurate and efficient numerical schemes. In
order to do so, we have to confront some fundamental mathematical problems which
will be done in this proposal.
