This CAREER proposal, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
addresses questions of the reactivity of organic thin films with "open shell"
atomic and radical reactants. Professor Kandel and his coworkers at the
University of Notre Dame, are examining the reactions of functionalized self
assembled thiol monolayers with atomic reactants such as hydrogen and oxygen.
Reactivity is probed by examining the reacted surface with Auger electron
spectroscopy, thermal desorption spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling
microscopy. As part of this research project, Kandel will develop an
undergraduate course that focusses on the construction of a simple scanning
tunneling microscope, demonstrating the process of instrument design while
illustrating important concepts in solid state and surface science. The results
of this research activity provide fundamental understanding of gas-surface
reaction processes important in electronic materials processing, in plasmas,
flames, and upper atmosphere chemistry.

With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Kandel and his coworkers at Notre Dame are investigating the interaction of
reactive atomic and radical species with model organic thin films. The results
of these studies provide fundamental information about the gas-surface reaction
chemistry of organic surfaces important in lubrication, electronic devices,
polymer surfaces, and combustion environments. The educational aspect of this
CAREER award includes the development of a course focussing on instrument
design.
