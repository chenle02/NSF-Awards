This project establishes a Microcomputer Interfacing Laboratory used primarily
for teaching pre-service science teachers how computers can be used for direct
data acquisition from science experiments. The overall goal is to develop in the
students familiarity and skills relating to the use of the computer in modern
experimental science. The new Laboratory is used in several courses,
particularly in a science teaching methods course and a course associated with
the Computer Applications Minor program. Students develop computer-interfaced
experimental projects that can be used in high school or college science courses
in the content areas of earth science, biology, chemistry, and physics. The
laboratory experiments will be compiled into a "Multidisciplinary Science
Laboratory Interfacing Manual." Also, in-service workshops will be held for
local high school teachers to demonstrate computer interfacing equipment and
student-developed lessons and to allow teacher to create their own lessons for
incorporation in the Manual.
