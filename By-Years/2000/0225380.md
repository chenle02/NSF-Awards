This award supports an integrated research and education program that is
centered on computing motion strategies in geometry-intensive applications. A
healthy synergy will be obtained by balancing efforts between both core issues
and specialized applications. The core of this research program is rooted in
robot motion planning, and it is built on a broader unified mathematical
framework that incorporates concepts from optimal control theory, computational
geometry, statistical decision theory, and dynamic game theory. This leads to
the proposed investigation of three core algorithmic issues: 1) searching high-
dimensional spaces that have algebraic and differential constraints,
2)responding to unpredictable changes and on-line information, and 3) solving
sensor-based tasks and processing incomplete information. The focus is
significantly broader than traditional path planning. The core research is
guided by efforts in several applications, such as mobile robotics with active
sensing, virtual prototyping-hazardous environments. These research efforts are
incorporated into an education plan that: 1)builds an interdisciplinary group of
graduate students who are carefully guided through the education and research
process, ii) introduces undergraduates to research, particularly through mobile
robotics and graphical simulation projects, iii) takes steps towards an
interdisiplinary curriculum in geometric algorithms, and iv) helps those from
disadvantaged backgrounds to realize their potential and excel in their careers.
