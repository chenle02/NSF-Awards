Using the technique of the Ricci flow evolution equation, the investigator will
study the structure of certain classes of complete non-compact Kaehler manifolds
with positive bisectional curvature, the smooth structure of compact Riemannian
manifolds with positive curvature operator and the existence of Kaehler-
Einstein metrics on certain compact Kaehler manifolds. The research covers
several topics in modern differential geometry. The geometry of evolution
equations is realized in many fields of mathematical physics, areas relating to
global change, population studies and the biological sciences. It is expected
that the investigator will be active in the training of graduate students.
