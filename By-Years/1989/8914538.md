This project contributes to the general theory of information flow in networks
and to the overall understanding of communication, computation and control.
Shannon.sense information theory, queuing theory, and distributed computation
and control are involved in this study. Specific problems under consideration
include: progressive transmission and the successsive refinement of information,
an information bound on control, Kolmogorov rate distortion theory, and the
capacity of broadcast channels, relay channels, and other multiple user
channels.
