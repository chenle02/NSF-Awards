The Workshop on Networked Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) Communications
convenes researchers and practitioners to identify key research challenges in
the rapidly developing area of networking for assisted-reality technologies. The
2-day event will be held in Crystal City, VA, on April 23-24, 2018, and
attendees will include industry participants, government technologists, and
academic computer scientists and engineers representing the networks, theory,
systems, and applications communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
workshop are to: (1) identify key technical problems for the academic research
community to investigate; (2) establish a long-term vision and corresponding
research agenda to realize the envisioned future of ubiquitous networked VR/AR
applications; (3) increase research community understanding of the requirements
for future networks to support these applications, and (4) identify new
applications and societal benefits associated with augmented reality
applications. Dissemination of workshop findings will be made through the
publication of a workshop report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
