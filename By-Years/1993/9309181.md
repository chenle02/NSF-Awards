9309181 Henriquez The objectives of the research initiation grant is to develop
a mathematical model of cardiac tissue for evaluating the sensitivity of various
types of electrogram recordings at the surface to changes in the underlying
spread of electrical activation. Both unipolar and monophasic action potential
electrograms will be modeled and two and three dimensional bidomain models of
cardiac tissue will be used. This study will include complex activation fronts
including reentry. This research is important since it could lead to the
improvement of the utility of extracellular measurements for a variety of
electrophysiological procedures. ***
