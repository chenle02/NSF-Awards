This award will support research utilizing the particle- size distribution
technique to examine the Oligocene to Pleistocene paleocirculation of
Circumpolar Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. Cores returned by (Ocean
Drilling Program) ODP Legs 114 and 119 scientists. Therefore, this will be a
major improvement over the methods used previously that required correlation of
paleocirculation and paleoclimatic events found at separate locations. This
investigation will correlate paleocurrent events with paleoclimatic events
revealed in micropaleontologic and geochemical parameters.
