9413303 Cheng Table look-up is a technique widely used in computers to
accomplish high-speed information processings. In its implementation, numerous
operations are performed at an earlier time, and the input data and the
corresponding results are stored in a table. When one of the operations is
requested at a later time using the same input data, the processor simply looks
at the table and retrieves the pre-computed information. In VLSI implementation,
the speed of the look-up table technique is primarily limited by the
communication bandwidth. In addition, the limited number of pins available for
VLSI circuits prohibits parallel access of the table by multiple processors.
Consequently, a research effort focused on using optical technology to
accomplish the look-up table tasks to resolve these problems, and improve
overall system performance is being proposed. ***
