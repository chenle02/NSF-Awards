This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the use of a
concept for removal of contaminants from water by subjecting them to contact
with particles to which the contaminants become attached and then removing the
particles which are recirculated following a process that regenerates their
activity and segregates the contaminants for subsequent disposal. Support is
recommended as a 24 month Continuing Grant, the initial increment of which is in
the amount of $101,320 for 12 months starting on May 1, 1987.
