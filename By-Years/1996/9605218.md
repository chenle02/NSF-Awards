Research into a variety of theoretical methods for problems in atomic physics
are proposed. This includes a generalized Hartree-Fock approach for scattering,
extensions of Levinson's theorem, scattering by non-spherical targets,
variational calculations of long-range potentials, Casimir effects and atoms in
magnetic fields.
