The goal of this research is to discover novel foundational principles for
developing highly-efficient and reliable software that can achieve sustainable
performance on the exascale computing platforms expected by 2020. Such platforms
will deliver three orders of magnitude beyond today?s systems; harnessing this
raw computational power could revolutionize our modeling and understanding of
critical phenomena in areas like climate modeling, energy, medicine,
sustainability, cosmology, engineering design, and massive-scale data analytics.
Yet, developing software for exascale systems is a tremendous challenge because
the hardware is complex and it is not believed that the most productive ?high-
level? software development environments (e.g., programming languages and
libraries) will be able to effectively exploit these exascale systems.

The investigator aims to address this challenge by using automated tuning
(autotuning) to eliminate the low performance traditionally associated with
high-level programming models. This research (a) develops new model-driven
frameworks for tuning parallel algorithms and data structures, going beyond
existing techniques that focus on low-level code tuning; and (b) studies
autotuning for programs expressed in high-level programming models, with the aim
of eliminating the performance gap. Concomitant with this research, the PI will
create a new practicum course: The HPC Garage. The HPC Garage physically co-
locates interdisciplinary teams in a social collaborative lab space; the teams
engage in a year-long competition, called the XD Prize, to develop highly
scalable algorithms and software for NSF TeraGrid?s next-generation XD
facilities. The HPC Garage also hosts summer interns in Georgia Tech?s Computing
Research Undergraduate Intern Summer Experience (CRUISE) program, whose mission
is to encourage students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to
pursue graduate degrees in computing.
