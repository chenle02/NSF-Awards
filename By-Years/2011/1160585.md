I/UCRC for Identification Technology Research 1160585 SUNY at Buffalo; Venugopal
Govindaraju

The University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB) proposes to join the Center for
Identification Technology Research (CITeR) as a university site. CITeR,
currently comprised of Clarkson University (lead), West Virginia University and
the University of Arizona, was established about a decade ago to be the forum
for bringing industry and academic interests to converge in the biometrics
arena..

The UB site proposes to advance the science of biometric technologies for both
civilian and homeland security applications by integrating pattern recognition
and machine learning algorithms with sensors technology. The UB team plans to
fuse brain scans with facial expressions and recognition to attempt to record
emotion. UB's interest is in encrypting biometric templates while maintaining
efficiency of indexing and search. The multidisciplinary faculty at the UB site
will design chemical and photo sensors to propose new biometric modalities with
integrated liveness detection.

The UB site will further CITeR's objective to serve as a comprehensive academic
center serving the growing identification technology research, undergraduate and
graduate education, and outreach needs of the public and private sectors. The UB
site brings an experienced team in the areas of behavioral science, computer
vision, visualization, pattern recognition, machine learning, and pervasive
computing. Under the auspices of BEAM (Buffalo Area Engineering Awareness for
Minorities), the proposed site plans to attract the participation of local high
school and undergraduate students. The UB site also intends to increase the
number of under-represented minorities obtaining graduate degrees in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics. CITeR meetings are expected to serve as
an excellent opportunity for students to interact with potential employers to
understand challenges in the field.
