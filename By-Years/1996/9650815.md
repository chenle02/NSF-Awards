One of the strengths of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering is
the Visual Applications area consisting of Computer Graphics, Multimedia
Systems, Computer Aided Geometric Design, and Image Processing. The department
has excellent undergraduate courses in all of these subject areas taught by a
group of internationally recognized faculty. This project is creating a
laboratory equipped with the essential resources to support these undergraduate
courses. Not only does this project improve the undergraduate program, it can
also yield one of the best programs in Visual Applications in the Nation. The
project involves the purchase of a network of cost-effective Silicon Graphics,
Inc. INDY workstations, several Pentium PCs extended with multimedia
capabilities, and some other peripherals for the laboratory.
