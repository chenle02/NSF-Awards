ABSTRACT This project will develop a neural network system to dynamically code
facial expression, automating a process which, though widely used, is now highly
time, labor, and cost intensive. Automation will make this metric accessible to
many more researchers at less cost, while eliminating residual interscorer
discrepancies. Measurement of facial expression is valuable in many domains, and
has led to unique insights in problems as diverse as human development,
sociology, developmental and social psychology. From a practical standpoint,
different aspects of expression eluicidate whether a listener is empathetic or
hostile (important in politics and business), distinguish abusive from
nonabusive caretakers (social work), predict divorce in dysfunctional married
couples, and may incriminate dissembling witnesses (forensics). Reliability of
facial expression as a gauge of nervous system function has been affirmed
through autonomic nervous system indices as well as electromyography and
electroencephalography. Initially, automating measurement of facial movement
will involve static images of faces of a single subject, which will be
preprocessed to normalize size and brightness, compressed with a back-
propagation image compressor, and fed to a second neural network whose output
will correspond to the "action units" of the widely used "Facial Action Coding
System." Recent techniques such as weight-sharing will be used where necessary.
Recurrent networks will be used to allow processing of dynamical information,
with extension of implementation to multiple subjects. This methodological
advance has the potential for a significant contribution to the infrastructure
of science in many domains.
