Success is described on the confinement of spin-polarized hydrogen by a magnetic
trap that confines the gas by magnetic forces that completely isolate it from
all surfaces. Recent results are reported in which the gas been evaporatively
cooled to a temperature of 2mK. These advances open the way to the study of
hydrogen in a new quantum regime. Atomic hydrogen at submillikelvin temperatures
can provide an ideal system for studying the weakly interacting Bose gas and
quantum transport phenomena. A program of research is proposed for applying
these new techniques to study the statistical mechanics of atomic hydrogen and
deuterium at submillikelvin temperatures. The new techniques are also expected
to have important applications in atomic physics and ultra high resolution
spectroscopy. A primary experimental goal is to develop a laser-based technique
for studying the momentum and spatial distributions of hydrogen in the trap.
