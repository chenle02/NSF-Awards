Chemistry (12) This project focuses on enhancement of our undergraduate
chemistry and environmental science programs by introducing high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the laboratory courses of instrumental analysis
and environmental chemistry as well as in multidisciplinary environmental
projects. Laboratory experiments are being adapted from the research and
educational literature and implemented into the undergraduate curricula as well
as the research projects that are tied to local environmental issues. These
laboratory experiments allow our students to perform qualitative and
quantitative analysis of environmental and biological samples, and to develop
problem-solving skills by conducting open-ended research projects. The
integration of the lab experiments with the research projects increases
students' competence in chemical analysis, and thus motivates them to further
explore/solve "real world" chemistry and environmental problems. We plan to
disseminate the outcome of this project by hosting a professional workshop that
targets the chemistry faculty at local community colleges and science teachers
at local high schools.
