Dr. Vilonen intends to continue his work on perverse sheaves, D-modules and
their applications to representation theory. There are projects in three
different areas. The first area of research is on problems relating to the
micro-local structure of perverse sheaves, Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for
irregular D-modules (and E-modules) and a direct construction of mixed perverse
sheaves. The second area of research is on the Langlands conjecture. Here the
investigator intends to work on a geometric form of the Langlands conjecture.
This geometric formulation implies the Langlands conjecture for function fields.
The third area of research is on representation theory of Lie groups. The goal
here is to understand explicitly the structure of (g,K)-modules. These labors
are all part of a large effort involving numerous mathematicians to perfect
algebraic and analytic tools for relating geometry of spaces to properties of
structures which "live" on these spaces.
