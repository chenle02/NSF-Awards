Security is very difficult to use, and staying safe online is a growing
challenge for everyone. It is especially devastating to inexperienced computer
users, who may not spot risk indicators and may misinterpret currently
implemented textual explanations and visual feedback of risk. This work
explores, evaluates, and compares the effectiveness of several online safety
education modules for users of various skill levels and the importance and
effectiveness of visual feedback when encountering security threats. This
interdisciplinary work, with psychologists and computer scientists playing
crucial roles, is developing and testing specific user feedback strategies to
determine their relative effectiveness in keeping users from making security-
critical mistakes, and unambiguously informing users when security failures have
occurred. This research is a vital step to determine what works, what does not
work, and to get users to pay attention to important risk signals that may
otherwise go unnoticed.
