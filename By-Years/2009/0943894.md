University of Hawaii requests funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation
and equipment in support of the multidisciplinary NSF/UNOLS projects to be
undertaken on R/V Kilo Moana, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet. The requests, in order of priority are:

1) EM122 Multibeam Upgrade

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
