ABSTRACT HAMMER OPP-9423429 Well publicized genetic studies linking the origin
of modern humans to Africa have been based largely on maternally-inherited
mitochondrial DNA, which reveal nothing about the role of males in the dynamics
of human migration. The overall goal of this research project is to use the Y
chromosome (carried by males alone) as an independent tool to test hypotheses
regarding the origin and migration patterns of modern human populations and the
male-dedicated gene flow in selected regions of the world. This research is the
first comprehensive effort to systematically examine genetic variation in the
human Y chromosome. These paternally derived data will complement the growing
wealth of linguistic and archaeological data in northern Eurasia and give a more
complete view of the origins and migration patterns of humans into the New
World. *** ??
