An award is made to Delaware State University to enhance research in several
areas while also contributing to undergraduate education and training. The
instrumentation (Seahorse, Argilent Technologies, Inc.) allows researchers to
measure the energy and metabolism of the cell. In addition to providing training
of undergraduates in research, this equipment will also be a critical component
of the redesigned core curriculum in biology. The PIs of this project will pilot
a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) that will provide an
opportunity for students to participate in authentic research. Exposing students
to such research experiences will give them a more positive view of scientific
careers and enhance retention rates in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This
instrumentation will support a diverse, interdisciplinary team of investigators
whose research focuses on understanding the genetic, molecular and cellular
mechanisms that underlie energy budgets in cells (Seahorse). The Seahorse will
serve four distinct projects. One project investigates the connection between
mitochondrial function and TDP-43, a nuclear ribonucleoprotein that has been
implicated in many forms of neurodegeneration. Two other projects investigate
the role of dopamine in metabolic dysfunction related to neurodegeneration, one
focusing on rotenone toxicity in a drosophila model, while the other project
investigates the role of SUMOylation in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and
cell death. A fourth project investigates the role of CD44, a cell-surface
glycoprotein important in the metabolic reprogramming of cells to glycolysis
under hypoxic conditions.
