The PI has requested partial funding for a special issues of The Oceanography
Society (TOS) Magazine, "Oceanography" - Mountains in the
Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seamounts are a major frontier in ocean research with
a diverse community of scientific, commercial, and societal stakeholders
focusing on their exploration, study, and commercial use, and protection from
overexploitation. Scientific interests in seamounts range from their use as
windows to Earth?s mantle to the understanding of the ecology of biological hot
spots. Profitable fisheries led to the need for protection and understanding of
sustainable fisheries yields. This proposed volume is the first truly integrated
look at seamounts, where leaders of the geophysics, geochemistry, microbiology,
marine ecology, oceanography, and fisheries communities will present the current
understanding of and pose new questions related to seamount science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanography
Magazine is an excellent venue for such an interdisciplinary set of papers and
it will be used by scientists to stay current and by educators as a resource.
This issue is quite timely with respect to social issues including fisheries and
MPAs.
