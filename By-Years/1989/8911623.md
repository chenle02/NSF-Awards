The principal investigator will developed the mathematical theory of the
theoretical/experimental collaboration aimed at identifying signal and response
mechanisms in immediate allergic reactions. Biological cells sense their
environment primarily through the interaction of cell surface receptors with
specific extracellular ligands. These interactions serve as signals, initiating
cell responses to hormones, neurotransmitters, immune response mediators, and
other molecules. One response the principal investigator and her colleagues will
study is the release, from intracellular granules, of molecules that cause
allergic symptoms. The mathematics proposed here involves setting up systems of
differential equations, and estimating parameters involved in these equations as
well as estimating distributions using statistical techniques. The mathematical
analysis will be necessary to interpret any but the simplest experiments. The
combination of solid mathematical modeling and analysis expertise with the
biological experimentation is a positive model for interdisciplinary research.
