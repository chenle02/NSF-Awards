9222032 Niedzwecki In the future severe wave conditions like wave breaking will
occur closer to existing coastal structures and pier and bulkhead structures
currently in distress due to neglect will face more severe loading conditions.
Methods for retrofitting deteriorated waterfront pile and bulkhead structures or
strengthening newer waterfront structures are not well established and current
analysis tools can not adequately account for the variabilities in deteriorated
structural geometries or the uncertainties associated with the use of materials
such as steel fiber reinforced concrete. Further, an adequate model for
providing accurate estimates of the wave loading in confined areas such as on
the underside of waterfront structures is not currently available. A new
probabilistic discrete element analysis approach, which includes finite elements
and boundary element methods, to address the geometric and material variability
is pursued in this research effort in concert with the development of a
probabilistic wave force uplift model based upon fundamental concepts of fluid
impulse and momentum considerations. Parametric studies exercising the limits of
the new model will be performed. These simulations will incorporate the limited
data available and predictions for hypothetical, but realistic waterfront
structures.
