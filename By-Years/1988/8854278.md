The three-week workshop is enhancing the ability of faculty in undergraduate
computer science programs to develop and teach courses in the areas of systems
programming, computer operating systems, computer networking and computer
architecture. In particular, the workshop is aimed at: increasing faculty
members' knowledge of both the characteristics of the hardware components and
the interaction among these components within a computer system, and developing
effective techniques for transmitting this knowledge and understanding to
students. Faculty participating in the workshop are primarily involved in the
design and implementation of laboratory experiments which illustrate many of the
basic principles of integrating the components of a microprocessor-based
computer system. For example, experiments are being developed to illustrate the
capabilities and limitations of various microprocessors, the different memory
mapping schemes, interrupt handling techniques, and a variety of peripheral
interfaces. Workshop participants are also discussing the integration of these
laboratory experiments into their computer software systems curricula. Detailed
descriptions of the experiments developed through this workshop will be
disseminated to the academic computer science community.
