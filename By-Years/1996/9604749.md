Funds are requested to purchase a Finnigan-MAT LCQ Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer
and associated Hewlett Packard HPLC for use by a group of seven independent,
federally funded investigators from three different basic science departments
(biochemistry, pharmacology, and cell biology) at the Medical University of
South Carolina. It is proposed to use this highly sensitive, efficient equipment
in the isolation, purification, and synthesis of insulin-like proteins, retinal
pigments and binding proteins, GTP-binding proteins, sperm motility proteins,
lens globular proteins (crystallins), and regA proteins. The research projects
of six additional users who will also benefit from the proposed instrument are
also briefly described. Preliminary data using the LCQMS instrument are
presented for a lens protein demonstrating that the LCQ technology provides not
only state-of-the-art sensitivity, but saves enormous amounts of time and sample
handling through its capability to perform on-line HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS on one
chromatographic run. The proposed instrument will become a part of MUSC's Mass
Spectrometry Facility which has evolved into a laboratory primarily devoted to
the study of protein structure and function. It combines research in new
developments and applications of mass spectrometry, application of this
technology to important research problems by the faculty and students associated
with the facility, and service to the general MUSC community as well as to
national and international collaborators.
