David Leitner of the University of Nevada, Reno is supported by an award from
the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for the study of
heat transport in molecular systems important in biology and technology,
including materials adopted in small integrated circuits. The research combines
principles developed in a range of disciplines, including materials science,
biophysical and theoretical physical chemistry, and brings together communities
of scientists and engineers. The principal investigator is involved in
communicating science to the public through participation in the Telluride
Science Research Center and in outreach activities with students in secondary
school.

This research centers on development and application of theoretical and
computational approaches to study thermal transport on the nanoscale, which is
often mediated by interfaces between molecules and their local environment. One
aim of the proposal addresses the calculation of thermal conductance in and
between large molecules. A second theme focuses on the computation of thermal
transport in nanoporous materials, in particular nanoporous glassy materials
adopted as highly electronically insulating materials in integrated circuits. A
third aim of the proposal concerns the calculation of response times of local
probes of energy transport in large molecules, in particular proteins, peptides
and molecular chains.
