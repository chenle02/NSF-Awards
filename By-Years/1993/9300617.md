9300617 Martin This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.
Joseph Shakal of the University of Wisconsin to conduct collaborative research
with Dr. Shinichi Goto for 24 months at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in
Tsukuba, Japan. They will apply Dr. Shakal's methods of auxiliary fuel injection
to combustion experiments on a dual fuel diesel engine. The Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) is currently funding research on clean
burning engine technology at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory. Dr. Goto is
conducting experiments on reducing soot and nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon
emissions of diesel engines by injecting butane as a liquid near the intake
valve at the time the valve is open. Utilizing Dr. Shakal's expertise in dual
fuel injectors, the team will install a dual fuel injector on the engine and
conduct experiments with butane being injected after combustion of the diesel
fuel is underway. By measuring natural fluorescence and emissions, the team will
determine the optimum injection conditions for a cleaner burning engine. This
clean burning technology could then be immediately applied to bus, truck, and
other diesel engines in both the U.S. and Japan.
