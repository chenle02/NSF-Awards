This action funds Sean C. Reber of Kent State University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Computational feature-based texture synthesis on flow
fields," during the summer of 2012 at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced
Integration Technology in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. The host
scientist is George Chen.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is producing realistic fluid
representation and animation in movies, games and other digital media and
assisting in visualizing and analyzing flow data or vector fields for scientific
applications. The goal of the research is to improve upon the existing methods
of Lagrangian based texture advection, using a Poisson-disk distribution of
particles, and optimization based texture synthesis by adapting them with
structural features extracted from flow fields using finite-time Lyapunov
exponents (FTLE).

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
