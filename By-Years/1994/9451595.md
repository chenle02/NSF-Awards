9451595 Linder This proposal requests matching funds to purchase a liquid
scintillation counter to be used in undergraduate biochemistry laboratories and
in undergraduate research at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). The
biochemistry laboratory serves an active and growing B.S., Biochemistry degree
program. The instrument will be used to implement a new experiment measuring
rates of protein turnover in cultured cells under a variety of conditions in the
biochemistry laboratory. This experiment has been carefully designed to 1) teach
students the theory and practice of radioisotope handling and detection, 2)
provide an interesting and challenging laboratory experience, 3) enable students
to perform standard computations and corrections associated with the use of
multiple isotopes, quenching, and isotope dilution, and 4) convey procedures and
practices associated with safe handling and disposal of radioisotopes. The
requested instrumentation will also be used extensively by students in active
undergraduate research programs. Research is an essential component of the
educational process at CSUF and has been highly successful by a number of
criteria including publications co-authored by students and entry of students
into graduate programs in the sciences.
