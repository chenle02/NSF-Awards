Intellectual Merit Centrioles are conserved microtubule-based organelles that
play essential roles in numerous cellular functions and in an organism's
development. A cell requires exactly two centrioles in order to normally divide
and function. Thus, it is important that centriole number is precisely
regulated. However, in many animals, it appears that the unfertilized oocyte
lacks any centrioles and it inherits only one centriole from the sperm. As a
fertilized oocyte has two centrioles, it acquires the second centriole via an
unidentified mechanism. The goal of this project is to better understand how the
second centriole is acquired using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system.

Broader Impacts As well as answering basic Developmental and Cell Biology
questions, this project will provide many developing and novice scientists
(e.g., undergraduate and high school students) an opportunity to experience
laboratory research at a top tier institution. Over the past five years, the
Avidor-Reiss laboratory has developed and executed a student outreach program
that provides students from Boston-area high schools and colleges with short
term (2 - 3 month) or long-term (2 - 3 year) laboratory internships where they
can gain direct training and exposure to research in the biological sciences.
This is an exceptional and ideal opportunity for a young person who is
considering a career in science. In conclusion, the proposed research will help
educate and inspire the next generation of researchers.
