Mountain Empire Community College Young Scholars Program will strengthen its
current summer enrichment program in math and science for high school juniors
and seniors. This program is part of the Virginia Governor's School Program,
which offers students enrichment activities beyond those available in the
regular school programs. Referred to locally as the Magnet School, this four
week program features hands-on scientific and mathematical investigation,
including overnight field trips to science-related facilities and locations.
Real-world environmental and ecological problems are studied and innovative
teaching methods are utilized. Students are selected from the seventeen high
schools in the College's service area. High School teachers also participate in
the summer program. They are exposed to non-traditional instructional
methodologies, update their knowledge in the fields of science and mathematics
and contribute to improved communications and cooperation between the high
schools and the College.
