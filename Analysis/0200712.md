Abstract

The principal investigator will use vectorial Hankel and Toeplitz operators in
noncommutative analysis. In spite of the recent progress of approximation theory
for matrix and operator functions there are still many open problems important
in applications such as control theory, multivariate stationary processes, etc.
The principal investigator will look for a sharp estimate of the degree of the
superoptimal approximant of a rational matrix function and sharp estimates of
the resolvents of Toeplitz and Wiener-Hopf operators acting on spaces of vector
functions, study properties of Wiener-Hopf, thematic, and canonical
factorizations of matrix functions, study different regularity conditions for
multivariate stationary processes in spectral terms, study Hankel-Schur
multipliers, study Schatten--von Neumann properties of certain integral
operators arising from Schrodinger operators.

Among operators acting on spaces of analytic functions there are two classes
that play an extremely important role. These are Hankel operators and Toeplitz
operators. The theory of such operators has been rapidly developing for the last
20 years. Recently it has become clear that to satisfy the needs of control
theory, prediction theory and other applications, it is necessary to study
Toeplitz and Hankel operators on spaces of vector functions. This leads to a
considerably more complicated theory, The principal investigator has obtained
recently interesting results that required a new technique. He is going to
continue to work in this direction and apply Hankel and Toeplitz operators on
spaces of vector functions to different problems in noncommutative analysis.
