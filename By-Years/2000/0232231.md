This Phase I project will provide a low-cost process for producing high-pressure
hydrogen (e.g., &lt;br/&gt;7.500 psia, 510 atm) for use in vehicles. This
process uses a proven, regenerable, low cost CO2 sorbent and a small-scale
process that reforms natural gas, diesel, gasoline, or oil derived from biomass
to hydrogen and compresses that H2 to high pressure for use in vehicles.
Although the regeneration of the CO2 sorbent requires energy, the new
sorbent/process effectively minimizes the efficiency impact. All of the
necessary reforming reactions, water gas shift and carbon dioxide removal are
performed in one reactor. This results in higher hydrogen purity, better energy
integration (i.e., higher efficiency), reactions eliminate high temperature heat
exchanges or valves, and greatly reduces steam requirements and minimizes the
use of downstream process. The result is a lower cost, smaller system with
improved efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key aspect of the system is the
low cost reforming of the fuel. In the near term, the production of H2 would
benefit merchant applications. The proposed system can generate on-site hydrogen
at scales that are similar to the current on-site hydrogen generation plants at
very high purity and low cost. In the long term the new system can provide
hydrogen at low cost to distribution centers for use in vehicles and other fuel
cell applications.&lt;br/&gt;
