The S-STEM Program at Gaston College is using high-impact strategies to improve
persistence and graduation rates for STEM students. Gaston College (GC) is a
state-supported, open-door, comprehensive community college serving Gaston and
Lincoln counties in North Carolina, and is a member of the 58 institution North
Carolina Community College System (NCCCS). This program is intended for students
preparing to transfer to a four-year institution for further study in any STEM
discipline. This project enables the recruitment of larger numbers of STEM
students and helps scholars address major barriers to completion through strong
peer-support networks, and focused advising and mentoring. Success of the
scholars is fostered by financial support, academic cohorts, mentoring, and
supplemental group activities. While this project targets all STEM students,
based on the demographics of the college and surrounding community, the project
has a positive impact on the numbers of underrepresented students enrolling in
and completing STEM programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gaston College program
uses high-impact strategies including cohort formation mentoring and meta-
cognitive exercises to improve persistence and graduation rates for STEM
students. The goals include (1) transformation of curricula through integration
of inquiry-based instruction and development of a research methods course with
an undergraduate research component as a capstone experience; (2) centralization
of STEM student support services within a center environment to include
advising, mentoring, cooperative work experiences and undergraduate research
experiences, and tutoring; and (3) reduction of the unmet financial need of
cohort students by providing scholarships. As part of the evaluation process,
quantitative assessment is collected for both for scholarship recipients and the
general population seeking Associate of Science degrees. Data include GPA,
course grades, retention rates, enrollment and rates of progress towards degree,
percentage of underrepresented groups, graduation rates, and transfer and/or job
placement rate.
