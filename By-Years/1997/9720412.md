This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
initiative. It is interdisciplinary research in the knowledge, processing, and
learning of language. It proceeds from a framework utilizing results from
mathematical statistics, adaptive systems, and formal learning theory which
provide a means of treating language as a kind of statistical optimization.
Previous work by the principal investigator on the integration of linguistic
theory with optimization principles in neural networks has led to this new
grammar formalism, optimality theory, which has had considerable impact on many
aspects of the study of human language, including learning. Recently developed
methods of psychological experimentation now provide reliable data on the
process of language learning, even in infants. This research brings together
these experimental methods for observing real-time processing and learning of
language, computational methods of research on optimization and automatic
language processing, and linguistic methods for studying the structure of the
representations essential for human language. The investigators bring not only
expertise in the contributing disciplines, but also considerable experience in
interdisciplinary collaboration. The results of this research will help us to
explain the mystery of how humans - and possibly artificial systems - can learn
to use and understand languages.
