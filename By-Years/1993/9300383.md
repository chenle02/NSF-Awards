Dr. Robert D. Coombe and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Denver are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is that one of the research areas is on the chemistry of urban
atmospheres-a problem area for this region.
