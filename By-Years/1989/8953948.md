Students are finding more excitement and making better progress in calculus
because of a revised curriculum that emphasizes problem solving, building
intuition, and improving written mathematical expression. A data base is being
created consisting of non-routine, open-ended, multi-step problems and
discussion modules emphasizing concepts, experimentation, and widely varying
applications.
