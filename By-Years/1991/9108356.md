This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with nonlinear dynamical phenomena
in electric power systems. The principal tool to be used in developing the
methodology is bifurcation theory. The methodology will be used to formulate a
performance index to predict voltage collapse and to identify weak areas in the
system for possible voltage control.
