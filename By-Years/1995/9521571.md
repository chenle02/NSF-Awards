9521571 Meert This grant provides partial funding ($12,500) for the acquisition
of paleomagnetic laboratory equipment at Indiana State University, a primarily
undergraduate institution. A Thermal Demagnetizer and Impulse Magnetizer
together with peripheral equipment will be purchased with these funds and an
equal amount provided by the University and will establish a fully functional
paleomagnetic laboratory to be guided by this young Principal Investigator . The
laboratory will allow the Principal Investigator to train graduate (M.A.) and
undergraduate (B.A.) students and involve them in a variety of projects
including Precambrian tectonics and paleogeographic reconstructions. ***
