The long term goal of this research is to use thio derivatives of RNA bases and
phosphate diesters to explore or to exploit metal ion binding on nucleic acids.
The first project uses a single phosphorothioate modification to direct a metal
ion cross-linking agent to a Tetrahymena ribozyme for the purpose of studying
ribozyme structure and selective inactivation of RNA. The second project
examines metal ion binding to 4-thiouridine and 6- thioguanosine and incorporate
a 4-thiouridine into a Hammerhead ribozyme in positions thought to be important
in metal ion binding. Metal-ion-RNA interactions are a key component of RNA
structure and are important in the development of therapeutic agents for the
inactivation of RNA. Interactive activities in the classroom and in the research
laboratory involve both undergraduate and graduate female chemistry students. A
graduate level interdisciplinary course in bioinorganic chemistry is being
taught, and a seminar series is being run on careers in the physical sciences in
order to induce female students to consider physical science degrees.
