9361080 Kumar Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology is currently the most
popular platform of flat panel displays (FPD), but it suffers from complex
manufacturing and high cost problems. Great difficulties have been experienced
in producing demonstration prototype field emission displays (FED) which have
been promoted as the leap-frog FPD technology. This is mainly attributed to the
manfacturability and scalability problems associated with the traditional micro-
tip type of cold cathode used as the source of electrons in all current FEDs.
The recent invention of Amorphic Diamond (AD) field emitter cold cathode is
probably the first revolutionary discovery affecting FPD technology sine the
original micro-tips were developed almost twenty years ago. The thin film AD
cathodes have a very low effective work function (on the order of 0.2eV), have
high density of emission sites, have high thermal conductivity, are chemically
inert, can be deposited at room temperature, and are FDP material and process
compatible. We are proposing to concentrate on the understanding of the field
emission phenomenon from these films and to carry out a systematic study for
optimization of these materials. A better understanding of these mechanisms will
help not only in the development of higher quality AD emitters, but may also
lead us to new (non-carbon based) and even better field emitters. ***
