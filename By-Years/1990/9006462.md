Food web theory predicts a series of relationships between the species richness
(number of species) of a natural assemblage and the stability of species
abundances in time. In spite of the importance of food web dynamics to both
basic and applied issues in ecology, few of these predictions have been tested
experimentally. This project will first assemble replicated food webs of
protozoans that differ in species richness, connectance (number of species
interactions in an assemblage) or number of trophic levels. These webs will then
be used to evaluate the persistence and temporal stability of communities with
and without small perturbations in nutrient levels. These enrichment experiments
are very important to improve the knowledge base of fertilization effects in
nature, an area of great concern as a result of the nutrient loading associated
with global change. In another set of experiments, the effects of species
richness will be determined in the laboratory relative to the persistence and
variability of species. A final group of trials will examine whether the degree
of connectance in food webs affects their stability, and whether stability
decreases as food chains increase in length. Although these experiments will be
done on assembled communities in the laboratory, ancillary studies will employ
similar approaches to explore whether natural protozoan communities collected
from the field will perform similarly to those constructed artificially.
