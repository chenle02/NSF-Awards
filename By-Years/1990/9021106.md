Insects which specialize in feeding on only certain groups of plants are
important experimental organisms for addressing two fundamental questions in
evolutionary biology. These are 1) what factors influence the appearance of new
varieties or races of organisms? and 2) what factors determine the rate and
direction of evolution? New varieties of insects have been found when new plants
are introduced to or invade areas where an insect is already feeding on a
related plant. Dr. Dingle proposes to study an insect species that feeds on
various species of related plants and has switched in parts of its range to
plant species that have been introduced as ornamentals. Dr. Dingle will study
the evolution of the differentiation by examining the influence of genes and the
environment on this evolution. Dr. Dingle will also examine the basis of host
choice in the two populations and test to see if the two populations will still
interbreed. In this way Dr. Dingle will attempt to learn if the two populations
have differentiated enough to be separate species. The problem of adaptation to
new host plants is of considerable basic and practical importance. Most
important crop plants are introduced and it is important to know how readily
insects can adapt to them and become pests. Many alien plants are accidentally
introduced and may thus "escape" the insects which normally feed on them to
become abundant weeds. To control them it is useful to know how readily new
insects can adapt to them and replace the natural enemies they left behind. The
insect studied here is particularly useful because the effect of a switch in
host plants, a dramatic change in mouth part structure, is so easy to measure
and manipulate. As a result of this switch, the insect has evolved changes in
the structure of mouth parts used in feeding on the different plants. The
research thus holds great potential for minimizing insect damage to introduced
crops and to maximize damage to introduced weeds.
