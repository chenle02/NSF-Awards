This two-year award supports participation of graduate students and a
postdoctoral researcher in a U.S.-U.K. cooperative research project between
Andrew Barron of Rice University and W. H. Rankin of the University of
Edinburgh. The objective of their research is to determine the structure of a
series of Group 13 compounds - aluminum, gallium, and indium - through analysis
of electron diffraction data. They will study the compounds under conditions
similar to those employed in metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of
thin films. The investigators will write mathematical models to describe the
molecular geometries and interpret the data. The U.S. investigator brings to
this collaboration expertise in molecular control studies of inorganic
materials. This is complemented by the U.K. investigator's expertise in the
structure of small molecules. The project will advance our understanding of
molecular control of the structure, morphology and purity of thin films.
