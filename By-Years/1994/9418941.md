9418941 Ganguly The research supported by this award represents a continuing
effort to determine the energetic properties of ferromagnesian silicates and to
use these data to constrain the thermal and dynamic histories of terrestrial
rocks and meteorites. The research will (1) extend previous work on
multicomponent diffusion in (Fe, Mg, Ca, Mn) garnet to lower temperatures and
into previously unexplored compositional space, (2) investigate the edfect of
H2O on the diffusion of divalent cations in garnet, (3) determine Sm3+ tracer
diffusion in garnet, and (4) continue collaborative experimental and modelling
work on Fe2+-Mg interdiffusion in clinopyroxene.
