An Undergraduate Software Engineering Laboratory This project will create a
software engineering laboratory based on a client/server cluster consisting of a
file server and high-performance workstations. This will make possible the
enhancement of one existing course, and the creation of three others. These
courses, Computer Networks, Distributed and Parallel Systems, Software Design
and Software Environments, together with other courses will improve and support
the software engineering concentration within the computer science major program
at Oswego. Implementation will substantially strengthen Oswego's ability to
graduate competent software engineers.
