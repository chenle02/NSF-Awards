This award will support Professor Pierre Schmidt of Florida International
University in a research collaboration with Professor A. Ortiz-Conde of the
Universidad Simon Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela. The objective of the
collaboration is the development of a circuit model for thin film silicon- on-
insulator MOSFETs based upon the charge-sheet concept. The project will include
checking the range of validity of the models, development of a computer aided
design model, and calculation of static current-voltage characteristics. The
technology involved in this project is of importance to radiation-tolerant
integrated circuits, to novel three- dimensional integrated circuits, to high-
voltage transistors, and to advanced device and circuits concepts all based on
thin-film silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs. A considerable part of the analytical
study will be carried out by the Venezuelan side, while experimental
verification and determination of the range of validity will be done by the U.S.
side.
