Abstract Meyer Dr. Meyer (with Dr. McCord) will study the topology of the
integral manifolds of the regularized spatial three-body problem. He wishes to
describe the bifurcations by computing the homology of these manifolds for
various values of the parameters. He will try to clarify the existence of Arnold
diffusion in the three-body problem using reduction, symplectic scaling,
normalization, and the theory of normally hyperbolic manifolds. Dr. Meyer (with
Dr. Schmidt) will study the existence of KAM tori near elliptic orbits of the
three-body problem. He (with Ms Howison, a graduate student) will establish the
existence of various periodic solutions of the spatial restricted three-body
problem. He will also try to establish the existence of elliptical comet like
orbits in the full three-body problem. Dr. Meyer studies the differential
equations the describe the motion of the planets and satellites in our solar
system, the N-body problem. He also studies other types of equations that
describe mechanical systems. Since these equations are not solvable exactly, he
studies questions about special types of solutions. For example, when does the
system of equations have periodic solutions or even quasi-periodic solutions? He
will attempt to establish several new families of periodic solutions and several
new families of quasi-periodic solutions for the N-body problem. He has
developed several new methods to attack these problems. The existence of these
quasi-periodic solutions give some partial understanding of the stability of the
solar system. He will also study some global questions about these systems. What
global constraints on the possible configuration of the bodies come from the
conservation of energy and momentum?
