This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Steven P. Nolan of the University of New Orleans to
undertake a multi-faceted program of solution calorimetric, kinetic and
catalytic studies on well-defined organometallic compounds of ruthenium,
palladium, rhodium, nickel and platinum in order to develop catalytic systems
that offer a fundamental understanding of the formation of C-C, C-N and C-O
bonds. Another overall aim is to simplify catalytic protocols for coupling
reactions and enable catalytic transformations by easily used systems under mild
conditions. The ligand families in these systems are tertiary phosphines and
N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) derived from an imidazole framework. The NHC
ligand family offers user-friendly systems with respect to air-, moisture-and
thermal-stability coupled with improved reactivity compared to ubiquitous
tertiary phosphines systems.

This research is linked to important industrial applications in fine chemical
and pharmaceutical syntheses, so that the technology developed may be
transferred to industrial partners. The research will also train undergraduate,
graduate and postdoctoral students in important areas of chemical technology.
