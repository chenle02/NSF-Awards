This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the
development of aqueous, environmentally benign computer read - write head
lapping fluids based upon polyaspartic copolymer dispersants. In order to
accomplish this, a whole new class of polyaspartic acid copolymers will be
synthesized and their lapping performance will be characterized. The overall
results from this study will have a significant impact upon the computer hard
disk manufacturing industry since it will enable the production of read write
heads having better surface quality / planarization needed for next generation,
higher storage density computer systems. Results from this work will be
beneficial to the domestic hard disk drive industry; enabling it to maintain its
prominence despite its increased overseas competition
