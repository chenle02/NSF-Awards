Support for three undergraduate researchers will be provided by this award. The
students will work with the principal investigator on selected questions in
applied mathematics taken from problems arising in industrial settings. Typical
of these questions are studies of light loss in space telescope metering,
modeling clocks in space and analyzing relativistic effects of light paths. Some
of the work will involve numerical approximations. Visits to industrial research
facilities are also planned.
