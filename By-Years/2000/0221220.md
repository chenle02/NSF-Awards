This dissertation investigates the causes and earnings outcomes of employment
in ethnic niches among the Latino population in Boston and Los Angeles. Data
from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality will be used because this survey
identifies the ethnic backgrounds of the respondents' coworkers and supervisor.
In addition to the usual human capital variables as determinants of employment
and earnings (e.g., education, English fluency), the study will focus on
nativity, skin color, national origin, and gender. The research will also
investigate the role of job search strategies that use informal networks of
family and friends as an explanation for how Latinos and especially Latinas end
up employed in ethnic niches.
