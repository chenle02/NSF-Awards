In cache-based side-channel attacks, an attacker with no special privileges or
physical access can extract secrets from a victim process by observing its
memory accesses through a shared cache. Such attacks have been demonstrated on a
number of platforms, and represent a dangerous and open threat. This project
explores side-channel attacks on the shared lower-level-caches (LLCs) in modern
CPUs.

The investigators demonstrate the feasibility of these types of attacks, and
explores defenses against these attacks and against colluding attacks at
different levels of the cache hierarchy. The project develops security metrics
for expressing side-channel vulnerability and correlates them to the ease of
reconstructing the secret data from the leaked side-channel information. These
new metrics and tools developed in this work will assist in rigorous evaluation
of the security of systems with respect to these types of attacks.
