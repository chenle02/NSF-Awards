This awards supports summer research by undergraduates at the Sevilleta Long
Term Ecological Research (LTER) site of the University of New Mexico. Students
will live at the Sevilleta LTER during the 12-week summer program while pursuing
research problems related to ongoing research at the LTER. Sample areas of
research include 1) investigation of the role of genetic and physiological
variation in abundance and distribution of cottonwood trees along the Rio
Grande, and 2) response of desert grassland ecological processes to rodent
removal. Students will attend seminars and participation in other group
activities that will include discussions of the research process, of scientific
ethics, and of teaching. Communication of research results will also be
emphasized.
