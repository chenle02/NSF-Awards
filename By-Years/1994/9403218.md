The investigator develops the theory for the generalnonlinear rescaling
principle for constrained optimization. Based on this principle, he finds
theoretically well-grounded and numerically efficient methods for solving large-
scale constrained optimization problems. Constrained optimization problems arise
in all areas ofscientific, technological, and commercial activities. The problem
is to choose values of parameters, subject to certain limits on their values, so
as to make some function of the parameters take on an extreme value. For
instance, one might try to locate warehouses so as to minimize the costs of
shipping items to individual distribution sites. Or one might choose the
placement of structural members to maximize the strength of the structure
subject to weight constraints. Problems like these can involve thousands of
parameters and tens of thousands of constraints. The investigator develops and
studies efficient and numerically stable methods for large-scale optimization
problems. The ability to solve such problems is critical in optimal structural
design, forecasting, network optimization, optimal control, economics, and
finance communication problems.
