The project develops a new powerful method of evaluation of entanglement in
various dynamical systems. The method uses Toeplitz determinants and the Fisher-
Hartwig formula. Entanglement is a primary resource in quantum information
processing, necessary for quantum computation and communication. The idea of the
project is to find a physical system with maximum entanglement available to
control. The entropy of a subsystem is used in the project as a measure of
entanglement; it defines the dimension of the Hilbert space of the subsystem.

Development of high-performance computing is a strategically important goal. A
promising approach to the construction of fast computers is based on quantum
mechanics. In order to build quantum computers, and it is necessary to identify
physical systems with a large degree of inherently quantum-mechanical behavior.
A qualitative measure of such 'quantumness' is entanglement. This project
develops a method for searching for physical systems with maximal entanglement.
