This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in
Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics. The project brings faculty from
the three campuses of Miami-Dade Community College together to help implement
the program. Over a two-year period M-DCC seeks to award a total of forty
scholarships to these students. Besides the financial eligibility, the
scholarships recipients must also meet established academic criteria that will
enable them to obtain Associate in Arts degrees in computer science,
mathematics, and engineering. The students have the opportunity to get involved
in summer internships with local industries. Upon completion of the program, the
students may continue on to an upper division school or those who receive
training, may directly enter into the workforce. Faculty Mentors are assigned to
each scholarship recipient in order to improve the quality of their educational
experience and thereby improve the student's chances for academic success.
