This is the first year of a two-year continuing award. The research focuses on
the development of novel image description operators based on the notion of
Gaussian Wavelet Groups (GWG). These groups are synthesized in clusters that
have high cojoint spatial-frequency resolution and are also efficient in
detection and localization of shapes directly from gray-scale images.
Specialized GWGs will be developed that are capable of measuring various shape
descriptors such as location, orientation, size and boundary curvature. The GWGs
will be generated in real time by novel lattice networks. To describe whole
shapes, a novel topological structure called a scale-spinal-graph (SSG) will be
developed, along with a network that can generate the SSG with parallel
operations. The project will also develop an efficient image representation
scheme using clusters of GWGs, for real time image compression.
