This proposal seeks partial support for a summer FASEB conference "Ubiquitin
and Protein Breakdown" that deals with a topic of fundamental importance in a
wide variety of both pro- and eukaryotes; the meeting provides a forum at which
leading contributors to research progress on this topic will be able to share
latest findings and interact to stimulate research in key, critical areas. //
