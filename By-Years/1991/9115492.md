The anti-correlation between cosmic ray fluxes and the level of solar activity
(solar modulation) is caused by magnetic field irregularities carried by the
solar wind that sweep charged particles out of the solar system and/or
decelerate them. Since electrons and nuclei have greatly different charge/mass
ratios, the relation of velocity and magnetic rigidity is significantly
different for these two particle species. If the heliospheric magnetic field has
long range order, the charge sign of cosmic ray particles can affect their
propagation. A major failure of current modulation model simultaneously to
reproduce electron and nucleon modulation is related to reversals of the solar
magnetic field which occur every eleven years. Charge dependence should change
when the solar field reverses, but in a way different from what is observed. The
PIs propose a research program designed to extend measurements of charge
dependence of cosmic ray solar modulation through comparison of electron data to
be obtained under this proposal with electron and proton data available from an
instrument on the ICE spacecraft as well as other data from the literature. This
investigation will determine the extent to which large scale order of the
heliospheric magnetic field is important in determining trajectories of charged
particles in the heliosphere.
