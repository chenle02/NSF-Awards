This award supports collaboration between Dr. Shiferaw Berhanu of Temple
University and Dr. Jorge G. Hounie of the Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos in
Sao Carlos, Brazil to study a number of properties of solutions of systems of
complex vector fields with smooth or real analytic coefficients. In cases to be
considered, an integrability condition is always assumed to hold. These problems
are motivated by classical results of holomorphic functions in one and several
complex variables. Results from this research may have important applications to
function theory in several variables and to the theory of linear partial
differential equations.
