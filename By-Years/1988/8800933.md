This project, submitted by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on behalf of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), Fleet
Replacement Committee (FIC), will carry out a preliminary design study for a
large, general purpose, monohull, research vessel (R/V). The preliminary design
will amplify an earlier concept design by Glosten Associates which shows promise
of creating a ship with comparable operating costs to existing large R/V's, but
with improved seakeeping and substantially greater flexibility and capability in
meeting science mission requirements for the next generation of R/V's. This
project will provide valuable information and guidance to the NSF, other federal
agencies and the ocean science community. The Project Director, Dr. F. N.
Spiess, is a highly respected scientist and is quite capable of directing this
project, having had considerable experience in overseeing similar activities.
