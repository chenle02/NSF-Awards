Abstract

Award: DMS 1205947, Principal Investigator: Michael T. Anderson

This project concerns several studies in the geometric, analytic and physical
aspects of the Einstein equations and applications to related areas. Of
particular interest are global issues for boundary value problems for Einstein
metrics, including applications to classical differential geometry such as the
isometric embedding problem and the study of minimal and constant mean curvature
surfaces in space forms. Research will also be carried out on several topics in
general relativity, including the study of quasi-local mass and the Bartnik
static extension conjecture. Research related to the renormalization group flow
in the AdS/CFT correspondence will also be undertaken in a joint project with
physicists working in string theory.

The Einstein equations have long been a central focus of study and interest to
mathematicians and physicists. They are very important on the mathematical side
since they are at the forefront of knowledge and research in the areas of
geometric analysis and partial differential equations. On the physical side,
they govern our understanding of large-scale physics - the formation of stars,
galaxies and the structure of the universe as a whole. As a concrete
application, GPS would not be possible without a thorough and full understanding
of the Einstein equations. In addition, they lie at the core of string theory -
the most actively studied subject in high energy theoretical physics. The
project will involve collaboration and interaction between mathematicians and
physicists seeking to unravel some of the mysteries of these equations. In
addition, the project involves the training of graduate students in these areas
important for the future of basic research.
