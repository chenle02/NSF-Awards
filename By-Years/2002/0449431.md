Proposal Title: CAREER: Aggregate-enhanced Membrane
Filtration&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0449431&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Albert Kim&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Hawaii&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation is a fundamental study
of micro-hydrodynamic scale phenomena&lt;br/&gt;using Stokesian dynamics for
reducing colloidal fouling in crossflow microfiltration and ultrafiltration
enhanced by pre-aggregation and specific particle deposition. The main object of
this project is enhancement of filtration performance using particle aggregation
in feed water and on the membrane surface. Geometrical structure of the
aggregate cake and fluff layer will be modeled and the specific resistances will
be estimated from the simulations. Stokesian dynamics will be developed and
modified to simulate the generation of the aggregate cake layer. A primary
objective of this project is to determine the critical conditions, i.e.,
critical flux, below which no disintegration will happen. The educational plan
will focus on cultivating scientific motivation of domestic students who are
mostly American-born Asian and native Hawaiian students. They will be introduced
to the project through new courses at the undergraduate level on the purpose of
research-based education. The proposed course activities will integrate domestic
undergraduate and foreign graduate students through research-related projects to
foster collaborations. There is a need for developing molecular models that
capture the molecular level information of aggregates both in solution and on
membranes. Understanding the physico-chemical aspects of the aggregates on
membrane surfaces will offer means of preventing these and thus improving the
membrane efficacy. The proposed research is thus expected to have a significant
impact on designing more efficient filtration systems.&lt;br/&gt;
