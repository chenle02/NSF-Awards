Machine learning (ML) is a crucial tool to address many societal challenges. ML
is also a critical factor in American competitiveness. Much of ML was inspired
by biology and sometimes aims to understand biological systems, especially the
brain. Yet, the methodologies of ML resemble biological systems only
superficially. Understanding biological systems is one of the central goals of
Mathematical Biology (MB). MB takes a seemingly opposite approach to ML by
carefully matching experimental data and reconstructing the physiology of
biological systems. So far, the tools of ML and MB have been mainly distinct. In
this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will seek synergies between these
two different methodologies and build mathematical tools that bridge these two
approaches. PI will also develop tools to study real-world circadian rhythms and
sleep. One tool is a smartphone app the PI will deploy. PI shall also work to
increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics through
outreach to underserved high schools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical
models in this project consist of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and
stochastic differential equations. One of the primary goals is to build ML tools
based on biophysically accurate models of neurons. These models will use the
formalism developed by Hodgkin and Huxley. The key problem to be addressed here
is how learning can occur with highly nonlinear models and time dependence
through improvements on the backpropagation technique. Additionally, the PI will
develop approaches that use predictions from currently developed models to
enhance classification in ML. Key problems to address here are how to classify
ODE models' simulations or incorporate uncertainty into ODE models properly. The
methods will be tested against experimental data on human
sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
