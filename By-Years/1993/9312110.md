The importance of seabirds as part of the marine ecosystem has only recently
been recognized. In order to understand the dynamics of polar marine ecosystems,
a focus on the interaction between the physical environment and the major
biological components, including such apex predators as marine mammals and
seabirds, is required. This workshop will focus on Southern Ocean seabird
species, but will include arctic and temperate species. The development of new
instrumentation and sampling techniques for studying seabirds during the last
decade has given valuable insights into their physiology, population biology and
community ecology. As new approaches have developed, concern has been raised
about the introduction of bias into the data being obtained. This workshop will
address the topic of research protocols used in seabird studies with the aim of
understanding the effects on the population studied and the data collected.
