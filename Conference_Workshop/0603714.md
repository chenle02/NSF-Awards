Professor Bridson will deliver a total of seven lectures on the state of
contemporary Geometric Group Theory. Topics will include: limit groups, free
group automorphisms, free by cyclic groups, dimension for groups (cohomolgical,
topological, CAT(0), action etc.) CAT(0) spaces, the geometry of word problem,
balanced presentations and the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture, Grothendieck
ambiguity, Deficiency, and the conjugacy and isomorphism problems.

The University of Arkansas Spring Lecture Series, held each year since 1977,
features multiple talks by a leading researcher outlining the state of an area
of mathematics. This year's conference presents an excellent opportunity for
graduate students and young researchers to gain an overview of Geometric Group
Theory. Geometric Group Theory aims to study groups, algebraic objects in
nature, using geometric techniques. In the past 25 years geometric structures
were found on many groups that are of great interest for researchers in many
fields of natural sciences. Theses structures lead to the discovery of fast
algorithms for several key problems in group theory. More information can be
found on the conference homepage: http://www.uark.edu/depts/mathinfo/sls-2006/
