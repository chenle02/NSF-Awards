The research to be performed on this RIA award will investigate the role of the
interface and interphase region on the toughening of highly crosslinked epoxy
polymers. Two distinct approaches will be examined through the study of rubber-
modified epoxies and thermoplastic-modified epoxies. The results of these
studies will enable the development of highly crosslinked epoxies with improved
quality and reliability.
