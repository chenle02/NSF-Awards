This award will support a joint seminar entitled "Advances in Mercury
Toxicology" between U.S. and Japanese scientists. The seminar organizers are
Professor Thomas W. Clarkson of the University of Rochester School of Medicine
and Professor Tsuguyoshi Suzuki of the School of Medicine, University of Tokyo,
Japan. The seminar will be held in Tokyo, August 1-3, l990. The meeting will
bring together scientists to evaluate new concepts on environmental transport of
mercury and its mechanisms of toxicity. The problems associated with mercury
pollution of the food chain and potential human health effects of mercury
ingestion are of concern in both countries. The agenda includes topics ranging
from environmental fate, through biotransformation, mechanisms, and organ-
specific toxicity, to clinical aspects of human intoxication. All the
participants, both Japanese and American, are internationally recognized experts
in their fields. Previous meetings involving U.S. and Japanese researchers
helped advance the understanding of mercury toxicity in both countries. The
organizers expect this meeting to have a similar impact.
