Spectroscopic studies of negative molecular ions are proposed using a negative
ion beam and a coaxial infrared laser beam from a color center laser.
Vibrational-rotational transitions are induced between the internal states of
the ion, and the excited ionic state autodetaches producing a fast (keV) neutral
which is then detected. It is proposed to measure the vibrational-rotational
transition of negative ions with sufficient resolution to observe hyperfine
structure, and detect metastable states in the autodetachment continuum. It is
also proposed to perform photodetachment studies of atomic anions near
threshold, measuring the electron affinity of the atom and testing the range of
validity of the Wigner law for the behavior of the cross section near threshold.
The results are relevant to spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, and to studies of
laboratory and terrestrial plasmas.
