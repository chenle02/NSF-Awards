This study is a theoretical investigation of the self-focusing instability
driven by high power radio waves in the ionosphere. Self focusing results from
localized changes in ionospheric properties produced when a high power radio
wave at certain frequencies is transmitted into the ionosphere. Self focusing
describes the tendency for the radio waves to be focused by the resulting
spatial variations. The goal of the study is to understand the role of non-ideal
effects present in the experimental configuration. These include density
inhomogeneities, finite pump size, plasma flow, and the irregular speckle patter
of the beam intensity. Analytical and numerical techniques will be used to study
the nonlinear evolution of the self-focusing instability in the presence of
coherent structures or random inhomogeneities in two and three dimensions. The
computational results will be compared with available experimental data and will
be used to plan future ionospheric modification experiments. The results will
improve our fundamental understanding of a basic physical process that occurs
when high power radiowaves propagate through collisional or collisionless
plasmas.
