This research will be conducted in several areas of probability and ergodic
theory: 1) Construction and fundamental properties of Gibbs states on sequence
spaces with countable alphabets; 2) applications to dynamical systems with
countable symbolic dynamics, e.g., geodesic flows on noncompact manifolds and
conformal dynamical systems with parabolic points; 3) related problems
concerning statistical regularities of orbits in flows; and 4) temporal and
spatial growth in branching diffusion processes and branching random walks. This
research is a blend of statistical theory, dynamical systems, and ergodic
theory. There is a broad class of dynamical systems for which the well-developed
machinery of symbolic dynamics is available. This class is characterized by the
fact that the associated symbolic dynamics needs only a finite alphabet (so one
has to deal with finite state Markov processes). This research extends this
class to those systems for which an infinitely countable alphabet becomes
necessary and develops the corresponding machinery. This will provide the tools
for obtaining new results about the clustering of orbits at limit sets and about
the statistics of closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. The outcome of this
work will be to unite many known results which were won by very different
methods, so unifying, thus simplifying, areas with quite separate results.
