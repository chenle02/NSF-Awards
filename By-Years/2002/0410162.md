Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A travel grant ($24,750) is recommended
for 30 U.S. chemical engineering professors to participate in the International
Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Symposium on&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Control
of Chemical Processes (ADCHEM 2003), Jan. 11-14, 2004 in Hong Kong. An
allocation of $750 per person will be made for partial airfare or registration
fee support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Process control has been a fundamental
research area and an enabling technology for efficient chemical processing and
manufacturing. On the other hand, the globalization in chemical and material
processing has brought fierce competition for the U.S. chemical manufacturers to
outperform in the global economic environment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad
impact of the project is to help US academicians and graduate students to
participate in this international conference to facilitate their scientific and
intellectual exchange with the international community. It is expected that the
trip will help US academic researchers and graduate students assess the status
of research and development around the world and thus better position themselves
in the control area.&lt;br/&gt;
