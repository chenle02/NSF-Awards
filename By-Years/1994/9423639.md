9423639 Perry This research project analyzes, within the framework of pluralist
theory, the impact that black political participation has had on the
governmental allocation of benefits to blacks in 14 U. S. cities for the period
1945-1994. The study provides a comparative longitudinal analysis of the impact
of black political participation on the governmental allocation of benefits to
blacks in these 14 cities and examines the value of pluralist theory for
explaining the observe impact. Methodologically, the study employs pooled time
series analysis to examine the relationship between black political
participation and the governmental allocation of benefits to blacks over the
50-year time frame of the study. Multiple regression will be used to determine
how much of the variance in the governmental allocation of benefits to blacks is
explained by black political participation, at specific time points (one year
time points), as compared to other independent variables which may also affect
the governmental allocation of benefits to blacks. This project should
substantially enhance our understanding about black politics and urban politics.
