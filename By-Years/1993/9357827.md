9357827 Lee This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Jay H. Lee under
the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Program. The objective of
this research is to devise an integrated modelling/estimation and control
technique suitable for complex chemical plant operations. The three key areas of
process control: modelling, estimation, and control, and interdependent and need
to be studied on common grounds. A synergistic framework will be developed that
can be readily applied in practice. Nonlinearity, model uncertainty, adaptivity,
and operational ease will be addressed within a common framework. The PI plans
to use Model Predictive Control (MPC) as the flexible framework for these
issues. The theory will be applied to devising control schemes for a pulp
digester and a 20 tray bubble-cap distillation column. Ultimately it is planned
to expand the application areas to include electrochemical processes such as
fuel cells and batteries.
