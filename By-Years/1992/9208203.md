In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, William Chupka of Yale University will study the spectroscopy and
dynamics of small molecules using multiphoton techniques. The interaction of
electronically excited states with dissociative and ionization continua will be
studied with emphasis on the gerade states of molecular oxygen, which have the
same symmetry as the ground state and hence are not connected to it by a single
electric-dipole transition. Selected ion-molecule reactions will also be studied
using ions prepared in pure vibrational states. %%% The proposed studies will
use multiple laser techniques to excite, probe, and ionize isolated gas-phase
molecules in order to obtain information useful for understanding and predicting
the dynamics and interactions of many important systems, such as gas discharges.
These experiments can also be used to derive important information on molecular
oxygen states that are important in atmospheric processes, yet which are
difficult to investigate in the laboratory.
