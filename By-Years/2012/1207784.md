The project aims to study analytically and numerically some central problems
arising in the study of invisibility cloaking for acoustic and electromagnetic
waves. There has been significant attention in the scientific community in the
last few years on invisibility for electromagnetic and other types of waves. The
main goal of this project is to develop and analyze practical cloaking schemes
under various circumstances, and to understand the cloaking phenomena. The main
tools used are analysis and computation. Specifically, the proposed research
will be devoted to the following four problems. The first one is to study the
regularized approximate cloaking for the full system of Maxwell's equations via
the transformation optics approach. Sharp estimates will be derived in assessing
cloaking performances under various practical circumstances. The second problem
is on the design and analysis of novel cloaking schemes including partial
cloaking and on the implementation of isotropic cloaking medium obtained by
inverse-homogenization theory. The third problem is to understand the
invisibility cloaking from an optimization viewpoint by minimizing the
scattering of the waves. This will also gives clues to what is the borderline
between visibility and invisibility. The final problem is to develop effective
and efficient numerical methods to numerically study cloaking. These problems
present interesting challenges from both the analytical and computational points
of view.

Research on invisibility cloaking has the potential for many civil and
industrial applications, such as in medical surgery, wireless communications,
air flight and space exploration etc. However, it presents many challenges both
theoretically and in practical implementation due to the singular and unstable
structures of the suggested blueprints for cloaking. The solution of the
proposed problems would provide theoretical recipes for the construction of
practical cloaking devices. Moreover, the mathematical understanding of
invisibility cloaking will on the one hand offer a different way than the
transformation-optics approach to achieve cloaking, and on the other hand
provide important implications for inverse problems involving reconstructing
electromagnetic objects. The analytical and computational techniques developed
in this project are widely applicable to other electromagnetic phenomena. Some
of the ideas developed in this project will be included into a graduate level
class. The proposer also plans to advice and train graduate students in this
challenging field.
