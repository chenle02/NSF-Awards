An upper division laboratory course based on some of the Nobel Prizes awarded
during the past decade will be developed. This replaces existing Modern Physics
Laboratories which use antiquated equipment and are based on pre-1950's physics.
The major new equipment includes a closed-cycle low temperature system, a
scanning tunneling microscope, a multichannel analyzer, an EPR spectrometer, an
ultra-high vacuum chamber, an Auger spectrometer, and YAG and dye lasers. This
equipment will be utilized with existing equipment in the development of
experiments appropriate for undergraduates based on the 1987 Nobel Prize for
High Temperature Superconductivity; the 1986 Prize for the Scanning-Tunneling
Microscope; the 1983 Prize for Nuclear Reactions and Nucleosynthesis; the 1981
prizes for Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear Optics, and Laser Spectroscopy; and
the 1977 Prize for the Quantum Nature of Solids. The product will be new, up-to-
date, exciting experiments for majors in physics that are "transportable" to
other institutions.
