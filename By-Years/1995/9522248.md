ABSRACT CTS-9522248 Performed metal clusters will be exploited to produce probes
ideally suited for service as coherent sources for the fields-emission of
electrons and probes capable of determining the morphology as well as the
elastic compliance of delicate nanostructures. These probes will be incorporated
into two prototype instruments: (1) a low-energy electron microscope for
obtaining atomic resolution images of nanoscale objects and (2) a scanning force
microscope capable of nanoscale lateral resolution and of measuring the elastic
compliance of nanostructures. ***
