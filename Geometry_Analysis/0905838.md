The main projects of the proposed research include: boundary rigidity and
related inverse problems, minimal fillings, asymptotic geometry of tori and
area-minimizing surfaces in normed spaces; study of partially hyperbolic
diffeomorphisms; conjugation-invariant quasi-norms; ``area structures and
spaces". They are aiming at solving a number of long-standing and important
problems, and formulating new problems and new directions of research. The four
projects that form the core of the proposal have already yielded a number of
important results. Among the problems the proposal is aimed at are Michel's
Conjecture that simple metrics are boundary rigid, Pu's conjecture on the
filling area of the circle, Busemann's Conjecture that flats in normed spaces
are area-minimizers, classifications of partially-hyperbolic systems, studying
``area structures", finding geometric (conjugation-invariant) and ``non-
dynamical" (not asymptotic) invariants of diffeomorphisms preserving certain
structures, and various generalizations of the E. Hopf Conjecture. Most of the
conjectures and directions of research suggested in the proposal grew from ideas
and methods developed by the PI in his previous research, and projects described
in the proposal continue the research resulted in solving them.

Many topics of the proposed research have rather feasible relation to applied
science. The Boundary Rigidity Problem and related Inverse Problems are
motivated by important problems in geophysics and medical imaging. To visualize
that, imagine that one wants to find out what the Earth is made of. More
generally, one wants to find out what is inside a solid body made of different
materials (in other words, properties of the medium change from point to point).
The speed of sound depends on the material. One can "tap" at some points of the
surface of the body and "listen when the sound gets to other points". The
question is if this information is enough to determine what is inside. The
proposed research already resulted in the first result of this kind for a
reasonably general case (with the restriction that the properties of the
material do not change to much from point to point), and there is a cautions
hope to handle the general case. The physical analogs of large-scale invariants
of periodic metrics are macroscopic properties of periodic media (such as a
crystal substance), and one wants to relate these properties to microscopic
characteristics; similarly, study of partially hyperbolic systems, geodesic
flows, and geometric complexity may result in better understanding of
(stability) of certain models in thermodynamics, biology, sociology, and
physics, especially when dealing with imprecise data.
