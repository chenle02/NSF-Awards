Dust changes our view of astronomical objects. It interacts with light from
distant stars to make them more dim. Dust also radiates heat, which astronomers
can see with millimeter and radio telescopes. Early galaxies contained more
dust, and that impacts our understanding of how galaxies form and change with
time. The investigator will use multiple telescopes to understand how dust in
the most distant galaxies affects the cosmos. Undergraduate students from
underrepresented backgrounds will be trained in related astronomy research.

Dust makes up a negligible fraction of the mass budget of galaxies (<1%) and yet
has transformative effect on their integrated spectra. Its efficient absorption
of starlight in the ultraviolet and optical results in half of all extragalactic
light in the Universe being thermally re-radiated in the far-infrared and
millimeter (FIR/mm). Yet galaxies' thermal dust emission is poorly understood
relative to stellar emission processes. The importance of dust to a wide range
of astrophysical processes -- from its role in the condensation of cold
molecular clouds to form stars, the coagulation of planetesimals, or the
reprocessing of starlight at longer wavelengths -- makes it a crucial ingredient
of the Universe requiring detailed observations. This project will use a diverse
range of observational FIR/mm datasets to comprehensively characterize the dust
emission of galaxies across cosmic time. Core concepts of this research will be
used to bolster the retention of under-represented students in astrophysics
careers through support of summer research and innovative equity-focused
pedagogical activities.
