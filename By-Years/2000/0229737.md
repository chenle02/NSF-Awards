This research will examine the effects of anthropogenic activity and global
warming on freshwater and organic carbon input to the Arctic Ocean from the Lena
River for the last 50-150 years. Additionally, it will reconstruct the late
Holocene freshwater and organic carbon discharges for the past 2,000 years. The
overarching goal will be to assess impacts of late Holocene climate change on
watershed-river-upper ocean linkages. The research will obtain a broad suite of
observations, including bottom sediment and water column properties, from the
Lena River delta and will use these to parameterize the historical data. Age
dating will be done using radioactive decay methods to produce a reliable annual
to decadal age model, microfossils from sediment cores will be analyzed to
reconstruct the Lena River's fluvial dynamics, and palynological studies will
recover information about past environmental change in the Lena watershed.
Results will be correlated with tree-ring records to generate information on
arctic/subarctic humidity and precipitation. Globally, the results will
contribute to understanding contributions of the Russian arctic rivers to global
hydrologic and carbon cycles.
