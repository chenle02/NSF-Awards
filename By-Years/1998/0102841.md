Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Mathematical Models of Materials with
Multi-Stability at the Micro-Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to study rate
sensitivity of the prototypical discrete analogs of active materials. At the
micro-level, active materials can be viewed as complex assemblages of multi-
stable, molecular size devices; large deformations are then due to the switching
between different locally stable configurations. At the macro-level the
switching leads to the energy flux into smaller scales and &lt;br/&gt;associated
dissipation. In this project we focus on optimization of energy transduction
between the scales in multi-stable materials and specifically consider behavior
of these systems in the situations where fluctuations are relevant and the size
effect can not be neglected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project we
study the dynamic behavior of active materials which include shape-memory,
magnetostrictive and ferromagnetic alloys, transformation-toughened ceramics and
materials, exhibiting controllable distributed micro-damage. Biological examples
of active materials are provided by muscles and other distributed protein
systems. The goal of the project is to understand the mechanics of dissipation
and active force generation in these materials which may open ways to an actual
construction of the artificial molecular size motors. Specifically we
&lt;br/&gt;are interested in developing prototypes for ultra-small objects,
which can carry load and be self propelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date:
