in Computational Geometry: algorithms and properties for proximity and
triangulations. Exchange visits with a Romanian scientist will provide
opportunity for collaborative research in computational geometry. Research in
proximity problems and triangulations will be enhanced by a visit of the senior
American scientist to the host Romanian university and a subsequent visit from
the guest scientist to the United States. ***
