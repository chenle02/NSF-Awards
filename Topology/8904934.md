8904934 Handel The principal investigator will work on a pair of related
projects, one concerning automorphisms of the free group and the other
concerning the dynamics of surface diffeomorphisms. The first is a continuation
of joint work with Mladen Bestvina. They hope to show that the group of outer
automorphisms of the free group of rank n satisfies the Tits Alternative. They
also hope to complete the characterization of geometric automorphisms that was
begun earlier. The second project involves the computer implementation of
algorithms developed earlier to determine the Thurston canonical form for an
element of the mapping class group of a compact surface. Particular emphasis
will be placed on the genus zero case, the goal being to understand the dynamics
of a diffeomeophism f of the two-sphere by studying the canonical forms
associated to f outside a finite invariant set.
