Professor Williams, collaborating with Professor Rutledge of the Colorado State
University, will participate in a thunderstorm experiment near Darwin, Australia
between November 1988 and February 1989. This award will allow the two principal
investigators to operate the MIT 5 cm radar and a network of 10 coronal point
stations in the field. The joint operation of the MIT radar and the NOAA TOGA
(Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere) 5 cm radar will provide, for the first
time, dual-Doppler observations in the tropics. The primary objective of
Professors Williams and Rutledge's research is to better understand the dynamics
and electrification of deep tropical convection and mesoscale weather systems
and compare it with what we know of in the middle latitudes. Since the field
phase corresponds to the winter monsoon period in northern Australia, this work
will also allow a comparison of the behavior of lightning between oceanic
storms, prominent during monsoon onset, and continental storms, prominent during
monsoon breaks.
