This proposal explores the design of a low-power and high-performance analog
hardware system capable of solving Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem which is
at the heart of many decision, scheduling, error-correction and cyber security
applications. Since SAT belongs to a well-known family of hard decision problems
in computer science, an efficient solution would have a profound impact in all
of computational sciences, engineering, and societal applications. The project
builds on close collaborations among theoreticians and hardware designers to
create opportunities to cross-pollinate research areas that traditionally have
had little intersection in this context. The project will allow the PIs to
incorporate new research discoveries into relevant coursework, and offer
research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including those
from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed effort will
study the potential of analog hardware based on some related deterministic
Continuous Time Dynamical System (CTDS) in the form of coupled ordinary
differential equations, which have been recently introduced for the study of the
SAT problem. The CTDS performs gradient descent on an energy function, which
itself changes in time, coupled to the performance of the dynamics through
exponentially driven auxiliary variables. The project will study systematically
the question of whether and by how much a CTDS based analog hardware SAT solver
can outperform digital SAT solvers in terms of performance and energy
efficiency. It will also advance the understanding of the impact of hardware
induced noises on analog SAT solvers. In summary, the project attempts to
provide insights into the relationship between the nonlinear dynamical system
properties of the analog solver and the computational hardness of constraint
satisfaction problems, and thus lay the foundation for analog hardware designs
for CTDS solvers, as well as that for SAT solvers.
