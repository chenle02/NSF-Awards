The Division of Chemistry, the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering,
Environmental, and Transport Systems, the Division of Physics, and the Division
of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation jointly fund this project by
the GEM Consortium. The GEM Underrepresented Minority Internships in STEM
Program is designed to build a diverse workforce in STEM fields such as
chemistry, engineering, and physics, by focusing on connecting underrepresented
(e.g., African American, Hispanic American/Latino, and Native American) graduate
students to leading industries in the United States (US). The program provides
this group of emerging talented graduate students with knowledge, mentoring,
professional development, and hands-on training that will allow them to be
competitive for leadership positions in these industries.

Specifically, this project will allow the National GEM Consortium (GEM) to
implement the GEM Internships in STEM Program by deploying the partnerships that
have been developed among GEM, chemistry and other related physical science
industries, higher education institutions, and the National Science Foundation
(NSF) around mutual goals for increasing the diversity of talent and leadership
in the national STEM workforce. This project allows GEM to leverage earlier NSF
awards that have supported initial design and implementation of an internship
program focused on building pathways to careers in STEM and more recently
specifically into chemistry related fields. The project will support 89 graduate
students over a three-year period and create better alignment between demand in
the workforce and supply of diverse talent.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
