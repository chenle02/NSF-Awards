9410385 Throne The research proposed in this application is concerned with a
recently developed generalized eigensystem finite element technique for the
inverse problem of electrocardiography will be extended, compared with other
existing methods and validated by comparison with experimental results.
Preliminary results indicate that the new generalized eigensystem method
performs better than existing approaches on a previously reported eccentric
spheres model problem with anterior and posterior spherical cap sources. This
generalized eigensystem technique will first be applied to the inhomogeneous
eccentric spheres problem and then to a realistic human torso model with
realistic human epicardial potentials. With both models the effects of errors in
estimating the conductivities, errors in the anisotropic properties, and
geometrical errors will be examined and compared with previously reported
methods. In addition, the techniques will be validated and compared with
experimental results from an isolated rabbit heart preparation. Computational
issues such as improved spectral finite elements, robustness, accuracy, and
efficiency will be considered. ***
