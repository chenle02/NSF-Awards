The Museum of Northern Arizona proposes to initiate a two-part project in
natural-science education on the Colorado Plateau, with a strong focus on the
Native Americans of the region, and especially their children. The project
involves, one, the installation of modern geology and biology exhibits that are
highly relevant for understanding the natural history of an important area and,
two, the development of two closely associated new educational outreach
programs, one based on well designed kits for school use and the other involving
the training of teachers in the use of those kits.
