Certain highly-efficient gene conversion events have been shown to be dependent
on a new class of "mobility endonucleases". Representing a minimum of three
types of DNA-cleavage proteins based on their cleavage patterns and amino acid
sequences, these endonucleases are found in association with group I introns,
promoting conversion of intron-minus alleles to intron-plus. Sequence analysis
of the mitochondrial genome of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina
predicts an unprecedented number of such endonucleases (10-30), providing an
opportunity to 1) address the frequency of mobility endonucleases within the
mitochondria of Podospora, 2) characterize selected endonucleases in regard to
their substrate requirements and specificity and 3) study the expression and
regulation of these proteins and their function in the mitochondria. The
Podospora system additionally provides unique opportunities to study the
potential involvement of mobility endonucleases in the phenomena of
mitochondrially-related senescence and horizontal gene transfer. %%% The
objective of this proposal is to 1) characterize and compare a selected
endonucleases candidate gene in Podospora with a highly similar candidate in
Neurospora, utilizing a variety of molecular and genetic techniques and assays,
2) expand this system to study other putative endonucleases, and 3) develop
methods to evaluate their role in sentence, the Podospora life cycle and
horizontal gene transfer.
