Although perfect randomized experiments are the gold-standard for drawing causal
inferences about the effects of treatments, they are often impossible to conduct
to address important questions. Limitations of randomized experiments include
ethical considerations with human subjects, length of time to implement, and
complications such as noncompliance. Recent work for drawing causal inferences
in non-randomized studies that combines both statistical and traditional
econometric approaches in creative ways shows great promise for building new and
important bridges between the perfectly controlled randomized experiment and the
uncontrolled observational study. Continuing this work should lead to important
new techniques for the analysis of imperfect studies for causal effects.
Substantial current applications include inference for the effectiveness of
`choice` programs relative to standard programs for elementary school education.
