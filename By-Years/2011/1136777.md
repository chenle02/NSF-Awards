This award provides support for participants to the international conference on
Discrete Simulation of Fluid Dynamics, held August 8-12, 2011 at North Dakota
State University. This conference provides a forum to discuss novel numerical
methods for fluid flow and their applications that are derived from microscopic
models. The thematic focus of the meeting will be ?Computational Soft Condensed
Matter?. The aim of the meeting is to bring together experts in simulation
methods with experimentalists working on systems that would benefit from
computational approaches. The numerical methods represented at the DSFD meetings
include lattice gas automata, the lattice Boltzmann equation, discrete velocity
methods, dissipative particle dynamics, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, direct
simulation Monte Carlo, stochastic rotation dynamics, molecular dynamics, and
hybrid methods. This grant provides support primarily for underfunded
participants, including minority groups from local Tribal Colleges.
