8901610 Wimp This group research effort is aimed at discovering and implementing
techniques for the resolution of outstanding problems in asymptotic
combinatorial analysis. The project will utilize talents in several disciplines:
combinatorics, asymptotic analysis, special functions, and related fields. In
addition, it will aim to create an atmosphere of enhanced educational activity
in the subject area through the involvement of graduate students in research.
The research effort itself will consist, basically, of two objectives: (1) The
discovery and description of combinatorial relationships, including equations
(difference, differential, integral, functional) satisfied by combinatorial
quantities. (2) The development and application of techniques to determine the
asymptotic behavior of these quantities.
