This award supports the research of Professor J. Hoffstein to work in
automorphic functions. He intends to work on obtaining the symmetric cube
L-series of a cusp form on GL(2) as a Rankin Selberg integral. He also intends
to study non-unique Whittaker models of theta functions on the n-fold cover of
GL(2). Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the
nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized
that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic
nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
