This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "Ohio River Analysis Meetings (ORAM) 2017-2019," the first
event of which will be held March 25-26, 2017, on the campus of the University
of Cincinnati. The 2018 meeting will take place in Spring 2018 at the University
of Kentucky, and the meeting will return to the University of Cincinnati in
Spring 2019. For additional information consult the conference website:
https://math.uc.edu/ORAM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this annual regional
conference series, entering its seventh year in 2017, is to stimulate scientific
exchange and to foster the area of analysis in general, and the field of partial
differential equations in particular. The meetings feature invited lectures by
distinguished mathematicians and parallel sessions for contributed talks, mostly
by early-career mathematicians. Anticipated plenary speakers for the 2017 event
include the following: Alex Iosevich, Andrea Nahmod, Stefanie Petermichl,
Christopher Sogge, and Jeremy Tyson.
