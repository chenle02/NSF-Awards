This project involves investigation of selected oxygenated and nitrogen-
containing organic compounds through laboratory and theoretical photochemical
studies, and atmospheric observations. The studies will involve (1) laboratory
quantification of photolysis quantum yields of peroxyacetyl nitrate, and
hydroxylmethyl hydroperoxide in the near-infrared spectral region along with ab
initio calculations of the strengths of the overtone transitions of these
species as well as peroxynitrous acid (HOONO), (2) laboratory measurement of
absorption cross sections and photolysis quantum yields for a number of
aldehydes in the ultraviolet spectral region, (3) measurement of atmospheric
peroxy nitrous acid (HOONO) and acetaldehyde using ground-based solar spectra
along with laboratory measurement of infrared spectra of these species, (4)
measurements of the isotopic fractionation of molecular hydrogen formed in the
solar photolysis of formaldehyde, and (5) experiments to quantify the hydroxyl
radical product yield from the reaction of molecular oxygen with vinoxy
radicals. Together, these studies will improve understanding of the atmospheric
fate of organic oxygenated and nitrogen-containing species, and will lead to
enhanced capability to predict their impact on free radical, ozone and aerosol
abundances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include
improving our understanding of atmospheric processes related to ozone and
aerosol formation, and thus leading to better strategies for improvement of air
quality. This research will also provide education and training for graduate and
undergraduate students, and will be enhanced by its collaborative nature
involving chemists, geochemists and physicists.&lt;br/&gt;
