The PI's requests funding to design, construct, and test a new instrument setup
that will allow measurements of air-water gas exchange in shallow-water marine
environments. This effort will benefit a large and broad group of aquatic
scientists who use gas exchange estimates in their ecosystem studies. In
addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in high-frequency
data acquisition with complex instruments and analysis of "big data" produced
within this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's will design, construct, and
test a new instrument setup that will allow this new application of the aquatic
eddy covariance technique in shallow-water marine environments. This will be
accomplished by applying their aquatic eddy covariance technique right below the
air-water interface to measure air-water gas exchange. If successful, the new
instrument setup will significantly improve the accuracy of gas exchange
measurements for shallow-water marine systems, and as important, enhance the
temporal and spatial resolution of these measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
