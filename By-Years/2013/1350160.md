Robots are an increasingly common presence in human environments, working
alongside people in factories, hospitals, and military field operations.
However, today people must change how they work to accommodate robots in their
workspace. This poses a significant barrier to adoption of robot technology by
creating inefficiencies. This project provides an integrated research and
educational approach to develop intelligent robotic technologies that more
seamlessly integrate with human work environments.

The technical approach translates qualitative and quantitative insights from
human studies into explicit computational models, and exploits these models to
redesign robot algorithms for learning, decision-making, and control. The
research effort specifically investigates three types modifications to robot
behavior: (1) modifying robot motion planning using anticipatory signals of
human motion, (2) customizing robot task plans using statistical models of human
task execution, and (3) inferring and applying human domain expertise to
expedite automated planning for mixed human-robot teams. Human subject
experimentation is planned to assess ease-of-interaction, worker trust, and task
performance, and the approach is validated using metrics to quantitatively
assess the degree to which a robot's behavior preserves natural human workflow.
By designing robot autonomy that minimizes disruption to human workflow, the
approach supports graceful transitions from robotic work back to human work and
vice versa.
