This award provides two-thirds of the funding required for the purchase of
computer hardware and software that will be installed and maintained in the
Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State
University. The University is committed to providing the remaining funding

the Global Positioning System of satellites for precise geodetic measurements.
