The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) and Cornell University propose
to organize an international symposium of leading scientists and engineers in
the field of nanotechnology from US and Japan. The meeting will be held at
Cornell University in Jan. 2003. Operating in a workshop environment, key issues
in the development of tools and metrology for nanotechnology will be explored in
an interdisciplinary environment that will be guided by the major research
successes of this field.

Many interesting new nanoscale phenomena have been discovered in recent years,
with significant promise for impact on society. This promise has lead to
increased funding for nanotechnology including the National Nanotechnology
Initiative here in the US. However, the transition from a discovery to a
practical or even potentially practical device or process is a long one.
Appropriate tools and methods are critical to this transition. This includes
tools for fabrication, visualization, and characterization, as well as methods
and standards to assure repeatability and accuracy of fabrication and analysis.
Few of these tools and methods exist today.

Research Impact The field of nanotechnology is unique among the scientific
frontiers in its breadth and its extensive interdisciplinary content. This
symposium will bring together leaders in the varied fields to explore common
phenomena, common requirements, and common techniques with the intent of
expanding innovation in nanotechnology tools and methods.

Broader Impact of Program: While primarily intended to explore the development
of tools and techniques for nanotechnology, a significant component will be to
increase interaction and collaboration between scientists and engineers in the
US and Japan. Scientists from Japan and the United States are among the research
leaders in the field of nanotechnology. Similarly, both countries lead the world
in the development of instrumentation for fabrication and characterization at
all scales. There is thus much potential for the development of new tools and
new methodologies to be gained by an international interdisciplinary workshop in
this area.

Tremendous developments in nanotechnology have occurred in both the US and Japan
in the last 5 years. This workshop is an opportunity to share some of those
developments and to explore the subsequent requirements for improved tools and
metrology in nanotechnology.
