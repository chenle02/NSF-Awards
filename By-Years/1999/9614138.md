96-14138 Merrill The PI proposes a theoretical study to determine the structures
and energy minimum states for pseudo single domain (PSD) grains, in which stable
magnetization in rocks typically resides. Preliminary analyses show that there
are local energy minimum states even for the small grains exhibiting magnetic
vortex structures, and that for a limited range of sizes and shapes, the global
energy minimum state is that in which the magnetization is along the shortest
dimension of the grain. This feature is contrary to what is expected and
described widely in the community, and it has important ramifications for
inclination anomalies, anisotropy, and for the origins of remanent
magnetizations. ***
