The investigator proposes to use FTNMR to probe the anisotropy of the
intermolecular potential. Because previous work in this field has been
restricted to certain conditions, the PI is interested in extending the range
for the cross sections above 400 K so as to obtain more information about the
energetic region high on the repulsive wall of the intermolecular potential as
well as to extend the lower limit into the condensed phase. In conjunction with
the condensed phase work, the PI proposes to carry out dynamic simulations in
order to model the results since, by using dynamic calculations it is possible
to change various physical parameters while keeping the potential function the
same.
