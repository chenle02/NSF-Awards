This research is investigating the inherent performance problems associated with
object-oriented code execution. Traces are being captured from a number of
object-oriented programming environments. A workload Characterization is being
performed to identify the underlying problems presented by this new programming
model. Architectural changes are then proposed to improve the execution
performance of object-oriented code. This research is investigating
architectural changes to the hardware that will improve performance across all
programming environments. As more and more software is developed using object-
oriented languages, this research will have a direct impact on accelerating the
performance of future applications. The educational part of this project is
concerned with making improvements in the Computer Engineering curriculum,
student advising tools, classroom computer aids, and undergraduate research
courses.
