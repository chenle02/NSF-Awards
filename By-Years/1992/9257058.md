This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include a study of the interactions between
optically trapped atoms. Excitation of the cold atoms by tunable lasers during
collisions will give detailed information about the unique dynamics of these
excited-state collisions. Modification of interatomic forces by non linear and
quantum-optical effects will be investigated in optically thick trapped-atom
samples.
