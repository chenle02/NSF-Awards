The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) process technology has matured to
the point where it is possible to fabricate a chip with both electrical and
mechanical pomponents on it. However, tools and design methodologies are
lacking. This worksho is to bring together design researchers from the VLSI CAD
and MEMS design fields to discuss and develop ideas for a new design methodology
for combined MEMS/VLSI structures.
