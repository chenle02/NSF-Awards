This grant addresses the technical and policy barriers confronted by the
semiconductor industry in creating next generation memory devices. The
objectives of the grant are to: (I) enable high-volume manufacturing of
atomically-precise, defect-free patterns made from synthetic DNA, (II) self-
report defects using an in-line optical technique to monitor the quality control
of patterns during high-volume production, and (III) create a policy framework
that guides public-private collaborations in scalable nanomanufacturing.

If successful, solving these industrial challenges will help: (A) validate
molecular self-assembly as a cost-effective manufacturing process for scalable
nanomanufacturing, (B) establish novel process techniques for scalable
nanomanufacturing, (C) overcome critical roadblocks in semiconductor device
fabrication at the nanoscale, and (D) address societal implications of the
large-scale production and use of DNA as an engineered nanomaterial. The
research will also advance the discovery, innovation, and overall knowledge-
based prosperity of science and engineering in Idaho, an EPSCoR State.
