9320723 Rose This grant will provide funds for the study of the influence of
environment on the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies. Recently
completed research by the Principal Investigator and collaborators has
demonstrated a strong connection between the formation/evolution of galaxies in
clusters and the evolutionary state of the clusters themselves (i.e., existence
of cluster substructure and distribution of the associated hot intracluster
medium). It is the goal of this research program to better elucidate the
interplay between the process of galaxy formation/evolution and the
formation/evolution of clusters of galaxies and their associated substructure
and hot ICM.
