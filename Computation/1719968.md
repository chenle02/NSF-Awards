Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematical models in science
and engineering. The field of algebraic geometry, which studies solutions to
such systems, has the potential to improve techniques for practical numerical
investigations of these systems. This research project aims to apply algebraic
geometry to advance numerical algorithms for solving systems of polynomial
equations. The research includes developing new homotopy continuation methods
that exploit the action of the monodromy group, random walk homotopies, and
hybrid algorithms for solving sparse systems. The new theoretical framework and
algorithms will be implemented in open-source software.

Homotopy continuation algorithms are a backbone of modern nonlinear algebra, the
art of solving systems of equations that are not necessarily linear. The main
strength of these algorithms is in approximate computation, which often is much
faster than classical exact techniques and allows tackling problems in high-
dimensional spaces. Homotopy continuation methods solve a problem A in three
steps: (1) look for a problem B in the same family of problems as A, but with a
simpler structure; (2) construct solutions to that simpler problem B; (3)
connect A and B with a homotopy, that is, a continuous deformation, and track
how solutions of B morph into solutions of A. This project aims to develop a
novel framework for basic homotopy continuation routines. One major point is
that randomizing numerical algorithms to a greater extent makes them even faster
and more robust without a costly increase in computational precision. Another
point is that, looking to minimize computational costs, we should invent new
hybrid methods intertwining exact and approximate techniques originating in
different areas of mathematics. The symbiosis of symbolic, combinatorial, and
numerical ideas is the key to the new methods for solving sparse systems. Tools
from tropical geometry and numerical algebraic geometry will deliver a
generalization of polyhedral homotopy algorithms and lead to a faster polynomial
system solver that benefits from a tighter solution count.
