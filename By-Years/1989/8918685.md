The northern Red Sea is a unique region that is presently underdoing the
transition from continental rifting to oceanic seafloor spreading. Recent work
has led to a general understanding of the structural framework of the region;
however, there is still a basic disagreement over the interpretation of that
framework, and, in particular the possible presence and distribution of oceanic
crust is disputed. The principal investigator therefore sought out and obtained
access to the geophysical data from a comprehensive and hitherto proprietary
geophysical survey of the critical area between 25 & 26 N. Study of this data
will allow the controversy to be directly addressed and will allow predictions
made by the various models for the evolution of the Red Sea to be tested in an
area where the geophysical and geological framework is presently not known.
