Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9803258 Principal Investigator: Frederick Wilhelm

Frederick Wilhelm proposes to work on three problems. The first is a program for
creating new examples of Riemannian metrics that have lots of positive
curvatures. The metrics are on certain fiber bundles. The program seems
particularly likely to succeed for three sphere bundles over the four sphere.
Second he will work on proving his new conjecture---that the dimension of the
image of a Riemannian submersion of a complete, positively curved manifold is
strictly greater than half of the dimension of the domain. Third he will try to
complete the classification of Riemannian submersions of round spheres.

The three problems all address the general question of how does the curvature of
a space effect its geometry and topology? Roughly speaking, curvature is what
determines the trigonometry of a space. For example one can prove that the
surface of the earth is curved with out looking at it from outer space. To do
this have two people start at the north pole and travel in any two directions
that are perpendicular to each other. If they travel at the same speed, they
will eventually meet again at the south pole. On the other hand, if the same
experiment were conducted on a flat world, the two people would never meet. They
would keep getting further apart, even if they never reached the "edge" of the
world. The main justification for studying this general question is that it
seems intrinsically beautiful, intriguing, and natural. It has a long history,
that dates back to the 1930's work of H. Hopf, Morse, Schoenberg, Meyers, and
Synge.
