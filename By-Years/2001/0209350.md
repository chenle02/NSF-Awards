With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
John Toscano, of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University, is
studying the structure and reactivity of short-lived organic intermediates.
Professor Toscano will use the technique of time-resolved infrared spectroscopy,
combined with experimental and calculational studies, to examine the chemistry
of arylnitrenium ions, oxynitrenes, and oxynitrenium ions. The biologically
important reaction of arylnitrenium ions with guanine will be examined to
clarify mechanistic details. New photochemical precursors to oxynitrenes and
oxynitrenium ions will be developed, and the chemistry and spectroscopy of these
reactive intermediates will be elucidated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic chemical
reactions frequently proceed via the formation of relatively unstable
intermediate compounds of only fleeting existence. Such intermediates are also
involved in many biochemical reactions and play key roles in numerous processes,
including chemical carcinogenesis. By studying the formation, structure, and
reaction chemistry of reactive intermediates, one may obtain fundamental
information about the nature of chemical reactivity and potential leads for the
prevention of chemically-induced hazards such as carcinogenicity. Professor John
Toscano, of the Department of Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University, carries out
studies of chemical reactions using the tool of time-resolved infrared
spectroscopy, in which the powerful technique of infrared spectroscopy, which
can provide key information about the structure of organic compounds, is used to
follow the formation and disappearance of reactive intermediates during the
course of a chemical reaction.
