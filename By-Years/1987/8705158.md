This is a renewal of a study to examine trends in the number and quality of
technological innovations produced in U.S. industry. Innovations in two specific
fields, biotechnology and light-wave engineering, will be studied in terms of
both their number and their quality. These innovation trends will be related if
possible to productivity changes in the related industries. The project is
intended to provide indicators of U.S. performance in these important new
technologies and to add to the understanding of productivity trends by focusing
on the underlying technologies.
