This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
by Prof. David Reingold, which is aimed at elucidating features of electronic
interactions between atoms in a molecule which are not bonded to each other.
Organic chemists believe they have a sound understanding of electron sharing
between bonded carbon atoms. However, recent advances in the synthesis of
strained-ring organic molecules demonstrate gaps in our understanding of the
concepts of bonding and electron-sharing. This work is aimed at synthesizing and
exploring the chemistry of molecules which have significant electron density
between non-bonded atoms. Two different projects are planned. In the first, Dr.
Reingold plans to prepare a family of compounds which should provide a test of
the Goldstein-Hoffmann theory of through-space (longicyclic) conjugation. In the
second, Dr. Reingold will synthesize what could be the first bishomobenzene
derivative, a cyclopropasemibullvalene. On rearrangement, this should provide
the first planar, electronically unperturbed Ä±8!annulene.
