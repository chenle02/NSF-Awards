Software correctness is essential to avoid costly or
catastrophic&lt;br/&gt;failures in modern safety-critical systems, such as the
ones relied&lt;br/&gt;upon by NASA. Model checking is a verification technique
that checks&lt;br/&gt;the correctness of a system by exhaustively exploring all
of its&lt;br/&gt;possible behaviors. It has proven successful in the development
of&lt;br/&gt;hardware designs and is used by Intel and other major
hardware&lt;br/&gt;companies. Before model checking can significantly improve
the&lt;br/&gt;reliability of mission critical software, a number of basic
research&lt;br/&gt;problems must be addressed. The extraordinary complexity of
real&lt;br/&gt;systems results in an explosion in the possible behaviors that
need to&lt;br/&gt;be checked. The techniques devised to mitigate this problem
for&lt;br/&gt;hardware can also be applied to software; however, some of the
most&lt;br/&gt;successful ones, such as symbolic model checking, have
proven&lt;br/&gt;difficult to apply in this new domain.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary direction of this research is to adapt these
techniques to&lt;br/&gt;the task of checking concurrent software. Fundamental
changes to the&lt;br/&gt;algorithms are required due to the different
characteristics of&lt;br/&gt;hardware and software systems. Modern software
systems are often&lt;br/&gt;developed using object-oriented languages, such as
C++ and Java. While&lt;br/&gt;object-oriented languages ease the design phase,
they introduce&lt;br/&gt;additional challenges for verification. One important
characteristic&lt;br/&gt;of modern object-oriented software designs is the
dynamic creation of&lt;br/&gt;threads and objects. This research aims at
leveraging existing&lt;br/&gt;techniques, such as the partial-order reduction
and symbolic model&lt;br/&gt;checking, by extending them to address this
challenge.
