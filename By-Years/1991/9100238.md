Professor Jones will work on the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves. He intends
to study problems related to Iwasawa L- functions of l-adic representations. He
will also study equivariant cohomology with a view towards finding analogues of
flat duality theorems. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
