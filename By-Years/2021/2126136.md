This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop and launch
a new, commercially viable terahertz (THz) imaging technology initially targeted
at medical imaging applications. The prototype instrument uses THz reflective
imaging phenomenology, a technique that has been shown to efficiently
discriminate between healthy and diseased tissues. With a resolution of more
than 300x300 pixels, operation at between 10-30 frames per second, and a compact
form factor, the system is appropriate for medical environments such as cancer
surgeries, including glioblastoma resection. The THz camera will be a new
addition to the medical imaging market that has matured with x-ray, MRI, visible
and infrared technologies to reach $45 billion. This new instrument is enabled
by a large format sensor array that uses a low-cost manufacturing process
already implemented in a high-volume foundry. In addition to the medical
application, similar imaging systems can be used in security screening
applications ($2 billion market/year) such as passenger screening at airports.
More broadly, the underlying sensor technology can be adapted for use across the
extremely wide THz spectrum, which has implications for many industries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is primarily its
integration of both high resolution and high-speed aspects of THz imaging, as
these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated in a commercially viable form.
Previous demonstrations have either involved slow scanning systems that preclude
real time applications or cameras that target much higher bands of the THz
spectrum. The latter restriction stems from an inability to manufacture arrays
of large pixels to image at the longer THz wavelengths. Going beyond one of a
kind laboratory proof of concept experiments, the THz camera seeks to provide
resolution and frame update rates that are relevant to actual applications. The
commercial manufacturing viability of the sensing element may ensure that
applications beyond the initial medical market will be practical. The camera
will feature not only the high-resolution THz imaging near the 250-350 GHz
spectrum but also incorporate high-resolution visible and near-infrared cameras
that can complement the THz video, with trials being planned for hospital usage.
In addition to clinical usage scenarios, the imaging system can be adapted for
use in airport security and other screening applications, as portability and
ease of use will guide the demonstration system
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
