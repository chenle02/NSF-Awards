over a 56kbps line. Faculty and students at the schools benefit from access to
the resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In
addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other
institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides
partial support of the project for two years.
