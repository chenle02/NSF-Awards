A new method for the generation of inorganic: organic composites for Photonics
using Laser Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (LAMBE) will be developed.
Photonics, which involves the use of photons to acquire, process, store and
transmit information, is emerging as a new multidisciplinary frontier of science
and technology. These proposed novel composite photonic materials will combine
the high optical quality and environmental stability of inorganic oxides with
the large nonlinear optical coefficients of organic structures. The new
technique of generating these composites is highly unique in that it involves a
low temperature processing more suitable for sensitive organic materials. It
involves direct injection of an organic vapor into a molecular beam expansion of
the inorganic oxide produced by typical laser ablation. The mixed system is
subsequently deposited on the desired substrate. Films of optical waveguiding
quality will be produced using the proposed technique of laser assisted
molecular beam epitaxy, and the linear and nonlinear optical properties of these
films will be characterized.
