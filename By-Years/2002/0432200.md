This award represents continued partial support of the 2004 Technical Activities
Program of the Federal Facilities Council (FFC). The FFC is an element of the
Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) of the National
Research Council (NRC). Since 1953 the FFC and its predecessor organizations
have provided sponsoring agencies with a mechanism for jointly identifying and
addressing mutual problems and concerns regarding facilities and infrastructure.
The 2004 program supports convening three workshops: Investment in Federal
Facilities: Developing Common Approaches Across Stakeholder Agencies, Emerging
Information Technologies for Facilities Design and Management, and Quality
Assurance/Quality Control for Federal Facilities Projects; completing one
information study on Using Performance-Based Contracts and Incentives Clauses:
Federal Agencies' Experience; and conducting three forums: The Cost-
effectiveness of Building Protection Strategies, Security in Leased Federal
Facilities, and Experiences of Federal Facilities Management Organizations with
the A-76 Process. The 2004 program also provides administrative and technical
support for the FFC oversight committee and the six standing committees; Design
and Construction, Emerging Technologies, Operations and Maintenance,
Organizational Performance and Management, Physical Security and Hazard
Mitigation, and Project and Acquisition Management. This includes support for up
to 28 committee meetings with guest speakers, maintaining and enhancing
networking activities through the FFC Web site, and participating in industry
conferences and forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
