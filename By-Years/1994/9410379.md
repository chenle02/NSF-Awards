9410379 Baldwin On February 21, 1994, the National Technological University will
deliver the fifth annual Discover Engineering teleconference as part of
Engineers Week Celebration. This live teleconference is two-fold. First, the
program provides U.S. middle and high school students (and their teachers) with
an interesting insight into the work of engineers in a novel teleconference
setting. Secondly, the Discover Engineering telecast is the centerpiece of open
houses at many industrial, government and college locations. The telecast series
is central to many local activities wherein engineers welcome students and
teachers to the workplace, providing tours and wrap around discussions which are
stimulated by the telecast. Since this proposal is for conducting a
teleconference, it is exempt from peer review in accordance with NSF Manual No.
