The Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Limnology and OceanoGraphy
(DIALOG) is an interdisciplinary project that works through several professional
societies to target recent Ph.D. recipients across the full spectrum of
disciplines relevant to the biologically oriented aquatic sciences. This project
will quantify and characterize recent aquatic science Ph.D.s, consolidate and
disseminate Ph.D. dissertation abstracts, establish electronic lists to
facilitate distribution of job opportunities, and run an international
"capstone" symposium for selected recent graduates to foster interdisciplinary
insight, peer networking, and early career development. DIALOG will foster
international as well as inter?institutional contacts, and include graduates
from both developing and developed countries. Demographic data will facilitate
the characterization and tracking of human resources. The on?line Dissertation
Registry will provide a comprehensive yet concise summary of new research for
scientists, policy makers, and agency representatives and facilitates
integration of a new generation of researchers into the broader community. The
electronic distribution list will provide a mechanism to target and disseminate
information across institutions and foster communication across disciplinary and
international boundaries. The international symposium will support participant
diversity at all levels, and bring together individuals whose work transcends
traditional boundaries. Activities will establish peer networks and enhance
insights and perspectives to accelerate career development and advance
interdisciplinary approaches to science.
