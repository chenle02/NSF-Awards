Professor Fisher will work on the equidistribution theorem for Kloosterman
sums. He also hopes to generalize Katz's equidistribution theorem to lisse
sheaves with traces in a number field. He also hopes to study numerically the
distinctness of Kloosterman sums. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
