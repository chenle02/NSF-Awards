The computational demands of modern chemical research require the proper
computing system that would avoid wasteful bottlenecks by balancing a variety of
computational capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware and
software maintenance, support personnel and training in all areas of
computational chemistry. Many new insights into the kinetics of chemical
reactions can be developed through theoretical studies with use of mini-
supercomputers when the experimental data are inaccessible. In addition, the
most cost-effective computers are the mini-supercomputers. This award will allow
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan to acquire a mini-
supercomputer system. The research studies to be performed include the
following: 1) Ab initio calculations of molecular properties. 2) Monte Carlo
simulations of energy transport and reaction kinetics in condensed phases and on
surfaces as models thereof. 3) Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations
of nucleation kinetics and structure of molecular clusters. 4) Development of
new ab initio methods for reaction dynamics. 5) Molecular modeling to elucidate
structures determined by X-ray crystallography and by microwave and NMR
spectroscopy. 6) Analysis of complex spectral data, i.e. for hyperfine
interactions, barriers to internal motions, 2-D NMR, etc. 7) Graphical analyses
of the results of these and other studies.
