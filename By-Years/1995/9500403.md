9500403 Eiss Under an SGER award the tribological properties at elevated
temperature will be investigated for in-situ self- reinforcing polymeric
composites. Blends of isotropic thermoplastics, such as poly (ether-ether-
ketone), and a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer, HX-4000, will be
elevated for their formability and their mechanical and tribological properties
at elevated temperature. The results will be related to composition,
micromorphology, temperature, and thermal transition point of the mixture and
its components. ***
