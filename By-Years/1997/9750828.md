A teaching laboratory for object-oriented programming is being developed for
software engineering students. It is being used to teach a team approach to
software development. Rather than emphasizing software engineering management,
the project is giving students the opportunity to develop a large software
project using the Scheme language. This Lisp dialect enables them to leverage at
least a 500 percent improvement in productivity. Using this language, they are
more able to learn how to manage large-scale industrial software projects. In
particular, students are receiving instruction in the areas of functional
decomposition, optimization, random-basis testing, retrieval for reuse, and
expert language translation. In the area of functional decomposition, students
are learning how to decompose a complex software problem into manageable pieces
and distribute the work across a team. They are learning, through the study of
transformational programming, how to apply knowledge bases to optimize the code
resulting from specifications. Students are also being taught how to reuse
software (e.g., C++ and Scheme) using functional programming and knowledge-based
transformation. Finally, students are being taught how to build interoperable
software through the construction of prototype translators that translate
between Scheme and Lisp or Scheme and a simple subset of C++. *
