9415911 Halliwell Presently, the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM)
have limited capabilities because mixing, which depends strongly on depth
dependent physical processes within the mixed layer, must be governed by a
simple bulk parameterization of the important terms of the vertically integrated
TKE balance; these parameterized terms contain poorly-known coefficients. This
project will solve this problem because it will cap the MICOM with a level
coordinate mixed layer model capable of explicitly resolving depth-dependent
physical processes within the mixed layer. The long term goal of the project is
to perform eddy-resolving global simulations on a massively parallel computer.
