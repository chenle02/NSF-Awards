Using vitrified specimens and special ultrastructural techniques, this project
will investigate structure of the native intact eukaryotic flagellum and that of
the major components participating in its movement. The high-resolution three-
dimensional images that are possible to be obtained with this technique will
contribute to our understanding of microtubule- based motility.
