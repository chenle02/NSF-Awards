The Disaster Research Center will carry out a quick-response field
reconnaissance trip for a preliminary study of the emergency response to the May
5, 2003 series of tornadoes in Missouri and Oklahoma. The focus of the study
will be the warning, system, the response of the emergency management and
hospital systems to the storms, and the effects of Project Impact on the ability
of cities to mitigate the effects of the storms. Ethnographic observation and
informal interviews with key personnel in the hospitals, the city administrators
involved with the mitigation, and the emergency management communities (police,
fire, emergency management agency), as well as the collection of documents and
local mass media accounts of the disasters will be used to examine the
functioning of the hospital's emergency operations plan, its
institutionalization and emergent response patterns and community mitigation
features that were instituted as a result of Project Impact and their
effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research such as this is important to
capture valuable perishable data, especially from an area for which historical
disaster data exists, because it can be used to evaluate previous findings on
warning systems, hospitals, the responses of the emergency management
communities, and the effectiveness of FEMA's Project Impact. The impacts to
society are broad in so far as they might serve to improve our operations and
procedures for dealing with disasters.&lt;br/&gt;
