This project is to create a computer networks laboratory which will be an
integral and essential part of a newly developed undergraduate computer networks
course, aimed at students in both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
The computer networks course will cover both the theoretical and practical
aspects of computer network design, implementation, and performance. The
laboratory will broaden the experience of undergraduate students with the actual
development and use of computer networks. The requirement to interrupt the
operation of the network, and its associated computers, makes it impractical to
use existing computer facilities for the networks. In addition to its use by the
undergraduate computer networks class, the laboratory will used in the
undergraduate operating systems course and a future distributed systems course.
Electrical Engineering students can take the computer networks course as an
electrical engineering elective and can also use the laboratory to work on
design projects associated with computer networks.
