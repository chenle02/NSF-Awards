Student visualization of spatial and temporal relationships traditionally has
presented a challenge unique to geoscience faculty. In California, however, the
existing teaching problems are being exacerbated as a growing population of
students for whom English is the second language is being incorporated into
university communities. This inexorably growing concern of communication of
scientific concepts and principles to an audience with lower levels of English
facility requires a fundamental modification of our teaching philosophy and the
methods of delivery of the information in the classroom. Additionally, because
of societal influences, contemporary students are oriented toward visual
learning rather than auditory learning. Although no single solution to our
academic dilemma exists, one potentially fruitful direction, offering
substantially increased efficacy in educational communication, lies in the
subordination of the spoken word to alternate communication methods. Short,
computer-animated simulation sequences carefully linked to oral lecture
material, can be used. In this scenario animations will be presented in the
classroom using existing television monitors and video tape players. To
implement instructional simulations and thus improve student comprehension of
geologic relationships, this proposal seeks support for the purchase of computer
equipment to create and record animated sequences appropriate for
classroom/laboratory instruction. To maximize use of the modules, descriptions
and single frame examples of all modules will be placed as web pages on our
existing web server for browsing. Copies of animations can then be obtained by
contacting the writer. If interest is sufficient, the files will be made
available on the web server for direct downloading.
