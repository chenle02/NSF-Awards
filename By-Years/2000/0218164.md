&lt;br/&gt;0218164&lt;br/&gt;Strahler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
Professor Alan Strahler, a graduate student, and colleagues from Boston
University for travel to collaborate in remote sensing research with Dr. David
Lupp and others of the CSIRO Earth Observation Center in Canberra, Australia and
with Professor Ziaowan Li and colleagues of the Institute of Remote Sensing
Application of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. NSF support will enable the US
group to participate in ongoing field measurements in Australia and China and to
work with their collaborators to improve their
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their work focuses on the imaging of vegetation
canopies from aircraft or satellites using radiometric instruments. They are
developing an alternative to the radiative transfer theory of how light is
scattered by vegetation canopies. Their approach describes the canopy as a
collection of discrete three-dimensional objects, which leads to many practical
applications. Their fundamental objective is to retrieve details from the
vegetation cover such as the size, shape and spacing of the leaves and plants.
This information will have direct application to studying the carbon balance and
dynamics of vegetated ecosystems at landscape scales. &lt;br/&gt;
