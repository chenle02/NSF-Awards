Abstract DBI 9750006 David M. Parichy This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Mutational analysis of pigment pattern
diversification in cyprinid fishes." The patterns formed by pigment cells are
useful traits for studying the molecular changes underlying morphological
evolution. This project uses the advanced genetics of the zebrafish Danio rerio
to identify genes contributing to adult pigment pattern differences among
cyprinid fishes. The aims are to test known pigment pattern genes for
interspecific differences in their activities and to screen for previously
unidentified genes that contribute to pigment pattern differences across taxa.
