Figueroa 9410343 This is an award to provide support for research on the
potential removal of uranium from aqueous solution by its precipitation as the
oxide after a reduction process resulting from actions of mixed cultures of
sulfate-reducing bacteria. The investigator's hypothesis is that bioreduction is
the dominant mechanism for the process which is augmented by solution
characteristics such as initial concentration of the uranium, ionic strength,
pH, presence and concentration of adsorption sites and presence of other redox
couples. Results of this project are expected to be a better understanding than
now exists of the contributions that bioreduction, biosorption and chemical
reduction have on the process by which uranium is initially reduced and then
precipitated from solution. This knowledge is expected to be used in the
engineering design of bioreactors for removal of uranium from contaminated water
and wastewater. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord with
NSF 92-122, Research Initiation Awards Program. ***
