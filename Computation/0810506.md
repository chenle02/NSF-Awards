Matrix Differential Riccati Equations (MDREs) arise frequently throughout
applied mathematics, science, and engineering. In particular, they play major
roles in optimal control, filtering and estimation, elementary particle physics,
and two-point boundary value problems of differential equations. A number of
algorithms have been proposed over the past 25 years for solving MDREs
numerically. These include general-purpose numerical methods retooled to take
advantage of today's computing technology for better performance. Nevertheless,
these methods, because of their generality, inherently do not and cannot fully
exploit many valuable structural properties of MDREs, some of which remain to be
discovered. The objectives of this project are to build a better mathematical
understanding of the long-term solution behavior of MDREs, especially those that
have singularities in the solutions, and to derive new numerical methods that
are able to gracefully handle singularities, unlike the commonly used abort-and-
restart procedures. A new MDRE solver package as the result of a better
mathematical understanding, new algorithms, and the exploitation of IEEE
floating-point exception handling capabilities in today's microprocessors is
expected to be released publicly for the use of scientific communities upon the
successful completion of the project. Graduate students with emerging expertise
in numerical differential equations will be involved.
