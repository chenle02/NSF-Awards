There is a strong current research interest in adaptive control of robots, that
is, control strategies which would allow a robot manipulator to automatically
adapt to changes in its environment, loads, or to exceptional disturbances in
order to successfully complete manipulation or assembly tasks. Some controller
designs rely on approximations of system dynamics while others require
measurements of joint accelerations and inversion of inertia matrices. This
project further develops a new method which utilizes system kinetic energy
rather than the fully expanded system dynamics. The method's strengths include
guaranteed global convergence of the tracking, and computational simplicity. The
project's focus is external control of unknown dynamic parameters, the problem
of controlling the end effector of a passive mechanism along a desired
trajectory using an active robot. This problem represents a large class of
important practical applications involving motion control of complex mechanisms
or mobile environments. Opening a door, turning a crank, as well as more complex
problems in industrial settings belong to this class. The controlled mechanism
has its own nonlinear dynamics which are generally unknown. The research will
concentrate on transient performance of the control algorithms, and on trade-
offs between joint space and Cartesian space formulations.
