Professor Beckerle of the Chemistry Department of Clemson University is
supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate the rates and mechanisms by which the
vibrational energy of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces is redistributed.
These studies will be carried out in real time using ultrafast laser
spectroscopy. In this research, femtosecond time-resolved infrared spectral
hole-burning will be employed in a comparative study of the rates and mechanisms
of vibrational energy transfer for adsorbates on the surfaces of metal
structures ranging in size from bulk sigle crystals to ultrathin metal films to
nanometer size metal particles. Much of contemporary surface science is devoted
to the understanding of heterogeneous catalysis, and the growth and processing
of advanced materials. An important aspect of such studies is the effective
comparison of adsorbates on metal surfaces of widely ranging sizes and/or
geometry. The research undertaken in this project will serve to provide
important insight into the way in which vibrational energy of adsorbed molecules
redistributes itself across a metal surface.
