The establishment of a Computer Laboratory in the Geography Department at Mary
Washington College is proposed. This laboratory will significantly enhance the
'instruction offered in several upper-level geography courses, as well as
providing students with "hands-on" 'experience using equipment they 'will
encounter in graduate schools and professional careers.Specific needs to be
addressed include introducing geography majors to geographic information systems
and the basics of automated mapping; acquiring imagery from orbiting weather
satellites, and providing the means to demonstrate various computer applications
and provide instruction on their use in classes of up to forty students each.
