The structure, dynamics, phase transitions, chemical reactions and electronic
properties of condensed systems at high pressures and other extreme conditions
will be investigated using techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and x-ray
diffraction. Systems to be investigated include: phase equilibria of oxygen,
nitrogen and sulfur, and mixtures of oxygen/nitrogen, carbon monoxide/nitrogen,
oxygen/argon; structures of organic and polymeric conducting materials; thermal-
and photo-instabilities of simple aromatic molecules at moderate pressures. In
addition, internally heated diamond-anvil cells for x-ray diffraction studies at
high pressures will be developed.
