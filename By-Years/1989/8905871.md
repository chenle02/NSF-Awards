This research will extend work on the spectroscopy of single levitated aerosol
particles into the surface region with the development of three new
spectroscopies. The first, surface tension spectroscopy, to provide a measure of
the surface molecular excess; the second, electromagnetic sounding (using
fluorescence and second harmonic generation), to provide microscopic information
on molecular orientation at the surface and the distribution of molecules in the
interior; and the third, phase boundary phase shift spectroscopy, to provide an
on-line measure of the water condensation rate at the surface. This will be the
first application of all three spectroscopies to investigate microscopic effects
associated with water condensation in the presence of surface active species of
atmospheric interest. Preparation of surface coatings having specific densities
will be facilitated by the use of a proposed microparticle collider. This
research will provide new techniques for the study of atmospheric aerosol
physical and chemical property.
