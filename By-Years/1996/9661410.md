*** 9661410 Prohaska This project will evaluate the feasibility of a
miniaturized ozone sensor for the resolution of parts per billion (ppb)
concentration changes in the atmosphere. The proposal is based on a recent
breakthrough which utilizes established sensor technology in combination with
solid-state mass production techniques to form low-cost miniaturized sensors
with superior measurement capabilities. The development of this high-resolution
device will require detailed understanding of sensing materials, measurement and
fabrication processes, as well as possible causes for signal distortions. The
proposed Phase I studies are designed to provide necessary information and data
for a successful Phase II development. During Phase II it is planned to
integrate the ozone sensor with other miniaturized toxic gas sensors, ie. for
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, onto highly selective, low-cost, low-energy
consuming, light weight, multiple sensor devices for environmental monitoring.
Phase II product development is planned to be performed together with corporate
partners who are established in the environmental and safety market, and will
support the Phase III product engineering and manufacturing transfer. ***
