This award supports participation in the "Tenth Mississippi State Conference on
Differential Equations and Computational Simulations," which provides a forum
where mathematicians, engineers, and scientists from academia and industry
exchange research and education ideas involving theoretical, applied, and
computational developments in differential equations and associated simulations.
The conference will be held October 23-25, 2014 on the campus of the Mississippi
State University. The website for this conference is
http://www.ccs.msstate.edu/deconf/de2014. The conference is a collaborative
endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Center
for Computational Sciences (CCS), a High Performance Computing Collaboratory
(HPCC) member center, at Mississippi State University. The majority of the grant
funds will be used to provide travel support to graduate students and recent
doctoral recipients. The conference will provide these future research leaders
an opportunity to present their work, to meet and collaborate with other
researchers, educators, and practitioners, and to learn about recent
developments in this interdisciplinary field.
