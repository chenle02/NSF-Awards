Computer Science (31)

This project proposes to develop a pipeline of Information Assurance (IA)
professionals by providing scholarships to talented students over a span of four
years, with a yearly cohort of 6 to 8 students. The university is well
positioned to attract high quality students who are interested in IA. The
Computer Science and Computer Engineering curricula prepare students with strong
technical competence in the field of Information Assurance. The MS in IA
program, jointly offered by the College of Computer and Information Science
(CCIS) and the College of Criminal Justice, provides students a holistic view of
IA with a curriculum integrating technical, legal and policy issues. Through the
IA-related course offerings, research activities, cooperative education
opportunities, outreach activities and research activities, the university has
established itself as the right place to further develop this expertise. The
program has been certified as a Center of Academic Excellence in Information
Assurance Education and Research (CAE/IAE-R) by NSA/DHS.

In addition to extensive course development, CCIS and the College of
Engineering have joined together to establish an interdisciplinary research
institute in Information Assurance. These efforts aim to attract interested
students with diverse backgrounds, as well as researchers to participate in
advancing the state-of-the-art in Information Assurance. The Cooperative
Education Program, the application-oriented projects embedded in the IA
curriculum, and faculty connections with IA-focused industries and research
laboratories provide the students with an unique advantage in securing permanent
and internship employment, particularly with the federal government.

This program proposes to devote special attention to work with HBCU and HSI
colleges/universities, to attract and recruit under-represented students to the
field of IA. This project leverages previous experience in working with
minority-serving institutions through an NSF REU summer program.
