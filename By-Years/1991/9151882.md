Since 1986 at the University of Oregon, a curriculum utilizing Scheme as the
programming language in introductory courses for undergraduate computer science
majors has been able to address a wide range of basic issues. From this
experience, two fundamental difficulties in teaching the curriculum to liberal
arts students has been identified: i) the predominantly preengineering emphasis
of available texts, and ii) a lack of adequate instructional software support.
As a result, a concept-oriented curriculum and associated Macintosh-based
software environment is being developed. Students explore notions of recursion
and abstraction as well as complexity and correctness. Experience with
applications of these ideas is achieved through lab assignments on such topics
as computer music, color graphics, simple animation, interactive interfaces, and
large-scale program modification. All on-line course materials are being
developed as MacScheme, ParcPlace Smalltalk, or MetCom Modula-2 programs and
Hypercard stacks. The lab will contain Macintosh lIci and llfx personal
workstations networked with a Sun SPARCserver for file management and print
services. Video equipment is being used as a tool for presentation and
preservation of lectures and results of lab assignments.
