Work under this ROW Research Planning Grant will be directed toward isolating a
number of differentially expressed clones of a mutant gene that dramatically
effects kidney function in mice. If the clones are new, they will be
characterized by Northern hybridization and by sequencing. These clone libraries
should provide an essential preliminary step to a better understanding of the
molecular manifestations of this important mutant gene. Alternative methods of
identifying this gene will be planned in order to enhance its eventual
isolation. This mutant gene holds promise as an intriguing eukaryotic model
system.
