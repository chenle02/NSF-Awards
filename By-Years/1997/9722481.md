expenses for 10 US scientists to participate in a joint US- Venezuela Congress
of Physiological Sciences, scheduled to take place in Caracas, Venezuela, August
31 - September 5, 1997. Organizers are Dr. Martin Frank, American Physiological
Society and Dr. Sonia Torres, Venezuela Society of Physiological Sciences. The
program will cover a wide range of physiological sciences representing the broad
scope of investigations conducted by the scientists, and will provide a regional
and local forum for the exchange of physiological information and research data.
One of the goals of the project is to encourage the development of intellectual
and research interactions between scientists from US and Latin America. Such
interactions promote scientific collaborations and create opportunities for
broadening the scientific experience of young scientists. ***
