Many genetic changes affect several different traits, and the same locus can
have both benefits and costs, realized through its effects on different traits.
This study combines molecular genetic and field experimental techniques to
investigate the genetic and ecological basis of a flower color polymorphism in
the Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii. Most P. drummondii have blue flowers
caused by the production of anthocyanins, which are produced by a biochemical
pathway that is common in plants. Anthocyanins, which are also produced
throughout plants' vegetative tissue, are believed to have other effects,
including defense against herbivores and protection from UV damage. White-
flowered P. drummondii lack anthocyanin. This study will determine the genetic
basis of the white flower color and investigate the environmental effects of
anthocyanin levels that are related to traits other than flower color.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has implications for understanding novel
adaptation and the maintenance of biodiversity. The project will provide diverse
research-based training for the graduate student CoPI and for undergraduate and
high school students that the CoPI will mentor and train
