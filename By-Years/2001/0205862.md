AST-0205862&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Martin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a
research project to discover and characterize very low-luminosity substellar
objects. The search will take place in several nearby young stellar associations
and open clusters with ages ranging from 1 to 120~Myr, and in high galactic
latitude fields. Brown dwarf and free-floating planet candidates will be
identified using deep multi-color CCD photometry. Near-infrared photometry and
spectroscopy will provide crucial information on the nature of the objects.
These observations will increase significantly the sample of known brown dwarfs.
Hence, this new field of research will be put on a more firm statistical basis.
The relative numbers of brown dwarfs and free planets in a given association,
cluster and the field will allow the determination of luminosity functions and
mass functions in the substellar regime for a variety of environmental
conditions. Follow-up studies, such as disk accretion for very low-mass
primaries, binarity, rotation, and weather-like variability will be carried out
by Martin and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
