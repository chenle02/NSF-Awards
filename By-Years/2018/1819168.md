This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2018 Network and Distributed
System Security (NDSS) Symposium to be held in Santa Diego, California, Feb
2018. NDSS brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the
Internet community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies
that define network and distributed system security. This travel grant will
enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US
citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of
graduate school education for our society's future computer security
researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with
world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections,
and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research
careers.
