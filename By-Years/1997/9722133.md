Three problems involving the interaction of charged particles in a non-
equilibrium plasma are studied using the theoretical tools of statistical
mechanics coupled with numerical simulation. The primary objective of the
research is to qualitatively explain features from recent experiments and to
discover the underlying mechanism for the motion of charged particles in a
plasma and plasmas under the influence of external fields.
