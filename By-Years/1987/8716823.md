This project will investigate the structure of the ocean north of Hawaii using
expendable AXBT's dropped from a series of flights. recent theory and analysis
suggests that the Hawaiian Island ridge system rectifies incoming Rossby waves
into a current system with quasi-persistent offshore structure. This study will
determine the spatial sturucture, and with repeated flights, will describe some
aspects of the temporal variability.
