Under a Presidential Young Investigator Award, research will be conducted on
compressible turbulent flows and on related issues in acoustics. Both direct
numerical simulations and theoretical analysis will be utilized. Compressibility
effects on various scales of motion in the turbulence field, on the cascade of
energy between scales, and on energy dissipation at the small scales will be
studied. Engineering model for more accurate prediction of compressible flows
will be developed for application to various high speed and combustion flow
system.
