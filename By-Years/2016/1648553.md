The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it may
potentially impact the lives of millions of women worldwide who are tested for
the presence of endometrial cancer. In the US, women who with abnormal vaginal
bleeding (regardless of age, shape, race, economic standing, history or
ethnicity) are considered to have endometrial cancer, until proven otherwise.
Unfortunately, unlike the use of pap tests for the detection of cervical cancer,
no tests or exams currently exist for screening endometrial cancer. Simple and
accurate screening and biopsy tools are important for the early detection of
endometrial cancer because of: i) clinical requirements to rule out cancer first
and foremost, ii) improved survival rates with early detection, and iii) high
pain, cost, and time associated with current diagnostic measures. This team's
process may enable women to get access to non-invasive, accurate diagnoses of
endometrial cancer not otherwise available. Accurate, real time and early
diagnosis of endometrial cancer will benefit and estimated one out of nineteen
women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on the first steps in
translating a miniaturized tool for discerning healthy vs. malignant tissue at
the point of care. Despite the critical need, no method currently exists for the
real time, clinical diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Current methods require a
succession of inconclusive, invasive, and time-consuming tests, thus failing to
meet the needs of the user. To fill this gap, this projects aims to develop a
product for screening endometrial cancer during the first visit to a clinic. Two
imaging modalities are integrated, including photoacoustic imaging (known to
provide a clear map of vasculature, and ultrasound) for deep tissue penetration,
identifying tissue density. This combination will enable the detection of tissue
not otherwise able to be reached without expensive and invasive procedures
requiring contrast agents. This new method of device manipulation will allow for
complete 3D imaging of an organ, in conjunction with tissue sample collection.
