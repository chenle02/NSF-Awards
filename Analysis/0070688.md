ABSTRACT:

The investigator wants to study two topics in Several Complex Variables. The
first is on holomorphic embeddings. By constructing holomorphic functions,one
seeks to embed complex manifolds as closed submanifolds of some complex
Euclidean space of as low dimension as possible. The second is on envelopes of
holomorphy. In constructions of holomorphic functions, one is faced with the
restriction that sometimes they all extend past certain boundary points, for
example, in higher dimensions no holomorphic function can have an isolated
singularity. Isolated boundary points belong to the envelope of holomorphy.The
investigator will study, more generally, envelopes of holomorphy. In particular,
there is a great need for investigation of a large variety of examples.

Complex analysis is a basic tool in many fields of mathematics and in other
sciences. Even problems described with real numbers are often dealt with more
naturally after extending into the complex domain. A foundational problem of the
subject is how to construct holomorphic functions with required properties. This
basic problem has motivated much of the work of the proposer in the past and is
also the motivation for this proposal. For example how can one find a
holomorphic function tending to infinity at a certain boundary point, or has
some other singularity there?
