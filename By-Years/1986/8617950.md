This proposal involves research on the nature of the structure of quasicrystals
and metallic glasses that can form quasicrystalline structures upon annealing.
Conditions for formation of quasicrytals will be ascertained from analysis of
structural relaxation occurring in the amorphous state and subsequent
transformation into the quasicrystalline state. Experimental techniques to be
applied include differential anomalous X-ray scattering, neutron scattering,
energy dispersive X-ray and synchrotron radiation diffraction. Several metallic
glass alloy systems will be studied that show tendencies toward possible
quasicrystalline structure formation. Dr. Egami has an outstanding research
record and the facilities at the University of Pennsylvania are excellent for
performing the proposed program. This research was previously supported by NSF
Grant DMR-8318816.
