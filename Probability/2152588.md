The project focuses on random matrices - rectangular arrays of random numbers.
While the primary focus is on theoretical properties of such matrices, the
questions are motivated by applications in other sciences: economics,
statistics, and physics. In data sciences, rectangular arrays appear whenever
the observations are naturally arranged in two dimensions, for instance, in time
and space. In quantum mechanics, matrices and related operators appear in
modelling of a physical system. When the amount of available information about
such a system is limited, a proper modelling is by taking the matrix to be
random. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.

Random matrices and their eigenvalues play a central role in many research
areas, including high-energy physics, growth models, number theory, and high-
dimensional statistics. The project revolves around exactly solvable or
integrable families of random matrices, for which the eigenvalues are accessible
through explicit formulas, actions of differential operations, orthogonal
polynomials, and other essentially algebraic techniques. The goal of this
project is three-fold: to search for these families, develop delicate asymptotic
results about them (which usually go far beyond theorems available for generic
systems), and use them for obtaining asymptotic predictions for much wider
classes of random matrices and related objects of applied interest. The central
objects gluing together different parts of the project are beta-ensembles, which
are N-dimensional distributions uniting and generalizing the laws of eigenvalues
of various random matrices. While in classical contexts the parameter beta takes
values 1, 2, or 4, depending on whether the matrices under consideration are
real, complex, or are quaternion matrices, this project emphasize a point of
view in which beta is allowed to take arbitrary positive real values and should
be interpreted as the inverse temperature in the terminology of statistical
mechanics.
