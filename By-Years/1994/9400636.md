Professor Debarre will investigate geometric properties of abelian varieties. In
particular, he will study the topology and geometry of covers of abelian
varieties of small degree. He also intends to continue his study of the Schottky
problem. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry
is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
