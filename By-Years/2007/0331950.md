The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Precision Metrology
(CPM) supports the necessary cohesion between university researchers and
supporting affilates from the tight-tolerance manufacturing community for the
development of the next generation of manufacturing engineers, measurement
techniques, metrology instrumentation, efficient processes, and enabling
products that will facilitate advances in precision manufacturing where state-
of-the-art dimensional tolerances on the order of ten parts per million are
common.

The above-mentioned broad objective will be realized through the examination of
real world precision related manufacturing problems presented by industrial
affiliate members in conjunction with university faculty and student
researchers. The problems addressed will have sufficient generic interest for
industrial affiliate members to approve by vote at semiannual meetings.
Addressing real problems will provide the students with an applied education
pertinent to current tight-toleranced manufacturing challenges and result in
highly-trained employees that can solve similar problems in a real-world
environment.
