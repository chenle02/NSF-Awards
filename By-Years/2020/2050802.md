This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to North Dakota
State University, located in Fargo, ND, supports 10 undergraduate students for a
10-weeks of research training and professional development during the summers of
2021-2023. This interdisciplinary program is focused on helping students develop
an interest and appreciation for Green Chemistry, with research projects geared
toward sustainability and the circular economy in chemistry and polymer science.
Additionally, participants take part in an organized set of activities to
prepare them for their future careers, including workshops on conducting
research, professional development, student research presentations, seminars on
Green Chemistry, team building activities, and creation of infographics. The
summer program is designed to provide state-of-the-art training in collaborative
research environments to garner an excitement for
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alongside faculty mentors, students work on
research projects connected to Green Chemistry within a broad set of research
fields, including biomass transformation, design of catalysts, computational
chemistry, polymer science, life cycle analysis, and chemistry education
research. Complemented with a series of professional development activities and
seminars, these undertakings provide holistic training for students in a highly
interdisciplinary area. The site emphasizes the recruitment of students from
institutions with limited research opportunities, especially students from
underrepresented groups and non-ACS accredited programs. This training will
enhance their preparedness to meet career challenges and be responsible stewards
of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
