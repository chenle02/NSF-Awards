The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Dr. Phan H. Loi received
his doctoral degree from Pennsylvania State University, and will pursue research
in the area of pure mathematics under the guidance of Dr. Vaughn Jones at the
University of California, Berkeley.
