This project investigates the role of randomness and parallelism. Specific
problems involving the behavior of algorithms with random input include hashing,
packing, and partitioning algorithms. With respect to parallel computation, the
PI (with Megiddo and Ramachandran) showed that linear programming with two
variables per constraint (and in the objective function) is solvable in polylog
space. This project investigates whether it is in NC (or possibly RNC), along
with variations of the problem, and their relation to problems such as matching.
Also under investigation is the reduction of the processor count in parallel
algorithms. Of particular interest are problems such as path-finding in directed
graphs, and special cases such as planar graphs.
