The proposal requests funding for partial support for the International Workshop
on Ring Imaging Cherenkov Counters (RICH2004) to be held in Playa del Carmen,
Mexico from November 30 to December 5, 2004. This is the 5th in a series of
Workshops that have been very useful for those working on the design, building,
using and writing software for Ring Imaging Cherenkov
Counters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to support the travel
expenses for young researchers in the field, namely, students and postdocs. For
those selected, the conference fee will be waived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
