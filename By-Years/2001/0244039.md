Schaffner/02-44039&lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed funding for an REU site
at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), College of William and Mary.
The award will support twelve undergraduate students each year during a 10-week
summer research internship. The internship program focuses on interdisciplinary
coastal marine science, particularly processes operating in the local Chesapeake
Bay estuarine environment. VIMS is one of the largest institutions in the U.S.
dedicated to the study of coastal and estuarine systems. Research areas
available for students include marine ecology, biological and chemical
oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, marine
fisheries, and marine policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
