We propose to study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of both unsteady and
steady state singularly perturbed systems. Using asymptotic-numerical methods
and singular perturbation theory, our results are expected to have more
applications in fluid dynamics. The proposed research activities will enhance
the quality our research.
