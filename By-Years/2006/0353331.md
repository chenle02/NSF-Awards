This five-year project will investigate the science learning of ELL students and
other groups of students within the Florida system. Working with the Miami Dade
schools and providing a comprehensive system of research, professional
development, policy analysis and student outcomes this project will likely have
broad impact and is timely for the upcoming NCLB science requirements. The
methodology is sound. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used and the
research questions about how ELL students learn science and meet the demands for
assessment and accountability are important. Predominantly these investigations
will be conducted in the elementary school setting with specific emphasis on
science, although other disciplines and literacies are likely to be integrated
at this leve by the professionally developed teachers.&lt;br/&gt;
