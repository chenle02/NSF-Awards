The research is aimed at determining the distribution, motions and physical
conditions of the various components of the interstellar medium in galaxies. The
purpose is to study the relationship of these components to each other, to the
spiral structure, and to the star formation processes in galaxies. While the
general evolutionary cycle between the interstellar medium and the stars in
galaxies is understood, the detailed underlying processes are still not clearly
delineated. In order to study the interstellar medium in external galaxies with
sufficient resolution, the Principal Investigators will use the relatively new
Hat Creek millimeter-wavelength telescope to observe the neutral atomic hydrogen
(HI) component and the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope to observe the
molecular component and the relativistic electrons. An optical imaging Fabry-
Perot spectrometer will be used to probe the ionized gas. Such comparative
detailed analyses will further the understanding of the basic processes of
galactic evolution. How galaxies evolve with time has relevance to many basic
questions in astronomy such as galaxy formation, cosmology, and the origin of
the structure of galaxies and of their morphological types.
