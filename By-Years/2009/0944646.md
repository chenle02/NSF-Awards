This research project will continue studies of a taxonomically definitive group
of early evolving (single-chambered) Foraminifera at both multi-gene molecular
and ultrastructural levels of analysis, in order to generate more robust and
detailed phylogenies of these ecologically-important organisms. Studies will be
extended to include members of the enigmatic genus Gromia, to better define
their ecological significance and placement within the protistan supergroup
Rhizara. Together, these structural and molecular data will be used to complete
taxonomic descriptions of over 20 new rhizarian species. The research will
develop rapid molecular screening methods for future ecological studies of
rhizarian protists, and uncover the driving forces that led to their
diversification. A range of educational activities will target local and
national audiences, and include development of hands-on, standards-based,
innovative science classroom activities. In addition, a short art/science
documentary film depicting research on the biology and evolution of Antarctic
rhizarian protists will form the basis of a workshop hosted by the Capital
Region Center for Arts in Education.
