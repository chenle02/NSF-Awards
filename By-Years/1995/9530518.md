Title: A Knowledge-Based Approach to Climate Analysis and Forecasting
Information regarding the climate system is often imprecise, incomplete, vague,
or uncertain. A significant part of this information exists as empirical facts
and rules, expressed in qualitative form. The objective of this study is to
develop a system that can manipulate qualitative information is such a way as to
provide understanding about observed climate changes. The appropriate method to
reach this objective is based on concepts and techniques of expert systems and
artificial intelligence. The information about parameters of the climate system
will be presented both in quantitative and qualitative forms. Relationships
between climatic variables will be expressed as production rules written in IF-
THEN format. Each rule will contain a certainty factor that represents a
numerical measure of the confidence one has in the validity of a rule. Two
methods will be used to combine certainty factors. The first method is based on
the Dempster-Sharper theory, and the second one on the Bayesian scheme. The
system will be able to evaluate the future state of various climatic variables
(such as temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, etc.) and of
macroclimatic features (such as centers of action, jet streams, upper
atmospheric troughs and ridges, etc.). It will also explain why the conclusion
was reached and how certain it is. This system may also be considered as a
decision support system valuable for recording ideas and retrieving necessary
information that will facilitate discussions about observed and anticipated
climate changes. The grant will support the prototype development which will
focus on the Northern Atlantic. Then the system will be expanded to the entire
Northern Hemisphere. The system will be useful both for climatolog ists and
decisionmakers. It will find different applications in fisheries, agriculture,
navigation, recreation and other climate-related industries.
