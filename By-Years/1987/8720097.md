This project will evaluate the origin and movement of fluids that interact with
high-grade metamorphic terranes in two areas, the Basin and Range province
(Western USA) and the Pyrenees Mountains (France). Stable and radiogenic isotope
constraints will be used to evaluate the source of aqueous fluids, the extent to
which such fluids modify deep crustal rocks, and the rates and geometry of fluid
flow.
