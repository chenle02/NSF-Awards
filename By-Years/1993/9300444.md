Proof construction is a pervasive activity in computing mathematics. Although
techniques for automated reasoning made it possible to prove theorems with
extreme rigor, much the past effort has been directed towards proving difficult,
interesting, and often well-known theorems using general- purpose logics and
proof techniques. The application of automated reasoning technology to support
formal methods in software engineering has fallen well short of original
expectations. The main reason for this failure is the overriding emphasis on
automatic theorem proving. A completely new approach is required where the focus
must from theorems to proofs, and from general-purpose language inference
mechanisms to well-integrated, domain-specific mechanisms. Any sufficiently rich
application domain, such hardware, real-time, concurrent, or fault-tolerant
systems, exploits a host of specialized formalisms in order to encode important
concepts and methods and to reduce complexity. project develops multi-modal
framework for interactive proof construction to support the use of domain-
specific formalisms. The envisaged application is to reason about complex
digital systems.
