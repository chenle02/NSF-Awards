This project is in accordance with AD/ENG Bulletin 85-25 for Innovative and
Novel Research. The problem of ice formation on highways and bridges is a
constant cause of accidents and fatalities in northern climates, in addition to
the cost of providing materials to reduce the hazard. Salts, sand and ashes of
various types have been used to reduce the icing effect, but these precautions
do not eliminate the cause of icing. This project will explore fundamental
studies on the formation of ice to pavement bond and to explore methods by which
the bond formation may be prevented. The study will involve the correlation of
chemical and mechanical behavior to determine the mechanism o> ice formation and
investigate methods of deicing to eliminate the action. The effect of surface
agents and hydrophobic coatings will be investigated. The researcher is
qualified to perform this investigation. This is a one time award for 12 months.
