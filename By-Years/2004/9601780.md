9601780 McGinn A versatile state-of-the-art powder x-ray diffraction instrument
consisting of 1) an x-ray generator, 2) a high precision multi-configuration
goniometer, 3) a solid state detector 4) a position sensitive detector, 5) thin
film attachments and 6) a high temperature furnace assembly, for
multidisciplinary use will be purchased. This equipment is intended to support
research performed by 12 faculty from the Colleges of Science and Engineering at
the University of Notre Dame. The following capabilities will be made possible
by the new system: 1) high temperature, 2) position sensitive detection for
rapid data acquisition for studies of reaction kinetics, metastable phase
formations, 3) a solid state detector for improved energy resolution and
detection efficiency, 4) thin film capability for structural analysis of various
film geometries 5) improved powder diffraction sensitivity, resolution and
analysis, supported by a computer work station software for modeling and using
cutting edge analytical algorithms. Whether it be structural characterization of
heterostructures, or the kinetics of chemical reactions, the proposed equipment
is crucial for the continuation of the research and teaching efforts in
Structural Characterization a t the University of Notre Dame. The acquisition
will have significant impact on the research programs of the four principle
investigators. Equally important is that the user base of the X-ray
characterization facility and the number of trained users will quickly grow (as
will result from this funding. ***
