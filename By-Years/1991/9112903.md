Computer simulations will be carried out which will provide models for
laboratory experiments designed to measure the Fokker-Planck coefficients in a
fully ionized plasma. Attention will be focused on the modeling of diffusion
processes and computer codes for plasma simulations will be used to model
various initial conditions. The modeling will be extended during later phases of
the research to include two and three dimensional studies.
