Charge density wave (CDW) motion in linear chain metals represents the only
known example of electronic conduction by a moving quantum ground state, apart
from superconductivity. They believe that this effect constitutes the most
important unresolved problem in condensed matter physics. A large body of
experimental evidence now supports the hypothesis that CDW acceleration in an
electric field proceeds via macroscopic quantum tunneling, with phase coherence
properities similar to the Josephson effect. Based upon years of previous work,
they are proposing a program of combined experiment and theory which includes
the following major element: (1) control of CDW pinning through ion bombardment
and implantation, (2) direct observation of CDW structure and motion with their
recently constructed scanning tunneling microscope, and (3) development of a
complete theory for CDW motion. This program is designed to elucidate the
microscopic aspects of this remarkable new phenomenon, and to simultaneously
provide the control of CDW properties that will be required for future
electronic application.
