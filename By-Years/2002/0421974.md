This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop
low-cost, 20-50 mW blue and green lasers for bioinstrumentation applications.
The Phase II program objectives are to : (i) design, assemble and test 20 mW 505
nm laser prototypes; (ii) to validate laser performance in a commercial bio-
instrumentation application, and (iii) to assemble, test, and validate 50 mW
blue-green laser prototypes using a higher efficiency second harmonic generation
(SHG) architecture.

The commercial application of this project will be the availability of
inexpensive laser light sources for researchers in cellular biology and DNA
sequencing.
