While some researchers have aimed at efficiency, they have often developed
algorithms without proving them secure. Conversely, researchers focussed on
provable security have often produced impractical algorithms. Providing both
performance and provable security entails great effort in each domain, often
entailing a strange marriage of mathematics with implementation
considerations.&lt;br/&gt;It is not unusual for researchers to be seeking a
generator of a random cyclic group while at the same time worrying about whether
finding one will cost too many machine cycles. This research effort aims to
address these problems by developing cryptographic algorithms that are
vigorously optimized, yet retain proven security. Moreover, for each algorithm a
carefully-tested implementation will be provided, along with a specification for
porting to other platforms. Finally, the most promising algorithms will be
forwarded to standards activities in order to make them widely available. The
planned results are to provide the user community with fast, secure algorithms
with freely-available reference code; to encourage other researchers to expend
efforts in these directions when publishing new protocols, and to introduce
students to the cross-disciplinary nature of this research, which blends pure
mathematics with architectural considerations.&lt;br/&gt;
