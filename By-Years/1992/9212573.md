This proposal is a request for the continuation of a 1 year 1991 award. We
propose to use data obtained from the coordinated GEM data campaigns to test and
refine the open-magnetosphere model of Toffoletto and Hill ?1989! with respect
to the mapping of the magnetospheric cusp to low altitude. The model provides
quantitative predictions of the local time extent and location of the
equatorward boundary of the cusp and the direction and strength of ionospheric
convection as functions of the cross- polar-cap potential, IMF direction and
solar wind dynamic pressure. The equatorward boundary of the cusp is
provisionally defined as the ionospheric footprint of that portion of the
dayside merging line that lies sunward of the magnetosheath sonic line. We plan
to do model-data comparisons as a means of testing the model's assumptions and
boundary conditions; this test will provide a guide for setting an agenda for
model improvements, some of which are currently under development. Ultimately,
we expect to develop a model of cusp ion precipitation, calculated by tracing a
distribution of particles from the dayside merging line to ionospheric altitude
within the large-scale magnetic and electric fields specified by the model.
