This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Rocky Mountain Partial Differential Equations Conference" that will be held May
18 and 19, 2017, on the campus of Brigham Young University. For additional
information see the conference website: https://math.byu.edu/pde/

This regional conference will focus on a range of topics, both pure and applied,
within the field of partial differential equations (PDE). One purpose of the
conference is to create a network of PDE specialists in the Rocky Mountain
region that will promote research collaborations. The program will feature two
plenary speakers (Edriss Titi, Daniela De Silva), each of whom will deliver an
hour-long lecture. The program allows ample opportunity for junior
mathematicians to present their work.
