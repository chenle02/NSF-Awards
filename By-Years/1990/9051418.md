EL Paso Community College, with an enrollment of 16,500 students of whom 71% are
Hispanic, is developing a Social Science Student Survey Research Center. This
center is providing research experiences in community surveys for students
enrolled in four advanced social science courses: Principles of Economics,
Statistics and Research Design in Psychology, Social Psychology, and Research
Methods in the Social Sciences. Course syllabi are being revised to incorporate
data gathering and analysis utilizing computers and software. These changes in
curriculum, accompanying the purchase of equipment, will improve students'
understanding of research methodology and enhance their success in pursuing
further education or employment. The college will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
