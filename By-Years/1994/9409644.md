9409644 Kenttamaa Purdue University Ion-molecule reaction strategies for the
synthesis and structural characterization of gaseous organic radical cations
will be developed. Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy
will be used to study the stability, reaction paths, kinetics, and
thermochemistry of these radical cations. The role of the charge site in
reactions of these species will be addressed by using ions with different types
of radical sites, and ions with different structures separating the radical site
from the charge site. The use of electron withdrawing and donating substituents
and a rigid molecular framework will be employed to accomplish these goals. This
grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Hilkka Kenttamaa at Purdue University. The synthesis and
characterization of distonic radical cations in the gas-phase will be undertaken
by Professor Kenttamaa. These relatively little-studied species are
characterized by having a unit of positive charge and one odd electron on non-
adjacent atoms in a molecule. Unique synthetic routes will be used to place the
charge and odd electron in different portions of the molecule and to then
determine the reactions that these species undergo. Mass spectrometric methods,
which measure the mass to charge ratio of species, will be used to characterize
the distonic ions and their reaction products.
