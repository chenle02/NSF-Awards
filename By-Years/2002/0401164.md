Gaitsgory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators conduct research in
the following areas: representation theory of Kac-Moody algebras, connections
with arbitrary singularities on curves, moduli stacks of G-bundles on surfaces,
representation theory of groups over two-dimensional fields, and geometric
Langlands correspondence. They study representations of affine algebras at the
critical level in terms of D-modules on natural varieties. They compute the
determinant of the period isomorphism associated to a vector bundle V on a curve
and a connection on V (which can have irregular singularities). They compactify
the stack of G-bundles on a surface. They study the category of representations
of groups over two-dimensional local fields on pro-vector
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of the research lies on the
intersection of several domains of modern mathematics - the Langlands program,
representation theory, finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional algebraic
geometry. It will deepen our understanding of the Langlands program and possibly
lead to its 2-dimensional generalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
