9628331 Chamberlain There are two competing scenarios for the Proterozoic
convergence of the Superior and Wyoming Provinces and each model has broad
ramifications for the assembly of the North American Continent. Basically, one
model has the collision at about 1.85Ga with subsequent accretion of arc
terranes to the south, while the other model calls for considerable arc terrane
accretion to the Wyoming terrane, and this composite terrane finally collided
with the Superior terrane at 1.66 Ga. This project will attack this problem in
two places where the structural boundary is exposed, and constitutes a
geochronological, geochemical and structural investigation focused on the
sequence and timing relationships. Results are expected to constrain tectonic
reconstruction scenarios for the Proterozoic assembly of central North America.
