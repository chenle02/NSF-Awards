This grant supports an international conference on "Computational Analysis of
Inverse Problem," to be held in May 16-18, 2013 at the University of Central
Florida (UCF) in Orlando, Florida. The theme of the conference is on computation
and analysis of inverse problems. Inverse problems have wide range of
applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, tomography and nondestructive
testing, machine learning, geophysics and statistical inference. In the past 20
years, there have been major advances in inverse problems and its foundational
aspects, where methods of functional analysis, partial differential equations
and applied harmonic analysis have played pivotal roles in guiding the
computational methods. The aim of the conference is to bring together top
international experts to facilitate collaboration and communication among
researchers under the common theme of inverse problems. There will be 20 invited
speakers from USA, Europe and Asia Pacific, 15 of them from USA. Funds from NSF
shall provide support for graduate students and recent PhDs and cover partial
expenses of some domestic senior researchers.

Inverse problems have wide range of applications including medical and other
imaging techniques, location of oil and other mineral deposits underneath the
earth's surface through remote sensing, creation of astrophysical images from
telescope. In addition to the traditional application in medical imaging, which
plays a big role in improving national health care, the theory and computational
methods developed to study inverse problems have demonstrated a big impact on
energy independence through more effective drilling of oil and natural gas. They
also help us to deep our understanding of climate change through creation of
astrophysical images. The conference will serve the purpose of encouraging
communication and collaboration between researchers not only in different
scientific disciplines and industries, but also across international boundaries.
The conference is expected to attract many young researchers and graduate
students to participate in conference activities, in particular women and other
under-represented minorities. The participation of graduate students and young
researchers from USA and other countries will give arise to a good opportunity
for mentoring activities for these groups.
