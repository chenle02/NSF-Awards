&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project
will investigate the problem of generating evolutionary object neural networks
for controlling characters in classes of entertainment software, with
consideration given to genres of massively multiplayer online games. The
objective of the research is to identify and develop general self-adaptive
routines and software tools that can be incorporated in a software developer's
kit (SDK) that is suitable for licensing to third-party developers. A series of
experiments conducted within a statistical framework will identify first- and
second-order effects of parameter choices for the evolutionary control of game
characters, which will be incorporated into the SDK. R&amp;D will be aimed at
generating the most rapid evolutionary learning for game characters while having
the smallest code "footprint." Additional research will facilitate automatic
play testing and optimization of artificial intelligence in games. The
scientific and technical understanding of hybridizing evolutionary computation
and neural networks will be enhanced by the careful study of the nonlinear
effects of parameter choices in the studied settings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful this product will ease the transition of video games from development
to products. The development of an SDK that will help reduce the time and cost
of segments of video game production by 50-80%. The software developed may serve
as educational classroom aids in university courses. Furthermore, the strong
correlation between video games and military simulations suggests important
contributions to dynamic planning in combat simulations, as well as extensions
to optimizing courses of action in business operations, such as supply-chain
management. &lt;br/&gt;
