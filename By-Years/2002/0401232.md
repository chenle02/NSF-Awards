The research program will address questions that are fundamental to our
conception of the universe: What is dark matter composed of? What is the dark
energy? Do dark matter and dark energy interact with each other? Why is the
abundance of dark matter about equal to that of ordinary matter, when in
conventional theory they are unrelated? Indeed, why is there any ordinary matter
left in the Universe at all? Are there more dimensions than the 3 we live in,
and what can we say about their structure and properties? In particular the PI
will develop a semi-analytic cosmic ray shower simulator (SENECA). A new
candidate for dark matter (the H-dibaryon) which is based on the existence of
light gluinos will be studied. The research will include a detailed and
intensive examination of the consequences of coupling dark matter (DM) and dark
energy (DE) through a dependence of DM mass on a quintessence field. The PI will
also examine models that can generate an asymmetry for standard model baryons
without baryon number violation and investigate whether one can identify DM as
mirror ordinary matter on a different brane.
