This proposal is to provide data-recording equipment for a fourth magnetometer
to be deployed as part of the MAGIC magnetometer array as well as to supply
spare parts for the continued service and operations of the other systems in the
array. Such equipment is critical to the science program to be funded under the
complementary proposed program from the University of Michigan on "Continuing
Operation of a Magnetometer Array on the Greenland Ice Cap (MAGIC) to
Investigate Propagating Ionospheric Current Systems." Since SRI provided the
systems for the present stations, it is most efficient that they provide
equipment for the final station to be deployed during the 1992 summer field
season. The apparatus includes the following: (1) very low power microcomputer
with interface to handle the analogue magnetometer signals, (2) large, low power
consumption static random access memory, (3) clock providing 1 ms timing
precision from Omega system VLF broadcast signals, and (4) power supply and
conversion equipment. The system is packaged in a heavily insulated container to
provide environmental protection for the computer system which self-heats the
enclosure. Data is stored in the static RAM for later interrogation by the
experimentor with a memoary sufficient to store up to one year of 15-s averaged
data.
