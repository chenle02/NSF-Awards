ABSTRACT The project is an experimental investigation into the use of distinct
types of information during sentence comprehension. Pilot work supports the view
that syntactic processing is "informationally encapsulated" in that certain
types of information fail to influence or guide syntactic processing, even in
contexts where such information may be useful. Such encapsulation allows for a
computationally efficient parse (in linear time). Specifically there is a sharp
contrast between the utilization of information such as category, subcategory,
number, and case specification and information such as animacy and abstractness
features. The investigators will use four experimental tasks: (i) lexical
decision (Wright &amp; Garrett 1984); (ii) Word-by-word syntactic decision
(Stowe 1989); (iii) word-monitoring (Marslen- Wilson &amp; Tyler 1980), and (iv)
the probe task. Both the word-by- word syntactic decision task and the word-
monitoring task involve problems which limit their usefulness in experiments
attempting to shed light on the issue of encapsulation. The issue of
encapsulation is related to the issue of computational efficiency because the
domains in which concord relations are established varies from feature to
feature. The probe task will be used to investigate the role of the c-command
domain in syntactic processing. In general, the aim is to conduct experiments
which pilot work indicates will support a particular view of human sentence
comprehension, i.e. the process of human sentence comprehension distinguishes
the use of lexically-specified and general syntactic information from the use of
semantic or pragmatic information, even when syntactic information is ambiguous.
