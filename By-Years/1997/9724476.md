The rapid growth in the applications of advanced materials necessitates an
integrated effort to acquire and develop new electrohydraulic machines for
mechanical property evaluation to better understanding the behavior of advanced
materials. This project is to acquire and develop high-frequency, elevated
-temperature electrohydraulic equipment for automated fatigue and fracture
tests. The equipment will be used to investigate the mechanical behavior of
advanced materials, such as ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs), metal--matrix
composites (MMCs), polymer-matrix composites (PMCs), superalloys and
intermetallics. Moreover, the new equipment will facilitate the study of aged
materials and biomedical devices. The research project will provide a valuable
mechanism to support both teaching and research activities. In addition, the
project has potential to impact the field as well as to the national
infrastructure.
