This award provides partial support to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)
for the initial meeting of a joint committee of the NAS and the Academy of
Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (ASUSSR) on Science and Technology Policy. The
committee, co-chaired by NAS Vice President James D. Ebert and ASUSSR Vice
President Yuriy A. Osipyan, will provide a nongovernmental, high-level forum for
discussion of policy issues of mutual interest in the areas of research
infrastructures (technical personnel, research- industry linkages, roles of
states/republics, big/small science balance) and innovation in applied research
and development (government role in creating incentives, internationalization of
industrial technology, public financing of industrial research in the transition
to market economy, military-civilian technology relationships). The results of
the discussion will be summarized in published form. This project fulfills the
program objective of advancing the understanding of science policy issues in the
United States and the U.S.S.R. by enabling leading specialists to discuss issues
of mutual interest on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
benefit.
