The ever increasing demand on power processing systems for improved efficiency
and reliability, smaller size and weight, coupled with continuous growth in
dimension and complexity of payloads, has focused attention on a major
deficiency - the ability to design, test and trouble-shoot large-scale power
systems. One of the major difficulties in large-scale system analysis involves
the subsystem interaction problems. As a system becomes more complex, the
interactions among highly nonlinear components and subsystems create a large
degree of uncertainty in the system response even though each component may be
well understood and documented. Thus, the need of a comprehensive power system
modeling tool that can actually predict a system's local and global behaviors is
most critical since the elaborate design verification through integrated systems
hardware testing is prohibitively expensive or often impossible. The main
objective of the research in this phase is to develop a computer-aided
comprehensive large-scale power processing system modeling tool using the multi-
port coupling method to facilitate the design and analysis of present and future
power processing systems, particularly in the area of satellite and space power
systems, main frame computers, and communication power systems. Components of
power processing systems are inherently nonlinear. As a result, their behaviors,
due to large-signal and small-signal disturbances, can be quite different.
Employing the comprehensive modeling tool, dc, small-signal and large-signal
dynamics will be analyzed for both local component level and global system
level. The interaction analysis will be performed to aid the system level design
and trouble-shoot.
