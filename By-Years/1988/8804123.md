This is a cooperative project supported under the US-PRC Protocol on Earthquake
Studies, Annex III. This project is intended to establish a reliability-based
earthquake resistant criteria for the design of reinforced concrete building
structures. The proposed design criteria will explicitly consider the ductility
and strength requirement. The load and resistance factors will be used for the
design of buildings. The design criteria will produce risk-consistent structures
under various design conditions. Thus, the buildings designed according to
recommended criteria will have adequate strength and ductility to resist
earthquakes. The US research team will primarily concentrate on the necessary
analytical developments, while the PRC group will be mainly responsible for
providing pertinent laboratory and field experimental data. The PRC group is
also expected to supply damage data observed in China. In this respect, the US
researchers will also collect and analyze the damage data observed in the US and
elsewhere (particularly in Japan and Mexico).
