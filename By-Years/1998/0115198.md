The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries found European science in
flux, as new theories and discoveries reshaped Europe's intellectual life. At
the same time, Europe's religious makeup was shifting, as Protestant and
Catholic reforms altered doctrine and practice. This dissertation research
project examines the ways in which science and religion interacted on the ground
in this pivotal period, by investigating how the Catholic Church defined and
policed the boundary between the natural and the supernatural. This dissertation
will contribute to these key areas by drawing upon Church investigations into
two spheres of supernatural power: magic and sainthood. Research funds will
support a nine-month research trip to Italy to work primarily at the Archivio di
Stato, the Archivio della Curia Patriarcale, and the Marciana library.
