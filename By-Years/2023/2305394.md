Research in dynamical systems aims to understand the long-term behavior of a
structure that changes according to some prescribed law. The structure and the
law can come from diverse fields such as physics, economics, biology, etc. and
as a consequence dynamical systems pervade most areas of science and its
applications. The PI will study a broad class of low-dimensional dynamical
systems using tools from other areas of mathematics, notably algebraic geometry
and Hodge theory. The tools and techniques that will be developed will cross-
fertilize these mathematical disciplines, addressing longstanding problems and
opening new directions of investigation. The research program will also be
suitable for engaging and training early career mathematicians, including
graduate students and postdocs.

In one direction, the PI will study the relationship between Hodge theory and a
class of dynamical systems called Anosov representations. These connections were
only recently unraveled by the PI and promise to enrich both fields. In
particular, longstanding obstacles related to the mysterious differential
geometry of period maps in Hodge theory can be overcome by considering other
target spaces in flag manifolds, suggested by dynamics, and which allow for
uniformization results of a new kind. In a second direction, the PI will study
dynamics in moduli spaces of translation surfaces with new tools coming from
o-minimality and transcendence theory. These tools will be used to shed light on
classification problems that are central to the subject. In addition, existing
finiteness results will be made effective and algorithms will be devised to
efficiently compute orbit closures.
