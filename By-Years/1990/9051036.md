A comprehensive and flexible imaging systems laboratory is essential to ensure
students in manufacturing engineering and image processing are effectively
instructed in this expanding field. The aim of this laboratory is to (a) raise
the level of imaging courses from an industrially-unacceptable level to an
industry-standard level, and (b) to allow the implementation of additional image
processing courses. The use of PC-based digital imaging systems enables students
to examine and develop alternative machine vision applications and to study
image processing effects. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
