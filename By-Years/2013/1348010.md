New technologies for the 21st century, with applications from LCD displays to
touch screens and solar cells, involve the use of some metals that were not
mainstream Earth resources just a few decades ago. Human innovation has led to
new uses for indium, including the production of indium tin oxide (ITO), a
substance that is both electrically conductive and optically transparent. These
properties permit its use as the active component in the touch screens of smart
phones, tablets, and related devices. As a result, the demand for indium
increased three-fold from the 1990s to the mid-2000s, and ITO has been
responsible for much of this increased demand. The research proposed herein will
not only improve our understanding of the distribution of indium in the crust of
the Earth, but will aid in the exploration for new indium-bearing ores, and
thereby, help provide for the future indium needs of the
country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary sources for indium include massive
sulfide deposits, vein deposits including granite-related veins, and other
granite-related deposits. Indium is most commonly recovered from sphalerite, a
zinc sulfide mineral. As part of this work, experiments will be performed to
close critical gaps in our knowledge concerning the distribution of indium among
the crystalline, aqueous, and molten phases of sub-volcanic magmatic systems, as
well as the thermodynamics of the incorporation of indium into sphalerite under
ore-forming conditions. Results of the research will permit quantitative
estimates of the magmatic-hydrothermal efficiency with which indium can be
removed from magmas, and be incorporated into sphalerite-bearing ores. The
proposed research will permit explorationists and researchers to test hypotheses
for the formation of high-temperature indium-bearing ores. This project is
supported via the NSF FY14 Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials
(SusChEM) initiative.
