9403636 Ulrickson Many times weather of interest to the public are controlled by
factors that are very local in nature. The researchers will study the
climatology and dynamics of a low-level easterly flow in the Spokane, Washington
vicinity that occurs beneath a regional westerly flow at least a few days each
month and in all seasons of the year. Synoptic-scale analyses of weather
observations indicate that the environmental flow should be westerly at all
levels; therefore, the factors controlling this reverse flow must exist locally,
or on the mesoscale. These winds are of more than academic interest. The
significance lies in several effects: (1) the easterlies modify temperatures and
dew points; (2) when mountain fogs form, the easterlies transport them into the
Spokane area; (3) the area's frequent surfaced-based inversions, which strongly
influence regional air quality and controls, are modified; (4) because of their
diurnal occurrence, the easterlies affect air traffic control; (5) these winds
influence the transport of suspended particles and airborne chemicals. The
Principal Investigators will attack this problem using climatological and
diagnostic studies as well as a mesoscale numerical model. They also will
collaborate with forecasters at the local National Weather Service Office with
the intent of formulating methods for improved prediction of these episodes. ***
