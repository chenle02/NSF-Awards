9420988 KATSOUROS The National Academy of Sciences, through its Ocean Studies
Board (OSB), provides guidance to the National Science Foundation/Division of
Ocean Sciences and other Federal Agencies on major ocean science policy issues.
This request is for continued partial Core Support for the OSB. The OSB plans to
consider scientific issues related to coastal oceanography, the carbon dioxide
cycle, biodiversity and partnerships between the Federal Government and the
Oceanographic academic community. The OSB will also support US scientists to
provide leadership in the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The OSB will, thus, continue
to contribute to maintaining the health of Ocean Sciences in the US and to
furthering international cooperation in Ocean Sciences.
