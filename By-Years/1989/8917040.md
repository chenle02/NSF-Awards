The College of Engineering of Florida Atlantic University serves as the U.S.
coordinator for United States-Norway cooperative workshops in ocean engineering
research. Two workshops are proposed, one on the subject of autonomous
underwater vehicle and subsea robotics technology in Norway, and the other on
aquaculture/sea ranching technology in Florida. These workshops will serve to
bring leading researchers in both countries together to further develop joint
research programs in this area. The Harbor Branch Foundation, Ft. Pierce, FL
will provide assistance as stated herein. Approximately ten individuals from the
U.S. will be selected to participate in each workshop. The Norwegians will also
select approximately ten participants for each workshop. The participants will
meet for three days, presenting papers, discussing topics of mutual research
interest and planning for future collaboration. One or two additional days will
be used for conducting visits of facilities pertaining to the workshop topics.
