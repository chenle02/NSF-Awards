9352905 Hallett The Calculus Consortium based at Harvard University, with
funding from the National Science Foundation, has developed, tested and
disseminated an innovative single variable calculus course. The course is
currently being used at over 125 colleges around the country and abroad. In this
project, the effort is being expanded to include precalculus and the second year
of calculus. A major component of the proposed project is dissemination.
Information about the Consortium's single variable materials has reached a large
number of faculty at diverse institutions. The dissemination effort for the
proposed project is being modeled on the workshops, minicourses, newsletters,
test sites, and networking that have proved successful in the current project.
