As Lewis Carroll famously wrote in Alice in Wonderland - It's a poor sort of
memory that only works backwards-. On this side of the mirror, we cannot
remember visual events before they happen; however, our work will help predict
what people remember, as they see an image or an event. Our team of
investigators in cognitive science, human neuroscience and computer vision bring
the synergetic expertise to determine how visual memories are encoded in the
human brain at milliseconds and millimeters-resolution. Cognitive-level
algorithms of memory would be a game changer for society, ranging from accurate
diagnostic tools to human-computer interfaces that will foresee the needs of
humans and compensate when cognition fails. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The project capitalizes on the spatiotemporal dynamics of encoding
memories while providing a computational framework for determining the
representations formed from perception to memory along the scale of the whole
human brain. A fundamental function of cognition is the encoding of information,
a dynamic and complex process underlying much of our successful interaction with
the external environment. Here, we propose to combine three technologies to
predict what makes an image memorable or forgettable: neuro-imaging technologies
recording where encoding happens in the human brain (spatial scale), when it
happens (temporal scale), and what types of computation are performed at the
different stages of storage (computational scale). Characterizing the
spatiotemporal dynamics of visual memorability, and determining the type of
computation and representation a successful memorability system performs is a
crucial endeavor for both basic and applied sciences.
