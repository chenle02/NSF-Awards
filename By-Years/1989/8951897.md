The technique of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) affords chemists a
powerful tool for the separation and identification of the individual components
of multi-coumpound mixtures. The introduction of undergraduates to this
important methodology will be carried out by the development of a set of new
experiments for Organic and Analytical laboratory courses. Included in the
experiments are studies of Friedel-Crafts alkylation, orientation in
dehydrohalogenation, measurement of a primary isotope effect and analysis of
essential oils. This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) award from
the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at
Miami University to acquire GC-MS instrumentation that will be used to enhance
undergraduate laboratory instruction.
