The University of Colorado's Mountain Research Station is one of the nation's
outstanding biological laboratories. The facility supports research in biology,
geology, geography and climatology. It is both a national resource used
extensively by researchers from a variety of agencies and institutions and an
important asset to the faculty and graduate students of the institutes and
departments of the University of Colorado. Since its beginning in 1914 the
Station has added signifcantly to man's understanding of biological and physical
processes in the alpine environment. The Station served as a major site for the
International Biological Program, and is now a Long-term Ecological Research
site for the National Science Foundation. An extensive data base has resulted
from these and other programs, including the Mountain Climate Program that the
Station has operated continuously since 1952. The project provides funding to
purchase, install, and equip a pre-formed modular laboratory building. The
building will be installed at 3,540 m on the alpine tundra of Niwot Ridge, site
of the Niwot Ridge Long-term Ecological Research program. The Tundra Laboratory
will facilitate research in the Niwot Ridge area by providing shelter for
researchers and instruments from the alpine climate. It will provide a refuge
from the frequent summer electrical storms, hail, cold winter temperatures, and
extreme winds that characterize the Niwot Ridge weather. It will make possible a
variety of types of research that are not currently feasible. The Tundra
Laboratory will be solar heated, highly insulated, and equipped with
photovoltaic system to provide electrical power. It will support research in
biology, geology, and climatology.
