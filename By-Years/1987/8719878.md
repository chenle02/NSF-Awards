The St. Mary River and Willow Creek Formations of Montana offer unequalled
opportunities for the study of Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas from upper
coastal plains environments and particularly for the analysis of habitat
bottlenecks and their effect on extinction and radiation of large bodied
terrestrial from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1986 make it
certain that further exploration will yield important additions to our knowledge
of the Late Cretaceous biota of the western interior of the U.S. It is proposed
(1) to devote two field seasons to collecting, mapping, and detailed
stratigraphic work in the St. Mary River and Willow Creek Formations (including
areas only reconnoitered in 1986); (2) to analyze the three or more distinct
types of eggs collected from the St. Mary River Formation; (3) to describe the
juvenile and embryonic dinosaur remains (both material in hand and expected
finds); (4) to describe the adult dinosaurs and other associated reptiles; and
(5) to draw what conclusions are justified from the previously mentioned data
about the evolution of the St. Mary River and Willow Creek dinosaurs, with
special reference to their relationship to the opening of terrestrial habitats
through the regression of the Bearpaw Sea.
