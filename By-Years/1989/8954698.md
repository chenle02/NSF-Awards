The Field Museum of Natural History proposes to design and construct an Animal
Resource Center of 24,000 square feet in the context of its encompassing larger
exhibit, "Diversity and Survival in the Animal Kingdom." The Center will
capitalize on the museum synoptic collections of animal mounts and models and
will interpret these irreplaceable specimens in ways that will introduce central
biological themes in ecology and evolution. The exhibit conjunctively will use a
wide variety of learning techniques to appeal to the varied audience. The museum
anticipates that the exhibit will serve fifteen million visitors over the next
twenty years and that it may serve as a cost-effective model for other natural-
science museums.
