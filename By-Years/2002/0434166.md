This award to Johns Hopkins University provides support for the "Seventh
International Conference on Nanostructured Materials (NANO.2004)" to be held on
June 20-24, 2004 in Wiesbaden, Germany. This international conference is a
biannual conference in the innovative discipline of nano-technology and
nanomaterials. This conference is expected to feature nano-related sessions on
mechanical properties and applications, optical properties, applications, and
photonic effects, chemical properties and applications, magnetic, electric and
electronic properties and devices, bio-inspired concepts and medical
applications, chances and risks of nanomaterials, modeling and computer
simulations, and novel processing techniques. With this award, Professor Ma
plans to partly support the international travel of US participants, primarily
students, postdoctoral candidates, junior faculty members and under-represented
groups. The selection of awardees for travel support will be made by ad hoc
committee members consisting of the PI and the past and present chairmen of the
International Committee on Nanostructured Materials. This conference award is
jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for
Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering.
