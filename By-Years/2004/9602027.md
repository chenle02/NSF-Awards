9602027 Sneed This Americas Program award will fund a cooperative research
program and workshop between Joseph Sneed, Colorado School of Mines, and
Frederick W. Lange, University of Colorado, Boulder, and Mario Molina-Carrillo,
Instituto Nicaraguense de Cultura, Nicaragua, and Maria E. Murillo, Direccion
General de Museos, Costa Rica. The objective is to establish the initial
foundation for an internet based, multimedia information system for selected
museum and university archaeology and cultural ecology collections in Central
America. The focus of the project is the archaeological and ecological material
in museum collections, and the closely allied concerns of cultural patrimony
protection and intellectual property. In cooperation with Costa Rican and
Nicaraguan cultural institutions, this system will serve educators and the
general public. It would be used extensively by scholars and students in the
U.S., especially in institutions that emphasize Latin American anthropology and
will provide a paradigm for international cooperation in the production and
maintenance of internet based information systems in other academic disciplines
and regions. ***
