Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological processes and their interactions
with environmental processes at regional to global scales. This is a new field
that has emerged in recent years to address problems that have been difficult to
address through other perspectives, such as plot-level or single investigator
research projects. The field is highly integrative, draws heavily from a wide
range of ecological and other perspectives, requires critical attention to data
management and informatics throughout the life of the project, includes models
as central tools, and utilizes analytical approaches that can handle such
complexity many of which are relatively new to ecology. This special issue of
the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, published by the
Ecological Society of America, derives from a scientific meeting held in early
2012 that addressed the development of Macrosystems Ecology as a new field. The
participants in that meeting have organized four overarching synthetic chapters
and three more focused, illustrative project-level chapters to be included in
the issue. Together, these papers will propose key concepts and theories that
the field is exploring currently and some of the exciting research frontiers
within the field of ecology and across disciplinary boundaries to other fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include a conscious effort to involve
more junior scientists as lead authors in order to contribute to the growth of
this area into the future, as well as one chapter that will focus on the culture
of highly collaborative research teams, a topic with broad importance to science
in general.
