Abstract Della Rocca

This is a proposal for the 16th West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), to
be held for the first time at California State University Long Beach (CSULB) on
February 02-03, 2008. Support is requested for speakers, graduate students,
post-docs, and partial support for other participants. Approximately 60
participants are expected, including 30 graduate students and post-docs to
attend the yearly weekend seminar, which will feature 6 hour-long and 5 half
hours-long talks on current topics.

The WCOAS is a two decades-long tradition among the operator algebraists in the
western United States. The seminar provides a tremendous opportunity for
researchers in the field, which fosters and reinforces ties among the western
universities. Additionally, the seminar provides young researchers with a forum
to present their latest results and discuss them with senior mathematicians.
This creates opportunities and future connections for graduate students.
Furthermore, this event keeps the field specialists updated with the latest
discoveries and projects. For math graduate students, this will be an inspiring
event: they will be able to observe and interact with professionals devoted to
mathematical research. The high concentration of operator algebraists in the
western United States and Canada has been the main reason for the huge success
of the WCOAS.
