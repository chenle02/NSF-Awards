This grant funds the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site
"Complexity across Disciplines" at Boise State University, a nine-week program
for eight students each summer. The program, hosted in the Department of
Mathematics, focuses on projects related to computational complexity. The site
seeks to produce cohorts of young researchers whose work and vision transcend
traditional boundaries among STEM disciplines. Each cohort will engage in
contemporary research problems in mathematics, with applications to cryptology,
biology, and several other fields of inquiry. The program will also provide
opportunities for REU students to participate in outreach activities targeting
K-12 students in the region. Students from rural communities with limited
opportunities will have one-on-one exposure to highly motivated STEM students
from across the nation. The site offers, in collaboration with other summer
undergraduate research programs at Boise State University, a rich array of
professional and interdisciplinary development events.

The nature of computing and complexity has expanded from the academic realm to
the practical arena through great strides made in the scientific understanding
of basic processes of life, significant advances in information processing
through the growth of the internet, and automation of basic daily tasks. The
research projects are motivated by a quest for efficient search or sorting
algorithms and for efficient information security tools. The mathematical
foundations for these projects include algebraic structures, combinatorial
structures, and game theory. Each project has deep connections with significant
open problems in mathematics, and could lead to discoveries of importance to the
security of current commercially used cryptosystems and to data mining. The idea
of examining certain genomic rearrangement processes from a game-theoretic point
of view is new, has inherent value as a mathematical exploration, and has the
potential to clarify observed phenomena in natural rearrangement processes.
