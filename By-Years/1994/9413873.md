volume for a symposium to take place this summer in Columbus, Ohio entitled "The
Role of the Cryosphere in Global Change". The purpose of the meeting is to bring
together scientists involved with observing and modeling high latitude processes
and assessing the impact of changes in those processes on global climate. This
symposium is being organized by the International Glaciological Society (IGS)
and is co-sponsored by the Byrd Polar Research Center, the American
Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. The symposium volume
is to be published as a proceedings volume of the Annals of Glaciology. ***
