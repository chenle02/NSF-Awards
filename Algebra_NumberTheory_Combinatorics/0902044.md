The aim of this project is to investigate some mod p aspects of the Langlands
program. For GL_2 over the rational numbers, Serre's conjecture, now a theorem
of Khare-Wintenberger and Kisin, predicts the modularity of certain mod p Galois
representations. Generalizations of Serre's conjecture have been put forth for
other reductive groups by various mathematicians, including the PI. One main
goal is to prove strong new results towards the weight parts of such
conjectures. Another main goal is to make progress towards the formulation of a
local mod p (and ultimately also p-adic) Langlands correspondence for reductive
p-adic groups, in particular for the group GL_3 over the p-adic numbers. These
correspondences are expected to be closely related to the weights in Serre-types
conjectures, but have only been understood so far for GL_2 over the p-adic
numbers.

The broader context of this project is the area of number theory, one of the
oldest branches of mathematics. Number theory concerns the study of whole
numbers and the solvability of equations in whole numbers. Its most important
practical application has been to cryptography, which is crucial for secure data
transmission on the internet. Through the amazing conjectural framework of the
Langlands Program, number theory interacts with the seemingly unrelated areas of
group theory (study of symmetries), analysis and geometry. This has proved to be
very fruitful and led to some of the recent successes such as the proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem.
