The 8th Meeting on Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs (HQA8) is scheduled to
be&lt;br/&gt;held on July 23-27, 2018 at Brown University. We anticipate that
the meeting will be attended&lt;br/&gt;by approximately 30 participants from
countries worldwide including: United States, Mexico,&lt;br/&gt;Brazil, Belgium,
Australia, and the United Kingdom. HQA8 it the eighth of a series of
meetings&lt;br/&gt;on a field that began with the pioneering work of Yves Couder
and Emmanuel Fort on walking&lt;br/&gt;droplets. A liquid droplet can ?walk? by
bouncing on the surface of a vibrating bath of the same&lt;br/&gt;liquid through
a resonant interaction with the wave field it creates. The ensemble of drop
and&lt;br/&gt;waves has been called a walker, which constitutes a wave-particle
association at the macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;scale which have been shown to exhibit
several quantum-like features. Funding will be used to&lt;br/&gt;provide travel
support for students and researchers that would otherwise be unable to attend
as&lt;br/&gt;well as to support some costs associated with the workshop
itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
