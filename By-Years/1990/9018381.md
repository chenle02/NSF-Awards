The magnitude of the Yellowstone fires of 1988, which were the largest fires
every experienced in a national park within the continental United States, has
created an exceptional opportunity to address some of the central questions in
ecology today. Drs. Romme, Turner and Gardner will use the Yellowstone National
Park fires to ask three basic questions: First, how climate and landscape
pattern interact to create situations in which extremely large fires are
possible. The investigator's previous experience suggest that there may be
thresholds in parameters of landscape structure and meteorological conditions
that interact to control fire size. They propose to identify the thresholds and
then use them in a modeling approach to explore the implications of global
climate change for Yellowstone's disturbance regime. Second, Drs. Romme, Turner
and Gardner ask how fire size affects landscape pattern. They hypothesize that
landscape heterogeneity is greatest with fires of intermediate size and least
with very small or very large fires. They will test this hypothesis by using
remotely sensed imagery and the Park's geographic information system. Third,
they ask how plants having different modes of reproduction respond to fire size,
severity, and heterogeneity. They will sample areas burned from 1972 to 1988 in
three successive field seasons to test specific hypotheses relating landscape
parameters (e.g. the size of a burned patch, distance from an unburned edge, and
internal heterogeneity of a burned patch) to the reestablishment of individual
species and to community richness. This investigation of Yellowstone fires will
not only help us understand the events of 1988 but will provide insights into
interactions between vegetation patterns and ecological processes in all
landscapes. Drs. Romme, Turner and Gardner are international experts in the area
of landscape ecology. The facilities for this research are excellent.
