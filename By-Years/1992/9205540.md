The Department of Mathematics at Rice University will purchase the following
equipment: one file server, one compute server, two hard disks, one compact disk
reader (CDROM), six X- window terminals (one with color monitor), hardware to
connect terminals to system, one printer, and the software Mathematica. This
equipment will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for projects in Differential Geometry and Analysis by
Robert Hardt, Michael Wolf and Robin Forman, Linking Phenomena in Three-
Dimensions by Tim Cochran, and in Ergodic Theory and Combinatorial Number Theory
by Michael Boshernitzan. The methods employed will stress symbolic, algebraic
and graphical computation applied to problems of inherent scientific interest by
researchers well-established in their fields.
