1151033&lt;br/&gt;Henry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Biosensing
program supports the development of novel carbohydrate biorecognition molecules
that could be used both for in vivo and in vitro detection of structure specific
forms of beta amyloid, the primary protein component of senile plaques in
Alzheimer's disease. The work will contribute to the development of new methods
for diagnosing and following disease progression in Alzheimer's patients. The
need for good quantitative clinical measures is needed for successful
development of new drugs to treat this progressive neurological disease.
