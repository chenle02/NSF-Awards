This research will provide critical operational support and related scientific
applications for TOGA/COARE using McIDAS (Man- computer Interactive Data Access
System) workstations. The TOGA/COARE Intensive Observing Period (IOP) will take
place in a data sparse region of the far Western Tropical Pacific from November
92 through February 93. TOGA/COARE must rely on satellite imagery and global
circulation model (GCM) analyses and forecasts for making daily operational
decisions during the IOP. McIDAS is the most advanced tool for synthesizing
satellite imagery with thermodynamic and dynamic fields anlayzed by GCM and and
regional models. As part of this project, scientific and logistic support will
be provided during the IOP with two dedicated McIDAS workstations. Most data
will be obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology McIDAS in Australia with some
additions from the Wisconsin McIDAS through Internet. McIDAS workstations will
be placed at two key locations: the COARE Operations Center in Townsville,
Queensland, Australia and in Honiara, Guadacanal, Solomon Islands, where
critical operational decisions will be made. Besides providing all available
data, analyses, and forecasts during the IOP, this project includes a series of
pre-IOP and past IOP studies. The pre-IOP study will compare GCM analyses and
forecasts to satellite imagery from the year before COARE to evaluate the models
and assess forecasting skill. The past IOP study will focus on summarizing the
weather and cloud events of the IOP and completing the GCM evaluations begun in
the pre-IOP. The comparisons of analyses and model forecasts made during the
IOP.
