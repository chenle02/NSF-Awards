The genetics of adaptation will be examined in the Leviviridae, a group of
single stranded RNA phage. The phage will be selected for growth at high
temperature. High temperature inhibits the growth of the wild-type phage.
However, after propagating the phage at high temperature for several
generations, phage fitness recovers. In this study, eight different phage
species will be propagated (via serial transfer) at high temperature. The
genetic changes associated with adaptation to fast growth at high temperature
will be assayed by completely sequencing the evolved phage and comparing these
sequences to the ancestral sequence for each species. The specific questions
that will be addressed include: (1) what are the genetic changes associated with
adaptation to high temperature, (2) what are the fitness effects of the genetic
changes, (3) what is the distribution of fitness effects of mutations that are
fixed during the course of adaptive evolution, (4) is the evolution repeatable
within a phage species, (5) to what extent does the phylogeny of the species
predict specific change associated with adaptation to growth at high
temperature, and, (6) to what extent do changes in the RNA molecule increase the
stability of important stem-loop structures at high temperature? The Leviviridae
are unique in that they have a very high mutation rate and the function of much
of the secondary structure of the RNA molecule has been worked out; hence, the
functional significance of many adaptive changes can be understood. Moreover,
because a well-supported phylogeny of the group exists, the genetic changes can
be placed into a phylogenetic context.
