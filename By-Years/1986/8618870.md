This grant supports a manufacturing forum which will be undertaken by the
National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences. It
provides policy- makers from government, industry, labor, and universities an
opportunity to meet and discuss issues that influence the overall
competitiveness of U.S. industries engaged in manufacturing. While there is wide
recognition that efforts are needed to improve the environment in which
manufacturing and industry operate, no clear concensus of agenda specific
actions has emerged. This grant provides a forum where such actions can be
considered and, if necessary, recommended. Broad concerns with these issues in
general has been represented by government, industry, and academe during a
meeting that was convened by the Manufacturing Studies Board of the National
Research Council in February 1986. It was recommended that a manufacturers forum
should be created to bring together leaders of activities related to
manufacturing, to exchange views and review alternative actions. This request is
fully consistent with the Directorate for Engineering's objective of
"stimulating the application of engineering knowledge to the solution of
significant problems of national interest."
