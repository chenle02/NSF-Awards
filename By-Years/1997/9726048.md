ABSTRACT EEC - 9726048 LEE The polymer industry is one of the major industries
of the U.S. and it continues to grow. Research in polymer composites is an
important growing sector which needs research to maintain the U.S. lead in the
global market. A planning grant (EEC-9612323) was awarded to Ohio State
University to determine if an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering was feasible and viable. As a
result of the planning award, Ohio State University has raised $296,000 in
membership funds and approximately another $300,000 in "in-kind" support for an
Industry/University Research Center for Advanced Polymer and Composition
Engineering. The research agenda for the Center will address projects in
Advanced Plastics Processing, Thermostat Polymers and Composite Manufacturing,
Joining of Plastic Parts via Integral Attachments and Design and Die/Mold
Manufacturing. The award is being cost shared by Dr. J. Lee, Program Director,
Materials Processing and Manufacturing Program.
