A key challenge of drawing conclusions about a population from a sample of
individuals is how to accurately describe the uncertainty about the population
average because one only observes a sample, rather than the whole population.
The standard approach relies on approximating the distribution of the sample
average by a bell-shaped distribution, whose spread can be estimated by the
variability of the sample observations. When the underlying population
distribution is not bell shaped, this approximation becomes poor in small
samples, leading to a wrong representation of the uncertainty about the
population average. This proposal will develop a new method for describing the
uncertainty that remains accurate even for non-bell-shaped populations. This is
done by modelling the potentially non-bell-shaped structure in the construction
of the uncertainty estimate. More complicated problems of drawing conclusions
can be cast into drawing conclusions about the average of a suitably defined
population. The results of this research could thus have many practical
applications in the social sciences and improve business and policy decision
making. The end results are to increase economic efficiency and speed up
economic growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to develop an
alternative to standard t-statistic-based inference about the mean from a sample
of i.i.d. observations that better controls size for moderately heavy-tailed
underlying populations. It combines extreme value theory for the k smallest and
k largest observations with a normal approximation for the average of the
remaining middle n-2k observations. The mean shift is a function of the same
tail parameters that govern the extreme value distributions, as well as the
realized value of the extreme observations. One thus obtains an approximate
parametric model for 2k+1 observation, with the tail parameters as nuisance
parameters; one can apply numerical techniques to obtain valid and powerful test
in this approximate parametric model. The main theoretical result shows that
this approach represents an improvement over existing method. For populations
with finite variance but infinite third moment, the new approach induces smaller
errors in rejection probability compared to the usual t-statistic, or the
percentile-t bootstrap, at least as long as the population is such that extreme
value theory provides accurate approximations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
