Research in theoretical elementary particle theory will focus on attempts to
relate the fundamentals of string theory, which pertain to very high energies
far beyond those soon to be accessible, to "low-energy" physics which can be
explored with the next generation of accelerators. String theory is a promising
candidate for a theory of all the basic forces of nature, including gravity.
However, it is crucial that ways be found to test this theory experimentally.
The finding of these ways is the intended main thrust of this project.
