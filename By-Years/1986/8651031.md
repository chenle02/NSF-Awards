Laboratory experiences in biochemistry and cell biology at Hood College are
being improved significantly through the recent acquisition of a high
performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Through the use of this instrumentation
in the preparation and analysis of proteins and nucleic acids, students are
developing capabilities in modern separation techniques while gaining a better
appreciation of physiological processes at the molecular level.
