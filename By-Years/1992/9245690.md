This joint workshop will further coordination began at the Panarctic Biota
working group that met a year ago (February 1991) to develop databases on arctic
flora and fauna and will expand the areas of cooperation to fishes and
invertebrate organisms. The ecology of the arctic regions is extremely fragile
and susceptible to stresses caused by economic development and global climate
change. The meeting is being organized by Dr. David Murray of the University of
Alaska at Fairbanks and Academician Vladimir Sokolov of the Institute of
Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
This project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading researchers in the United States and Russia to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
