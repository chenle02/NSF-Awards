Sensory Coding and the Natural Environment Gordon
Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an international meeting on
the properties of complex natural environmental stimuli, and the encoding and
processing of these stimuli by biological systems. The theme of the meeting is
highly interdisciplinary, and the organizers seek to draw attendees from a
variety of backgrounds to promote cross-fertilization, including systems and
cognitive neuroscience, perceptual psychology, statistics, signal processing,
and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting has three fundamental
components that are of central importance to the development of robust machine
intelligence: the development of sophisticated (i.e., non-Gaussian) source
models; identification, codification, and exploitation of principles for
biological processing of diverse and complex sensory patterns; and neural
decoding-- the extraction of information about the sensory world directly from
the spiking activity of single cells or populations of cells. This topic has
direct application to brain-computer interfaces and robotic control of movement.
The meeting will help fulfill the need to educate both students and current
investigators about the techniques, methodologies, and types of results emerging
from this field.&lt;br/&gt;
