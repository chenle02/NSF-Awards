*** Hashish 9400674 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will develop a prototype continuous-pumping abrasive suspension jet (ASJ)
cutting system for shallow and deep underwater applications. Successful
completion of the Phase I research effort has shown that high-pressure ASJ is a
feasible concept for use in underwater cutting of rocks and metals. Phase I
program results demonstrated the method to be superior to previous abrasive jet
techniques in submerged environments simulating up to 6,100-m (20,000-ft.) ocean
depths. Extensive laboratory tests will be performed during Phase II that will
result in scientific data, prediction models, and a basic understanding of the
submerged material removal process by high-velocity jets. Phase III
commercialization activities will include the delivery of a prototype ASJ to
either the Navy or Oceaneering Technologies for field testing and demonstration.
The successful development of this technology will enable the advantages of ASJ
cutting to be readily adapted to platforms, remotely operated vehicles,
submersibles, and manual operations. There are a wide range of commercial and
government applications for ASJ technology including cleaning and descaling;
mining; exploration; underwater construction; salvage, decomissioning and
removal; and pipeline repair. Use of ASJ technology in these applications will
prove more economical and environmentally benign than existing underwater
cutting technologies. Keywords: Abrasive suspension jet, Underwater cutting,
