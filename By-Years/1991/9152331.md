The purpose of this project is to update a program in cell and molecular biology
at a college that serves adult learners and a significant number of minorities
and women. Students are introduced to basic experiments in molecular biology by
incorporating modern DNA technology into an existing cell biology course. A
microcentrifuge, electrophoresis chambers and shaking water bath allow students
to transform E. coli with p-amp and recombinant DNA, isolate DNA, perform DNA
restriction digests and analyze their results using electrophoresis. These
experiments provide the student with 'hands-on experience' in DNA
science.Instruction in cell biology is enhanced by familiarizing students with
tools by which cells and their constituent components can be examined, analyzed
and documented. A phase contrast microscope allows students to examine living
cells, protozoans and bacteria. Electrophoresis units for protein separation are
used by students and replace demonstration laboratories. Darkroom equipment
(enlarger and ektamatic processor) give students experience in photomicrography
and a visual record of their work with isolated organelles, stained chromosomes
and transcriptionally active nucleoli, and cytochemical localization of
carbohydrates.
