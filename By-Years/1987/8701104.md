This project is for basic research in the foundations of computing. The major
emphasis is in the area of inductive inference, the capabilities and limitations
of computers to learn by example. Several problems dealing with multiple machine
inference, probabilistic inference, and the complexity of inference will be
studied. The problem of inductive inference is related to the problem of program
testing. The continued exportation of ideas and techniques from the field of
inductive inference to applications concerning the testing of programs will be a
main focus of this research. Other problems under study include foundational
issues concerning data flow architectures and implementations of applicative
programming languages. Issues and problems concerning abstract complexity theory
have come out of the preliminary work of a previous NSF project. The fundamental
problem addressed in this research is to classify and otherwise delimit the
space of complexity measures that apply to a given programming system.
