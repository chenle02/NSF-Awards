The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
Project is the development of an oral drug to reduce the side-effects of
radiation injury to the digestive system, such as is common with cancer
patients. Radiation therapy is one of the most important and effective treatment
strategies available to oncologists. It is prescribed to more than 8 million
cancer patients in the United States each year, but less than half complete
their treatment due to the side effects. These gastrointestinal side effects
include nausea, vomiting, pain, and problems with digestion â€“ with the potential
for long-term damage to the gut that can prove fatal. Presently, no treatments
treat these gut-related side-effects of radiation. This project advances a
treatment for this condition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility of
scaling a milk-exosome isolation technology as a first step toward using
exosomes for an orally available radio-protective therapeutic. This award will
establish proof-of-principle for a safe, orally administered drug delivery
platform capable of delivering biologic and small molecule therapeutics for a
range of diseases, with radiation disease as the first target. The first aim
will determine scaling efficacy by testing each step at large-scale, then
verifying with a panel of assays. The second aim will establish the radio-
protectant potential of the therapeutic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
