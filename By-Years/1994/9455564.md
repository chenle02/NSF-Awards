9455564 Fathe A team of Occidental faculty members in physics and mathematics
are constructing a unified freshman program in physics and calculus. The
students in the program are those with some deficiencies in pre-college
mathematics and science preparation, but who might be motivated to pursue a
science or mathematics program as a background for a variety of careers,
including medicine, and K-12 teaching. These students are disproportionally
female, Latino, and African-American, groups which have long been under-
represented in mathematics and science-based careers. The students enroll in a
year-long course consisting of 4 units in the fall semester and 8 units in the
spring semester. The pace is relaxed to permit students time to consolidate
their mathematics skills and develop physical intuition. In addition, the course
includes appropriate use of technology for analysis, simulation and calculation,
carefully designed group assignments and projects, and frequent writing
assignments. Further, the students are offered the opportunity to share a
corridor in a campus residence hall. Employment of upper division science
students as teaching assistants and residence hall staff helps to integrate
college learning with college life. By the end of the program, the students will
have a solid understanding of how calculus and physics develop from a few
fundamental ideas, and how the disciplines are interrelated. They will develop
the mastery of basic math, physics, and communication skills necessary to
support these intellectual goals. More importantly, the students will develop
attitudes and learning styles that will support further study and success in
science and mathematics.
