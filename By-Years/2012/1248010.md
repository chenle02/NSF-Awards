Terrestrial-based wireless transmitters can often cause interference to space-
based remote sensing instrumentation, such as satellites that are designed to
probe the Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere. Remote sensing observations of
the Earth are often acquired using low-Earth orbit satellites that scan a narrow
swath of the Earth at any one time, and orbit the Earth once each 90 minutes or
so. The satellite detectors are often exposed to specific interference sources
for only a few tens of milliseconds as the satellite passes overhead and the
detector beam passes over the Earth's surface at very high speed, but that
exposure is sufficient to produce substantial interference to the very sensitive
observations being acquired by the satellite. One method of mitigating the
interference is to synchronize very brief blanking of terrestrial interference
sources as a remote sensing satellite using the same band passes overhead,
leveraging the fact that satellite orbits are very well known and the specific
point of time at which a sensor pixel will be passing over a particular point on
the Earth can be determined with high accuracy. This method is one example of a
broader application of coordinated interference mitigation techniques that will
be explored as part of this research. The broader applications may extend beyond
satellites to cases of interference between and among a large variety of land-,
air-, and space-based users.
