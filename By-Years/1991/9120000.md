The Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity undertakes to
understand the materials, the phenomenon, and possible applications of high
temperature superconductivity by bringing together human resources and
facilities from four institutions with strong capabilities in both
superconductivity and materials research: the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and Argonne
National Laboratory. Center chemists, physicists, materials scientists, and
engineers, including theorists and experimentalists, collaborate to design and
carry forward an integrated research and education program. The mission of
Center research is to establish the character and origin of the superconducting
state and its dependence on materials properties, thereby establishing a
knowledge base for applications. Through workshops, collaborations, and visitor
programs, the benefits of the Center are extended to colleagues in industry and
in other universities and national laboratories. The Center for
Superconductivity is directed by Professor Miles V. Klein.
