Project description for general audience:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global
community is currently experiencing unprecedented levels of forced migration;
59.5 million individuals around the world have been displaced involuntarily
owing to conflict, human rights violations, and other forms of persecution. This
research project examines how the local, host population is affected by an
influx of refugees, specifically with regards to host citizens' national
identity, demand for state-provided public goods and services, and preferences
over immigration policies. The research examines whether or not refugees may
strengthen nearby native citizens' national identity and solidarity. It involves
a survey with citizen respondents in Tanzania, a country with an extensive
history of hosting various refugee groups. This survey will compare attitudes
and behaviors of citizens living in refugee-hosting districts to those in
similar districts without refugees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technical
description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do refugees impact their local, host
environments? This research project theorizes that the exogenous shock of forced
migration may have unintended yet positive consequences for nationalism and
nation-building in the host country. Refugees may strengthen nearby native
citizens' nationalism as national identity is the obvious point of difference
between natives and refugees. Additionally, the influx of international and
government aid into refugee camps often stands in contrast to the lack of local
public goods in nearby host communities. Refugees, by challenging national
borders and highlighting inequalities in welfare, can inadvertently spur host
citizens to rally around their national identity and better cooperate in
providing and demanding for public goods and services. The survey randomly
varies the level of salience of refugees and uses new methods to measure the
complex dimensions of national identity and migrant threat.
