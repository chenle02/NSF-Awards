INTELLECTUAL MERIT: &lt;br/&gt;The bacteria that inhabit the mammalian
gastrointestinal tract, referred to as the microbiota, generally benefit the
overall host physiology and well-being. Recent studies suggest that intestinal
microbiota are also major contributors to a complex signaling network in the
human gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, it is hypothesized that bacterial
molecules produced by the intestinal microbiota will be recognized by intestinal
cells as a result of their close spatial association within this ecological
niche. At the core of signaling network are tryptophan metabolites that appear
to contribute to both the intestinal and microbiota fitness. This project will
test the hypothesis that tryptophan metabolites affect dentritic cells in a way
that benefits the intestinal environment as well as the microbiota to create a
beneficial gut mucosal ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:
&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the communication of host cells with
signals produced by the intestinal microbiota, which is an important factor in
human/microbiota symbiotic relationship. The educational and outreach component
of this proposal focuses on two activities to increase the number of
underrepresented students that pursue advanced degrees in biological sciences.
First, the Principal Investigator serves as a role model for underrepresented
students and has established a continuous pipeline of undergraduate students
that receive research training in the PI's laboratory. Second, this project will
develop an institutional program that creates opportunities for the Texas
A&amp;M Hispanic Minority Serving Institution (HSI) in the Texas A&amp;M
University System. These students are prepared research and training in graduate
or medical school at the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center.
