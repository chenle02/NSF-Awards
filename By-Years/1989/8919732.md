This project supports a "Workshop on Scientific Computing Performance Analysis"
to be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, on
August 29-31, 1989. Attendees will come from academia/industry, the national
laboratories and the national supercomputer centers. The workshop will
concentrate on identifying areas of research opportunity related to performance
analysis of high performance computing systems and scientific workload
characterization. Research on these and related topics is seen as having
significant value in enhancing the efficient use of current, conventional
supercomputers and in establishing measures of assessing the potential of newer
parallel architectures.
