ABSTRACT

The principal investigator will conduct research on two projects which relate to
both Operator Theory and Geometry of Banach spaces. The recent solution of the
complex version of the Klee's Conjecture using ideas from Operator Theory
suggests further research on support points and convex sets. Some new geometric
approaches will be used for investigating the Invariant Subspace Problem in
general Banach Spaces.

The principal investigator recently solved a long-standing problem, constructing
a convex body which has no tangent hyper-planes. It is important to understand
under which conditions such a strange phenomenon can exist. Another project
starts with the fundamental fact that every matrix has an eigenvector. A natural
extension of this to infinite-dimensional spaces would be that a linear operator
has an invariant subspace. We will investigate whether this statement is true in
a number of important cases.
