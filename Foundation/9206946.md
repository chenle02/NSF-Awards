Three faculty investigators and their graduate students are involved in this
project. Martin and Steel will work in set theory. Steel, and Martin to some
extent, will concentrate on inner model theory and on strong forms of
determinacy. Martin also expects to complete his monograph on proofs of
determinacy. Moschovakis will work in the theory of algorithms and its
applications to the foundations of mathematical computer science. Set theory
lies at the foundation of all mathematics. Important questions concern the
axioms that underly all number systems, algebra, geometry and analysis. Are
certain axioms necessary? Are they irrelevant in certain contexts? Particularly
significant in this regard is the so-called Axiom of Determinacy, which can be
framed as a statement that a certain two-person game has a winning strategy for
one player or the other. The game in question involves constructing a set by
having the two players alternate in selecting members for it.
