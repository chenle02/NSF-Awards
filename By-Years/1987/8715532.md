The objective of this project is to document the low frequency (frequency less
than 1 GHz) characteristics of variable extragalactic radio sources. These data
will be compared with the predictions of the various mechanisms which have been
proposed for this activity. These mechanisms can be divided into: a) Intrinsic
variability of a relativistically evolving source, and b) Extrinsic variability
due to scattering or absorption in the intervening medium. In order to decide
between the hypotheses, observations will be carried out to: a) Continue with
the periodic measurements of the flux density of radio sources at low
frequencies (318 MHz and 430 MHz), b) Obtain high resolution images of the
sources at low frequencies (327 MHz) using Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI), and c) Obtain low frequency (327 MHz) images of these sources at the
Very Large Array (VLA). The data base will be augmented by data from a
collaboration with other groups working at radio and optical wavelengths. The
participation of undergraduate and graduate students in this project, which
involves international cooperation and the use of modern and sophisticated
techniques, represents for them challenging and rewarding opportunities.
