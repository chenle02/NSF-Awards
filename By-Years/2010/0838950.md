his effort seeks to develop a better understanding of how the nonlinearly
coupled thermosphere and ionosphere are driven asymmetrically in polar storm
events, and how coupling between these domains affects overall system-level
response. Goals of the project are to a) specify electrodynamic drivers in the
northern and southern hemispheres during specific storms with newly available
Antarctic data, b) investigate how the hemispherically asymmetric magnetic field
configuration controls system-level response to strong driving, c) examine the
hemispheric asymmetric energy and momentum transfer between the ionosphere and
thermosphere and how these processes affect the global response to different
driving conditions, and d) understand how the polar thermospheric background and
disturbance neutral winds asymmetrically develop under different driving
conditions.

Along with furtherance of space-weather objectives, the training of graduate
students provides the broader impact to this proposed research grounding this
effort in an educational mission.
