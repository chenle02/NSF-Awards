This research is concerned with the structure and representations of algebraic
groups and associated finite groups. The principal investigator will establish
results on the structure and embedding of reductive subgroups of simple
algebraic groups; work on linking the subgroup structure of finite groups to
that of algebraic groups; study the representation theory of the symmetric
groups over fields of positive characteristic; and study representations of
finite groups of Lie type over a field of the defining characteristic. A group
is an algebraic structure with a single operation. It appears in many areas of
mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry. The fundamental building blocks
of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of the major results in
mathematics of the past decade is the classification of the finite simple
groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal pages. This
research is aimed at using this classification in the study of arbitrary finite
groups.
