An Engineering Foundation Conference on Flocculation, Sedimentation and
Consolidation will be held at Sea Island, Georgia, on January 27 - February 1,
1985. It is planned to review the status of these phenomena and to identify the
critical research needs. Application of the work varies from mineral, civil, and
chemical to coastal engineering. In addition, aggregation and settling in
nonaqueous media is of significance in coal liquefaction, tar sands processing,
paint and pigments, and electrophoretic display devices. Major problems exist in
disposal of fine mineral wastes where settling and consolidation are important.
The role of flocculation of clays with polymers in achieving this objective is
not very well understood. Centrifuge modeling has improved the predictability of
consolidation behavior of fine particle sediments, but the potential of applying
the centrifuge model in conjunction with colloid and surface chemical aspects of
particle interactions is yet to be explored.
