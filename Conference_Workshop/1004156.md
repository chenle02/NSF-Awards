This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "2010 Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 23 to April 25, 2010.

This annual conference, of which the 2010 meeting will be the thirteenth in the
series, celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B.
Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of
partial differential equations. The 2010 program will feature two principle
speakers (Tristan Riviere and Daniel Tataru), each of whom will give a two-hour
lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by mathematicians in
the early stages of their careers (e.g., Inwon Kim, Alexander Olevskii, Natasa
Sesum, Andrej Zlatos). The program allows ample time for informal discussion
among the participants.
