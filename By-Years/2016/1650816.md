The Sixth Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place on
January 17 2017, as part of the flagship programming language conference,
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which will be held in Paris, France.
This grant will support approximately 8 students to attend the PLMW event plus
the POPL conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN
PAC) for students who are presenting papers at POPL, this proposal is intended
specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups
and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader
significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden
participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from
leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next
generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important
research arena.
