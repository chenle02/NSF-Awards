Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out on a model liquid
crystal system to study a variety of non-equilibrium phenomena. The phase
ordering dynamics of a quenched nematic liquid crystal will be investigated with
a special emphasis on the role of the topological defects in the equilibration
process. A very rapid quench of a nematic below its crystallization point will
be undertaken in an effort to create and study an anisotropic glassy system.
Algorithms will be developed so that the simulations can run efficiently on
massively parallel machines. If successful, this work will further the
understanding of non- equilibrium phenomena in complex fluids and anisotropic
systems, as well as providing the first numerical simulations of topological
defects in fluid systems. It will also further develop the computational
approach required to efficiently run molecular dynamics simulations on massively
parallel machines. This research is jointly supported by the Divisions of
Materials Research and Advanced Scientific Computing as part of the
Computational Approaches to Real Materials Initiative which is a component of
the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative. %%% This
computational research will focus on understanding the properties of liquid
crystals, such as are used in video displays, when they are rapidly cooled.
During the cooling process various defects are frozen into the liquid crystal
and affect its properties. This cooling process is too complex to be modeled
analytically and is only amenable to computational analysis. Thus, this project,
which is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials Research and Advancd
Scientific Computing, involves both condensed matter physicists and computer
scientists. The computational work will be implemented on the emerging parallel
computers. The research is supported through the Computational Approaches to
Real Materials program within the High Performance Computing and Communication
Initiative.
