We propose a conference, titled From A=B to Z=60, in honor of Doron Zeilberger's
60th birthday to be hosted by the mathematics department of Rutgers University
and DIMACS (Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science). Both the
DIMACS center and the mathematics department of Rutgers University are located
in Piscataway, New Jersey. The goal of this conference, in addition to honoring
and celebrating the work of Zeilberger, is to serve as a gathering place for
those working in classical combinatorics, experimental mathematics, and other
areas of combinatorics not based on graph theory. We surely expect that
significant collaborative work will result from the proposed conference and that
students will make some valuable contributions in addition to valuable contacts.
