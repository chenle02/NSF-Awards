Proposal Number: ECS-9632377 Principal Investigator: John Scharer/University of
Wisconsin Title: Physics and Simulation of Helicon Plasma Sources Abstract This
research will provide a coordinated theoretical, computational and experimental
research program on helicon plasma sources. These high density efficient sources
are of interest for a variety of applications: neutral beam sub-micron etching
of semiconductors, processing of large flat panel display, materials surface
modification, use as a large volume plasma source for space simulations and for
basic plasma source and wave propagation studies. Despite strong interest in
these source few detailed simulations have been carried out to better model and
understand helicon sources. The proposed study is very through and will address
several important points. Among these are: incorporation of off diagonal hot
plasmas dielectric tensor terms which describe transit time damping as well as
Landau process, into the ANTENA2 code (developed by Professor Scharer) which is
used to describe 3-D wave fields and radial collisional and collisionless power
absorption for different helicon antenna coil configurations and radial plasma
profiles. Also the ANTENA2 code will be interfaced to the INDUCT95 transport
code to examine the self-consistent plasma profile evolution and the possibly
differing roles of bulk and fast electrons as observed in experiments. The
availability of the INDUCT95 code free of charge from an independent
collaboration is a major gain to the proposed effort. The independent
collaborators wants the opportunity to develop the INDUCT95 transport code in
tandem with the ANTENA2 code. Also, as a service to the community, the ANTENA2
code will be made generally available to other researchers during the source of
the grant to answer substantial requests for the code.
