Atmospheric aerosols will be sampled at an altitude in the free troposphere at
Mauna Loa in Hawaii. The project will extend an existing 15-year program of
aerosol sampling at the same location. It will include the laboratory analysis
of the collected samples and of an existing backlog of earlier samples. The
primary objective is to contribute to a long-term set of baseline data on the
composition of the aerosol burden of the free troposphere in remote regions.
Such a data set will constitute a record of changes in atmospheric composition
that should reflect varying effects of anthropogenic pollutant sources on the
background composition of the atmosphere. The laboratory work will emphasize
neutron activation analysis for trace elements, which may carry "signatures" of
natural or anthropogenic sources.
