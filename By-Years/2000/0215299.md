This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
autonomous method for curing voltage collapse and blackout in a power system
that may occur when a loadflow has no solution. This method will identify over
100 different voltage collapse problems in a system when current methods may
only detect two or three. It can find 1000 or more double equipment outages that
have no loadflow solution that are unknown due to the overwhelming computation
required to find them. For each such equipment outage that has no loadflow
solution, the method will determine (a) if the lack of solution is due to
loadflow algorithm convergence problems or not; (b) which of the over 100
voltage collapse problems is producing the blackout; (c) whether the lack of
solution is due to insufficient sufficient reactive supply and the corrective or
preventive control that would enable a loadflow solution to be found; (d)
whether the lack of solution is due to network reactive losses that require
reduction in load(emergency control) to enable a loadflow solution to be found;
(e) the corrective and/or emergency controls that require very few control
changes because it depends on the structure of the subsystem that initiates the
blackout. the method would be used in design, scheduling, and in on-line control
of power systems. Currently, it takes an average of 15 hours of engineering
manpower/ computation time to obtain a solution and in many cases no solution
can be found. The proposed method can be expected to obtain a preventive,
corrective or emergency control solution for every equipment outage that has no
solution in seconds and without human intervention. It accomplishes the task
because it learns and acquires knowledge of the structure of the system that
produces cascading instability that is voltage collapse and that produces
blackout.

This project has substantial commercial potential by reducing blackouts and the
economic and societal costs associated with power interruption.
