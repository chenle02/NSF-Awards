This is a project on algebraic geometry, which is one of the oldest disciplines
in mathematics. It studies geometric objects called varieties that are defined
by algebraic equations. Algebraic geometry has important connections to
mathematical physics and coding theory. The intellectual impacts of the proposal
are on improving our understanding on the relations between the geometry of
algebraic curves and higher dimensional varieties to the set of relations among
the equations defining the varieties. These relations are called the syzygies of
the varieties. The PI will investigate the properties of the syzygies of
algebraic curves and higher dimensional varieties. The PI also plans to study
the irrationality of an algebraic variety, a measure of the complexity of the
variety. This project has extensive educational and training components.

The PI and his collaborator Lazarsfeld will study syzygies by of the curves
using the geometric properties of the subvarieties of the Hilbert schemes of
points on the curve. They will investigate the asymptotic behavior of syzygies
of an algebraic varieties and their relations to the intrinsic geometry of the
variety. The proposed program would extend the classical results previously only
known in the case of algebraic curves to higher dimensional varieties. Another
part of this project is the study of the irrationality of an algebraic variety
with emphasis on the case when the variety is a very general polarized K3
surface. Together with Xudong Zheng (Johns Hopkins University), the PI will
study the Hilbert schemes of points for singular surfaces; in particular, the
relations between the singularities of the surfaces and the geometry of Hilbert
schemes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
