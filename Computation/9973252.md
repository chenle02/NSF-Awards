Abstract: Given a finite ground set of elements which can be uniquely
characterized as positive or negative, the object of group testing is to
optimize the identification of the positive objects by performing 0, 1 tests on
subsets or pools of the ground set. Group testing algorithms are search
algorithms. If one thinks of a search algorithm as a battery of tests, then no
test in a nonadaptive group testing algorithm can be modified by the results of
any other test. Thus the order in which the tests are performed is irrelevant.
Depending upon the real world problem that is being modeled, it is often the
case that the tests can be carried out simultaneously. Hence, nonadaptive search
algorithms are well suited for parallel processing and computing when memory or
data storage capability is limited. Every parallel algorithm is nonadaptive. In
this project, we propose to use and develop combinatorial and algebraic codes to
construct nonadaptive group testing algorithms from the matrix representations
of these codes. A specific aim of this proposal is to develop more efficient
high throughput group testing algorithms that find a large number of positives
when testing error rates can range up to 10%.

From an applied point of view, the ability to effectively and efficiently search
for unknown objects is essential to many endeavors in the areas of
biotechnology, telecommunications, and national security. The unknown objects
may be the locations of particular DNA sequences or a group of computer hackers.
Because of their computational power, group testing algorithms play a pivotal
role in the Human Genome Project and they are essential in the screening many
different kinds of biological and chemical data bases. Group testing algorithms
have also been applied to computer network protocols and can be used in the
development of computer intrusion detection software.
