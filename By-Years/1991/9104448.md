This research continues three seismotectonic investigations. In the first
study, VLBI data are being used to determine regional scale crustal deformation
at the North American-Pacific plate boundary. In the second, synthetic
earthquake catalogs are being developed using a model of strain accumulation on
fault segments and their interactive failure. In the third, geologic data are
being used to investigate the evolution of the Santa Cruz mountains and to
relate this evolution to North American- Pacific plate motion. The goal of the
project is to develop quantitative pictures of coseismic and interseismic strain
accumulation and release associated with major faults in western North America.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
