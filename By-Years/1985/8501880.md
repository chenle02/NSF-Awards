Orthopedic surgeons have found that many total hip replacements fail after
several years, requiring re-operation. This problem has generated much research
to find the cause. Mechanical failure processes at the cancellous bone/PMMA
cement interface will be studied using methods from fracture mechanics and
damage theory. The hypothesis to be tested is that fibrous tissue at the
interface is caused by relative motion between bone and cement due to crack
propagation. Crack propagation models will be developed to test this theory.
