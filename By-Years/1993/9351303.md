The project will use NMR methods as a basis for the development and
implementation of a new integrated laboratory course designed for advanced
undergraduate chemistry students. This course will consist of fourteen
experiments, the vast majority of which will involve elements of both chemical
synthesis and the application of sophisticated instrumental analysis techniques.
It will replace individual advanced laboratory courses in organic chemistry,
inorganic chemistry, instrumental analysis, and physical chemistry. The
exercises were chosen to be representative of research problems in chemistry and
biochemistry, thereby introducing students to the excitement of modem
experimentation in these areas. Specific applications include multi-nuclear
characterization of synthetic products, the use of NMR methods in a kinetic
determination, the determination of reaction enantioselectivity with chiral
shift reagents, and studies of structure, conformation, and solution dynamics
using NOE and two-dimensional techniques. In several cases students will be
encouraged to choose their own experi- mental approach, and we will emphasize
the importance of meeting as a group to share data and observations.
