This project aims to understand the accumulation of free energy in the solar
corona, the destabilization of energized magnetic field, and the rapid release
of free energy in flares and mass ejections. Coronal magnetic energy ultimately
arises from kinetic energy of the convection zone, but the controversy is
whether the magnetic fields already carry free energy when they erupt from the
photosphere to form active regions, free energy propagates into the corona from
the deep convection zone, or the fields are stressed by motions of their
photospheric footprints after eruption. The investigators will examine the
propagation of twist along a nonuniform flux tube. In particular, they will
determine the growth rate and characteristics of the kink instability in a
horizontal flux tube lying above the photosphere. In addition, they will
investigate the release of magnetic energy subsequent to the formation of
current sheets.
