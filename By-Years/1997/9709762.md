This project supports the research of a team of anthropologists and ecologists
from Colorado State University studying the degree to which indigenous peoples
in Tanzania can continue to successfully pursue their traditional economic
systems within the larger context of state and local government economic and
environmental policies. The site of the research is the Ngorongoro Conservation
Area, a biodiversity conservation site inhabited by the Maasai people. The
researchers will compare the tribal economic life within the Conservation Area
with the life of comparable people living in an adjacent district where
conservation policies are less restrictive. The project will examine the causes
of the Maasai's economic difficulties, determine the extent to which they are
related to conservation policies versus regional environmental and economic
patterns, and assess how conservation policies, development interventions and
local land use might be altered in the future to improve the people's situation
while still maintaining ecosystem integrity. Methods will include qualitative
participant observation and interviewing with quantitative surveys and land use
analysis. This research is important because traditional people the world over
often believe that conservation policies are antithetical to their own economic
well-being. By explicitly comparing the economic situation of the same people,
one group living under the weight of conservation policies and the other
relatively free of them, but both subject to regional and national economic and
socio-political constraints, the project will advance our understanding of the
specific effects of conservation policies. The resulting information will be of
great interest to conservation and development planners who must confront
similar issues in other parts of the world.
