In this proposal, our purpose is to ascertain the determinants of job
satisfaction and happiness with family life from among twenty-six variables that
are believed to have an influence upon both. In order to determine the relative
importance of the variables in accounting for the variations in both job
satisfaction and happiness in family life, a block-recursive model depicting the
bariable relationships has been developed and is to be subjected to empirical
testing on a sample of 13,926 black and white female respondents. The
theoretical model will allow us to determine which factors are the most
important in determining job satisfaction and happiness with life. In addition,
it is perceived that the use of a block- recursive model will clarify some of
the confusion existing in the current body of literature regarding the
determinants of job and family satisfaction, while, at the same time, enable us
to suggest a more parsimonious theory regarding the interrelationship of the
variables. The assessment of the relationships of the variables will be
simplified through the use of multiple regression techniques with a multiple-
partial correlational analysis. This technique provides useful statistical data
and tests of statistical significance regarding the interpretation of the data,
and generalization of the findings to the general population of English
speaking, female residents of the United states who are 18, and who do not
reside in an institutional environment.
