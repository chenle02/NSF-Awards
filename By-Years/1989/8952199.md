This project establishes a central laboratory for the study of nonlinear
dynamics, chaos and fractals, and supports coursees in mathematics, the physical
sciences, and engineering. Two mathematics courses -- one for students with no
prior preparation, the other requiring acquaintance with calculus -- use
computers housed in the laboratory for simulation and graphical analysis. The
laboratory also provides hands-on experience for students with some background
in physics in upper- level classical mechanics and a special course solely
devoted to the study of nonlinear vibrations and oscillations in mechanical,
hydrodynamic, and elecrical systems. The equipment in the laboratory will also
be used for demonstrations of physical phenomena with students in the two
mathematics courses. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an
equal match for the NSF award.
