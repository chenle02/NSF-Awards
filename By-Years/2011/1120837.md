F420 Cofactor Dependent Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (FGD) catalyzes the
conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone. The enzymology of
F420 dependent enzymes, such as FGD, has not yet been subject to rigorous
investigation. The overall goal of this research is to understand the function
and hydride transfer reactivity of FGD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using
site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), steady-state and pre-
steady state methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will
support the training of minority students in biochemistry. This work will also
enhance the quality of education for participating students because they will
acquire essential biochemical skills in the field of enzymology. As an African-
American female, the PI is aware of the scarcity of under-represented groups in
the scientific community and would like to provide mentoring opportunities to
all students interested, including those from under-represented groups.
