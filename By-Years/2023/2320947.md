NSF’s Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Initiative motivates and accelerates
collaborative infrastructure building for systems change that broadens
participation in STEM. A key part of the INCLUDES Initiative investment is
building and strengthening a National Network. This National Network is a
collaboration of agencies, organizations, individuals, and projects working
together to design, implement, study, refine, and scale up collaborative change
models and strategies. NSF’s Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Coordination Hub
(the Hub) leads and supports National Network members in building capacity,
developing and sharing knowledge, and making connections to advance the use of
collaborative infrastructure for systems change in STEM. The Hub inspires
innovative solutions to deep-seated challenges and expands the vision of what is
possible. The Hub’s work catalyzes a movement that takes actionable steps to
transform policies, practices, relationships, approaches, and mindsets to
broaden participation in STEM in support of the INCLUDES Initiative vision of a
STEM workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation.

Using a liberatory design framework, the Hub supports INCLUDES-funded projects,
shares learnings, and facilitates connections across the National Network. The
Hub serves as a backbone for an incubator of INCLUDES-funded Alliances and
Collaborative Change Consortia that tests new concepts, practices, and policies.
The Hub employs a thematic approach to equity-driven systems change; amplifies
and elevates the voices and experiences of marginalized populations; takes a
holistic approach to shared measures, including qualitative and quantitative
data and storytelling; and employs strategic research and communications. The
Hub’s work is growing and strengthening the National Network into a vibrant
ecosystem and national resource for demonstrably broadening participation in
STEM.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
