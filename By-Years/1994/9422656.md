9422656 Hoffman There are a number of interdisciplinary issues which are nascent
in network building associated with the "information superhighway" -- privacy,
pricing, and equity, to name a few. Often a broad view of these issues is only
available to those who can attend a number of independently scheduled
policy/issues meetings in Washington. This project brings together experts on
these topics at a fixed time each month to discuss them. A summary of their
talks will be made available for an international audience both in paper and in
electronic form afterwards and will be obtainable from all over the world.
Videotapes of each lecture will be made and available at costs. Moreover, making
some or all of these videotapes available electronically over the Internet will
be explored, and done if feasible.
