The Telecommunications Systems Technology program at the County College of
Morris is improving its Data Communications Laboratory with the addition of a
modern Private Branch Exchange (PBX) Telephone Switch. Students in this
laboratory learn how architecture, functions, interfaces, and protocols
influence the use of the switching system in the telephone industry and how it
serves end users of telephone and information services. The laboratory telephone
system provides Telecommunications Systems Technology students with improved
skills and hands-on laboratory experience and understanding related to courses
in telecommunications, data communications, and electrical engineering
technology.
