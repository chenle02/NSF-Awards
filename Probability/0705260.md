This project outlines some problems which focus on the effect of noise on moving
boundary problems. We are in particular interested in the mathematical
foundations of a one-phase Stefan problem with additive noise. The noise can
take on a number of forms, and the smoothness of the noise will affect the
problems we can hope to consider. We pose a number of specific problems which,
we hope, will resolve some fundamental issues in this area: existence,
approximation, smoothness, and asymptotics.

Moving boundary value problems are one of the key classes of partial
differential equations. The simplest example is ice and water, where the motion
of the boundary between the two depends on the local structure of the interface.
Although these equations are difficult to study, there is a large body of
literature on them. Since noise is ubiquitous in physical systems, it is natural
to study the effect of noise on these systems. Although our research attempts to
develop some of the foundations of stochastic moving boundary value problems, a
number of applied areas (e.g. combustion and porous media) may benefit from the
theory developed in this project.
