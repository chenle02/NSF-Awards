9627085 Mattei The Louisville Science Center will develop "The World We Create",
a 13,000 sq. ft. exhibit which will transform their second floor to an active
learning environment where visitors can explore the simplest element of the
creative process to the most sophisticated networks available to our society.
The activities will be organized into five core exhibit areas: New Way Tunnel,
Think Tank, Inventor's Garage, Chemistry Kitchen, and Tech World and will
reinforce educational reform activities in math, science, problem- solving, team
cooperation, and decision making. In addition to the large number of
interactives, there is a substantial technology/telecommunications component
known as the Tech Forum. This will serve at the home site for the Kentucky
TeleLinking Network (KTLN). The educational objectives of the exhibit were
developed under the guidance of prominent formal educators in the state and they
address both the education reform goals of the state and national science and
math standards. The exhibit has also been developed with direct participation of
a number of private sector partners. It is an impressive community effort. The
exhibit is scheduled to open in March, 1997.
