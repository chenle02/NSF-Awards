LAY ABSTRACT: Theologis (0422578)

Auxin is a hormone and controls many growth and developmental processes in
plants. The purpose of this proposal is to support travel and lodging expenses
for young investigators and graduate students to attend the Auxin 2004
Conference in Crete on May 22-28, 2004. The meeting will focus on the latest
advances in the molecular genetic and developmental aspects of auxin biology.
Discussions will involve a range of model organisms, as well as the application
of the latest genomics technologies to auxin research. There will be 100-200
scientists present, and the speakers will include leaders in the field, as well
as new investigators. A large percentage of the speakers will be females.
Student participation will be stressed.

Auxin 2004 is the second international meeting held exclusively on auxin biology
during the past four years. Much cutting-edge plant science is taking place in
this area of research, and the ambience and small size of the meeting should
encourage interactions that will promote further excellence.
