This award provides funding to the University of California- Berkeley,
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Integrated Sensors for a
project titled I/UCRC Video Production, Cataloging and Evaluation:"IUCRC
Showcase". This is a two part project consisting of the following: Project A:
scripting and filming an eight to ten minute video about the I/UCRC program for
use by IUCRCs for instructional and promotional purposes; and Project B:
enhancing technology integration via the collection, cataloging and evaluating
videos that describe the operations of individual IUCRCs. The video will address
the following points: 1) How NSF/Industry/University Centers operate; 2) The
advantages of Center membership; 3) What happens at a Center's Industrial
Advisory Board meeting; 4) Topics Centers address; and 5) Total number of
Centers and what they do. Project A will be designed to permit any I/UCRC to add
material that describes their Center's work specifically and will be produced at
UC-Berkeley, under the direction of Professor Richard White, Co-Director of the
Berkeley I/UCRC. In Project B, videotapes and related graphical materials
highlighting I/UCRC research programs will be solicited, collected, and
analyzed, and classified and coded onto an archival database. From this video
archive, a "technology integration" module will be prepared to supplement the
"IUCRC Showcase" video of Project A. Project B will be produced at the
University of Connecticut, under the direction of Professor Don Hempel,
Evaluator for the I/UCRC for Grinding Research and Development. The Program
Director recommends that the University of California-Berkeley be awarded
$118,977 for this project. Funding for this project will be as follows: $101,365
in FY 92 and $17,612 in FY 93.
