This two-year project sponsored by the George Washington University is designed
to enhance the content knowledge and teaching skills of middle school science
educators, to create a model for the innovative use of computer aided,
hypermedia technology in the science classrooms and to encourage increased
collaboration between education and scientists. The first year will focus on
life sciences and the second year will focus on the physical sciences both as
appropriate for the middle school curriculum. Each year fourteen teams from
schools in the greater Washington, D.C. area will participate in a four week
summer workshop with school year follow up sessions and site visits. The summer
workshops consist of content enhancement, skill building in the use of computer
aided hypermedia and skill and content utilization through the development of
classroom lessons and leadership skills development. The school year follow up
includes team meetings, implementation of science lessons, site visits, Saturday
sessions, inservice workshops lead by participants and participation in a
regional science educators conference.
