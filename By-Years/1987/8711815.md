This action would provide funds for two investigators and a graduate student to
continue their research in elementary particle physics. They, together with
collaborators from other institutions in the United States and abroad, are
performing an experiment with the 15 foot bubble chamber at Fermilab. They will
study the interactions of neutrinos in the bubble chamber. The group from
Illinois Institute of Technology is responsible for replay system for the
holographic photography. With holography very short lived particles can be
tagged efficiently. The bubble chamber (E632 at Fermilab) is scheduled to
operate for about six months beginning June 1987 and expected to accumulate a
sample of about 45,000 events. The objectives are: 1) to search for rare
phenomena; 2) to study like-spin dimuon production; 3 to study gluon and quark
fragmentation functions and structure functions; and 4) to study coherent single
pion and rho production and apply the results to coherent production of heavy
flavor mesons.
