9510306 Kojima Experiments are proposed to explore the properties of the
magnetic superfluid A-1 phase of liquid He-3 at ultra low temperatures and in
high magnetic fields. The temperature width of the A-1 phase will be measured by
developing an acoustic thermometer. The superfluid fraction will be measured
using spin/entropy wave propagation techniques. The spin relaxation will be
measured by a novel mechanical device to detect spin density. All of these
measurements are proposed to be extended from our previous maximum field of 5
tesla up to 15 tesla. %%% Liquid Helium-3 will be subjected to temperatures down
to 0.001 degrees Kelvin and to magnetic fields as high as 150,000 gauss. Under
these conditions, liquid Helium-3 transforms into a unique magnetic superfluid
state. The focus of research will be to measure the effects of the magnetic
polarization on the superfluid state at ultra low temperatures. Thermodynamic,
hydrodynamic and magnetic properties will be investigated using acoustic and
mechanical devices in the proposed experiments. Better understanding of the
superfluid state might be applied to studies of more familiar superconducting
states of metals. ***
