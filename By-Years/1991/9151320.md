This project provides an opportunity to create a laboratory in which sophomore
CAD students develop drawings of models that will be analyzed by senior finite-
element students. This interaction should prove beneficial for both groups. The
seniors gain experience working on a team and with individuals with less
technical knowledge. The sophomores get a better appreciation of their chosen
field, insight into their future classes, an opportunity to become involved with
upper classmen, etc. The equipment includes computers, printers, software, and a
plotter.
