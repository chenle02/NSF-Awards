This proposal requests funding for the purchase of a low-angle laser light-
scattering (LALLS) photometer and a high performance liquid and size exclusion
chromatography (HPLC-SEC) system. This equipment is to be used to determine
molecular-thermodynamic parameters and experimental ternary polymer-polymer-
water phase diagrams required to develop a predictive model for a promising new
separation technique in biotechnology, i.e., two-phase aqueous polymer-polymer
systems for selective extraction of biomolecules. The PIs are considered to be
very well qualified to effectively utilize the proposed equipment. Funding of
this proposal is being recommended and the costs are to be shared by the
Interfacial, Transport and Thermodynamic Processes and the Biotechnology
Programs of the Engineering Directorate within NSF, and the University of
California at Berkeley. Biotechnology Program $ 50,932 Interfacial, Transport
