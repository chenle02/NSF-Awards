The project's research lies at the crossroads of several themes in mathematics
and is focused on the study of probabilistic, geometric, and information-
theoretic aspects of concentration of measure and other high-dimensional
phenomena. In complex systems where rules of randomness are well understood and
sufficiently many underlying events are independent of each other, aggregate
behavior at large scales tends to deviate very little from the median behavior.
This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, has been the subject of
exciting developments, since concentration tools allow one to analyze many
essential properties of rather general systems. Being strongly motivated by
challenging purely mathematical questions, this research area also has a wide
range of applications in disciplines such as information theory, statistics,
computer science, and machine learning, among others. This research project is
aimed in particular at a correct understanding of the role of the growing
dimension, especially in the problems where high dimension serves as a unifying
force. High-dimensional models are useful in practice for instance to understand
the entire evolution of a phenomenon in time, not just the governing local
rules, which may lead one's low-dimensional intuition astray. The project will
have an important impact correcting such misconceptions in mathematics, and will
have further impact when these ideas are applied to areas such as statistics and
machine learning. The project will also have broader impact on educating
undergraduate and graduate students in the mathematical sciences.

The project's themes refer either to long-standing open problems or to
challenging questions related to recent developments. More specifically, the
investigator plans to develop new concentration tools starting from the
spherical concentration phenomenon and its extensions to Grassman and Stiefel
manifolds. With new tools, one of the targets of investigation will be the
circle of problems related to the K-L-S conjecture of Kannan, Lovasz, and
Simonovits. The project will explore refined concentration properties of high
dimensional projections of log-concave and more general convex measures; in
particular, the work will investigate new integral geometric characteristics of
convex measures on Euclidean spaces that are responsible for spectral gap and
Cheeger isoperimetric constants. Part of the project is devoted to asymptotic
expansions in the central limit theorem for the relative entropy and Fisher
information, including Berry-Esseen bounds, and their applications to optimal
transport for sums of independent random vectors. The project also deals with
information-theoretic inequalities and transport problems about empirical
distributions.
