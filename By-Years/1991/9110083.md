Numerical methods for the computation of good low order models, controllers, and
state estimators for large dimensional systems will be done Pored. This research
has two primary objectives: 1. To develop numerical methods that compute the
exact solution(s) of these systems of lyapunov and Riccati equations, and 2. To
develop fast numerical algorithms that compute good estimates of the solutions
these systems of equations without first solving for the exact solutions.
