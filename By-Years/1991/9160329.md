POC proposes to develop a totally new lensless lithography machine using a
combination of microprisms and waveguide holograms which will produce images
within a sub 0.25um resolution. This machine will have high resolution, large
field masks, and minimum aberration. Both theoretical and experimental efforts
will be made in Phase I to fully determine the limits of this approach and the
possibility of designing a practical lithography machine for integrated circuit
applications. Technical issues including material requirements, diffraction
limits of different holographic optical systems (HOS), aberration
magnification/demagnification, noise elimination and power distribution and
uniformity will intensively studied. Holographic materials that can provide
image resolution<0.1um are available for this program based on POC's proprietary
HOE fabrication techniques.
