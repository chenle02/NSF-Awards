This award supports infrastructure for research and education computer
communications networking in the Pacific region. It is made to the University of
Hawaii Manoa for operation of the Pacific Communications Network (PACCOM).
PACCOM is a regional initiative in the Pacific area with the objective of
providing common communications services to the academic and research sector of
each member nation (currently, the U.S., through the University of Hawaii's
computer network, Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand). PACCOM circuits and
operations support the connections among the research and academic networks of
the member countries, but not the networks themselves. NSF, NASA and the
Department of Energy share the costs of the U.S. portions of the international
circuits, in accordance with the guidelines of the Coordinating Committee for
Intercontinental Research Networking. PACCOM circuits terminate in the U.S. at a
multi-agency interconnection point at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountainview, California. The NSFNET node at Stanford University, Palo Alto,
California connects to the multi-agency interconnection point.***
