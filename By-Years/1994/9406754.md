A planning grant is awarded to design a H2 (n,p) 2n experiment and to establish
a research collaboration between North Carolina A&amp;T State University and the
Traingle Universities Nuclear Research Laboratory. The PI would spend this
summer designing an experiment to measure the neutron scattering length from
studies of n+d scattering. The goal is to try to resolve discrepancies between
previous measurements and from estimates of this quantity from pi+d capture
reactions. A broader goal is to establish a research collaboration. ***
