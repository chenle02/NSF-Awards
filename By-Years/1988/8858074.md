This is a Presidential Young Investigator project for atmospheric chemistry
research. A major focus of this research is expected to be the development of a
three.dimensional model to simulate the global distributions of chemically
reactive species in the troposphere. The long.term goal is to apply the model to
such complex environmental problems as increases in greenhouse gases and acid
rain. In the coming years it is expected that investigation on the changes in
the composition of the atmosphere associated with changes in climate will be
pursued. In particular, a general circulation model will be used to study the
atmospheric chemistry during the Ice Ages. Data available form cores in
Antarctica, suggest very different atmospheric transport patterns during the Ice
Ages than today. These transport patterns might provide a clue as to the causes
of sudden cooling. Understanding the mechanisms of climate change during the Ice
Ages would have important implications on our ability to comprehend current
changes in climate due to the greenhouse effect.
