This three-year project is designed to improve the quality and quantity of
science taught in the middle school classrooms in southwest Louisiana. The
project has three components. The first component consists of four workshops in
earth, life, physical, and space sciences. The goals of this component are to:
(l) update and broaden the knowledge of earth, life, physical, and space science
for thirty-two grade 6-8 teachers and four grade 6-8 principals and (2) provide
each participant with the methodology and the motivation to improve the quality
and quantity of science instructed in their classroom and in their school. The
second component of is designed to provide the participants with the methodology
and the motivation to effectively share what they have learned with their peers
through five teacher enhancements activities. The third component will involve
the development of a model by which a local school system can inservice their
teachers by providing workshops for a limited number of teachers and
disseminating the information gained through teachers who are trained to share
with their peers. The project is based on a similar one, funded by NSF, for K-6
teachers and principals, with pertinent modifications. An amount equivalent to
57.7% of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.//
