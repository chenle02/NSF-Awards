A new computational method for image registration is formulated. Registration
refers to the task of aligning a pair of images obtained by CT (computed
tomography), MR (magnetic resonance), ultra-sound, and other techniques, so that
they can be compared both qualitatively and quantitatively. This is an important
problem with applications ranging from remote sensing to medicine. In medicine,
imaging techniques and analysis have become an important, non-invasive tool for
diagnosis and for surgical and radiation treatment planning. Despite advances in
this area of research, the challenges posed by registration for three-
dimensional images remains an open problem. A new mathematical approach is
developed that optimizes any chosen similarity measure of the images, subject to
the constraint of a set of differential equations that can generate any
differentiable and invertible transformation.

The main intellectual merit of the project is that it significantly enhances our
understanding of imagery and shapes and also the accuracy and efficiency of
image registration techniques. The main features of the new method are as
follows. 1. Similarity measures used to compare images are directly optimized.
2. The method has a landmark matching capacity for large deformations between
images. 3. The method is founded on solid mathematical theory; in particular,
the admissible space of transformations is the set of all differentiable and
invertible transformations. 4. The project is carried out with the use of the
software Insight Tool Kit developed by the National Institutes of Health; that
software provides an excellent resource for the research activity. The broader
impacts of the proposed activity are as follows. 1. Undergraduate and graduate
students are educated and trained to apply powerful mathematical techniques to
medical and other image processing problems. 2. The new method will impact other
areas of the computational sciences. Results are to be presented at conferences
and published in scientific journals and through the mass media directed at
scientists and the general population as well. 3. New partnerships between
medical doctors, biomedical engineers, and mathematicians are established,
helping create a favorable environment for further research aimed at improving
the health of our citizens.
