Abstract

Award: DMS-0405117 Principal Investigator: Kefeng Liu

By using localization methods we plan to intensively study various conjectures
from string theory, in particular those arised from string duality. These
include the most general mirror principle for higher genus from functorial
localization, the Gopakumar-Vafa integrality conjecture, the relationship
between elliptic genus and Gromov-Witten invariants, both from equivariant index
theory. We have made significant progresses towards our goals, for which the
functorial localization formula we discovered during our proof of the mirror
principle is one of the key techniques.

The interactions of string theory and mathematics has been one of the very few
most active and most exciting fields in mathematics for the past twenty years.
String duality has created many amazingly beautiful mathematical conjectures.
Our localization methods have been very successful in proving them, inlcuding
the mirror conjecture, the Marino-Vafa conjecture, the Hori-Vafa conjecture and
the mathematical construction of the topological vertex. Such interactions not
only produce mathematical theories and results, but also give strong evidences
to the physical theories.
