EIA-0209761&lt;br/&gt;Roberts, Fred S&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Projects: Mathematical Sciences Methods
for the Study of Deliberate Release of Biological Agents and their
Consequences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will fund an interdisciplinary
workshop to investigate the potential uses of methods of the mathematical
sciences (math, computer sciences, statistics, operations research) to fight
bioterrorism. The group will identify the challenges posed by bioterrorism, will
identify potential uses of mathematical sciences methods to fight it, then will
focus on specific areas of emphasis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will
examine alternative preventative measures such as vaccination, vaccine dilution
and antibiotic and vaccine stockpiling or responsive strategies such as the
isolation of individuals, buildings, populations and regions, the rapid control
of mass transportation systems, and the systematic surveillance of the food and
water supply. Topics of interest will include multiple outbreaks, the impact of
bioterriorism on agricultural systems and food supply, and the spread of
pathogens through buildings, in water systems, and in communications systems.
