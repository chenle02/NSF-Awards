Dr. Richter proposes to examine the regulation of maternal mRNA expression
during the early development of Xenopus laevis. Oocytes of all animals contain a
supply of mRNA which far exceeds the cells' immediate protein synthesis
requirements. This maternal mRNA is synthesized and stored during the protracted
period of oogenesis and, in Xenopus, is translated during oocyte maturation and
early embryogenesis. Dr. Richter has obtained cDNA clones for mRNAs that are
translated at only certain stages of early development. He has also determined
that these mRNAs bind different proteins in oocytes. He will first assess the
nucleotide sequences of the mRNAs that are important for their translational
regulation, and then will determine the proteins that are bound to those
sequences. These experiments will be performed by making deletion and chimeric
mutants in SP6-derived mRNAs. These mutants will then be injected into various
staged oocytes and their translational potential will be assessed by sucrose
gradient centrifugation. The proteins that bind various regions of these mRNAs
will be assessed by UV-induced crosslinking. %%% The early development of an
organism is driven by the differential expression of various proteins. These
early processes are studied in the toad, Xenopus laevis because the eggs are
large and easy to work with. In this organism the very early embryonic
development is programmed not by the activation of specific genes, but rather by
differential expression of messenger RNAs stored within the egg prior to
fertilization. Dr. Richter will investigate how the expression of various
proteins is regulated in early embryogenesis.
