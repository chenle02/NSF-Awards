This project will study the relations between nonlinear realizability and the
existence of input-output equations. This will include realizability by
nonsingular rational systems, analytic realizability, efficient algorithms, and
relationships between realizability and integral input-output equations.
Techniques borrowed from algebraic and differential geometry will be often used.
These studies address fundamental questions in the modeling of control of
mechanical, electrical, and biological systems.
