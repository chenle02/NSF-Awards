Super Star Clusters (SSCs) are very large regions of active star formation that
are thought to be the precursors to globular clusters of stars. They typically
contain a number of young massive stars surrounded by regions of ionized
hydrogen gas (H II) and dust. The dust surrounding the SSCs typically obscures
the H II regions and stars from the visible part of the spectrum. Observations
of SSCs are, therefore, usually performed at wavelengths from the radio to
infrared. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the physical conditions
that give rise to SSCs through a program of observations using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA).

SSCs represent one of the most extreme modes of star formation in the universe.
The PI proposes to find and study the molecular cloud regions that are the pre-
cursors to these SSCs. The PI will use radio (JVLA) and sub-
millimeter/millimeter (ALMA) data already in hand to study proto-SSCs found in
the blue compact dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10 and the overlap region in the merging
Antennae galaxies. In addition, the PI will propose new observations to search
for new SSC precursors within these two sources and in other galaxy systems.

The proposal will allow the PI to continue an excellent program of public
outreach developed as part of a prior NSF award. The program entitled "Dark
Skies, Bright Kids" (DSBK) is an 8-week after-school curriculum for elementary
school children consisting of hands-on activities and family observing nights.
The DSBK program has over 10,000 student contact hours in the 5 years the
program has been running. The program also provides numerous graduate student
and postdoctoral volunteers involved in DSBK "real world" training in education.
