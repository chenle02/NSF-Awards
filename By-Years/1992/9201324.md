This is an award to support research on a technique to determine the presence,
identity if present and numbers of pathogenic organisms, if present, in
environmental waters. The technique is based on determination of the nature of
the genetic material that is unique to the different target pathogens using an
analytical procedure that amplifies the nucleic acid chain of the target
organisms for ease of identification and quantification. The research involves
concentration of the pathogens using a rotating membrane ultrafiltration medium
and subsequent detection of the pathogens using the polymerase chain reaction
procedure. This research addresses limitations of procedures currently used for
determining the microbiological quality of an environmental water. These
procedures depend on the analysis for surrogate microorganisms as a step toward
establishing the significance of their presence. This project is a renewal of
work initiated under NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research No. 92-01324
results of which were utilized to develop the research plan for this project.
