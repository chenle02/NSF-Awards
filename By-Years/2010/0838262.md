The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a centimeter-wavelength radio telescope
producing unique science in the areas of radio surveys and transient source
detection. The ATA is the first radio telescope designed for commensal
observing; it will simultaneously produce sensitive SETI (Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence) surveys as well as large area continuum and
spectroscopic surveys for conventional radio astronomy. The science of the ATA
is enabled by a number of innovative technical developments. The ATA may serve
as a prototype for the US design of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a next
generation radio telescope currently in the planning phase. Located in Hat
Creek, CA, formerly the site of the Berkeley Illinois Maryland Association
(BIMA) millimeter-wavelength array, the ATA currently consists of 42 offset
Gregorian antennas with continuous frequency response from 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, with
the possibility of future upgrades to more antennas.
