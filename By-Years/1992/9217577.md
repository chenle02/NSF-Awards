Investigations of the superfluid (sf) transition in liquid helium 4: 1) Study
helium containing aerogels as an impurity, measuring the thermal expansion and
thermal conductivity. Data on the concentration and pressure dependences will
illuminate the relationship between the phase transitions in the pure and impure
systems. 2) Study the propagation of second sound near the sf transition in the
presence of superfluid and normal-fluid velocity fields, to test the correctness
of a recent theory. %%% Quantum mechanics underlies and governs the behavior of
all matter. Liquid helium is almost unique in being a substance which behaves as
a quantum mechanical system on a macroscopic scale. Studies such as are here
proposed can be expected to advance their understanding of quantum physics, as
well as phase transitions and the special properties of porous materials.
