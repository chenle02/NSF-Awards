Galaxy clusters act as "cosmic telescopes" that magnify distant galaxies, making
them appear bigger and brighter and therefore easier to detect. If we want to
better understand the intrinsic properties of the distant galaxies, it is
important to make a "lens model" of the mass distribution of the cluster to make
a model of the magnifications of the distant galaxies. All current models seem
to missing something since they disagree with each other. This project will look
at the assumptions and missing effects from the current models to try to build a
better understanding of the uncertainties in lens
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will improve the state of
gravitational lens modeling by developing a framework for reconciling
discrepancies between different models for reconstructing lensing maps. The
project will incorporate four new effects: scatter in cluster member galaxy
properties, lensing by line-of-sight galaxies outside the cluster, structure
along the line of sight, and non-galaxy structure within the cluster. They will
use this framework to see whether the new effects can reconcile current lens
models, and present the framework as an open-source code module so that it can
be used in future cluster lens modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
