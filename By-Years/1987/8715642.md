Piston cores from northern Lake Turkana in Kenya contain strong cyclic records
of carbonate abundance and lamination thickness. One of these cores has been
radiocarbon dated and shows several strong cycles (significant at the 95%
confidence interval) in the range of decades to centuries. The proposed research
on cores from this lake has two primary objectives: first, to determine the
climatic and limnological significance of the cycles and second, to determine
the phase relationships of the various cycles relative to one another and to the
present day. Field work will entail deployment of a sediment trap, and
collection of freeze and piston cores, and filtration of water samples. The
significance of this research is that Lake Turkana sediments provide a unique
opportunity to: (1) gauge the cyclic behavior of climate in sub-Saharan east
Africa for a period of 4000 years with unusually high temporal resolution, and
(2) assess man's impact on climate in this region of Africa with the perspective
of 4000 years of historical record.
