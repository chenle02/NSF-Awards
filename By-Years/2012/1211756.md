The goal of this collaborative project is to carry out a systematic search for
sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) using as the primary
signature the Doppler shift of the broad emission lines emitted by gas that is
bound to one of the black holes. Finding such close SBHBs constitutes a crucial
test of modern scenarios for galaxy evolution that predict their presence. The
program will also test a variety of other physical models that invoke SBHBs to
explain the formation of stellar cusps after galaxy mergers and mass deficits
therein and models for precessing radio jets and X-shaped radio sources.

Broader impacts of the work include training of an undergraduate student and a
postdoc, outreach via public lectures, and lab experiments for non-scientist
astronomy students.
