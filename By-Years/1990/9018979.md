Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases esterify amino acids to cognate tRNAS during the
course of protein synthesis and are thus essential to the decoding of genetic
information in all organisms. The objectives of the work proposed here are to
determine the role of zinc in the aminoacylation and/or DNA binding activities
of E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) and to elucidate structural elements
that coordinate with this metal. The function of zinc in ARS will be explored
through a series of denaturation, kinetic, and DNA binding experiments, and the
location of the metal binding site will be determined through a zinc-blotting
procedure and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, the hypothesis that
this enzyme contains a metal binding domain resembling a zinc finger will be
tested by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis. Such a domain may
be involved in the autoregulation of ARS synthesis, which is thought to be
mediated through ARS binding to the promoter region of its gene. Alternatively,
the metal may be involved in the protein-RNA interaction, as is the case in
retroviral zinc finger proteins. The demonstration of either case would be novel
for this important class of enzymes.
