The proposed research of Antonio Sa Barreto is divided in three main parts. In
the first topic, the investigator intends to study the existence of resonances
for second order self-adjoint perturbations of the Euclidean Laplacian. Secondly
he intends to continue his research on Scattering theory for asymptotically
hyperbolic manifolds. Particular examples of such manifolds are the hyperbolic
space and its quotients by certain discrete groups of linear fractional
transformations. The methods used here can also be applied to study scattering
for perturbations of the De Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black holes. The
principal investigator will study the distributions of resonances and the
connection between the resonances and the trace of the wave group. In the third
topic, the investigator proposes to study what type of information can be
obtained from the scattering matrix in several different situations. He proposes
to consider the question of existence of transparent metric perturbations of the
Euclidean metric, i.e those that are not determined by the scattering matrix at
a fixed energy. He also intends to consider the question of determination of a
non-compactly supported metric perturbation, that have sufficient decay at
infinity, from the knowledge of the scattering matrix at all energies. The same
questions can be posed in non-Euclidean settings, as for example, for metric and
potentials defined on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds. As metioned above,
this is in some sense the case of the De Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black
holes. One would like to know if a time independent perturbation of this model
by a metric and potential can be recovered from the scattering matrix at all
energies.

The general idea of the first project in this proposal is to study, in
different situations, the effects that certain perturbations have on a medium.
For example how certain disturbances will affect the propagation of light or
sound. Resonances can be seen as a damping effect the perturbation has on the
propagation of waves. The third project concerns the reciprocal of this
question, i.e knowing the effects that an unknown perturbation has on a medium,
determine the the perturbation. In the second project the investigator will
study analogous questions for the case where the medium is ``asymptotically
hyperbolic''. A closely related and important example is the De Sitter-
Schwarzschild model of black holes.
