The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is developing and
implementing a project to identify and disseminate information about effective
practices and strategies for attracting, selecting, and preparing new K-12 STEM
teachers and retaining them in the STEM teacher workforce. Project components
include: 1) Co-sponsoring and implementing the 2009 and 2010 NSF Robert Noyce
Teacher Scholarship program annual conferences for faculty, administrators,
student scholars, and STEM teachers who were supported by the program; 2)
Producing a journalist style general publication that highlights the
accomplishments of the NSF Noyce Program, including highlighting awardees; 3)
Developing and maintaining an NSF Noyce Program Web site that includes
conference information; project descriptions and accomplishments, including an
online project locator; and evaluation and research reports from awardees; and
4) Conducting three outreach workshops to disseminate information about
programs, practices and strategies and to increase proposal submissions for the
NSF Noyce Program. The project includes an external program planning committee
of leaders in recruiting, preparing, and retaining K-12 STEM teachers. Project
products include conference program guides with abstracts and a general
publication summarizing the accomplishments of the NSF Noyce Program. The Web
site includes a project locator with descriptions and accomplishments of the
projects. Outreach workshops disseminate information about programs, practices,
and strategies and the NSF Noyce Program solicitation.
