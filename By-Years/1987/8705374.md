The Northern Flicker serves as a model for studies on the evolutionary process
of speciation. The ranges of two rather distinct subspecies overlap on the
western Great Plains where they form an extensive hybrid zone. The distinctness
of the subspecies is maintained even though the two hybridize extensively.
Previous work strongly suggests that selection is a major force in maintaining
the characteristics of the two subspecies across the hybrid zone. Current
research is designed to determine whether natural selection or sexual selection
is most important. Natural selection would be in the form of ecological
variables associated with the hybrid zone whereas sexual selection would reflect
the ability of the subspecies to establish breeding territories outside of their
native ranges. Resolving these questions will advance our understanding of how
speciation occurs and how so much diversity evolves in such a short time.
