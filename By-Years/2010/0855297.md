George Mason University Proposal Title: CT-ISG: Understanding Botnet Command and
Control (C&C) Communication Project Summary Botnets are recognized as one of the
most serious threats to today's Internet. To combat them, one key step is to
effectively understand how the botnet members communicate with each other.
Unfortunately, the trend of adopting various obfuscation schemes (e.g.,
encryption) in recent bots greatly impedes our understanding. The main thrust of
this research is the investigation of several interrelated key techniques to
overcome the above challenges and significantly enrich the understanding of
botnet command and control. Specifically, this work introduces a methodology
called context-aware bot execution monitoring, from the following observations:
(1) implementing the bot communication protocol, a bot program contains the
authoritative protocol logic it will follow to respond and the ultimate
specification of the bot messages it can handle; (2) a bot typically handles
different fields of the bot message under different execution contexts, (e.g.,
with different run-time call stacks). As such, this research will collect,
characterize, and analyze traces with execution context information to discern
various protocol fields as well as associated semantics in the bot message. The
broader impact of this research is two-fold: (1) It will significantly enrich
the understanding of the botnet threat by not only observing and inferring the
network-level interactions among bots, but also exposing the botnet C&C
communication protocol logic behind detailed bot interactions. (2) Results from
this research will also lead to the development of education materials for
undergraduate and graduate courses and for professional training sessions.
Intellectual merit of the work includes a novel approach to reverse engineering
the botnet C&C communications protocol.
