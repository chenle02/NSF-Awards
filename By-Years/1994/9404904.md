Sethian 9404904 This proposal will develop a new approach to shape modeling
which retains the most attractive features of existing methods, and overcomes
their prominent limitations. The technique can be applied to model arbitrarily
complex shapes, which include shapes with significant protrusions, and to
situations where no a priori assumption about the object's topology is made.
