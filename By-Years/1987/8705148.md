The equipment provided by this award is to be used by several faculty members
and their research assistants at R.P.I. to conduct a number of research projects
in the area of Structural Dynamics. Use is made of Computerized Symbolic
Manipulation to formulate and to analyze highly complex nonlinear differential
equations of motion. The main research projects include the dynamics of
helicopter rotor blades, helicopter rotor-fuselage interactions, nonlinear
flexural-flexural-torsional dynamics of beams and beam-like structural members
with application to robotic manipulators and systems with moving masses,
tayloring of composite structures and inverse kinematics problems in robotic
manipulators.
