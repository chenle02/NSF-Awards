Image Processing for Teaching (IPT) brings a powerful technology to schools and
two-year colleges, where students use this state-of-the-art tool for exploration
and analysis, learning problem-solving skills, computer and imaging
technologies, and specific image processing skills, which are becoming
increasingly important in the modern work place. IPT's past success at exciting
students about science and mathematics, bringing inquiry and discovery-based
learning to students of all ability levels, has created considerable demand for
implementation in vocational/technological education settings.The IPT project
produces curriculum materials targeting technological education programs. We
design and conduct workshops to provide the teaching staff development necessary
for successful implementation. IPT further supports implementation with follow-
up services, including toll-free telephone and e-mail communication, an annual
conference, and periodic video conferences. Our team of expert teachers play a
primary role in all planning, development, and instructional activities. The
stream of interdisciplinary activities, keyed to occupational clusters, will
keep instructors and their students on the cutting edge of technology, while
using a demonstrated powerful tool for learning.
