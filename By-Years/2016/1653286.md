Established as part of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural
Language Processing (EMNLP), the EMNLP 2016 Student Scholarship Program offers
scholarships that subsidize travel, conference and housing expenses to selected
students attending the conference, with preference given to financially needy
students who may otherwise not be able to attend. By bringing together a pool of
student researchers with the scientific and engineering knowledge of NLP from
all over the world, these scholarships allow the awardees to make contact with
other researchers in the field, discuss research ideas, receive critical
feedback on their work, and possibly establish collaborations with them. This
provides the students involved with invaluable opportunities for professional
growth. In the long run, the Student Scholarship Program can contribute to the
maintenance and development of a diverse computational natural language
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organized by SIGDAT, the Association for
Computational Linguistics' special interest group for linguistic data and
corpus-based approaches to NLP, EMNLP is an annual conference at the
intersection of NLP and machine learning. Since its inception two decades ago,
EMNLP has gradually established its reputation as one of the premier conferences
in NLP that attracts some of the best computational researchers in the field. It
would therefore be beneficial for SIGDAT to establish a long-term relationship
with the NSF through this pioneering NSF-sponsored Student Scholarship Program,
which, if successful, can become an integral part of future EMNLP conferences.
