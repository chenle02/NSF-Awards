This is an award of supercomputer time. Four specific researchareas are
supported: study of complex patterns and their development development of new
efficient cell mapping' methods forthe determination of critical quantities in
nonlinear dynamics analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of driven bubbles andstudy
of acoustic radiation from chaotic bubbles further development of recently
developed methods forpredicting the evolution of orbits on strange attractors.
