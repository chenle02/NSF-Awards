The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg,
Austria, is an international research institution supported by National Member
Organizations in 15 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union,
Eastern and Western European nations, Japan, and Canada. The focus of its
research is on complex, policy-relevant problems that transcend the interests of
single countries. These problems include several that have particular
significance for the United States, including, problems associated with the
global environment, with demographic change, and with the transition of Eastern
European countries to market economies. In December, 1989 the President
determined that IIASA continues to do useful scientific work and merits
continued support by the United States. As subsequently emphasized by the
President's Science Advisor, that determination required that the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, the US National Member Organization for IIASA,
should work with the National Science Foundation and other interested Government
agencies to identify appropriate research areas and funding arrangements for
IIASA. In response to the Science Advisor's expectations, the American Academy
has established a new U.S. Committee for IIASA chaired by Dr. Robert White,
President of the National Academy of Engineering. The primary purposes of that
committee are to: (1) increase U.S. scientific partici- pation in research at
IIASA, and (2) to assure that IIASA's research directions and the quality of the
research it conducts are consistent with the interests of U.S. science and the
U.S. Government. This award will support the activities of that committee.
