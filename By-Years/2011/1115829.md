Programs with potentially malicious content are becoming increasingly common.
Such programs are usually highly obfuscated, using a variety of techniques that
make it difficult to analyze the code, figure out its internal logic, and
develop countermeasures. Existing tools for reverse engineering such programs
are primitive and require a great deal of tedious and time-consuming manual
intervention, which hampers the timely development of defenses against newly
discovered malware. This project aims to devise automatic techniques to simplify
away these obfuscations and thereby make it significantly faster and easier to
understand the internal logic of obfuscated code with potentially malicious
content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses dynamic program analysis
techniques to identify instructions that affect the program's observable
behavior; these instructions are then extracted and, where appropriate,
simplified using equational techniques. Key research questions investigated
include simplification in the face of arbitrary obfuscations and combinations of
obfuscations, including (possibly multiple layers of) self-modification and
emulation. The main impact of this project will be to make it easier and quicker
for security researchers to figure out the internal logic of malware programs.
This, in turn, will make it possible to respond more quickly to new malware and
develop countermeasures to them faster and with less manual intervention. The
effect will be to reduce the damage done by malware before they can be
neutralized.
