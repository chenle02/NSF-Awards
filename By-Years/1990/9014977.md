This research project is concerned with the study of the photoelectronic
properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and related semiconductors
continuing previous work in three general directions. These are: 1) electrons in
states at and above the mobility edge using the optical time-of-flight method
developed by the researcher with the objective of understanding the nature of
the extended states in these materials; 2) the time of evolution of photoinduced
infrared spectra in the femto- and picosecond ranges to understand the ultrafast
carrier dynamics of carrier trapping of gap states and electron-lattice
relaxation; 3) using steady-state photomodulation spectroscopy to study the gap
states of high quality hydrogenated amorphous germanium which has recently
become available. This latter technique will also be extended to hydrogenated
amorphous silicon doped with phosphorous.
