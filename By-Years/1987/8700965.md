The purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility of using
ellipsometry to monitor the surface roughness of mechanical components. This
technique relies on reflected light from a surface and is carried out under
ambient conditions. Ellipsometry could potentially be used as a fast non-
destructive evaluation of industrially produced surface finishes. This research
plans to study the relationship between surface finish and ellipsometric
parameters. Surface roughness is known to effect the changes in polerization
state which occur when light is reflected from a surface. A recently available
automated Muller Matrix ellipsometer permits the detection of depolarization and
cross- polarization; two phenomena which are significant at roughness of
practical surface. Professor Williams has a strong research background in
ellipsometry. An award is recommended.
