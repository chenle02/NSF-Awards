This project provides students with training in real-time computer control using
a hardware/software environment that supports concurrency and distributed
processing. The programming training received by most computer science
undergraduates does not lend itself to application to real-time control of
complicated systems. Curricula are changing to meet the need for programmers who
can function in a systems control environment. However, too frequently students
must be satisfied with learning about theoretical models without seeing those
models applied to real problems. Also, many theoretical models gloss over some
practical issues having to do with the control environment. This project not
only exposes students to state-of-the-art software development tools for real-
time systems control, but it also provides them with a flexible physical test-
bed for their programs. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
