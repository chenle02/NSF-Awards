The purpose of this project is to produce microcomputer programs suitable for
use by hearing impaired students. Several hundred bioscience instructional
programs, developed for populations of non- handicapped students, will be
identified. The project staff will then select and modify about 30 of these
which meet specific criteria required for use by the target audience.
Modifications will include changes in the content of the software and the use of
more basic and concrete instruction, a simplified vocabulary, grammatical
structures more understandable to the deaf students, and increased numbers of
visuals. The project will field test the software with deaf students who are on
the campus of Gallaudet College in Washington, DC. These students will be 9th
through 12th graders at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf, and freshmen
and sophomores in undergraduate programs of the College. The goal of the project
is to improve the availability of microcomputer programs in secondary and post-
secondary institutions for teaching deaf students across the United States.
These include some 900 high schools/programs/classes for deaf students, and 75
post-secondary programs serving the deaf.
