Interdisciplinary (99) Enhanced student learning is resulting from the creation
of a Virtual Control Room through which students in the Integrated Science,
Business, and Technology Program are gaining experience in process design and
control. The project features adaptation of problem-based learning and small
group cooperative learning. Students have the opportunity via simulation to
monitor actual processes in Tissue Culturing to produce commercially important
molecules, a bioprocess by which an economically viable biotechnology product is
produced, and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The project is serving as a
model for the integration of business concepts into science and technology
courses and programs.&lt;br/&gt;
