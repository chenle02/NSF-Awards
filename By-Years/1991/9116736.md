This grant supports one-half of the inside-U.S. expenses for hosting, in
September, U.S. university scientists and the 15- member State Seismological
Bureau delegation for the 1991 Coordinator's Meeting of the US/PRC Earthquake
Studies Protocol and for a Symposium on "Earthquake Prediction: The State of the
Art". The State Seismological Bureau, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the
National Science Foundation are the members of the Protocol. This travel and
symposium is important to the successful conduct of U.S. projects of earthquake
hazards research planned or underway in the PRC. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
