The ever increasing availability of data has attracted a huge amount of effort
building machine learning models from the data to unleash its hidden power. One
ubiquitous finding about these machine learning tasks is that in most real-world
applications the learning tasks are closely related to each other. Moreover,
human experts in many domains can usually provide indispensable domain knowledge
describing how these models are related. Maximally exploiting such knowledge is
critical in building high quality machine learning models. This project will
develop effective and efficient interactive algorithms and tools (including open
source software) to enable knowledge discovery by integrating domain knowledge
of task relatedness from human experts. The algorithms and tools developed in
this project will directly impact biomedical informatics as they will be used to
build disease progression models. The educational component of this project
includes developing a new curriculum that incorporates research into the
classroom and provides students from under-represented groups with opportunities
to participate in research.

Leveraging task relatedness, multi-task learning (MTL) simultaneously learns all
related learning tasks and performs knowledge transfer among the tasks to
improve the quality of models from all the tasks. Although there are numerous
studies for MTL that assume different types of task relatedness, limited
progress has been made in incorporating domain knowledge in MTL. This project
will advance MTL by: (1) developing algorithms for knowledge aware multi-task
feature learning which exploit domain knowledge of features to guide the
selection of joint features from the learning tasks; (2) developing algorithms
for knowledge aware multi-task relationship learning which utilize domain
knowledge of tasks to guide the learning of task relationships; and (3)
developing efficient and scalable optimization algorithms to facilitate
effective interactive visualization. For further information see the project web
