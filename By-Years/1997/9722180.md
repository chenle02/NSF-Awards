The 1997 Aspen Winter Conference on Particle Physics, to be held in Aspen
January 19-25, 1997, will focus on `Particle Physics Enters its Second Century.`
The latest results of most major particle physics experiments will be discussed,
as will the status of various approaches to elementary particle theory. Then
prospects for future experimental facilities will be assessed. The conference
will make possible a very important exchange of ideas as the particle physics
community works to shape the future of this field.
