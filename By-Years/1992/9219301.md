This proposal is directed to the study of presynaptic NMDA-type glutamate
receptors that are likely to be involved in the autoregulation of synaptic
transmitter release. NMDA receptors are widely distributed in the central
nervous system of all animals and are intimately involved in normal neural
processes such as learning and memory as well as a number of pathological
processes. Little is known of the presynaptic receptor function or structure
since there has not been an available source of receptors that are not
contaminated by the presence of the postsynaptic receptors in mixed and complex
neural tissues. Because the olfactory epithelium is composed of a pure
population of neuronal cells and that it is a presynaptic element the epithelium
neurons can be a unique source of the genetic message and receptor proteins that
can be used to generate the molecular tools to study presynaptic structure and
function of the various neurotransmitter and modulator receptors that may exist
there.
