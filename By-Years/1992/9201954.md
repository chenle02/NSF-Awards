During the last decade many flexible assembly systems (FASs) have been adopted
as alternatives to traditional labor-driven systems, and the number is expected
to grow faster than ever. Design aids for such capital-intensive systems,
however, have not been investigated in depth. Even existing ones are not
adequate for real application because of simplicity of the underlying
assumptions, treatment of isolated design issues, time-consuming techniques, and
no machine flexibility consideration. Emphasis will be on an integrated design-
aid tool for FASs which overcomes these setbacks. This tool will take three
basic data (products, machines, and material handling systems) as input and
provide cost-effective flow system designs (layout and operating policies) which
satisfy target production requirements. The tool will employ two phases of
analyses: rough-cut analysis and detailed analysis. The tool will model FAS
aspects such as failure-prone machines, parallel-server stations, limited
machine flexibility, finite buffer spaces, material handling delays, precedences
among tasks, and a real-time pallet dispatch policy.
