Dayna Patterson is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship from the Chemistry Division,
to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening
participation by groups underrepresented in Chemistry at Northwestern
University. The project being performed by Dayna Patterson, entitled
Characterization and biosynthesis of non-methanotrophic methanobactins, is to be
conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist Amy Rosenzweig. This project
is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical
and Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methane-oxidizing
(methanotrophic) bacteria are known to acquire copper (Cu) for their function.
To do so, many of the methanotrophic bacteria encode for ribosomally produced,
post-translationally modified Cu-binding natural products known as
methanobactins (Mbns). Planned work is focused on elucidating the biosynthetic
function of the uncharacterized biosynthetic protein, MbnX, which is involved in
producing the still uncharacterized Group V Mbns. The Fellow will utilize
genetic, structural, and biochemical techniques to produce and characterize a
new Mbn from the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus beddingii DSM 4764. The structure
of this Mbn will provide insight into MbnXâ€™s biosynthetic role, and to further
understand MbnX, its structure and function will be explored. Activities that
will support broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in
Chemistry will include a research shadowing experience for students from a local
minority-serving community college, and starting a local chapter of the National
Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) which will
nucleate a community for underrepresented students in STEM at Northwestern
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
