Advances in molecular cloning technologies have made it possible to generate
large quantities of diverse proteins in micro-organisms, in order to study the
biological and physical properties of these proteins. The Department of
Biochemistry at the University of Virginia has a long history of biophysical
studies on diverse biological systems and several of the faculty, particularly
the faculty recently recruited, have research projects designed around studies
of such recombinant proteins. Of the 13 full time faculty, 8 are either using
recombinant proteins or plan to use them in the near future. One problem with
this approach to the generation of research material is in assembling the
hardware necessary for the isolation of these proteins from bacterial, or other
types of, cells. We have not had a long history of bacteriology or large scale
protein purification and so our resources which were once adequate for our
biochemical needs are now completely inadequate for generation of recombinant
proteins. This shortfall is compounded by the fact that for many of the
projected biophysical studies particularly large amounts of protein are
required. We propose to purchase the basic instrumentation for moderate scale
isolation of recombinant proteins from E. coli, yeast, and other cells.
