String theory requires gravity and extends the standard model of particle
physics and grand unified theories. Its mathematical consistency requires more
than the four spacetime dimensions, and the ways in which the extra dimensions
are dealth with in turn determines the observed particles and forces. Therefore,
it is important to understand the imprints left by the geometry and topology of
the extra dimensions on the observed four-dimensional spacetime. The PI's will
explore fundamental aspects of string theory and supergravity as they relate to
these issues. As such, this project advances the national interest by promoting
progress in science and the search for new physical laws describing uncharted
territories of quantum gravity. This project is also envisioned to have broader
impact by boosting the interfaces between string theory and mathematics. The PIs
will also provide critical training to postdocs and students, and intend to give
public lectures on their research results and organize workshops.

More technically, the PIs aim to construct the full spacetime effective action
of different string theory and M-theory compactifications to all orders in the
slope parameter and its formulation in superspace. Their goal is to use physics
to solve long-standing problems in mathematics (e.g,. the search of a "Calabi-
Yau-type" theorem for manifolds with exceptional holonomy or to search for an
analogue of mirror symmetry). Further, the PI's will study the construction of
an action principle for higher-spin theory, its quantization, higher-spin
invariant functionals, and higher-spin black holes. They will also study
supersymmetric field theories in curved backgrounds, superconformal field
theories in diverse dimensions, and a geometrical description of duality
symmetries of strings and branes.
