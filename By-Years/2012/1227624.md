Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) proposes to support technical services
on four research vessels, all operated as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which
is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).
Ships to be supported include R/V Revelle, R/V Melville, R/V New Horizon and R/V
Sproul. As part of their basic operations they will provide one (Sproul, New
Horizon) or two (Revelle, Melville) technicians on each seagoing research
project to support basic services and they will maintain, calibrate and provide
for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research
instrumentation. They also propose to provide several elements of specialized
support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized support proposed
for 2012 includes:&lt;br/&gt;? Reference Quality Hydrographic
Support&lt;br/&gt;? Multichannel Seismic reflection profiling and related
mitigation of impacts on marine mammals.&lt;br/&gt;? Management for HiSeasNet
(Internet connectivity at sea for the Academic Fleet )&lt;br/&gt;? SeaSoar
specialized support &lt;br/&gt;? Ship/Shore Internet Management&lt;br/&gt;? HDSS
sonar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
