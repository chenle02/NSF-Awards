The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports
fundamental studies at the interface between inorganic chemistry and solid state
physics which deals with the intriguing question of when does metallic behavior
take over from molecular behavior. This research in the chemistry and physics of
metal clusters will eventually lead to the discovery of materials with unusual
physical or chemical properties. The project is to study the stereochemical
systematics of a novel series of high nuclearity Au-Ag clusters. The structures
of these bimetallic clusters are based on vertex-sharing of centered icosahedral
cluster units as building blocks which can be referred to as "clusters of
clusters". Metal clusters corresponding to the magic numbers 13, 25, 36, 46, 56,
76, and 127 can be obtained by condensation of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 12 centered
icosahedral cluster units, thereby providing a reasonable pathway to clusters of
increasing nuclearity. It is hoped that investigations of these large metal
clusters of discrete size and shape will shed light on the fundamental question
of when, where, and how the metallic character begins and ends, as well as lead
to new materials with unusual physical and chemical properties.
