Our knowledge of the nature of prejudice can be deepened by examining how jury
decisionmaking is affected by ethnicity and by seeking to understand the nature
of any differential treatment. This research will investigate the influence of
ethnic identity on the processing of Anglo-American and Hispanic felony
defendants. Specifically, the study examines the impact of jury composition on
conviction and sentencing patterns in felony cases adjudicated in Texas District
Courts. Archival data will be analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques
that will permit the examination of such factors as how the social status and
socioeconomic composition of juries influence their dispositional decisions.
Notably, Texas is one of only a few states that permit jury determination of
guilt and sentencing in cases other than capital trials. Part of the importance
of the research stems from the dearth of extant data concerning the legal
treatment of Hispanic defendants. A more important gap in our knowledge of
differential justice that will be filled is the consideration in this project of
heretofore unexamined aspects of the problem, such as the social status of
jurors. This is the first research to examine this issue with respect to the
dispositions of Hispanic defendants. The project has the potential not only to
contribute to an understanding of the legal treatment of Hispanic defendants,
but also more broadly to the development of a model of differential justice that
considers the social characteristics of legal decision makers in articulating
the impact of law.
