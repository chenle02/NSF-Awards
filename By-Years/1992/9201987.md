9201987 Kwasny This is the third year funding of a three year continuing award
to investigate the following four issues: (1) the processing of natural language
with hybrid symbolic/subsymbolic architectures, (2) the development and study of
representational schemes that support both traditional structures as well as
ambiguity within those structures, (3) a challenge to the determinism hypothesis
of M. Marcus in creating recurrent networks that require information to be
extracted from the sentence while processing left-to-right, and (4) the
generalization capbilities of various deterministic, connectionist processing
systems. These issues are considered experimentally in a family of demonstration
systems under development. The organization of these demonstration systems is
extended beyond syntactical considerations.
