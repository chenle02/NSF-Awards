Eduardo Cattani and Aroldo Kaplan will continue their work in Hodge theory.
This involves the study of topological and geometric invariants connected with
an algebraic variety. Hodge theory yields a method of describing the space of
differential forms on a manifold. This theory has seen very rapid developments
in recent years. Most notably, on the construction of functorial Hodge
structures on appropriate cohomology and homotopy spaces. The work of Cattani
and Kaplan in cooperation with Wilfried Schmid has been at the forefront of
research in variations of Hodge structures. Cattani and Kaplan will build on
their recent results which bring the several variable case within reach of
applications. They will apply these results to the study of the behaviour of
integral cycles in an algebraic family of varieties. They will also study the
structure of modular varieties. This work will focus on the characterization of
maximal integral submanifolds for the horizontal distribution in a classifying
space for Hodge structures.
