This research will extend dynamic theories of games in several directions. Part
1 contributes to the growing literature on evolution and learning. It will
examine how a stable pattern of behavior might emerge when players adjust their
behavior by trial and error. In particular, the study will focus on the long run
implications of experimentation or mutations in such a process. This approach
has the potential to make a unique prediction, even when the underlying game
possesses multiple locally stable equilibria. Part 2 examines the nature of
implicit collusion in a realistic situation, where information about the past
history is not common knowledge. The investigator will formulate a model of a
discounted repeated game with privately observable outcomes, and will explore
the role of communication. This study is important because it will improve our
understanding in situations, prevalent in industrial organization literature and
organizational settings, in which players receive private signals about past
play and implicit agreements are developed.
