Laboratory experiences are being introduced to illustrate and test theories of
animal behavior and ecology that are presented in the lectures of five existing
courses. The computer-aided radio telemetry equipment also is providing advanced
undergraduate research opportunities in the disciplines of ethology and ecology,
providing undergraduate access, experience, and familiarity with the equipment.
The animal behavior and ecology topics that are being developed for
incorporation into the Department's laboratory course work and undergraduate
research include home range, territoriality, habitat preferences and
partitioning, cyclic activity patterns (circadian and seasonal), dispersal
patterns, refugia selection, social organization, and the effects of age,
season, and sex on any or all of the above.
