Computer Science (31) Through a collaboration of Grand Valley State University,
Alma College, and the University of Wisconsin/Oshkosh, this project explores the
use of the algorithm visualization (AV) tool JHAVE on student understanding of
computer algorithms. We are refining a suite of existing AV resources, each of
which consists of a visualization, a text description of the algorithm, and
questions that are presented to the students as they interactively explore the
algorithm. We are conducting usability studies of the resources on all campuses
in order to ensure portability of our results.

We are focusing on evaluation of the results of these resources using student
surveys, faculty surveys and examinations which will allow for cross-institution
comparisons. We anticipate using a working group format to dissemination and
enhance our results.
