Several unconventional ideas on the formation and maintenance of the low
latitude boundary layer (LLBL) of the terrestrial magnetosphere are proposed. It
is proposed that the solar wind plasma flowing tailward on the closed field
lines in the LLBL maintains the magnetotail. Field-aligned ion beams of the
ionospheric origin are identified as region o currents. The evidence of the
region o currents is sought in Viking satellite data and MAGSAT data. For the
study of auroral arc, sonderstrom radar facility will be used to obtain improved
measurements of field-aligned election and ion flows. A campaign is planned in
March 1989 in conjunction with auroral imagers. A model for the auroral arc is
proposed and the data obtained will allow the testing of this theoretical model.
This project will utilize observational sets of data from various satellites
(MAGSAT, Hilat, DMSP, ISEE 3) and radar observations to test the theoretical
models of LLBL and auroral arc.
