9561627 Castaneda This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
develops coreless transformers in switching power supplies for Mhz and greater
frequencies. The miniaturization of integrated circuits has not been accompanied
by a similar reduction in the size of their power supplies. Although high-
frequency operation has always been associated with smaller energy storage
components, smaller power transformers are limited by increasing core and ohmic
losses and by parasitic effects at higher frequencies. A new concept is a
transformer without ferrite core and consisting of a cascade of printed
striplines on multilayer structures. The idea is to store and transfer energy by
electromagnetic waves through waveguiding structures (transmission lines).
Important features of these transformer structures are stripline lengths on the
order of the guide wavelength and a turns-ratio determined by the stripline
characteristic impedance. Phase constants and line impedance of the striplines,
as a function of various parameters, will be determined by Computer Aided Design
(CAD) methods. Practical design issues will be addressed including maximum
possible voltage ratio obtainable with the constraint of the device's
dimensions, possible low-loss materials with high permitivity or permeability
for wavelength reduction, a bandwidth enhancement method, and the geometrical
shape of the stripline for the best use of the planar surface. Other design
issues will include power handling and heat dissipation capabilities.
Transformers are important in power processing circuits, which are required in
all common electric appliances, cellular phones, television sets, VCRs,
computers, etc. Size and weight reduction and speed enhancements require new
power converters with switching frequencies in the Mhz and greater range. An
absence of satisfactory electronics power transformers in this range may be
worthwhile commercially.
