9605098 Berkowitz New York's Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) hosts a
summer-research program for undergraduate students, with support from the NSF
REU-Sites program. Building upon a distinguished record of training and
research, emphasizing forest ecosystem structure and function, the Institute's
program immerses students in a highly interactive, 12-week session of field-
based projects, seminars, workshops, and presentations. Anticipated outcomes
include: (1) students acquire a broad perspective in modern field-based ecology
and in science more generally; (2) students learn fundamental skills in
designing, executing, and completing a research project; and (3) students become
better prepared to choose and pursue a career in science. Minority-student
participation as well as participation by women have been significant in past
NSF-supported programs, and efforts are being made to continue those emphases.
The program has four components: (1) Student research projects--working closely
with a mentor scientist, each student develops a research question and
associated hypotheses, implements the project, collects and analyzes data, gives
an oral presentation in a formal Research Symposium, and writes a paper. (2)
Research strategies for undergraduates--workshops provide training in various
tools and techniques essential for modern ecological research. (3) Research in
context--the staff of IES along with visiting scientists offer seminars and case
studies to broaden students' perspectives on scientific work. (4) Forum on
opportunities in ecology--a full-day forum exposes students to a broad range of
career choices in basic and applied ecology.
