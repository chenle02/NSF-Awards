The project creates, develops and implements a core curriculum required for an
alternative energy technician program leading to an associate degree with
transferable credits. In addition, the project prepares residents of Imperial
Valley with the necessary technical education needed to enter the alternative
energy job market. The entry level technicians acquire knowledge about various
alternative energy operations that are used by local firms. In order to properly
train alternative energy technicians, the project works directly with the local
and regional energy providers to ensure that the curriculum provides students
with skill sets that meets local occupational standards. Particular focus is
placed on continuous improvement to ensure that the alternative energy
technician program maintains a practical technological environment and meets
best practices.
