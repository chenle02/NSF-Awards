This award supports the research in combinatorial design theory and graph
theory of Professor Charles Lindner of Auburn University. The emphasis of Dr.
Lindner's research will be on problems in small embeddings of partial graph
decompositions, the existence problem of 2-perfect decompositions of the
complete graph into cycles, and the conjugate invariant subgroup problem for
both orthogonal and perpendicular arrays. This research falls in the broad
category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's
mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the
very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development,
however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide
variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back
several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few
decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.
