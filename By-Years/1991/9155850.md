A one semester hour lab course to be taken with or after the completion of the
traditional freshman-sophomore level elementary statistics course is being
developed. The lab guides the student through simple, but meaningful,
experiments which illustrate important points of applied statistics. In each
session the students discuss and perform an experiment, collect and analyze
data, and write a report. The lab differs from traditional science labs in that
the emphasis will be on statistical concepts. Students in the lab are being
compared with a control group with regard to performance in elementary
statistics and propensity to enroll in additional statistics courses. Student
and teacher's manuals are being prepared; the materials will be pilot tested at
another institution; and a national advisory committee is in place.
