Dr. Amnon Kohen of the University of Iowa is funded for his research on protein
dynamics and hydrogen tunneling in enzymatic catalysis by a CAREER grant in the
Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division. He will develop
mechanistic models for how biologically significant C-H bond activation occurs
and for the role of protein dynamics, coupled motion, and quantum mechanical
hydrogen tunneling in enzyme catalysis. Kinetic isotope effects and temperature
effects will be used to probe tunneling and associated reaction mechanism
questions. Dr. Kohen will incorporate aspects of bioorganic chemistry, physical
organic chemistry, and computational chemistry into the organic laboratory for
majors. A new graduate course, Chemical Catalysis in Biology, will be developed
and based on recent literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enzyme catalysis is one of
the most important biochemical phenomena, since it is at the heart of nearly all
of our physiological biochemistry (how our food is digested, how our cells
reproduce, how hormones induce changes in our body functions, etc.). The role of
coupled motion and quantum mechanical hydrogen tunneling in enzyme catalysis
will be discerned. Tunneling is the phenomenon by which a molecule or group of
reacting molecules transfers through a reaction energy barrier due to its wave-
like property. Synchronous motion or coupled motion of atoms in a reacting
molecule is a phenomenon that has been found to be important in some enzyme
catalyzed reactions. The small but important enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase,
that catalyzes hydrogen transfer will be a focal point of this research. Dr.
Kohen plans on developing new course work in the area of bioinorganic chemistry
for both undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
