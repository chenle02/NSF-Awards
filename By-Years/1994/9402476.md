9402476 Ghanem It is proposed to conduct a research program featuring a novel
concept for treating environmental engineering problems involving media with
uncertain (random) properties. The proposed concept hinges upon the approximate
representation of random processes describing the medium properties using a
finite number of random variables. This will be accomplished via the classical
concepts of the Karhunen-Loeve and Polynomials Chaos expansions, well known n
applied mathematics. I this study these expansions will be incorporated into
spatial discretizations of various medium properties in accordance with standard
finite element procedures. The proposed formulation will permit an optimal
representation of the random process involved using a minimum number of random
variables. Preliminary results obtained by proposed formalism to problems of
engineering mechanics show good agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results.
The proposed research will extend the existing formulation for the analysis of
problems in ground water flow. ***
