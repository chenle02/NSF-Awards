This project will investigate in-depth analyses of data from experiments
involving commuter decisions in a simulated traffic system. Factors to be
considered are: individual user route choice and departure times, and travel
time prediction. The results of this study will contribute to methodological and
substantive aspects in a broad realm of complex large scale systems involving
the interaction of human decisions.
