ABSTRACT 9422263 NABOKOV/CASSADY Cancer is the leading cause of death among
Alaska Native women and the third leading cause of death among Alaska Native
men. This dissertation research will investigate Inupiat Eskimo perspectives
about cancer and trace how these views influence health decisions and
activities. To date, scientific research has failed to examine the Native
cultural context of cancer and how Alaska Native apprehensions about the
environment are integrated into the fabric of everyday life. This study will
contribute to theories of medical pluralism and the social and cultural basis
for beliefs about environmental health risks. *** ??
