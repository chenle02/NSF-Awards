Baltimore proposes to plan for a larger scale initiative to address science and
mathematics education for low-income, and underrepresented groups. This is a
collaborative between Morgan State University, the university designated by the
state to coordinate efforts on urban education, and the Baltimore City Public
Schools (BCPS). The goals of the proposal are to: 1) strengthen and expand
existing collaborations to include ALL major players in mathematics and science
education; 2) complete a comprehensive self- study; and 3) develop a
comprehensive design for the Baltimore City Initiative. The award period is for
12 months, starting January 15, 1993.
