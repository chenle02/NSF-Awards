One of the most pervasive phenomena in astrophysics is rotational motion. We
observe it in planetary motions, satellites and rings in orbit around planets,
rotating stars (incl. the sun), the motions of binary stars, accretion disks
around white dwarfs and neutron stars, and rotation of galaxies. The Principal
Investigator (PI) proposes to study a diverse range of rotating fluid topics in
astrophysics: 1. Tidal evolution of late-type binaries; 2. dynamics of Neptune's
satellites and rings; 3. excitation and damping of the sun's normal modes; 4.
neutron star physics (origin and evolution of their magnetic fields and the
physics of gamma-ray bursts); and 5. topics in extragalactic astronomy. The PI
submitted this proposal under the Accomplishment Based Renewal category and
requested support for 5 years. During the tenure of this proposal, the PI
intends to conclude his involvement with these research topics on rotating
fluids and to turn his attention to new areas of study.
