The Noyce Scholars and Interns Program at the University of Portland is a
comprehensive partnership between the University's College of Arts and Sciences,
the Shiley School of Engineering, the School of Education, the Moreau Center for
Service and Leadership, Saturday Academy, and Portland Public Schools. The
program is increasing the number of highly-trained K-12 STEM teachers graduating
from the MAT program at the University who teach in high-needs schools. Noyce
Interns are working as teaching assistants in Saturday Academy classes for
students in grades 2-12. Noyce Scholars are STEM majors, at least 25% of whom
are mathematics, engineering, and computer science majors, and career-changing
STEM professionals who are being trained to be reflective teachers dedicated to
social justice through education. Noyce Scholars are serving two years as
teachers in high-needs schools for each year of scholarship. The project has 8
MAT scholars, 16 Noyce scholars and also supports 24 summer interns. Through
assessment, the program is helping STEM and Education faculty determine
effective strategies and practices for recruiting and supporting STEM majors and
STEM professionals who work to become K-12 teachers. The principal investigator
(PI) and Co-PIs are presenting the development and implementation of the
program, as well as lessons learned, at national and regional STEM and STEM
education conferences in order to help peer institutions set up similar
programs. The project is addressing a critical need for highly-trained STEM
educators in the Portland Public School system, strengthening ties between
divisions of the University of Portland and Portland Public Schools, and
bolstering the STEM teaching community in the Pacific Northwest.
