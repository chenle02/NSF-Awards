institutions from governmental affairs is a common principle of democratic
governments. In settings where religious affiliations are associated with other
aspects of heritage and individualsâ€™ identities, the principles of secularism
may be implemented in varying ways. This doctoral dissertation research
investigates reciprocal relationships between secularism and political change
through the theoretical lens of resilience, asking whether and how devout
individuals incorporate new concepts and identities to accommodate political
shifts away from secularism. In addition to training a doctoral student, the
project plans to disseminate findings widely to academic and non-academic
audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project tests the hypotheses
that democratic political transformations result in increasing proximity between
religion and secularism, and that individuals leverage this proximity as a means
of resilience to political changes targeting identity. Over twelve months of
ethnographic fieldwork, the investigators use a combination of participant
observation, semi-structured interviews, digital ethnography, and diary methods
to test these hypotheses. Research questions include (1) how religious
individuals understand and interpret secularism as a way of responding to
political change; and (2) how individuals use traditional religious principles
in conjunction with novel elements in response to political change. The research
contributes a novel synthesis of resilience theory and religion to investigate
the broad means by which humans adjust to changing political
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
