This grant funds training and support for teachers in the use of interactive
texts in mathematics instruction. The workshops are held during two consecutive
summers at four of the six existing Interactive Mathematics Text Project
centers. They include ongoing seminars throughout the academic year. This 24
month project introduces teachers in Towson (Maryland), Detroit, Los Angeles,
and Houston to interactive texts so they can use them in their classrooms and
begin authoring their own texts. Monthly seminars during the school year support
the classroom work of the teachers and provide a chance for them to share,
consult with experts, and provide feedback to the PI. In the second summer, the
teachers work with texts continues as they learn additional authoring systems.
The technology and methodology used in this project are new to teachers. The
project provides insights and understandings into how readily teachers adapt
this technology to their classrooms and how extensively teachers need to be
trained to feel comfortable with it and value its use. Cost sharing is estimated
at 73%
