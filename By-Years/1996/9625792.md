This projects focuses on development of scaleable parallel Molecular Dynamics
(MD) code to study the behavior of diblock copolymers under shear. Fast parallel
algorithms have been developed for simple fluids and for short range MD, but
algorithms that can handle polymeric chains are not available. Besides, current
algorithms only deal with equilibrium problems, whereas there is a need to study
problems with added shear flow. Several groups, have studied the equilibrium
phase diagram of diblock copolymers by means of simulations. Simulations have
not as yet been used to study their experimentally observed, rather complex,
dynamic response. Symmetric diblocks in equilibrium make a transition from a low
temperature, ordered (lamellar) phase to high temperature, disordered phase at
the order-disorder transitions temperature (TODT). Application of shear changes
the value of TODT. Ordered phases are observed even above the quiescent TODT.
The shift in TODT has been predicted theoretically for very long polymers. For
short diblocks- on which experiments are underway in Kramer's group at Cornell-
theoretical predictions is not exist and one has to rely on simulations instead.
This project will also study factors that influence the orientation of lamellae.
Experimentally, different orientations have been observed, but which mechanisms
play a role in the choice of preferred direction is not, as yet, well
understood.
