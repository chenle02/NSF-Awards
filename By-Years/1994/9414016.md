9414016 Ruvolo With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Maryellen Ruvolo
will purchase an automated DNA sequencer system consisting of: 1. an Applied
Biosystems automated DNA sequencer with the necessary software for editing and
analyzing newly-generated sequence files and for DNA microsatellite typing; and
2. a DNA data storage system consisting of: an external hard disk drive for
ready retrieval and manipulation of DNA sequence files and a magneto- optical
drive for long-term, high stability storage of DNA sequence files. The research
of Dr. Ruvolo and her colleagues uses DNA sequence data and the purchase of this
instrumentation will exponentially increase the laboratory's productivity.
Research on primate systematics and evolution constitutes the focus of the
laboratory's work and the team is currently involved in a number of projects.
These include a broad scale approach to the molecular systematics of primates
and a complementary effort on the molecular evolution of the Strepsirhines. The
group has begun work to determine the genetic diversity present within extant
chimpanzees and is examining mitochondrial DNA sequence and nuclear
microsatellite marker variability in East African chimpanzee populations. These
chimpanzees are important because of their endangered status as well as the
extensive behavioral information available on selected groups. The new
instrumentation will also allow the team to expand its examination of hominoid
nuclear gene variation and genomic structure. Dr. Ruvolo's laboratory trains
undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral fellows; automated
sequencer equipment will assist in this, as well as the research, function.
