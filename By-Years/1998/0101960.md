The Virtual Molecular Dynamics Laboratory will revise a set of instructional
materials for virtual chemistry laboratories and provide professional
development on those materials to 336 high school chemistry teachers. A key
feature of the materials is the use of molecular dynamics. Students can see in
real time, the microscopic behavior and using split-screen software programs can
simultaneously see the corresponding macroscopic behavior. By changing the
system conditions (e.g., the temperature) the student can begin to understand
both the microscopic and macroscopic properties. The teachers' professional
development will focus on using the simulations in their classes, introducing
the use of cooperative learning as a pedagogical approach to teaching chemistry
and encouraging the teachers to contribute to their profession by developing new
activities, approaches, lessons and assessments using the computer as a
simulator.
