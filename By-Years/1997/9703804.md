9703804 Armitage The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr.
Bruce A. Armitage to work with Dr. Peter E. Nielsen at the Panum Institute in
Copenhagen, Denmark. Dr. Armitage will study the interaction of peptide nucleic
acid (PNA) oligomers with RNA molecules. His major hypothesis is whether the
interaction of PNA with synthetic ribozyme RNA will inhibit ribozyme self-
splicing. This work will give increased understanding into the interaction of
PNA with folded RNA molecules, which are essential components in the development
of PNA as an antisense therapeutic and diagnostic agent. Dr. Nielsen is one of
the inventors of PNA and therefore is most experienced in the synthesis and
application of these molecules. In addition, Nielsen's colleague, Dr. Henrik
Nielsen will contribute expertise in RNA and ribozymes. Dr. Armitage completes
the collaboration with his experience in quinone chemistry and photochemistry.
