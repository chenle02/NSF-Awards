The focus of this research is the use of vicinal tricarbonyl compounds as
electrophiles in organic synthesis. Targets chosen for preparation include
zaragozic acid A and fumitremorgin B. In a related study, acyl cyano
phosphoranylidine derivatives of amino acids will be used as masked alpha-keto
amides for the synthesis of macrocyclic alpha keto lactams. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Harry H. Wasserman
of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Professor Wasserman will
focus his work on developing synthetic methods that use tricarbonyl compounds as
key units in bond forming reactions leading to products having interesting
biological properties.
