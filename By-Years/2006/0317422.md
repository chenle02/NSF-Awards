The investigators will measure absolute total cross sections for reactions
between state-selected diatomic cations and neutral oxygen atoms, which are of
importance to modeling of the ion chemistry in planetary atmospheres. The
investigators will use a unique octopole-quadropole photoionization apparatus
for state-selected ion-molecule reaction studies. The unique feature of this
apparatus is the implementation of the high-resolution pulsed field ionization-
photoelectron-photoion coincidence technique for state-selection of reactant
ions. The high resolution achieved has made possible the rotational state
selection of diatomic ions for ion-molecule reaction studies. Reaction rates
involving oxygen atoms in the ground state and the metastable state will be
examined. The success of this experiment will not only provide relevant cross
sections for modeling the ion chemistry of planetary atmospheres, but will also
open up a new research area concerning the fundamental study of ion-radical
reactions, which represent an important class of reactions occurring in extreme
plasma environments, including planetary atmospheres.
