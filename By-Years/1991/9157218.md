This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award. The research objective is to
develop a program to integrate large-scale and centrifuge data with numerical
data in order to expand the usefulness of these test methods for geotechnical
engineering. Centrifuge tests will be conducted to model problems being
addressed by on going large-scale tests and finte element analyses at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University.
