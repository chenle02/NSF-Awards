The project is enabling introductory physics teachers to develop the
instructional, computing and laboratory interfacing skills they need to help
their students learn physics by using the computer in the exploration of real
world phenomena. A two-week seminar is being offered in the summer of 1991 for
thirty college and university teachers and will be repeated in the summer of
1992 for thirty more undergraduate teachers. Participants will remain in contact
with one another and with the seminar instructors via a BITNET teleconference
during the academic year after each seminar is conducted. Topics covered in the
summer seminars include: interactive instructional strategies based on outcomes
of educational research; computer interfacing; use of spreadsheets and graphing
packages; data and error analysis techniques; the application of laboratory
interfacing and real time data analysis to lecture demonstrations; and numerical
problem solving and modeling.
