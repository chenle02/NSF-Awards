This grant will support experiment which will address a critical issue in
undergraduate engineering education. The test project will be based on an
autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and will involve hardware and software
design and development of ancillary systems necessary to carry out scientific
and engineering surveys to obtain needed environmental data. The AUV's layered
control approach, developed by Rodney Brooks at MIT's Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, breaks the robot control problem into a set of interacting
behaviors. This enables small student teams to work on a single behavior but
also forces them to work collaboratively in order to integrate interaction among
behaviors. This project will add a new dimension to Research Experiences for
Undergraduates by providing experience in design, engineering, construction, and
field testing.
