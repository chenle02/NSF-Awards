The objective of this research is to characterize the biochemistry and
molecular biology of nitrogen assimilation of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in
symbiosis with the bacterium Rhizobium meliloti, and to determine the effect of
the plant host in regulation of nodule formation and nitrogen fixation. The
proposed research will test the hypothesis that assimilation of ammonia produced
during nitrogen fixation involves the the expression of nodule.specific forms of
enzymes of the nitrogen assimilation pathway, and will be pursued through
analysis of the expression of genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase,
glutamate synthase, and aspartate amino transferase in alfalfa strains that form
nitrogen fixing and non.nitrogen fixing nodules. This research will increase
knowledge of plant host contributions to nitrogen fixation. It has the potential
to identify mechanisms of coordination of plant and bacterial gene expression
involved in this agronomically and economically important process and,
indirectly, to increase its efficiency.
