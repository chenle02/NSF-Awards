9703649 Borland The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral research visit
by Dr. Lisa M. Borland to work with Dr. Constantino Tsallis at the Centro
Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tsallis is a
distinguished member of the Brazilian scientific community, who has an
international reputation. The CBPF is one of the top research labs in Brazil,
housing over 70 researchers in physics, as well as 150 graduate students. This
project involves the investigation of the dynamics of systems with anomalous
diffusion. Specifically, they propose to develop a theoretical framework
ultimately resulting in a procedure for determining the underlying dynamics of
anomalous stochastic processes of Levy-type directly from experimental
observations. Once the theoretical description is understood, they would
implement the theory as a computer code. This would result in a powerful tool to
analyze the underlying dynamics of Levy- type processes in nature. ***
