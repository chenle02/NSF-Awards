Remote, reliable accelerometers suitable for deployment on the ocean floor are
needed for geophysical studies. In response to this need Optical Technologies,
Inc. (OPTECH) is designing an all- optical, remote fiber-optic accelerometer
system that requires no electrical conductors or connections in the water. The
accelerometer system will provide significant benefits and features; including
broad-band response, low maintenance, no electrical conductors/connections in
the water, wide dynamic range, no electrical power required at the sensor, and
remote sensing capability.
