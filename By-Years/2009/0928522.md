Lead Institution: Boise State University. &lt;br/&gt;Partner Institutions:
Caldwell School District, Boise School District, Emmett School District,
Meridian Joint School District, Idaho State Department of Education, University
of Idaho, Idaho State University, Micron Foundation, Idaho National Laboratory,
and Discovery Center of Idaho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across the nation, there is
concern about the quality and quantity of K-12 education in science, technology,
engineering and math. Idaho is no exception, where a primary concern is the lack
of highly qualified STEM education teachers. Teachers' abilities influence
students' knowledge and subsequently affect students' achievement and career
choices. School districts, parents, corporations, legislators, colleges,
universities, and other stakeholders are promoting efforts to address this
situation, yet these efforts are often isolated and disparate, and therefore,
fragmented in their impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MSP-Start grant, led by
faculty at Boise State University, brings together a wide range of partners to
create a shared vision and develop common goals for STEM education throughout
Idaho. Using this shared vision as a guide, the team is conducting a needs
analysis supported by data collection and reviews of the STEM education
literature. In developing a shared strategic plan, the team will focus on
assuring all students access to challenging courses and curricula, increasing
teacher quality, quantity and diversity of math and science teachers, and
integrating the new plan with promising practices in the partner institutions.
The goal of the project is the development of an MSP-Target or Institute
Partnership proposal. The type and focus of the proposal will depend on the
outcome of the data collection, the shared vision, and the strategic plan
informed by the data analysis and planning process with all partners.
