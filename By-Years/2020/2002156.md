Recently, there has been a tremendous growth in the number of electronics
markets that cater to a diverse set of participants such as advertisers,
retailers, publishers, traders, and freelance workers. A unifying feature of
such markets is that the participants do not possess complete information about
payoff-relevant market features, which they must learn during their multiple
interactions with the market. The goal of this research activity is to study
repeated auction markets where the bidders have incomplete information about the
items being auctioned, and analyze the resulting dynamic bidding behavior. Such
auctions arise in online advertising markets and play a significant role in
sustaining a wide range of services available on the Internet. The insights
obtained from this research will be used to evaluate and improve the design and
operation of such markets. The PI is committed to involving students from
underrepresented groups into this research program, and will engage in outreach
efforts through various outreach programs at Cornell
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The learning incentives inherent in repeated
auction markets require each bidder to evaluate the effects of his or her
actions and those of his or her competitors on the future evolution of the
market state. In order to understand how a bidder behaves in such settings, this
research will first use the tools of dynamic programming to obtain insights
about the structure of the bidder's optimal strategy for given fixed strategies
of her competitors. Using these structural insights, the researcher will then
characterize the resulting equilibrium in the market where each bidder reacts
optimally to others. We will develop algorithms based on iterative schemes to
approximately compute such equilibria and numerically analyze how the design of
the market affects its equilibrium properties. We will use the numerical
investigations to identify practical guidelines for improving the design and
operation of repeated auction markets, in terms of maximizing its revenue and
overall efficiency.
