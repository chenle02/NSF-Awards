Under the supervision of Prof. David Stark, Ph.D. student Joan H Robinson, will
engage in archival research and interviews to investigate the regulatory
framework for home diagnostics, looking in particular at how home diagnostics
have contributed to the development of American legal frameworks of personal
privacy and disclosure. Utilizing archival materials at the National Archives
and those attained through the Freedom of Information Act, she will study the
primary sources used by the Food and Drug Administration in their deliberation
regarding the Medical Device Amendments of 1976. The Co-PI, who is trained as a
lawyer, will also examine over one thousand case laws relating patent disputes
and misuse of these technologies.

Tools of self-diagnosis, from home HIV tests to monitors worn throughout the
day, are becoming widespread. This research will increase our understanding of
how home diagnostics are shaped by and shaping laws, attitudes and practices
regarding privacy, disclosure, and surveillance.
