9420964 Aubin This award provides funding for the development of a proprietary
Solid Freeform Fabrication Technology called 3 Dimensional Printing (3DP), which
will be used for a variety of injection mold tooling applications. Three
Dimensional Printing creates tooling inserts, mold, and/or component parts
directly from a computer model in an additive layer-by-layer process. Each layer
is created by spreading a powder and selectively joining the powder by ink-jet
printing of a liquid binder material. Within this program, mold inserts will be
produced in two ways: 1) by direct printing powder metal or metal/ceramic, and
2) by printing ceramic molds into which tool steel is cast. The 3DP process
could result in significant cost reduction in injection mold tooling
applications. The technology would have application in many manufacturing
processes.
