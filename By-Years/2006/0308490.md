0308490&lt;br/&gt;Weingartner&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Alaska
Fairbanks provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation
to be used on R/V Alpha Helix, a 132' research vessel operated by the
university's Seward Marine Center as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically, support is
recommended to acquire a precision heading, attitude and positioning sensor,
temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen sensors for the CTD instrument, there
computers for data acquisition and analysis, a navigation and charting software
package, and an upgrade to the deck unit for the CTD. All of these items are
intended for shared-use operation. These acquisitions should provide a
substantial advantage to marine scientists using R/V Alpha Helix in their
research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
