The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Professor Cina on numerical and analytical studies of the
time evolution of electronic geometric phase factors under large amplitude
nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules. Dynamics calculations pertinent to
oriented and unoriented samples are being used to investigate the possibility of
experimental observation of quantum adiabatic phase effects. Theoretical studies
of ultrafast phase-coherent optical spectroscopy on interacting chemical systems
are also being carried out. %%% It may be possible to use laser irradiation to
direct and control the course of chemical reactions. In order to achieve this
objective, the pathways for redistribution of energy within an absorbing
molecule must be better understood. Professor Cina's theoretical calculations
are intended to probe the possibility for a number of seminal experiments in
this field.
