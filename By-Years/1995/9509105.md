MCB 9509105 Catherine Walsh This proposal is designed to provide valuable
preliminary data contributing to the long-term goal of characterizing thymic
function in cartilaginous fish, the most primitive groups of jawed vertebrates
to possess a distinct thymus. The work focuses on the preliminary
characterization of possible phylogenetic equivalents of specialized cells
identified in mammalian thymi as thymic nurse cells. The thymic nurse cells are
suspected to have roles in interthymic T-cell maturation and/or removal of
nonfunctional or self reactive thymocytes. The research planning grant will be
used to develop a full research proposal to characterize the functional role and
evolutionary significance of elasmobranch thymic cells. %%% This project will
investigate the evolution of the thymus and the interrelation of cells in the
thymus. It will provide evidence to explain how cells acquire different
functions in the body of an organism. ***
