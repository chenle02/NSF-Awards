This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Prasad Akella of
Stanford University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Kazuo Tanie for
22 months at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL) in Japan. Akella and
Tanie will apply Dr. Akella's behavior models for soft fingertips in order to
better manipulate a three fingered robotic hand which was developed by Tanie.
Controlling the contact forces of a robotic hand when it is tasked to grasp an
object is quite difficult. Akella has found that soft fingertips stabilize a
robotic hand by dissipating energy and improve its dynamic performance. In order
to overcome the unstable contact forces of Tanie's robotic hand, the team will
develop force control software to complement Akella's mechanical design solution
of soft fingertips. Developing such an effective methodology for implementing
force control in manipulators can lead to more advanced robots which could be
used for more complex tasks in industrial as well as remote settings such as
undersea or in space.
