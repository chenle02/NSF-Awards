Optimization problems arise in every branch of science and engineering. In these
problems, typically one needs to choose parameters in order to minimize an
objective such as energy or cost. "Nonsmooth" means that the objective may not
vary smoothly with the parameters, and "nonconvex" means that the problems may
have multiple minimizers with different objective values, making them especially
difficult to solve.

The project focuses on three aspects of these problems: algorithms, theory, and
applications. The intellectual merit of the proposed work concerns the details
of all three aspects, which are all interrelated. Algorithms are formal ways to
specify computational methods. We focus on two algorithms in particular: a new
easily-stated but computationally intensive method designed specifically for
nonsmooth problems, and an older, well known, highly effective method for smooth
optimization which up until the present has not been considered a viable option
in the nonsmooth case. We intend to develop a theoretical foundation for the
convergence of these methods. We are also interested in other theoretical
issues. Finally, applications of nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization abound in
engineering and applied science, particularly in control engineering. Making an
impact in these application areas requires much effort: first of all,
understanding the problems of interest and their theoretical aspects, and
following this by applying our algorithms to the problems and analyzing the
results.

The broader impact of the proposed work has many components. One is that it will
lead to publicly available software that can be downloaded by engineers and
other users. The importance of robust, easy-to-use portable software and its
impact on the scientific infrastructure cannot be overstated. Nonsmooth,
nonconvex optimization has many potential applications, and it is hoped that the
successful application of the algorithms developed in this project to
challenging problems arising in practice will inspire other researchers to apply
them directly to their problems. Finally, the proposed work includes many
opportunities for the principal investigator to continue advising and mentoring
students, including members of underrepresented groups.
