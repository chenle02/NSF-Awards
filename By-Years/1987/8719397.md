Locomotion in all segmented animals consists of a repeated series of movements
that are metachronously coordinated in different segments of the animal's body.
The objectives of the work to be performed by Dr. Brian Mulloney are to describe
the structure, integrative properties and synaptic organization of the neurons
that control the metachronous movements of one set of segmental limbs, the
abdominal swimmerets of the crayfish and to describe how the ganglia in which
they occur are organized. These experiments will allow us to compare the
characteristics of spiking intersegmental coordinators and non.spiking bilateral
local coordinators, and to see if the non.spiking neurons play roles
fundamentally different from those of the spiking interneurons in the generation
of these movements. They will test an hypothesis about the properties of neurons
that synchronize bilateral pattern generating circuits. They will discover the
intersegmental circuits that coordinate different limbs metachronously, and
permit us to compare these circuits with functionally equivalent circuits in
other animals. This work is important because it will yield more knowledge which
is missing about coordinated movements and may supply valuable information
regarding spinal reflexes in man.
