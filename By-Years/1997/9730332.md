Incomplete information studies of bargaining impasse have used assumptions from
Nash's bargaining problem as experimental treatment variables. Results show that
when negotiators are uncertain about the size of the surplus to be divided or
the outside options of each other, breakdowns can result. Until now, research
has not analyzed the affects of private information in the third determinant of
the bargaining problem-bargainerr preferences. This study will develop a
methodology for determining bargainer preferences or type and use this
information as the treatment variable in another series of economic experiments.
One treatment provides bargainers with complete information in all aspects of
the bargaining game except for each other's type. The second treatment truly
constitutes complete information because in this case bargainers will also know
their opponent's type. Based on previous bargaining work done by experimental
economists, reciprocal fair behavior and individualistic behavior will be
identified and used to construct a taxonomy of subject type. Using the possible
combinations of these two types, three bargaining cells will constitute each
treatment. A comparison of the impasse rates of the two treatments will test
whether impasse vanishes under conditions of complete
