The research program proposes several problems at the interface of algebraic
geometry and characteristic p techniques in commutative algebra. Given a
variety, for simplicity say defined by polynomials with integer coefficients, we
can ``reduce mod p" for each prime integer p, and arrive at a family of
varieties over finite fields of varying characteristic. The overall goal of this
program is to understand the relationships between phenomena defined by
resolution of singularities or integration for complex varieties with "purely
algebraic" issues in these prime characteristic models. For example, continuing
with a project started with her post-doc Karl Schwede, the PI proposes to prove
that complex Log Fano varieties reduce mod p to globally F-regular varieties.
She also proposes a possible attack on the conjecture that log canonical
singularities reduce mod p to F- pure singularities, which involves direct
computation of the "F- threshold", a prime characteristic analog of the log
canonical threshold, for hypersurfaces. Her PhD student Daniel Hernandez is
making excellent progress on this.

Algebraic Geometry is the study of geometric objects which are defined by
polynomial equations. Just as lines are described by equations like y = 3 x + 1
or circles by equations like x^2 + y^2 = 4, it is possible to describe many more
complicated geometric objects, for example, in higher dimensional spaces, with
polynomials. This project attempts to understand the geometry of these
complicated objects by looking at the algebraic features of the equations that
define them. For example, we can see geometric properties of the line (such as
its slope, or "how fast it rises") in the equation y = m x + b (the slope is the
coefficient of x--the number m), or geometric properties (such as the radius) of
the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4 in the algebra of its equation (the square root of the
constant term, or 2, is the radius). This project proposes exactly that: study
the geometry of much more complicated objects defined by polynomials by looking
carefully at the polynomials themselves. There are several projects proposed
with the mentorship of young mathematicians in mind.
