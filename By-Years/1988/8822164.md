The proposed project will evaluate the potential for using the stomatal
resistance formulation for estimating regional evapotranspiration rates. This
will be accomplished by running a workshop at Pennsylvania State University in
the spring of 1989. The purpose of the workshop will be to clarify unresolved
issues in the use of stomatal and plant resistance parameterizations in large
scale plant canopy/atmospheric models. Subject matter will focus on the
technical aspect of measurements and formulation of the resistance laws at the
large scale and their applications. The workshop attendees will include an
interdisciplinary group of scientists from field of plant physiology, agronomy,
hydrology and meteorology. The workshop participants will be divided up into
three groups which include plan-scale, micrometeorology, and macromodeling
groups. A series of 15 position papers will be presented at the conference and
peer reviewed articles will be published in the Journal of Agricultural and
Forest Meteorology. The participants will also prepare a list of important
issues and recommendations which will be presented in a formal workshop report
to NSF. The principal investigators are well qualified to run this type of
workshop and Pennsylvania State University has adequate facilities for this type
of workshop. The Ecosystem Study Program recommends that this proposal should be
funded.
