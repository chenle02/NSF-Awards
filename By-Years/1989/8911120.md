This interdisciplinary study will examine the physical and biological
mechanisms for retention of fish larvae in the vicinity of an isolated island,
Barbados in this case. One specific physical mechanism will be examined in
detail. The recirculation in eddies generated by interaction of the prevailing
current with the island leads to a retention mechanism that allows recruitment
of larval fish that would be swept away in the mean current.
