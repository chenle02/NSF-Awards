ABSTRACT David Dandy CTS-9404556 Particle separation in liquid-solids laminar
flow branches pipes will be investigated using a combined computational and
experimental fluid mechanics approach. Three-dimensional Navier Stokes
simulations will be used to determine particle trajectories and concentrations
in branched separations including concentration variation with the pipe radius
(termed tubular pinch) and the effect of secondary currents. The results will be
compared to a systematic set of measurements performed by changing the particle
density, size and shape, and branched pipe diameter ratio and angle. Particles
to be used in experiments are of spherical, quasi-spherical and elongated
shapes, which are relevant to cell separation processes. The model for the
velocity and concentration prediction at moderate Reynolds number will be used
to develop improved design methods. By concentrating the particles away from the
wall, the particle-free fluid can be sucked into side branches. If successful,
the project is expected to provide experimental and numerical data in a
biotechnology area with limited previous research results, and a design
methodology for two-phase flow in branched pipe systems leading to more
efficient cell separation systems. ***
