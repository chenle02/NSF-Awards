This project provides partial support for maintenance and care of the Rancho
Santa Ana Botanic Garden and Pomona College herbarium (RSA-POM) collections.
RSA-POM, a National Resource Collection, is an important reference collection
for systematic botany research worldwide. Increased curatorial activity,
including the transfer of 170,000 specimens from the Los Angeles County Museum,
has resulted in a shortage of storage space for the growing collections. Use of
the collections by researchers has also increased, placing greater demands on
the time of curatorial and technical staff. NSF funds will be used to purchase
and install 142 new and 120 existing herbarium cases on a movable-carriage
compactor system. Housed on the herbarium's third floor, the system will provide
a 46% increase in storage capacity over the existing cabinet arrangement, enough
space for an additional 123,000 specimens. This will allow for nearly five
year's growth at the current rate of 25,000 specimens annually. NSF funds will
also be used to support two technicians to process new accessions, loans,
exchanges, staff collections, and other curatorial activities. Special emphasis
will be given to processing backlog collections and completing segregation of
the type collection.
