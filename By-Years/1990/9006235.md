Professor David Chandler is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the statistical
mechanical treatment of dynamics and structure in liquids. This research will
contribute significantly to our physical understanding of liquid structure at
the molecular level, and provide a fundamental molecular level description of
chemical reactions in solution. The main thrust of Chandler's research is in the
area of chemical dynamics and quantum processes in liquids. Specifically, he
plans to develop extensions and applications of techniques for performing time
dependent quantum Monte Carlo calculations on liquid systems. He also plans to
develop new treatments for electronic states in liquids and for metal insulator
transitions in liquids. The reference interaction site model (RISM) developed in
Chandler's research group will be extended to the treatment of solvation
dynamics, and a new dynamical functional integral approach for treating
vitrification and glass transition will also be developed.
