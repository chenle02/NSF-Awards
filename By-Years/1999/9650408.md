This project takes advantage of new laboratory and communications facilities at
this institution and current, rapidly developing technology to bring a variety
of mathematical course materials directly to students in their dormitory rooms,
homes, and departmental computer laboratories through World Wide Web
connections. Materials include mathematical course notes prepared directly on
computers, scanned documents such as sample exams, and laboratory exercises in
Java (tm) script. The university is providing the students with laboratory
computers, dormitory connections, and modem access. The next step in this
project involves the use of additional equipment and software to acquire and
store soft images of materials and to support laboratory and Web access to them.
The project also addresses the problematic format of mathematical documents to
be distributed over the Web.
