Using lab-teaching technology developed at their laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor
will hold teacher-teacher-training workshops at six locations in the Northeast,
Southeast and Midwest each summer, 1987-89. A mobile DNA laboratory carries all
the equipment necessary to perform with 24 participants a series of nine
experiments which culminate in the production and analysis of a recombinant-DNA
molecule. Each course will draw from teacher populations within commuting
distance of workshop site. Propose site and dates for 1987 workshops are: (1)
Winsor School, Boston, Massachusetts, June 29 - July 3; (2) Bronx School of
Science, The Bronx, New York, July 6-10; (3) Jefferson School of Science,
Fairfax, Virginia, July 27-31; (4) Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne,
Illinois, August; (5) Choate-Rosemary Hall, Wallingford, Connecticut, August;
(6) State University, Albany, New York, August. On-site preparation is
coordinated by a local organizer at the host institution. Although the program
is designed to select advanced placement and honors teachers a proportion of
similarly-qualified general biology teachers will be selected.
