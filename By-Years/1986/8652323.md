Thirty high school science and or/mathematics teachers will participate in a 3
week summer workshop and 14 Saturday workshops during the academic year. The
project focuses on updating knowledge in biology, physics, chemistry,
mathematics, and computer science. The instructional phase of this project
includes: lectures, laboratory experiences, field trips, and special projects.
The participants will be chosen from 60 Mississippi counties, both rural and
urban. The participants will provide local support from the school districts'
administrations. The college will provide resource support for the
implementation of the local inservice activities. This project, with the support
of local school systems, will aid significantly in helping the schools respond
to the newly mandated science and mathematics requirements of the state
department of education.
