This project involves the provision of conference expenses (including travel,
subsistence, and other necessary expenses) for selected computer professionals
who are physically disabled, a member of a racial or ethic minority, or both.
The expenses are for attendees at the conference on Computers and Quality of
Life (CQL'90) on September 13-16, 1990 in Washington, D.C.. The conferences is
sponsored by the acm/SIGCAS (Association for Computing Machinery's Special
Interest Group on Computers and Society) and the acm/SIGCAPH (Special Interest
Group on Computers and the Physically Handicapped). This conference offers a
multi-disciplinary dialog on what is known about the effects, both positive and
negative, of computing on human well- being. The program features computing
applications that benefit the entire society or groups with special needs, e.g.,
disabilities. Project support will make possible for computer professionals,
including instructors, to contribute to a dialog in which they would be able to
participate without special support.*** //
