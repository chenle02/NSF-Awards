This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will exploit the unique
fluorescence and signal amplification qualities of poly(phenylene ethynylene)s
in a nanoparticle format. This combines the intense solid-state fluorescence and
sensing capabilities of poly(phenylene ethynylene)s (PPEs) with the many unique
attributes of nanoparticles, including their tremendous surface area and their
surface adsorptivity. In this project, a series of charged PPEs whose emissions
span the color spectrum will be synthesized and systematically evaluated for the
formation of stable, aqueous nanoparticle dispersions. They will be
functionalized and conjugated to biologic recognition molecules (i.e. antibodies
and nucleic acids). The Phase I effort will yield a series of functional, highly
fluorescent nanoparticles which may be used directly for the labeling of
biological molecules.&lt;br/&gt; The commercial applications of this project
will be in standoff explosives detection for wide area mapping. Standoff, wide
area mapping is of intense interest for military and humanitarian uses as well
as for environmental remediation of explosives
contamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
