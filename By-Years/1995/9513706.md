9513706 Steinman In this work the oxidative stress response of two non-enteric
bacteria will be studied. Caulobacter. crescentus is adapted to survive in
nutrient-poor environments and entrance into and out of stationary phase is
likely an important part of its life cycle. However, little is known about
stationary phase in this bacterial species. The role of CuZn superoxide
dismutase and catalase/peroxidase in the stationary phase response will be
established. The gene for the catalase/peroxidase will be cloned, and a null
mutant constructed and characterized with respect to oxidative and other
stresses in various growth stages. Hybridization will be used to determine if C.
crescentus contains an rpoS homologue. If present, the gene will be cloned and a
null mutant made and characterized in its stationary phase resistance and
induction of CuZn SOD and catalase. A strain containing a transcriptional fusion
between the catalase promoter and lacZ will be constructed and subjected to
transposon mutagenesis to identify insertions that influence the stationary
phase induction of catalase. These mutants will be characterized in stationary
phase response as above and mutations of interest cloned. In addition, the cell
cycle of all mutants will be studied. Legionella. pneumophila
catalase/peroxidase gene(s) will be cloned and a null mutant made in wild type
and CuZn SOD-deficient strains. These mutants will be characterized in their
response to oxidative stress and ability infect macrophage cell lines and
monocytes. %%% Most cells can protect themselves against damage caused by the
reactive products of oxygen metabolism by making enzymes that destroy these
toxic compounds. In this project the oxidative stress response will be studied
in two bacterial species whose ecological niche may create an extracellular
oxidative threat: Caulobacter crescentus, a dimorphic pond bacterium which may
be exposed to high levels of external oxygen from photosynthetic algae, and the
Legionnaire's disease bacterium, Legionella pneumophila, that may confront
reactive oxygen species from respiratory burst activity in infected animal
cells. Although the response of E. coli to oxidative and stationary phase
stresses is well characterized, comparatively little is known for other
bacterial species. The work will focus on catalase/peroxidase enzyme activities
that should help protect the bacteria. Mutations will be constructed in the
genes for catalase/peroxidase, and the effect on bacterial survival during
oxidative stress and stationary phase stress will be determined. This will
provide new information about how desirable bacteria may be maintained and,
conversely, how undesirable ones might be combated. ***
