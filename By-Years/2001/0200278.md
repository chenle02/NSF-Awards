The principal investigator proposes to study linear systems of &lt;br/&gt;higher
dimensional varieties. In particular, he plans to apply &lt;br/&gt;the methods
of higher dimensional geometry to study some basic &lt;br/&gt;questions from
different areas of algebraic geometry such as &lt;br/&gt;birational geometry,
commutative algebra, computational &lt;br/&gt;complexity, geometry of algebraic
curves, jet schemes of singular &lt;br/&gt;varieties and geometry of big
divisors. He has already obtained &lt;br/&gt;results in the following areas, (1)
effective results on&lt;br/&gt;Nullstellensatz and syzygies of ideals, (2)
singularities of &lt;br/&gt;theta divisors and birational geometry of irregular
varieties, &lt;br/&gt;(3) Fujita's problems on adjoint linear systems and (4)
studying &lt;br/&gt;symbolic power of an ideal. But there are still many
fundamental &lt;br/&gt;problems remain unsolved. He plans to develop new methods
and &lt;br/&gt;techniques to study them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry
is one of the oldest areas in mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;it studies geometric,
algebraic and arithmetic properties of &lt;br/&gt;geometric objects defined by
algebraic equations. Algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geoemtry also has applications to
mathematical physics and &lt;br/&gt;cryptography. In this project, the principal
investigator &lt;br/&gt;develops new techniques to study algebra, computational
&lt;br/&gt;complexity and properties of higher dimensional geometric
&lt;br/&gt;objects. &lt;br/&gt;
