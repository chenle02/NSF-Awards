*** Johnson 9501892 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
seeks to develop novel materials for use in photocatalytic destruction of
organic contaminents in air, water and on surfaces. The research objectives are
to develop non-oxidizable ambient-temperature binders for photocatalytic TiO2;
enhance destruction rates of target compounds using tailored surface coatings;
demonstrate commercially useful self-cleaning, biocidal clear coats; and show
that photocatalytic reactions produce no undesirable byproducts. Target
applications of the technology include treatment of industrial air emissions,
destruction of chlorinated organics in drinking water, and self-cleaning,
mildewcidal and bactericidal architectural paints and clear coats. Spin-off
applications that are envisioned include clean rooms for semiconductor
manufacturing and control of fruit ripening. *** p:\sbir\yhashimi\9501892c.doc
