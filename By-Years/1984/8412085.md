The objective of this research is to design methodologies and algorithms that
enable users to access data in several separate databases by using a common
interface and without knowing in which databases the data is stored. The study
investigates the problem of merging descriptions of separate databases and of
converting requests expressed against a merged description into equivalent
requests against the original separate databases. Algorithms are developed that
enable the database administrator to identify and resolve conflicts encountered
when merging the description of the separate databases, and to design mappings
between the merged description and the original separate databases. These
mappings are required to process a request that accesses portions of data from
several separate databases. The research emphasizes the development of
descriptive techniques associated with schemas, theoretical work on schema
mappings, and graphics development for easy user intersection.
