In this project, research in the algorithm design and analysis of high order
numerical methods, including the finite difference and finite volume weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, discontinuous Galerkin finite
element methods, and particle methods, for hyperbolic and other convection
dominated partial differential equations, especially in adaptive, multiscale and
uncertain environments, will be carried out. Parallel implementation and
applications of these methods will also be addressed. The intellectual merit of
the proposed activity lies in its comprehensive coverage of algorithm
development, analysis, implementation and applications. Problems in applications
motivate the design of new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms;
mathematics tools are used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for
their applicability and limitations; practical considerations including parallel
implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in large
scale calculations; and collaborations with engineers and other applied
scientists enable the efficient application of these new algorithms or new
features in existing algorithms.

The proposed research aims at the design of efficient algorithms, which, when
used on today's powerful computers, will help to solve many problems from
diversified applications such as aerodynamics and aeroacoustics for aircraft
design, electromagnetism wave simulation for communications, and semiconductor
device simulation for the computer industry. The thrust of this proposal is to
use powerful mathematical tools to guide the design of algorithms, so that they
are more efficient, more reliable, and more robust in applications.
