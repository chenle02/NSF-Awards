Objective: &gt; The objective of this program is to develop new nonlinear and
active artificial impedance surfaces. This represents a new research area with
the potential to significantly expand the capabilities of artificial media, and
overcome the limitations of current passive impedance surfaces. This program
will involve all aspects of research, from conceptual development and
simulations to fabrication and measurements. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &gt;
The intellectual merit is that the development of active and nonlinear surfaces
will expand human knowledge to include nonlinear surface wave effects, as well
as superluminal propagation of surface waves through the use of active
electronics embedded in periodic structures. This proposal is transformative in
that these structures will demonstrate unique new phenomena at a size and
frequency scale that is amenable to direct probing of the electric field to
enable full examination of the underlying physics. In the future, these concepts
can also be extended to other regimes such as optical surfaces that include
active or nonlinear materials. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &gt; The broader
impacts are that this program will involve new outreach efforts to historically
underrepresented groups, as well as K-12 students to motivate them to pursue
higher education in engineering. This outreach effort will be through
coordination with the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering IDEA (Inclusion,
Diversity, Excellence, and Advancement) Center. The PI will pledge to work with
the center to identify potential grad students from historically
underrepresented groups, and to identify opportunities to promote the excitement
of this research to K-12 students.
