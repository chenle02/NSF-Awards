Four experimental workstations are being built. These stations are being used in
undergraduate electronic laboratories in order that students learn about and
participate in computer control and interfacing. Each station, when completed,
will consist of a personal computer equipped with appropriate interface boards
and a high-speed digital signal processor. With these workstations, students
will learn how to gather and analyze experimental data. Although this equipment
is being used principally in our electronics lab course, it will greatly enhance
and benefit all of our advanced undergraduate laboratory courses.
