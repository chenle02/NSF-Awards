Aerial wells, a device used in antiquity, are mounds of rocks which collect
moisture from the air and release water. They work best in arid regions where
solar heating and radiative cooling are large. The program will demonstrate that
"hydrogenesis", an apparent natural phenomenon, is the principle exploited in
the aerial well. A working hypothesis asserts that water is collected by
diffusion into micro pores of rocks and that there is enough diffusion potential
for water to collect at temperatures above the dew point of the free air.
Analytical models of controlling phenomena, water collection, retention and
release are being developed to explore the well's performance. The models are
based on Fick's diffusion equation, Marangoni's effect and Gibb's free energy
equation. A one-dimensional computerized model is being developed in Phase I of
this SBIR project. This model is to provide insight into the controlling
phenomena as a function of independent variables including humidity and
temperature, as well as optimum material properties.
