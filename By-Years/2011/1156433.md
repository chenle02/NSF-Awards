Chemistry (12)

The ChemPRIME (Chemical Principles through Integrated Multiple Exemplars)
Program is developing an approach to learning chemistry that presents Concepts
in a logically developed order common to many popular texts, but allows students
to choose from a wide variety of Exemplars, or subject-specific examples that
illustrate the concepts, arranged in Tracks that run through the entire course.
ChemPRIME applies the tools of chemistry to issues or subjects that students are
interested in. ChemPRIME retains the advantages, and sheds the disadvantages, of
previous approaches to teaching chemistry, by retaining the hierarchical
development of theory while allowing students to choose cases or applications of
the theory that motivate them to learn. This project is developing exemplars for
most of the concepts included in a typical general chemistry course spanning
tracks like Geology; Physics/Astronomy; Engineering; Everyday Products; Sports,
Physiology and Health; Biological Science; Liberal Arts; Environment and
Forensics. ChemPRIME offers an opportunity to integrate frontier developments in
chemistry into the curriculum while reflecting the field's increasing
contributions to other disciplines.

ChemPRIME is being developed as a MediaWiki速 text in combination with the
course management system Moodle速. Both MediaWiki速 and Moodle速 are open source,
making the project readily available and adaptable by others. ChemPRIME will be
disseminated through the Chemical Education Digital Library, a Pathway in the
National Science Digital Library, and will draw upon and contribute to the
various disciplines designated as NSDL Pathways. The ChemPRIME design invites
all users to contribute exemplars from their fields of expertise or interest.
