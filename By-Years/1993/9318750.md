ABSTRACT P.I. John Fleagle/Pierre Lemelin SBR- 9318750 The evolution of
prehensile extremities is a recurrent theme in models of primate origins.
However, there is strong disagreement about the underlying causes associated
with the shift toward greater prehensile capabilities of the hand in primates.
Proponents of the arboreal theory of primate origins have suggested that
locomotion in the trees, especially leaping from branch to branch, was the
primary selective factor involved in the evolution of prehensile hands and other
primate diagnostic features. Alternative models stressing viual predation on
invertebrates on fine-branch supports have also been proposed to explain the
emergence of these features. The main problem when evaluating these models is
that no detailed knowledge exists on how performance variables actually relate
to hand function and structure in extant primates. To this end, this research
project will document associations between hand morphology and hand use during
locomotion, posture, and manipulation of food objects whithin extant prosimian
primates. Differences in hand proportions and musculature will be contrasted
with behavioral observataions on hand use for selected genera. Comparisons will
then be made with some non-primate groups in order to highlight the peculiarly
primate specializations of prehensility. This study will provide an empirical
basis to evaluate various models of primate origins to explain manual
prehensility, and to interpert behavior in many important fossil hands. ***
