This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE)
grant aims at obtaining information on the mechanisms and pathways of allostery
on proteins by measuring and analyzing a protein?s 3D map of local mechanical
strength. Allostery involves the propagation of signals between sites in a
protein structure. A change in function could be brought about by the binding of
a ligand, covalent modification or mutation at a distant site. The mechanism of
this site-to-site communication is not understood, and is of great interest,
especially since allosteric effects must be considered in drug design and
protein engineering. The first part of the project will involve development of a
technique to calculate the local elastic moduli as a function of the position in
space for a molecule, while the second part will focus on applying the resulting
3D maps of local material strength to understand the mechanisms of allostery,
find the positions of possible allosteric sites and predict pathways of
propagation of allosteric signals through a molecule.

The results will benefit society by improving our understanding of allostery
and its connection to many regulatory processes that happen in the human body,
and by providing an innovative tool with the potential to revolutionize the
field of drug discovery for the treatment of several conditions and diseases,
including certain types of cancer. In addition, undergraduate students, and high
school students and teachers from underrepresented groups in Puerto Rico and the
New York City area will be exposed to the concepts and method through summer
internships and visits to the group?s laboratory, with the purpose of broadening
the participation of students from these groups and increasing their enrollment
into undergraduate and graduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) programs.
