9712309 Cupolo *** This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project
seeks to find the optimal red phosphor formulations which can be used in the
standard liquid crystal display (LCD) backlighting arrangement. By modifying the
conventional backlighting arrangement, through the use of novel phosphor
materials, substantial advances in these directions are possible. Standard
backlit LCDs are known to have poor luminous efficiency and viewing angles. The
direct material costs of LCDs are high, which, when compounded with low
production yields, have kept finished product prices high. Despite this, the LCD
is the most mature flat panel display technology commercially available. The LCD
has also captured the majority of the world's flat panel display market and
consequently has the largest production capacity. Therefore, there is a
significant opportunity to improve the LCD. It is anticipated that these red
phosphor materials will provide the basis for simultaneously improving the
luminous efficiency by approximately 50%, maximizing the viewing angles,
reducing direct material costs and improving production yields. This technology
will have applications in laptop and desktop computer displays, large-screen
direct-view TV's, electronic billboards. ***
