This is a proposal to provide funding for lodging and travel to the workshop
"Nil Phenomena in Topology," which will be held at Vanderbilt University
(Nashville, Tennessee USA) on 14-15 April 2007. Approximately 20 topologists are
invited to participate, almost all of whose current work is related to the theme
of the workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to engage established experts
and younger researchers in discussions on the current state of affairs and on
possibilities for future research. The theme of the workshop is the calculation
and handling of mysterious algebraic structures called Nil and UNil, defined 35
years ago by Friedhelm Waldhausen and Sylvain Cappell. Algebraically, these
structures are the correction terms to Mayer-Vietoris type sequences in K- and
L-theory, which have a strong connection to the Farrell-Jones Isomorphism
Conjecture. Geometrically, these structures obstruct the splitting of homotopy
equivalences between manifolds along two-sided sub-manifolds, which has a strong
connection to the Equivariant Borel Conjecture. Therefore these obstruction
groups play a central role in the reduction problem in the geometric topology of
high-dimensional manifolds.

The workshop is timely in that it aims to connect the various sub-disciplines of
the "Nil phenomena" that have emerged in the past 35 years. The points of view
that merit publicity at this gathering are the categorical, the manipulative,
the differential-geometric, and the controlled-topological. Besides a general
awareness of the big picture, we would like to stimulate more collaboration in
the "assembly line" from theoretical structure to algebraic computations to
geometric consequences in the topology of manifolds. More information can be
