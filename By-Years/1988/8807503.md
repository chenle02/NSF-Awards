This project partially supports the domestic travel of participants attending
the 1988 Gordon Research Conference on Statistics in Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering. The Gordon Research Conference fund will provide the principal
costs of the research meeting. The conference provides an opportunity for the
exchange of new ideas among researchers in statistics, chemistry, and chemical
engineering. Participants will include statisticians, chemists, and chemical
engineers from industry, government, and universities. The discussions will
involve innovative research ideas in applied statistics and in the analysis of
chemical phenomena.
