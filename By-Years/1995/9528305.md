This award to Washington University-St. Louis supports the dissertation
research of a student of cultural anthropology. The project will investigate the
knowledge possessed by women in an Indonesian town about HIV/AIDS. Through
interviews and ethnographic observations of married women, never-married women,
and commercial sex workers, the student will assess the women's knowledge of how
AIDS spreads, sexual practices which limit or facilitate the spread of the
disease, and the women's abilities to negotiate `safe-sex` practices with their
partners. The student will survey women in an urban area, select sub-samples of
60 women in each of the three groups to conduct longer interviews with, and
select a sub-sample of 15-20 women from each group for open-ended, intensive
discussions on gender relations, perceptions of risk of contracting disease, and
general cultural values about gender and sexual relations and marriage. This
research is important because it adds to our general expertise about this
important area of the world, as well as specific information about women's
knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS in this region. The
project will increase our understanding of what women know about heterosexual
transmission of this growing social problem, and will produce valuable knowledge
of women's self-perceptions of their own abilities to engage in less-risky
behaviors. This sort of understanding will be valuable in designing programs to
limit the spread of the problem not only in Indonesia, but in other places where
women have comparable understandings and constraints.
