A Molecular Phylogeny of the Dinoflagellates Dinoflagellates are unicellular
photosynthetic eukaryotes that have unique features, including nuclear
organization and chemistry, that separate them from any other eukaryotic group.
This Postdoctoral Fellowship project uses standard molecular biology techniques
to determine and compare sequences of small subunit ribosomal RNAs from a
selected assemblage of dinoflagellates to place them individually within their
group, and as a group among all eukaryotes.
