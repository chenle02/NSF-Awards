The principal investigator will conduct detailed mapping and structural
analysis in the Humber Arm Allochthon of western Newfoundland, Canada. The field
work will extend previous detailed mapping in the highest structural slices of
the allochthon to the lower sedimentary structural slices. This mapping will
allow further studies to stratigraphically subdivide the allochthon on the basis
of well-constrained paleontological age fixes, provenance studies of sandstones,
mudstones and cherts, in addition to standard lithologic correlation. In this
way we hope to gain a clearer insight into the stratigraphic development of the
former Atlantic type margin, the assembly, transport and structural development
of the allochthon, the formation of melange zones within the allochthon, and the
mechanism of ophiolite obduction.
