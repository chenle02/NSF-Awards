9357854 Penry The roles that marine organisms play as mediators of physical and
chemical processes and how they can affect the rates and extent of organic
matter cycling and degradation in the ocean are not well defined. In the ocean,
planktonic protozoa are important consumers and remineralizers of organic
matter. Particle consumption is a primary pathway of degradation, and this
project focuses on modeling and measuring digestive and egestive processes in
marine protozoans. Dr. Penry plans to apply a chemical engineering approach,
i.e., chemical reactor theory, in the investigation of the roles of digestion
and egestion by marine protozoan in particle aggregation and organic matter
cycling. Although protozoa do not have traditional guts, digestion theory is
still applicable. Gut reactor models are simply descriptions of particle
processing patterns, and the reactor can be a gut or a single cell. Quantifying
these processes and how they vary in response to changes in food resources is
necessary to understanding the roles of protozoan grazers in the upper ocean.
