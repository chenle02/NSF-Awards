The needs for care, growth and use of collections of the ontogenetic stages of
fishes--especially the early life stages or ichthyoplankton--have increased
enormously in caliber and magnitude over the past few decades, largely because
fish eggs and larvae have been central to solving some of the perplexing
problems in fisheries biology, environmental and ecological analyses, and
systematic studies. Examples of important studies based on larval fishes include
estimating the spawning biomass of commercially important fishes, analyzing
sensitive habitats to assess ecological and environmental impacts, and studying
the development, relationships and evolution of fishes. This project will
support the establishment and initial development of a significant new larval
fish depository at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Specific
goals are to accession and catalog already identified specimens; to identify
several backlog collections of fish larvae; to develop improved identification
procedures for larval fishes; and to begin the installation of a computerized
collection management system.
