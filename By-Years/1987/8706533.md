Context is crucial in archaeological studies. The proposed project will look at
the geological context of archaeological sites on the Green River in Wyoming and
see how the landscape influenced the way people used stone tools. Specifically,
the researcher will look at untested archaeological assumptions about tool use:
that people chose specific raw materials for certain tasks, that people selected
raw materials by shape, size, and type of stone depending on the tasks, and that
the availability of raw materials in an area influenced the way people planned
for, made, and used tools. This is a low.cost but highly creative and
potentially useful study that seeks a revised way to deal with long.standing
archaeological questions. Its emphasis on detailed examination of the
distribution of raw materials in a well.defined area is important; the project
promises to address issues that have been neglected. There should be cost
effective methodological and technical advances resulting in an increase in
precision in documenting the distribution of raw materials as a result of this
project. This study has the potential to provide useful information and models
not only on the specific sites and area under consideration, but also for other
prehistoric hunter and gatherer groups around the world. Archaeologists will
learn a great deal about the physical landscape and how people used it. It
should also help anthropologists more precisely infer patterns of mobility and
technological planning and decision.making processes by prehistoric peoples.
