Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0401925&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Lars Andersson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial
support for graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and early career researchers attending
the Miami Conference&lt;br/&gt;on Geometric Analysis, Nonlinear Wave Equations,
and General&lt;br/&gt;Relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the mathematics
relevant to the study of gravitation from&lt;br/&gt;geometric points of view
also appears in other problems,&lt;br/&gt;especially the study of nonlinear
differential equations modeling&lt;br/&gt;wave motion. This conference at the
University of Miami is the&lt;br/&gt;first of a projected series on important
problems and recent&lt;br/&gt;developments in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;
