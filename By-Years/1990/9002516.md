This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award will support a
program planning workshop in the area of algebraic geometry. The purpose of the
workshop, organized by Professor Steven Kleiman of MIT and Professor Felipe
Voloch of IMPA, Rio de Janeiro, is to stimulate cooperative research between
U.S. and Brazilian mathematicians. As such, the workshop will try to address the
following topics: diagnostic of on-going research efforts in both the U.S. and
Brazil in the area of algebraic geometry; identification of areas of common
interests and likely future collaborators; and organization of joint planning
activities for cooperation in the short, medium, and long term.
