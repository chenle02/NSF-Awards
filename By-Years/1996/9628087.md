9628087 Van Der Hilst This research involves improved tomographic imaging of the
Earth's mantle to enable a systematic study of subducting lithospheric slabs.
The tomographic imaging is to be integrated with plate tectonic reconstructions
and fluid dynamical modeling. Prior work included reprocessing of the entire
catalogue of the International Seismological Centre, including non-linear
hypocenter relocation and phase re-identification; this has resulted in a data
quality that is improved relative to that used previously in global travel-time
tomography. The current project will use this data for the global imaging for
both high-resolution regional models and whole mantle models. The primary goal
is to produce seismic velocity models with sufficient resolution for a
systematic investigation of lithospheric slabs world wide, in particular the
depth of penetration of the slabs throughout the lower mantle. The resulting
velocity models will then be tested in the context of numerical flow simulations
and the history of plate motions. ***
