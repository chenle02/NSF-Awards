Southwestern Utah has an essentially complete Cenomanian- Turonian
stratigraphic record of the transgressive-regressive cycle along the western
margin of the Greenhorn Sea which also records the early history of the Sevier
orogenic foreland basin. This project will develop lithostratigraphic,
biostratigraphic, and radiometric means of correlation across the entire
sequence. As the marine part of the cycle has already been studied in some
detail and correlated regionally, research will concentrate on marginal marine
and terrestrial deposits and faunas. Correlation of these strata is critical for
interpretation of the evolution of the Sevier orogenic foreland basin. Detailed
measured sections will be taken and brackish water faunas and terrestrial faunas
will be examined throughout the sequence. Radiometric dates will be employed to
constrain and test correlations. This record of marginal marine and terrestrial
taxa will be the most extensive of this age in the world and will allow for
evaluation of extinction and evolutionary patterns of marine through terrestrial
communities during a single transgressvie-regressive marine cycle.
