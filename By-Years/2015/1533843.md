Forensics is a burgeoning field of importance to national security and law
enforcement. New technology and scientific advancements allow for more
sophisticated analysis of forensic data yet there are no standards for
evaluating the reliability of new methods and to determine their usefulness as
forensic evidence. Improving the quality of forensic analyses should result in a
higher degree of efficiently and appropriately analyzed evidence.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has the objective to improve capability
within the forensic science community for greater scientific rigor in analytical
methods. The workshop will bring together twenty highly reputed forensic science
practitioners, research scientists, statisticians and policy makers to discuss
the current shortcomings and to recommend ways to most effectively evaluate the
forensic science literature. The speakers will contribute to a report that will
be published and disseminated by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).
