9307924 Tate This research investigates voter turnout and racial bloc voting in
mayoral elections. Racial elections typically pit a Black candidate against a
White candidate and are characterized by high voter turnouts and racially
polarized voting. Aggregate data from 26 major American cities will be collected
from 1969 to 1994. Data on election results and registration are gathered from
the city, county, or state offices, while local newspaper accounts are used to
determine the number of races involving Black officeseekers. These data will be
analyzed to address the following questions: First, what demographic, political,
and attitudinal factors are associated with high voter turnout in mayoral
primaries, runoff primaries, and general elections? Second, what demographic,
political, and attitudinal factors are associated with racially polarized voting
in such elections? It is hypothesized that the racial composition of the city,
its political structure, and the political context have important contributory
effects on turnout and racial voting in mayoral elections in additon to the
racial attitudes in the community. ***
