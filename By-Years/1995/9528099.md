With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Rotello of the
University of Massachusetts-Amherst will investigate non-covalent bonding
factors that influence the redox properties of flavoenzymes. For this
investigation the principal investigator has prepared artificial binding sites
which mimic the natural sites, but allow him to quantify the individual factors
that are believed to affect the redox properties. The two major factors which
are considered important are hydrogen bonding and pi stacking. Preliminary
evidence suggests that the project will be successful. Understanding the details
of enzymatic processes will provide scientists with the knowledge to modify
paradigms and procedures for improved therapeutic drug efficacy. This project
from a young investigator, if successful, will provide needed information on how
flavoenzymes function. Since these enzymes are essential physiological moieties,
this research has significant potential in the health related domain. These
results may be useful to a broader scope of redox systems that are germane to
organic materials and electronic devices.
