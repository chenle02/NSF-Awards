In recent decades increased competition has occurred among industries at the
international level. An increase in national and regional industrial
productivity appears essential in this highly competitive climate. There is a
need for new graduates in engineering and engineering technology to be capable
of quickly making contributions in industry upon graduation. This project is
aimed at providing engineering and engineering technology students with
educational experiences in computer-based industrial measurements and control
that will allow them to more quickly and more intelligently make their
contributions. This project utilizes industrial-quality computers, interfacing
equipment, and transducers that are assembled in order that ten experiments are
performed in computer control of industrial processes. At least five third and
fourth year courses are affected. The award is being matched by an equal amount
from the principal investigator's institution.
