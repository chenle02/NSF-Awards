These hands-on laboratory exercises focus on the hydrology of a small local
watershed. The new laboratories provide an integrated, interdisciplinary
approach that emphasizes direct student involvement in the collection and
analysis of hydrological data. The use of data from a familiar and accessible
field site adds to the student's knowledge of hydrological principles and
methods while at the same time synthesizes their understanding of ecosystem
function and value. The surface-water monitoring equipment and recording rain
gauge provided through this project are used to monitor all significant surface-
water inflows and outflows from the field site. The surface-water monitoring
equipment includes upgrades for two existing gauging stations and monitoring
systems for three new gauges. The recording rain gauge provides important
rainfall intensity and duration data that will be used in conjunction with the
surface water data. The equipment and the data generated from it are used
repeatedly throughout the semester to study various components of the
hydrological system and to develop simple models of system function. These
revised laboratory experiences can affect about 250 students over the next 5
years.
