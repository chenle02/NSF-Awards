The goal of the proposed program is to expand research in engineering at the
University of the District of Columbia. This program is designed to interest
minority students in research and to stimulate their interest beyond the
experiments and theoretical analyses which focus on the mechanical properties of
vascular tissue. Tests include tube inflation, torsion, residual stress/strain
determination, and uniaxial strip tension test.
