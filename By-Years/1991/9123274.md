A multi-purpose apparatus will be developed to measure in situ the pressure and
temperature in tribo-contacts (roller bearings, ball bearings, etc.) under
normal and severe operating conditions, including loads to Hertzian pressure of
4 GPa, velocities to 40 m/s and temperatures to 450 C. The data collection
effort will run in parallel with a modeling effort to determine the total heat
being generated at the contact as functions of these operating parameters as
well as slip, nature of the fluid, surface coatings, etc. The model will provide
detailed information on pressure and temperature distribution and on traction in
the contact zone.
