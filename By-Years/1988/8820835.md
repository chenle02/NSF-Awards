An initiative will be undertaken in theoretical atomic, molecular and optical
physics, establishing a center within the Joint Institute for Laboratory
Astrophysics (JILA). The permanent JILA theoretical faculty will be expanded.
There will be a sequence of one year collaborative research programs involving
pairs of visiting senior scientists, coupled to summer workshops and a summer
school for undergraduate and beginning graduate students. The program is aimed
at complementing JILA's existing large primarily experimental program and
addressing the national need to focus and strengthen the theoretical atomic,
molecular and optical physics field.
