Suri 9706594 The investigator studies problems arising in the h-p finite element
method. The first problem investigated is how h-p discretization of a
complicated domain can be accomplished by partitioning it to several independent
workers, and then reassembling the pieces, without assuming compatibility of the
sub-meshes. The objective is to develop algorithms that use Lagrange multipliers
at the interface together with proper mesh/degree combinations, and preserve the
(exponential) h-p convergence rates obtained when the domain is analyzed without
partitioning. The second problem is obtaining robust, mathematically certified
h-p methods for shells. Finite element modeling of shells is complicated by
boundary layers and locking phenomena, which seriously affect convergence rates
when the shell is thin. The goal is to design methods free of locking (such as
mixed methods), which resolve the boundary layers as well. The finite element
method for solving differential equations incorporates a mesh --- a quilt of
small pieces that fit together to make up the region where the equation holds
--- and a set of functions, usually polynomials, for each piece of the quilt.
Accuracy of the method depends on how fine the mesh is and how high the degree
of the polynomials may be. The h-p finite element method couples mesh refinement
with polynomial degree increase for enhanced accuracy and convergence. Finite
element modeling is used extensively in industry, from aircraft and automobile
manufacture, to structural analysis in civil engineering, to the precision
design and fitting of e.g. electronic components. Many large or complicated
problems (such as the modeling of an aircraft) must be first broken into
separate pieces (such as the fuselage, wings, etc.), to be meshed separately.
This project develops methods by which such components can be accurately and
efficiently reassembled for the final modeling. Also, individual components (for
example wings) are often ``thin'' and therefore modeled as plates and shells.
The finite element modeling of shells poses special problems, and robust methods
are developed and analyzed to address them. The research affects state-of-the-
art engineering by influencing the development of (and finding application in)
updated versions of commercial codes that have incorporated the new h-p finite
element technology.
