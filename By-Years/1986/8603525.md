The aim of this research project is to investigate (1) the effect of ground
motion on ground response, including earthquake motions sufficiently severe to
induce liquefaction and (2) the associated soil- pile interaction effects in
liquefied soil deposits. Loose and dense sand and salt samples will be subjected
to horizontal shaking similar to recorded earthquake accelerograms. Instrumented
model piles and pile groups will be installed in the saturated soil for the
study of dynamic soil-pile interaction. The models will be tested in the
geotechnical centrifuge at the California Institute of Technology, and the model
tests will simulate a prototype soil deposit with a depth of approximately 100
feet and subjected to ground accelerations in the range .05 to 0.5g. The
objective of these tests is to determine: (1) the effects of strain levels on
ground motions, (2) the ability of existing theories to predict the observed
linear and nonlinear soil behavior, and (3) the conditions that lead to
liquefaction and large permanent ground displacements. The realization of these
objectives will contribute significantly to current procedures for assessing
ground failure due to liquefaction as well as to the methods used to design
piles in offshore areas located in seismic environments. Professor Scott is
internationally recognized in this area of research and has the institutional
facilities available to conduct the research. It is recommended that this
request for support be approved.
