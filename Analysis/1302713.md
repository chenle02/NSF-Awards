This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S participants in
the program "Noncommutative Distributions in Free Probability at the Fields
Institute" that will be held from July 1-31, 2013, at the aforementioned
institute in Toronto, Canada.

The theme of this wide-ranging program is free probability and its
ramifications. Free probability theory is a probability theory adapted to deal
with variables having the highest degree of noncommutativity. It is based on
replacing independence modeled on tensor products by independence modeled on
free products. The theory has important connections with von Neumann algebras,
random matrices, combinatorics, and certain problems in mathematical physics.
Surprisingly, the part of basic classical probability theory for which there are
free probability analogues is unexpectedly large and keeps growing. The program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
