This development grant is a collaborative effort of three informal science
education institutions (St. Louis Science Center, The Missouri Botanical
Gardenand the Saint Louis Zoo), Washington University in St. Louis and St. Louis
Public Schools. The project will build on and learn from elements of informal
settings and free-choice learning to enhance learning and teaching in formal
settings. Specific goals for the developmental period are to (1) strengthen the
collaboration among the institutions; (2) test and refine ideas related to
the&lt;br/&gt;focus on informal science institutions as a primary vehicle for
SMT education in an urban setting; (3) identify strengths and barriers to
existing and proposed professional development models; and (4) evaluate the
models. To accomplish the goals, the collaborating institutions will conduct a
series of focus groups,&lt;br/&gt;identify and bring together other potential
partners, commission a case study by the John M. Olin School of Business at
Washington University for a supply warehouse to circulate hands-on science
supplies for classroom use, and develop a model for reciprocal internships
between schools and the informal sites. They will continue to refine their
research goals of identifying the most appropriate combination of informal
science institution and formal institutional attributes which will result in the
most effective science and mathematics learning for students and professional
development for teachers. The developmental project will also allow for the
further development of graduate level courses focused on the effective use of
informal science institution resources in formal settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
