This project will provide a new solution for 3D mapping and exploration of
underwater environments characterized by sparse and noisy data. It will enhance
the capability of underwater robots to autonomously map, navigate, and inspect a
previously unknown shallow-water environment. The development of this project
will benefit from its long association with United States Coast
Guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the state of the art in
three-dimensional occupancy mapping using Gaussian process regression, a
supervised learning method with great promise for its application to robot
mapping. This project will apply these methods to online 3D mapping with a field
robot, mapping underwater structures with a scanning sonar.
