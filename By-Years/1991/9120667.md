This project, which is supported under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research
(SGER) program, will trace the development and transport of the stratospheric
aerosol clouds that were injected by the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruptions. The
measurements will be made by balloon borne sondes at various latitudes until the
cloud reaches polar regions (approximately 1 year). The measurements will
determine the distribution of the clouds and measure their vertical profiles as
well as the size and shape of the constituent particles. Of particular
importance will be to what extent the cloud is trapped within (or excluded from)
the next polar winter vortices, since it is known that stratospheric aerosols
play an important role in the destruction of polar ozone. Particular attention
will be paid to the hemispheric differences. This project is jointly funded by
the Division of Polar Programs and Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
