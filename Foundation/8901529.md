Lempp intends to pursue research in classical recursion theory. He plans to
concentrate in the following areas: 1. Lempp, jointly with Lerman, plans to
finish up a project on the decidability of the existential theory of the
recursively enumerable (r.e.) degrees with nth jump reducibility predicates. 2.
Lempp, jointly with Lerman, Shore, and Soare, plans to investigate the existence
of isomorphic r.e. intervals , a partial result toward showing the existence of
nontrivial automorphisms of the r.e. degrees. 3. Lempp, jointly with Ambos-
Spies, will try to show that every r.e. interval has a non-aleph-0 categorical
theory, a result known now only for the set of all r.e. degrees. 4. Lempp,
jointly with Kucera and Lerman, will investigate the construction of r.e.
degrees via diagonally nonrecursive functions, as an alternative to conventional
priority arguments. These are topics of interest to experts in recursion theory,
a theory which formalizes the notion of mechanically computable if given enough
memory and enough time. Observe that this is not really the same as mechanically
computable in some reasonable length of time, but answers to questions about the
more general notion are often easier to obtain and do shed light on practical
computability questions.
