This project involves the measurement of the isotopic and mixing ratios of
methane and carbon monoxide from a shipboard transect in the Pacific Ocean
between Los Angeles and New Zealand. These combined measurements, made through
four trips per year for three years, will help answer questions related to the
growth rate of methane in the atmosphere and provide constraints on the overall
global budgets of methane and carbon monoxide. The resultant methane data will
be combined with data from other researchers and used in a 3-D model to evaluate
the changes concentrations of atmospheric methane and how these changes affect
the oxidizing power of the atmosphere. This project involves collaboration with
a research group in Wellington, New Zealand that is making similar measurements
and collaboration with the University of Oslo where the modeling and analysis
will take place. These collaborations greatly enhance the ability of this effort
to produce information with broader societal relevance, such as developing an
improved understanding of the global methane budget that has implications for
understanding human impact on climate change.
