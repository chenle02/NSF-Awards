This grant supports the purchase of an X-ray diffractometer for materials
research at James Madison University, a state-supported, predominantly
undergraduate institution committed to the inseparability of scholarship,
research and teaching. The instrumentation will be used for investigations on
the preparation of phosphate and phosphonate framework materials, the synthesis
of ceramics for electronic devices, polymer processing by selective laser
sintering and the study of novel aluminum fluoride minerals. The goal of the
group is to obtain an instrument that expands the range of materials that can be
structurally characterized and improves the quality and quantity of data
available to researchers. This instrument will significantly enhance the
laboratory environment in research and formal coursework, and will enable more
cutting edge research projects that challenge and motive undergraduate students.
It will provide a powerful teaching tool to introduce students to modern
materials characterization techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This X-ray
instrumentation will be used both in undergraduate research and for education by
the Center for Materials Science at James Madison University. The Center
involves faculty from the departments of Chemistry, Geology and Environmental
Studies, Integrated Science and Technology, Mathematics, and Physics. The plan
describes course development in powder X-ray diffraction, materials
characterization, mineralogy and inorganic synthesis. This equipment will be
available to students who are encouraged to do independent research for academic
credit. The research activities are well suited for undergraduate participation
and should result in quality publications, and students trained in useful
materials characterization techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
