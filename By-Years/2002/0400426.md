The primary goal of the proposed research in this project is to develop the
mathematical tools needed to prove several outstanding conjectures in Quantum
Information Theory. The central conjecture states that minimal output entropy is
additive for product channels, where a channel is the mathematical
representation of a noisy quantum system. The mathematical setting concerns
properties of completely positive maps on matrix algebras. Building on results
and methods from earlier work, the PI expects to establish this conjecture for
all qubit maps, and in the process develop tools that will apply to higher
dimensional maps. The PI expects to produce results that are both mathematically
interesting and also useful for quantum information theory.

Quantum Information Theory is concerned with exploring the new resources that
are available in physical systems whose behavior is wholly or partly governed by
quantum effects, for example single-atom systems and single-photon states.
Recent theoretical discoveries indicate that such systems may have extraordinary
properties. One example is the quantum computer, which is a theoretical device
capable of outperforming any standard computer. Another example is a protocol
for unconditionally secure encryption, which would be achieved by encoding
messages as quantum states. Mathematics has played an essential role in the
development of these new ideas. The present proposal is aimed at using advanced
mathematical techniques to explore the implications of using entangled quantum
states in communication systems. A fundamental problem is to determine the
information capacity of such a system, and thereby find the quantum analog of
Shannon's famous expression for the capacity of a noisy channel. The broader
impact of the proposed activity rests on the potential applications of quantum
information theory in physics and computer science, and ultimately in
technology.
