This project develops a unified framework for treating inequality in the
distribution of welfare, the incidence of poverty, and the impact of
redistributional policies. The research also develops new computational and
econometric methods for estimating models of aggregate consumer behavior.
Finally, new models of aggregate consumer demand are developed. These models
provide more precise estimates of consumer demand because they use information
on the different prices faced by different consumers. Conventional methods
assume that all consumers face the same prices.
