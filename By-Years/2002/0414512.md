ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sex determination mechanisms vary wildly from
phylum to phylum, even as evidence for their deep homology accumulates. This
project uses the nematode genus Caenorhabditis to study how sex determination
evolves over short time scales. It offers a well-characterized reference species
(C. elegans), variation in sexual mode (androdioecy vs. gonochorism), and the
first pair of closely related animal genome sequences. The project will develop
C. briggsae as a true genetic system, which will enable precise comparisons with
C. elegans. Two complementary approaches for identifying C. briggsae sex
determination mutations are used: classical forward genetic screens based on
phenotype and reverse genetic screens for deletion mutations via a PCR-based
method. Together these approaches will help clarify how mating systems evolve,
and whether the details of germline development are the same or different in two
convergent hermaphroditic species. In addition, the project will contribute to
the development of C. briggsae as a mature developmental genetic system.
Undergraduate and graduate student participation is central to the project,
ensuring that the training and mentoring of young scientists is a major
component. &lt;br/&gt;
