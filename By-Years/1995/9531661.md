9531661 Furey Triboemission particles emitted from sliding ceramic pairs will
be measured and characterized by type and amount as functions of time, applied
load, velocity, ambient atmosphere, and the presence of various compounds. Their
possible role in the formation of tribopolymers will be evaluated theoretically
and confirmed experimentally through tests with various addition-type monomers
in the sliding contact zone, followed by examination of the wear scars and the
surrounding surface by surface analytical techniques. ***
