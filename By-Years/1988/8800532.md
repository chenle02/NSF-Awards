The goal of the research is to examine the linkages between the water column
and the sediments to understand how interannual fluctuations in the magnitude
and pattern of pelagic production result in variability in production of benthic
(bottom-dwelling) organisms. The principal investigators hypothesize that the
timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom helps determine the amount of organic
matter reaching the bottom, as follows: (1) during early blooms, colder water
temperatures slow bloom consumption by grazers in the water column; (2) early
blooms limit the growth of grazers, which may themselves control the magnitude
and duration of the bloom; and (3) organic matter from early blooms that reaches
the bottom will degrade less rapidly because of colder temperatures. Before
considering, in depth, field studies of their hypothesis, the prinicipal
investigators will develop a mathematical simulation model of the spring bloom
based on data obtained from the literature and their best estimate of unknown
parameters. This simulation model will serve to clarify the mode of action of
the spring bloom and indicate whether an exceptionally early or late bloom could
have a significant effect on benthic production.
