Abstract 9512360 Gabitto This proposal is for funds to develop a chemical vapor
deposition facility to investigate the deposition of silicon thin films. The
objective of the proposed research is to build a diagnostic experimental
apparatus to study plasma and photo CVD. This proposal requests funds for a CVD
reactor system.
