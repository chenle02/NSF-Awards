Scientific progress is a multifaceted process, involving experimentation,
observation, theory, publishing, informal discussions, and formal meetings. The
current proposal seeks support for the latter of these activities, namely for
the "Sixth Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and the Sun,"
September 12-14, 1989, to be held at the University of Washington, Seattle. The
focus of this workshop will be on the "solar-stellar connection," which is a
relatively new, interdisciplinary research area that brings together the fields
of solar physics and stellar atmospheres of late type stars. Particular topics
of these fields are stellar coronae, chromospheres, winds, flares, magnetic
fields, convection, and non-radiative heating processes. The main emphasis of
the present workshop will be on stellar mass loss and evolution. U.S. and
foreign researchers will be attending, as well as graduate students. This
workshop continues a tradition that started with a workshop on cool stars in
Cambridge in 1980 and that has become the focal point in the field of solar-
stellar research.
