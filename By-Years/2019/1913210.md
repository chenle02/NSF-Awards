The main focus of this project is to rebuild the literature on lattice
algorithms on a foundation of modern computer architecture. This means going
beyond counting textbook operations, and instead investigating the time required
on a parallel machine with realistic limits on communication, so as to obtain
the ultimate implementation efficiency on current and future chips. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Major project activities include the following: 1. Fast constant-time
implementations of fundamental arithmetic operations such as integer
multiplication, Euclid's algorithm, and modular inversion. 2. A scalable
parallelized implementation of the LLL lattice-basis-reduction algorithm for
large-rank lattices. 3. Improvements to algorithms for finding shorter vectors
in lattices, including sieving, enumeration, and multiplicative techniques from
algebraic number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
