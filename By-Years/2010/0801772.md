Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801772&lt;br/&gt;G. Agrawal, University of
Rochester&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: Silicon photonics is a relatively new
branch of optics with a vast potential for the microelectronics and
telecommunication industries. The basic approach consists of utilizing silicon-
based materials for providing both the optical and electronic functions on the
same chip, resulting in a monolithically integrated optoelectronic platform. The
primary goal of our research is to develop the experimental and theoretical
knowledge base for understanding how the nonlinear effects inside silicon
waveguides can be exploited for a variety of modern applications relevant for
the microelectronics and telecommunication
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A variety of practical
devices utilizing nonlinear optical phenomena will be designed and tested using
silicon-on-insulator waveguides. The focus will be on dispersion engineering,
soliton formation, and supercontinuum generation. All-optical flip-flops that
can store information and act as an optical memory element will be demonstrated.
The use of photonic crystal waveguide structures will be investigated
theoretically and experimentally, with the goal of shrinking the device sizes
below 100 Âµm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The results of the research
will have broad implications, for the high technology sector of industry and
consumers alike, since silicon technology offers the potential for mass
production of reliable devices at low cost. The proposed research program will
also be used to attract students from under-represented groups in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
