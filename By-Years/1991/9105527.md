The goal of the proposed research is to further our understanding of the role
spatial information plays in regulating embryo development and the transition to
germination in higher plants. The approach will be to use molecular probes and
in situ localization techniques to look at the cellular basis for patterns of
gene expression in Brassica napus embryos, and to examine how these patterns
change over the course of development. An important consequence of this research
will be there identification of clones that can be used to look at the molecular
anatomy of the processes that appear to involve pattern formation, particularly
the determination of the shoot apical meristem during early embryogenesis and
the determination of organ identity at the shoot apex during precocious
germination. These clones can also be used, in combination with genetic analysis
of developmental mutants in Arabdopsis to dissect the mechanisms of pattern
formation in plant embryos.
