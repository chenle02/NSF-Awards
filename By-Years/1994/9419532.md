9419532 Prentice This award supports a US contribution to a collaborative
project with Russian and Swedish glacial geologists to test the existence of an
hypothesized Holocene ice dome centered on the Kara Sea. This hypothesized dome
could account for a maximum of 17 meters of sea level rise and so the question
of its existence has important implications for models of Holocene climate.
However, its existence is a highly contentious question. The goal of the project
is to produce well constrained radiocarbon ages of the northernmost terrestrial
moraine complex along the margin of the Kara Sea. The work will specifically
focus on the area east of Dikson, Russia, where the Leneevaya River intersects
the northern Taimyr moraine. Accurate ages of the moraines are required in order
to determine if an ice dome is likely to have existed in the Kara Sea region
during the last ice age. If the existence of the ice dome is supported, then
this work would also be key to formulating further work to fully characterize
the dome. The results of this project are expected to help resolve an important
and contentious question about the nature and extent of ice sheets during the
last ice age.
