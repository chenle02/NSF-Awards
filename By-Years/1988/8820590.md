In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Lipscomb will carry out studies of geometrical
and electronic structures of molecules with objectives of obtaining information
about the stable states and the transition states of chemical reactions. Studies
of boranes and their derivatives, including the condensation of diborane to form
the higher hydrides of boron, will require extensive corrections for correlation
of electrons in searching for transition states. Theoretical studies of enzyme
mechanisms are aimed at elucidation of entropy effects, binding of the
transition state, catalytic steps, solvent effects, enzyme environment and
dynamical effects to establish principles for construction of artificial enzymes
as catalysts.
