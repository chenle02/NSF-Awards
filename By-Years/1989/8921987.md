This Research in Undergraduate Institutions grant is in the general area of
analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of separations science.
Professor Robert Kooser of Knox College will use electron spin resonance studies
of probe molecules to follow the dynamics of structural changes in flowing
liquid chromatographic systems. The research will advance the knowledge of the
structure of the liquid/solid interface and the structure of stationary phases
used for separations. In addition, the research program will introduce three
undergraduates each summer to the various aspects of instrumental analysis,
computer data acquisition and spectroscopy. The multidisciplinary aspect of this
study will allow for a well designed undergraduate research experience. Using
the loop gap resonator electron spin resonance cell, Professor Kooser and his
students will study the structure of common stationary phase materials while
under flow. The research group at Knox College has been successful in
synthesizing new types of spin label functionalities directly at particular
positions in silane surface modifier compounds. In this study, the nitroxyl
probe functionality will be directly bonded in low concentrations of alkyl
chains attached to the silica in a reversed phase stationary phase. By
constructing a flow cell in the loop gap resonator, the mobility of the
particular spin probe as a function of size and position may be monitored. This
will allow determination of structure for many species under conditions never
probed previously.
