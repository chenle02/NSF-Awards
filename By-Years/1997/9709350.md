Professor Brenda Kesler, Department of Chemistry, San Jose State University, is
supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Chemistry Division
under a Research Planning Grant to explore the synthesis of chiral sulfonium and
selenonium reagents, and examine their use in asymmetric synthesis. Methods
developed for the synthesis of chiral sulfur derived salts will be extended to
the synthesis of analogous selenium compounds. Optically active compounds will
be achieved through face selective activation of isolated double bonds by these
reagents with the appealing possibility of chiral catalysis through regeneration
of the chiral sulfur and selenium compounds. A Research Planning Grant at this
stage in Professor Kesler's career will allow her to explore a methodology for
asymmetric synthesis that will form the basis for a competitive NSF proposal in
a timely area. Addition across a double bond directed by a nearby functionality
has been a fundamental method of achieving chiral compounds. Systematic studies
will be undertaken to elucidate the abilities of chiral sulfonium and selenium
compounds to discriminate between the different faces of isolated double bonds
in organic compounds. In contrast to the previous methodologies, face
discrimination affords a wide variety of optically active compounds in a more
straight forward manner. ` _Á/>¢ ?Â ¥©Á ?Á?Á%??Á? ?Á/?¥???¥` _??Á%
