Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an emerging class of deep learning models on
graphs, with many successful applications, such as, recommendation systems, drug
discovery, social network analysis, and code vulnerability detection. However,
the computation for GNNs faces a low efficiency problem as they involve complex
matrix and vector operations. Further, when applied to graphs that are
dynamically changing, the efficiency issue exacerbates. This project pioneers
the effort of developing efficient GNN algorithms and computation systems for
both static and dynamic graphs that can take advantage of world-class Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU) computing facilities. This project contributes to the
growing national need for professionals in machine learning and computation
systems. This project produces a high-performance software library that serves
as a foundational tool for fellow science and engineering practitioners from
academia, national laboratories, and industry. Additionally, educational efforts
are made to integrate the research findings into graduate and undergraduate
curriculum development. Outreach and educational activities are conducted to
promote the participation of K-12, undergraduate, female, and underrepresented
minorities.

The overarching goal of this project is to design an efficient GNN framework via
algorithm and system co-design for both static and dynamic graphs. Towards that,
this project designs three synergistic research thrusts. Specifically, Thrust 1
improves the efficiency from the algorithm level by designing novel GNN
algorithms that are efficient, allow the entire graph to be retained, and offer
convergence guarantees. Thrust 2 advances the system performance by designing
efficient computation techniques on GPUs with efficient workload scheduling and
reduced synchronization overhead. In addition, Thrust 3 incorporates the
techniques in Thrusts 1 and 2, and designs novel strategies to address the
unique algorithm and computation challenges in dynamic graphs.
