The PI will investigate the persistence of enhanced ammonia in the jovian
stratosphere. Their observations of Jupiter derive vertical and horizontal
distributions for ammonia. In addition, they will complete the radiative
transfer analysis of the hydrogen cyanide images. The vertical distributions
derived will be compared with ammonia and carbon, two molecules of different
impact-induced origin. The horizontal coverage will be compared to the dust
observed to investigate whether the particles were coupled with the gas in the
dynamics following the impact. Finally, their re- observation of Jupiter will be
to image hydrogen cyanide, which is stable for over a year, and therefore a good
tracer of atmospheric dynamics.***
