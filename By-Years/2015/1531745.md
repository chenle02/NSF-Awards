Funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will
support acquisition of a relative gravimeter to support research and research
training in geology and geophysics at Missouri State University, a non-Ph.D.
granting institution. The gravimeter would complement other geophysical imaging
equipment (e.g. resistivity) at Missouri State and support experiential learning
in techniques in exploration geophysics for studies of regional interest thereby
fostering their future employability in fields that routinely engage in water,
hydrocarbon and mineral deposit studies, an aspect of the proposal that is
congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the national welfare.

The investigator will employ the relative gravimeter for studies that attempt to
define the subsurface location of magmas in both hot spot volcanic settings and
on continental volcanoes, definition of the geometry and location rare earth ore
deposits in Missouri, and location and study of the subsurface karst features
and basinal structures.
