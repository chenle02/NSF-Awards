The Topology and Geometry of Physics Conference will be held at Texas Tech
University on October 23-25, 2008. The conference will showcase five established
researchers and seven additional speakers. They will give talks related to
quantization problems, quantum topology, the quantum Teichmueller space,
noncommutative geometry, and applications of quantum physics to algebraic
geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main idea of the conference is to
demonstrate deep connections between mathematics and physics. The participants
will be exposed to a wide range of methods and results from different fields of
investigation. The conference will also give a number of early career
researchers the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians.
