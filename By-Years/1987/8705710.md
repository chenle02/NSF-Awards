This research concerns prime number theory, which can be divided into two
approaches, the multiplicative and the additive. The multiplicative theory is
largely concerned with the duality between primes and zeros of the Riemann zeta
function. The additive theory is based on exponential sums of primes and
typically uses characters and Dirichlet L-functions in order to express additive
characters as sums of multiplicative functions. The overlap between these two
areas is what is being studied in this research. Some specific topics to be
examined are pair correlation of zeros of zeta functions, prime pairs and their
connection with Kloostermann sums and Barban-Davenpoort type theorems, small
gaps between zeta zeros, the function S(T) and Siegal zeros. This research
concerns prime number theory, that is, the distribution of the prime numbers in
the integers. Certain complex analytic functions, called zeta functions, contain
this information and so they are studied uses tools from analysis. Thus this
subject is a nice blending of number theory and analysis. The results are very
deep and difficult to come by. Goldston has been remarkably successful in
solving problems in this area. This research will certainly push forward our
knowledge substantially in this important area on mathematics.
