The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
Hampton University will conduct an assessment and evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses of basic science and engineering disciplines in the School of Pure
and Applied Sciences. In addition, collaborative relationships with Federal
laboratories and corporate organizations will be explored. Hampton University
has the facilities and personnel to develop a Minority Research Center of
Excellence. The Foundation has supported this project because the proposed work
will lead to meritorious research in the pure and applied sciences and will
increase the participation of minorities in science and engineering.
