This award supports cooperative research between Hellmut Eckert of the
University of California at Santa Barbara, and Michel Ribes and Annie Pradel of
the University of Montpellier. The objectives are to determine the structural
characteristics of ionically conductive chalcogenide glass using modern solid
state NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) techniques. The French investigators will
synthesize these glasses. Dr. Eckert will characterize the synthesized materials
using state-of-the art solid state NMR techniques. The work will assist in the
development of more efficient synthesis of glassy materials suitable for solid
electrolyte application in solid state batteries. The project will benefit from
the French investigators unique and innovative expertise in glass synthesis.
They are the world leaders in ultra fast quenching methodology which is used in
glass synthesis. The U.S. investigator has been innovative in applying NMR
techniques to the structural study of glass. This combined effort will advance
our understanding of the microstructure of these glasses and result in improved
and more efficient synthesis of glasses with high conductivity.
