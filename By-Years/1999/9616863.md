Thuan, Trinh Xuan 96-16863 Dr. Thuan will continue a collaboration with
scientists from Unkraine and Russia to study nearby galaxies which are extremely
metal- deficient blue compact galaxies. The first research goal is to obtain a
high precision measure of the primordial helium abundance for a sample of
candidate blue compact galaxies. The primordial He abundance constitutes one of
the most promising ways to constrain the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis
theory and the chemical evolution models of blue compact dwarf galaxies. The
second goal is to study the extended HI envelopes around young blue compact
galaxies. These are good candidates for being primordial neutral hydrogen
intergalactic clouds, which will be studied to help understand why star
formation has been stunted for so long in these envelopes.
