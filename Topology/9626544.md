9626544 Lawrence The Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) family of quantum
invariants of 3-manifolds was defined only as a family of discrete invariants
dependent on a parameter that can be any root of unity. This project aims to
study the extension of this invariant to a holomorphic function of the
parameter. Following work of Murakami, Ohtsuki, Rozansky and the Principal
Investigator, it is currently possible to define such an extension only for
specific manifolds. The goal of the project is to understand better the
relationship between this function, specific values that it takes, its
asymptotic expansion, and a combinatorial description of the geometry and
topology of the original manifold. This should lead to combinatorial formulae
for finite type 3-manifold invariants, generalizations of the Casson invariant,
as well as a discretization of the Chern-Simons-Witten Feynman integral and
comparisons with the Kontsevich integrals. Although much is known about the so-
called quantum family of invariants of knots and links in three dimensions,
which are generally polynomial functions of a complex parameter, the same is
currently not true for their 3-manifold counterparts. From the few known results
on these functions, they are seen to have intriguing number theoretic
properties, the investigation of which is the subject of this project. These
invariants also have a formulation as a Feynman integral, and it is hoped that
this project will contribute to the better understanding of Feynman integrals in
general, which currently sit on a not entirely rigorous foundation. ***
