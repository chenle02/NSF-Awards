Zhang will continue his research on various invariants of C*- algebras,
including the real rand, the topological stable rand, the exponential rand and
length, the C*-projective length of the Grassmann space, and the homotopy groups
of the unitary group and the Grassmann space of certain C*-algebras. He will
also continue his investigation on the internal structure of the multiplier
algebras in terms of the K-theory and its torsion subgroup of the associated
C*-algebra. The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the
theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as
finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are
often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These
abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they
play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study
the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
