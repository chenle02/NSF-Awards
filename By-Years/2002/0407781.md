In Drosophila and many other animal and plant taxa, interactions between males
and females that occur after mating can have huge impacts on reproductive
success. For example, Drosophila seminal fluid proteins cause increases in
female egg-laying rate, female death rate, and reductions in female re-mating.
The goal of this work by Dr. David Begun and Mara Lawniczak is to gain an
understanding of the female side of post-mating interactions. Female-expressed
genes contributing to the outcome of sperm competition will be investigated
genetically and molecularly. The evolutionary forces acting on these genes will
be analyzed using population genetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sexual selection
can be a major force in driving evolutionary change in some organisms, including
humans. The proposed research will contribute to identification of mechanisms of
sexual selection, of biochemical classes of proteins involved in male-female
interactions, and of the population genetic signatures of genes under sexual
selection. All of these results may find broader application in the study of
human reproductive biology.&lt;br/&gt;
