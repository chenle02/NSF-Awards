The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on
allowing a greater number of people with varying abilities to independently
operate a power wheelchair. The kit developed with this project can also provide
more independence by freeing up the hands from operating the wheelchair and
allowing for the wheelchair to be operated within a specified range - even if
the user is not seated in it. This wireless control technology can be used to
control other devices such as robots, travel scooters and adaptive sport
devices. Using sensors that are already part of smart phones, and the software
application including in the kit, a control device that is user friendly and
cost effective is created. Expanding the concept of how humans control machines
beyond a typical joystick can change the way society views wheelchairs and other
mobile devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the
commercialization of a hands free wheelchair control kit that can be used by
power wheelchair users, including those with a spinal cord injury, multiple
sclerosis, muscular dystrophy or poly trauma injuries. The device is designed to
allow power wheelchair users the ability to operate their wheelchair without the
need to manipulate a joystick with their hands. A smartphone and its
accelerometer sensors becomes the joystick by sending the control signals via
Bluetooth to the controller of the wheelchair or any mobile device. The
smartphone can be attached to the user's arm, head, chest, or remotely, to
control the wheelchair. The kit is also designed to toggle between the
wheelchair's original joystick controller and the customized smartphone
controller using a switch. A wiring harness is used to connect the custom
controller to the original controller of most wheelchair manufacturers for easy
installation and operation. Preliminary work by the team has shown its
capabilities as a successful control alternative to a joystick opening up
wheelchair manipulation to a wider group of users.
