This grant supports the research of the nuclear structure group at the
University of Kentucky. Most of their research utilizes fast neutrons from their
small accelerator for nuclear reactions and scattering, often using isotopically
enriched target materials. The resulting scattered neutrons or gamma rays reveal
excitation modes at low excitation in the target nucleus. The group utilizes the
Doppler-shift attenuation method to measure excited state lifetimes and gamma-
gamma coincidence measurements are useful in identifying the nuclear states
involved. The work with neutron excitation complements other methods of exciting
nuclei and serves to complete our knowledge of nuclear structure at low
excitation.
