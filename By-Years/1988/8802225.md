This project is concerned with utilizing geometry in the study of finite
groups. The principal investigator will concentrate on Buildings and their
groups, particularly Buildings associated to p-adic groups and groups of Kac-
Moody type. In addition, work will be done on embedding geometries in projective
space. The reseach supported is in a crucial area where several parts of
mathematics intersect. This project endeavors to classify certain finite groups
by using finite geometry and combinatorics. The geometric connection to the
theory of reductive algebraic groups and Kac-Moody groups is important for the
study of finite simple groups.
