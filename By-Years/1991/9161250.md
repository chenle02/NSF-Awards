This work is to make available an autostereoscopic display for teleobotic
applications. User dissatisfaction with awkward 3D display technologies tends to
negate the benefits of 3D visualization. This effort uses an autostereoscopic
LCD display to provide a compact and portable systems for 3D display. It avoids
the use of special glasses or head-mounted display devices to achieve 3D
perspective. The user's left and right eyes received binocular images and
produces a visual perception of objects such that the user has the impression of
looking through the display window rather than looking at the display screen.
The use of this device in telerobotic systems will enable the user to view the
end-effector and manipulated objects with greater utilization of human
perception and with increased precision and safety.//
