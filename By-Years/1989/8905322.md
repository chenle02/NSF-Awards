The goal of this project is to understand in greater detail the
interrelationships of protein structure, stability and dynamics. T4 lysozyme is
the protein used as a model. This moderate sized protein has a known
3-dimensional structure. Many mutant proteins of this lysozyme exist whose
thermodynamic stability is modulated by the composition. Dr. Dahlquist has
developed a plasmid expression system which allows large amounts of isotopically
substituted protein to be produced efficiently. He will use modern nuclear
magnetic resonance to study such proteins. The question of how proteins fold is
acknowledged as one of the most important and least understood of modern
molecular biology. A number of related areas would be greatly enhanced by the
ability to understand in detail why a particular amino acid sequence folds into
a particular shape and how changes in sequence change that shape, its
thermodynamic stability and its interaction potential with other ligands.
Progress in the understanding of the folding problem may allow more reliable
predictions of structure from sequence data with a corresponding increase in the
sophistication of engineered protein products.
