This award will support students from institutions of higher learning in the
United States to participate to the 62nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
(CDC), to be held in Singapore, December 13-15, 2023, along with pre-conference
workshops to be held on December 12, 2023. The CDC has been for over fifty years
the worldâ€™s leading annual forum for scientific and engineering researchers who
share an interest in systems and control theory, and in the foundations of
automation technology. As in the past, the 62nd IEEE CDC will feature the
presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, as well as
plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops. The conference brings together
academic and industrial researchers and students who share their latest research
ideas and discuss needs for further development of the field in light of current
and anticipated developments in applications and technology. The range of topics
covered at the annual CDC is extremely broad, mirroring the varied research
threads and applications of control and systems theory. The system-theoretic
approach has played a critical role in the development of many contemporary
infrastructures and technologies affecting everyday life. Today, for example,
system and control-theoretic tools are central in the design, operation, and
security of cyber-physical systems, where they can inform researchers about ways
to operate large networks (e.g., power, communications, computer,
transportation, and health-related networks).

Students receiving travel funds from this award to attend the CDC will have many
opportunities to interact with members of the professional community in a
stimulating setting, and to exchange ideas with a broad group of professional
colleagues. The large number of workshops before the conference and the
interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional
opportunities for training, learning and for gaining experience in presenting
technical results at a major professional conference. Specific outreach efforts
will be devoted to advertising the conference and the student travel award
program to under-represented minorities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
