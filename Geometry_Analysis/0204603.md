DMS-0204603 Yakov Eliashberg

The proposal is devoted to Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) whose framework was
recently described by A. Givental, H. Hofer and the author of this proposal. SFT
is a large project which lies on the borderline between Symplectic Geometry,
Hamiltonian Dynamics, Enumerative Algebraic Geometry, Low-dimensional Topology,
Theory of Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as String Theory and Mirror
Symmetry in Theoretical Physics. Among the goals of the theory: - definition of
new, SFT-based invariants of symplectic and contact manifolds and their
Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds; - applications to the Low-dimensional
topology; - development of new tools for proving enumerative results about
periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems; - understanding of the appearance of
integrable hierarchies in Gromov-Witten theory. Symplectic Field Theory has
already proved to have important applications. In particular, the ideas of the
SFT were instrumental in the solution of several old outstanding questions in
Symplectic Geometry and Hamiltonian Dynamics. There is a hope that some current
research in the SFT may bring some breakthrough in the low-dimensional topology.
Further development of the theory should also bring new applications not only
inside Mathematics, but possibly in some areas of Theoretical Physics, including
String Theory and Mirror Symmetry. Besides developing new applications the work
under this project will also concentrate on building the rigorous foundations of
the SFT.
