An invitational, three day conference will be held at the Cheyenne Mountain
Conference Center in Colorado Springs on April 1-3, 1992 to examine the present
status of CD-ROMS. Issues to be addressed include rights, permissions and
royalties; conversion from print to magnetic format; software/user interface;
and interactions with the CD-ROM industry. The conference will publish a
conference report which can serve as an introduction to CD-ROM and its potential
for use in education. The conference will also attempt to develop common
features in CD-ROMS for education to make the medium easier for teachers to use.
A group of educators will be organized to interact with representatives of CD-
ROM industries to encourage effective use of CD-ROMS in education. The
participants will include representatives from major EHR funded CD-ROM projects,
representatives from industries and researchers in the field of CD-ROM
development, and representatives from the NSF and the Department of Education.
