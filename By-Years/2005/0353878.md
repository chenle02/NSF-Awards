This ten-week summer REU Site will host twelve undergraduate students each
summer to explore issues surrounding the consolidation of the metro area of
Louisville, Kentucky. The research will examine, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, change and perceptions of change in the newly formed Metro
Louisville. The summer program will begin with workshops covering: research
literature on metropolitan reform; research methods in the social sciences; and
ethical issues in the conduct of social science research. In addition to the
workshops, throughout the ten-week summer period students will attend colloquia
in which invited community leaders will discuss pre- and post-merger issues.
Students also will have frequent topical meetings with other student members and
faculty mentors.

The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that it will advance social
science knowledge regarding causes of consolidation, governmental efficiency
with respect to delivery of services, economic development and job growth, and
movement toward or away from equity by examining the recent, rare event: the
consolidation of a large city and its surrounding areas. The broader impacts of
the research capture the essence of the REU program: to involve undergraduate
students in the total research experience by allowing them to conceptualize
their own project-related research question, design the research to address that
question, collect and analyze appropriate data, and report their results in both
written and oral presentations.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
