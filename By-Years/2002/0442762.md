There is a broad endorsement among educators that pre-service teachers benefit
greatly from being taught some history of mathematics. Publications of the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the Mathematics Association
of America (MAA), and the International Committee on Mathematical Instruction
(ICMI) have included recommendations for the incorporation of history into the
mathematics curriculum, especially for pre-service teachers. Through workshops
and other direct dissemination of ideas and material, this proof of concept
project educates faculty on ways to integrate historical content into
mathematics courses and provides resources to do this.

To improve the preparation of mathematics teachers by emphasizing historical
development of mathematical ideas, the project is producing a textbook
supplement consisting of resources for higher education faculty to use to
integrate history of mathematics into courses taken by pre-service mathematics
teachers. This includes teachers at both the elementary and secondary levels.
The supplement includes many exercises that give students opportunities to
experience the mathematics of a given period and culture.

The activities are designed to prepare and empower future teachers to teach
children about the important and exciting role that mathematics has played
throughout history. Students are gaining an increased understanding of the
interdisciplinary nature of mathematics, since many developments have been
historically motivated by problems arising in other disciplines. Institutions
are also being aided since this material helps make it possible to inject
history across the mathematics curriculum.

Technology has an increasingly important role to play in mathematics education,
and provides computational and visual tools that can be used to deconstruct and
reconstruct historical results and arguments. Many of the resources developed
involve the use of technological tools such as Geometer's Sketchpad, Excel
worksheets, and computer algebra systems.
