9307732 Reynolds This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing
Program in support of the collaborative research of Professors Reynolds and
Katritzky at the University of Florida. Support is provided by the Divisions of
Chemistry and Materials Research. Novel bis-2-pyrrolyl conjugated monomers
containing substituted benzenes, carbazoles and fluorenes as internal units will
be synthesized and electrochemically polymerized to highly conducting polymers.
The main goal of the research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the
electropolymerization and film-deposition processes that occur during oxidative
polymerization and to direct the electrosynthesis to form polymers with enhanced
properties. %%% Polypyrroles with higher degrees of long range order will be
synthesized which will have higher electrical conductivities and improved
environmental stabilities relative to presently available polymers. These
aspects are important in electrostatic charge dissipation and electric field
grading applications. ***
