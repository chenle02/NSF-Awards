This Proof of Concept project aims to create an innovative, next-generation
undergraduate virology textbook (entitled "Understanding Viruses") and ancillary
materials. The rapid pedagogical changes occurring in lower and upper division
science instruction require textbooks that also reflect emphasis on active
learning and critical thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
"Understanding Viruses" textbook concept integrates previously disconnected
virology principles into a single resource, providing the student with a more
global, conceptual approach to understanding viruses, host-virus interactions,
and molecular biology concepts. Additional linkages are made with history and
epidemiology as well as molecular virology and pathogenesis. Hence, these new
instructional materials are significantly improved in content and lead to
improved pedagogical preparation of faculty. In addition, ancillary materials
such as an Instructor's Toolkit are being created, emphasizing pedagogical
flexibility, and allowing instructors to customize particular areas of their
course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The impact of the "Understanding
Viruses" textbook and ancillary materials on student learning and faculty
instruction is addressed by an external evaluator who has a strong disciplinary
background in cell biology and microbiology, as well as pedagogical expertise in
biology education and experience as an author of a microbiology textbook. To
facilitate the assessment of book chapters by faculty reviewers, the
consultant's evaluation tool is implemented as an on-line assessment portal.
Capable faculty with recent and relevant experience in virology education and
research at eight different, diverse institutions (including some anonymous peer
review) are evaluating the new materials. The textbook's impact on students is
measured as their mastery of information as well as their pathways to learning.
The textbook is to be distributed nationally through a major textbook publisher.
