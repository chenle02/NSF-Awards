Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This A &amp; I
project adapts material developed at the Northeast Center for Telecommunications
Technology (NCTT) to improve the existing lightwave communication laboratory at
Three Rivers Community College. The project is adding fiber optic wavelength
division multiplexing capability to their existing laboratory and providing
students with a hands-on experience with sophisticated equipment. They are
adapting four experiments developed by NCTT and are considering four new ones
based on suggestions by their industry partners. In the evaluation effort, they
will analyze student report, written exams, and the students' performance on
practical exams to determine if the students achieve the learning objectives.
The dissemination plan involves presentation to PHOTON project participants, at
the NCTT workshop, and at national conferences along with publications in the
PROTON and NCTT newsletters and in professional journals.&lt;br/&gt;
