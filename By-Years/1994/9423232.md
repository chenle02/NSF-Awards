This award in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division provides partial support for the 1995 Gordon Research Conference on
Electrochemistry. This conference, which brings together leading electrochemists
world-wide, will address the role of basic electrochemical sciences in various
aspects of environmental chemistry including remediation, mitigation and
prevention. Through this grant, support is provided to enable ten young faculty,
postdoctorals, and graduate students, who might not otherwise be able to
participate in this conference, to present their research results at this
meeting and engage in interactive dialogue with leading senior colleagues in the
field. Broader applications of electrochemical techniques to environmental
problems could result in important advances in this strategically important
area.
