A natural language-based system will be built to answer queries based on a 200
million-word body of literature consisting of all the articles from the ASM
journals for the last five years. The study consists of proof-of-concept
research, so it is experimental in nature. There are two ideas that are key to
the analysis, which has the potential to revolutionize the use of electronic
literature in biology. The first idea is that biology should be viewed as a
collection of natural language structures, containers, which have a standardized
form and occur with high frequency in the literature. The second idea is that
there is a simple but systematic relation between questions that users ask and
the data in the containers found in the text. This will allow the system to
answer queries without deep analysis. New technologies, especially visualization
tools, will be developed in a uniform environment using Java.
