The 10-year Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) is scheduled to succeed the
Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) on October 1, 2003, representing a continuation of
nearly 25 years of scientific ocean drilling. The IODP will be jointly supported
and led by the NSF and the Ministry of Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport,
Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, with membership from other nations and
consortia expected in the near future. This proposal is to provide critical IODP
planning activities needed to ensure planned IODP start-up October 1, 2003 and
commencement of drilling activities in 2004. IODP Management International, Inc.
(IMI), the identified Central Management Office responsible for coordinating
IODP science planning and operational efforts, is not expected to begin
operations until January 1, 2004. This proposal provides planning coordination
and services in the interim that will ensure that IODP activities are able to
start as planned. These planning activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1)
building an IODP Executive Authority;&lt;br/&gt;2) building an IODP Science
Planning Committee needed to evaluate and rank proposed 2004 drilling
proposals;&lt;br/&gt;3) establishing other committees of the Science Advisory
Structure (SAS);&lt;br/&gt;4) hiring key officials of IMI, including its
President and Vice President, and preparing for a permanent IMI
office;&lt;br/&gt;5) coordinating initial activities with and between the IODP
drilling platform Implementing Organizations (IO's), including the Center for
Deep Earth Exploration in Japan, the yet-to-be-named U.S. IODP System
Integration Contractor, and the European Management Agency tasked with managing
implementation of possible Arctic Mission Specific Platform drilling;
and&lt;br/&gt;6) coordinating with NSF, MEXT, the SAS, and the IO's in producing
the first IODP Program Plan, which will detail the FY2004 operational schedule
as well as identify databank, database, publication, and education and outreach
activities.&lt;br/&gt;
