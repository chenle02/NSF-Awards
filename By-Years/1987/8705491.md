Microspectrofluorometry of Enzyme-Substrate Reactions: Dr. Kohen proposes to
use microspectrofluorometry to elucidate metabolic control and compartmentation
in single metabolically standarized single living cells. He will micro-inject
various substrates into the cells and monitor transient changes in the redox
state by measuring fluorescence of pyridine nucleotides and flavins. The
temporal and spatial metabolic modulation by specific inhibitors, hormones and
drugs will be documented. He will make use of novel types of substrates e.g.
caged substrates. These are substrates complexed with chemicals that keep the
substrates inactive until the complex is cleaved by light. This should permit
distinction between diffusion and active intracellular compartmentation. In situ
studies of intact cells are required if we are ever to understand the
organization of cell metabolism and activities of multienzyme systems in living
cells. At present we must use the questionable technique of extrapolating from
data obtained on enzymes in dilute solution. These studies should provide new
insights into metabolic responses to growth, differentiation, environmental
changes and cellular senescense.
