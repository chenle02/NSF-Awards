Substantial reduction of defects in silicon-on-sapphire material is required to
broaden the range of applications to include bipolar devices. During the past
few years, it has been shown that regional amorphization of the silicon layer by
implantation of silicon and solid phase epitaxy regrowth can reduce the defect
density in the silicon overlayer. However, one obstacle to large scale use of
this process is that it requires implantation of silicon-29 ions to avoid
introduction of contaminants. Another obstacle is that the wafers must be cooled
to liquid nitrogen temperature. This program will study the effect of a
germanium implantation and solid phase epitaxy process which could be feasible
for large scale wafer improvement. Implantation of germanium is advantageous
because amorphization can be achieved with a dose almost an order of magnitude
lower than required with silicon and without liquid nitrogen cooling.
