9612675 This RPG research is a preliminary study which will lead to development
of a systematic approach to risk assessment for foundations at sites that are
susceptible to sinkhole formation. This approach will combine characterization,
preparation and design to assess risk of structures (e.g., buildings, highways,
and retaining walls) built on karst terrain. Following a literature review,
standard approaches to risk assessment will be evaluated to determine which
approach or hybrid of approaches would be best suited to a systems approach
analysis. The study will include recent case studies of structure damage and/or
collapse due to sinkholes, and assess the limitations in current methods used to
characterize sites and design foundations in karst areas. ***
