An accurate and versatile computer- based testbed for designing printed-circuit
antennas and arrays will be developed. The testbed will include pre- and post-
processing tasks, e.g. specifying geometries, varying geometrical parameters for
a given design, display of simulation results. Furthermore, appropriate
databases will be utilized for design sensitivity analysis. The goal of phase I
will be to demonstrate the viability of the integrated, user-friendly front-end
or the graphical user interface. By linking the interface to an existing
analysis routine for a single-layer microstrip, sensitivity studies will be
exploited. In Phase II, the testbed will be expanded to include new analysis
with more efficient algorithms for complex structures and a capability to cut
masks using standard plotters.
