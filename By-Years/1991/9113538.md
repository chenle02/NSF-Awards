Sensory transduction is the initial step of stimulus reception in sensory
systems, in which the capture of energy of a stimulus (such as a light, sound,
touch, or chemical) is converted into a neural signal to be sent to the brain.
This symposium will focus on the molecular mechanisms of sensory transduction,
on the initial events in the receptor cells. The issues of stimulus sensitivity,
discrimination, amplification, and adaptation will be covered for a several
different sensory systems, by a multidisciplinary group of speakers and
participants. This conference and the publication of the symposium volume will
have an important impact across this currently very active field of sensory
research in neuroscience.
