The project is a novel attempt to develop a better understanding of hepatic
solute transport processes at the anatomic sites where it occurs. This has not
been attempted previously. The liver is unique in the body since the vascular
wall of the capillaries is perforated, thereby permitting intimate contact
between solutes in the bloodstream and the hepatocyte cell membrane. The
specific objective is to develop an electro-optical method to experimentally
quantify solute transport and uptake at this hepatocyte-blood interface. Such
information is not presently available due to the complexity of the experiments
involved and the three-dimensional structure of the liver. Most of the
theoretical models presently available are developed using whole-organ
experiments that require assumptions about the rates of uptake at the cellular
level. The overall goal of this work is not to eliminate the use of black-box
experiments, but rather, to test the assumptions made and to complement the data
obtained on solute extraction using these models.
