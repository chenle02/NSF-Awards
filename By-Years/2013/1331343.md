This project is funded as part of the United States-Israel Collaboration in
Computer Science (USICCS) program. Through this program, NSF and the United
States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support
collaborations among US-based researchers and Israel-based researchers. The
availability of fast and cheap computers coupled with massive storage devices
has enabled the collection and mining of data on a scale previously
unimaginable. This opens the door to potential abuse regarding individuals'
information. This work explores the fundamental tradeoffs between privacy for
individuals' data and the usefulness of the information one can obtain from
these large datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential privacy is a well-
established paradigm aimed at mitigating the drawbacks of traditional
anonymization techniques, as it provides a rigorous guarantee for the added risk
to an individual in participating in a database. This research addresses
fundamental questions clarifying the boundaries of what is possible under
differential privacy and its relaxations, by exploring the fundamental conflicts
between privacy and utility and the additional tensions introduced by
computational efficiency. This work expands the potential impact of
differentially private algorithms on real-world applications, and also ensures
broad impact via curriculum development, pedagogical development, and outreach
activities.
