Under this Engineering Research Equipment Grant, the Optical Sciences Center at
the University of Arizona will upgrade a highly stabilized CW dye laser to a
titanium sapphire laser. This upgraded laser will be dedicated to research in
engineering, specifically lightwave technology. The titanium sapphire laser will
be used for several research projects: a) measurement of the linear and
nonlinear optical properties of II- V semiconductor crystals grown on our Riber
32P MBE machine, for example, strained-layer InGaAs/GaAs multiple quantum wells,
in order to assess their potential for low- energy optical modulators and low-
threshold lasers; b) study of spectral hole burning and instabilities in our
MBE-grown CW vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers; and c) characterization of
the nonlinear properties of specific MBE-grown devices such as our InGaAs/GaAs
asymmetric reflection modular.
