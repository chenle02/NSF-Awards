This award will support a workshop on neuroendocrine strategies in a tropical
environment in conjunction with the 101st Annual Meeting of the American Society
of Zoologists in San Antonio, Texas. The workshop, organized by Professors
Barney Schlinger and Arthur Arnold of UCLA, will focus on tropical ecology and
its relevance to neuroendocrine mechanisms in animal physiology and behavioral
ecology. The meeting will highlight ongoing research in comparative
neuroendocrinology within Latin America as well as studies utilizing neotropical
animals. The tropical regions of the New World are considered by many to contain
the greatest biological diversity of any region on the planet. This region is
currently experiencing intense pressure from rapid development, including
massive deforesta- tion and destructive land-use practices, actions that will
detrimentally affect animal populations. This Science in Developing Countries
award will help to promote collaboration and exchange of ideas between North
American and Latin American comparative neurobiologists and endocrinologists in
a topic of strong mutual interest.
