With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A)
Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Michael Duncan of the
University of Georgia to conduct experimental studies to look at the structure
and bonding in complex protonated species. These species are commonly invoked in
important reaction mechanisms, like the ever-ubiquitous proton transfer. In
these particular experiments, Professor Duncan will use the observed infrared
spectra of ions tagged with Ar atoms to infer information about the structure of
the protonated species, as well as the strengths of the various bonds (from the
vibrational frequencies). The graduate and undergraduate students working on
this project will receive training in laser science, molecular beam methods and
spectroscopy, while working on compelling chemical problems with broad
scientific impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Profesor Michael Duncan and his research
group will use infrared lasers to photodissociate Ar-tagged protonated species
prepared in a molecular beam. The infrared spectrum of these tagged ions is
measured by scanning the infrared laser while looking for production of the
untagged ion. Species to be studied are: protonated carbonyls, protonated
hydrocarbons (carbocations), proton-bound dimers, simple mimics of solvated
species. In a new direction, Prof. Duncan and his students will expand their
work to look at photofragment imaging of some interesting protonated systems to
measure the bond energies for these weakly bound systems and to explore the tag-
free spectroscopy of some of the ions. Professor Duncan will continue to
collaborate with a wide range of theorists and experimentalists on these
important chemical problems.
