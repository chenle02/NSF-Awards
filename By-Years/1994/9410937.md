In the proposed effort, the PI will continue the operation of the cosmic ray
neutron monitors at Mt. Washington and Durham through the next modulation
minimum (1996-97), as well as continuing studies which relate ground-based
cosmic ray observations to near- Earth cosmic ray telescope data. Specific
problems the PI intends to investigate are: (1) the interplanetary cosmic ray
radial and latitudinal gradients; (2) location of the termination shock and
cosmic ray modulation boundary using cosmic rays; (3) significance of the
correlation of the cosmic ray intensity charges and the heliospheric current
sheet; (4) recovery phase of the 11-year cosmic ray intensity cycle; (5) the 22
year cycles...comparison of the intensities at successive intensity maxima; (6)
rigidity dependence of transient decreases; and (7) solar cosmic ray events.
