This proposal addresses the problem created by the lack of geometric computing
in the curriculum. The lack of interdisciplinary foundation courses in geometric
computing affects student success in subsequent graphics, engineering design, or
mathematics courses, as well as student retention and employability in product
design and manufacturing related software development. The primary objective of
the project is to design a comprehensive geometric computing course to address
interdisciplinary issues for second-year students in computer science,
engineering, and mathematics. Furthermore, this project is developing the
courseware (textbook, lab manual, videos, and web-site applications) and
interactive animation software systems to explore aspects of geometric
computing. The impact of this project is to provide students with the basic
skill for handling geometric problems, understanding the limitations of finite
precision on geometric problem solvers, and to prepare students for geometric
applications in science and engineering. The impact of this project is also
expected improve the retention rate of students and the employability of
graduates in product design and manufacturing related software development.
