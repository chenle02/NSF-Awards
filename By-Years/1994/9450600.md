9450600 Johnson The Chicago Public School System and its educational partners
propose to implement broad based reform in each of the system's 551 schools. The
USI is led by a strong, innovative General Superintendent. It will build upon
School Reform Legislation which resulted in individual schools being governed by
eleven member Local School Councils (LSC) consisting of parents, teachers,
community members and the principal. The very successful Chicago Comprehensive
Regional Center for Minorities (CRCM) provides the USI with a rich array groups
as well as an effective data base which is being redesigned for local school
use. It has also led to the development of a Resource Menu which will include
listings of all appropriate and quality community resources available to
schools. A critical benchmark of the Initiative is the expectation that all
children will complete algebra by the end of the eighth grade. Citywide and
local school-based design teams and the implementation of a highly coordinated
staff development program will serve as the mechanism for ensuring quality
mathematics and science education for all students in Chicago Public Schools.
