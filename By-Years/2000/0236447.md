This grant will partially support for a 3-day workshop on using operations
research to improve health care delivery. Approximately 40-50 participants will
meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, September 25-27, 2002. A number of recent
conferences, including an NSF workshop in Atlanta and one sponsored by the
National Academy of Engineering, both in 2001, documented the opportunities for
engineering to contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of health care
delivery. This workshop would bring together experts from the health care and
operations research communities to identify critical research issues that can
drive operational improvements in health care delivery systems. The workshop
would be jointly hosted by the University of Michigan which is a leader in both
medical and health care research.
