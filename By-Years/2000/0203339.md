The ability to make well-controlled structures on the nanometer scale represents
one of the most important scientific advances of recent decades. Such
nanostructures are already in use in a variety of optoelectronic devices, and
promise to be of increasing importance as communication speeds increase. The
fundamental physics of these structures lies in the quantum confinement of
electrons. However, the influence of such confinement on the ultrafast
electronic interactions which determine both nonlinear optical response and
relaxation rates is unclear. This project will use ultrafast spectroscopy to
determine how confinement influences interactions on the femtosecond time scale.
It begins with the development of a very pure set of semiconductor
heterostructures with varying width. These samples will then be studied via
several ultrafast optical techniques to fully characterize the influence of
confinement on ultrafast dynamics. This project will take place at Williams
College, an entirely undergraduate institution in which young students take
active, central roles in research. The research training provided by this
project will allow ten undergraduates to become familiar with research, and
specifically with cutting edge optical and electronic techniques, at the
earliest point in their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drive for
increasing speed in communications and computers is pushing technology toward
ever smaller semiconductor devices. A fundamental question as these devices are
developed is the following: is smaller always faster, or is miniaturization not
the best way to increase speed? This project begins to answer the question by
exploring the ways in which electron interactions change as semiconductors
become extremely small. It will proceed by using an ultra-fast laser to inject
energy into nanoscale semiconductor structures, and then to measure how those
structures respond. The results will demonstrate the ways size alters the
fastest electronic interactions, which take place in less than a trillionth of a
second. This work is of both fundamental and technological importance, since
these interactions ultimately allow electrons to relax after excitation, and
thus set the speed limit for electronic and optical device performance. This
project will take place at Williams College, an entirely undergraduate
institution in which young students step up to take active, central roles in
research. The research training provided by this project will allow
ten&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to become familiar with research, and specifically
with cutting edge optical and electronic techniques, at the earliest point in
their careers.
