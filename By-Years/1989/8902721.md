Present-day systems, intelligent or otherwise, are limited by the
representations of the world given to them by their designers. The primary goal
of this research is to automate representationchanges for problem-solving and
learning systems. The research is formally grounded in a novel, first-principles
approach to automating conceptual shifts for computational efficiency, called
the theory of irrelevance. This theory makes precise the intuition that
inefficient representations make irrelevant distinctions. The research proposed
here is an attempt to extend the theoretical foundations above to coverlarger
scale problems in engineering design and robotics. We will test the theory by
implementing a reformulation assistant in engineering design and spatial
planning.
