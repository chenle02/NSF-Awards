In this age of declining trust in government, apathy toward participation in
public affairs, and information overload, developing "citizenship skills" is a
fundamental challenge to liberal arts education. The traditional approach of
undergraduate education in political science is no longer adequate because of
rapid changes in the availability of electronic information. Students are highly
attuned to the information age but our classroom approach has not kept up. We
seek to address this gap through more effective use of computing technology with
funding for equipment for a departmental computing laboratory that will focus on
undergraduate education for citizenship. Four departmental courses have been
selected (Political Science 205 - Political Science as a Social Science,
Political Science 303 - Public Policy Formation. Political Science 422 - Global
Environmental Problems, and Political Science 407 - International Conflict) in
which computer technology will be used to provide opportunities for political
science undergraduates to obtain citizenship skills in the following areas;
accessing information, acquiring information,, analyzing information,
understanding the political and economic context, and making collective choices.
The Department is in the process of constructing the computer laboratory. When
equipped with 18 Pentium computers, a local area network, and an SVGA RGB
projector, the computer laboratory will provide a flexible learning and teaching
environment for the development of citizenship skills for political science
undergraduates. The department is developing methodologies to evaluate this
project and will have support for evaluation and dissemination from other units
on campus such as the Center for Instructional Development and Research.
