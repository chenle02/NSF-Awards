Scientists are faced with an ever increasing array of options for data
publication and a growing set of requirements to meet grant and journal
directives. General purpose data repositories, data archives with journals or
university libraries, domain-specific data repositories or broader project
management and collaborative environments that provide some data publication
services (e.g., issuing DOIs) are just a few of the options available. How
should scientists choose among these options? How effective are these
alternatives in meeting the multiple objectives for data publication, including
discoverability, recording of sufficient metadata for reliable re-use,
reproducibility of scientific results, convenience for data provider, and
persistence. The investigator proposes to organize a workshop that brings
together key stakeholders in data reuse. The workshop targets research carried
out in the geosciences and is an activity connected with the South Big Data
Regional Innovation Hub.
