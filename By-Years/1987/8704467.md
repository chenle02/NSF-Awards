Segmenting an image into distinct, meaningful regions is thought to be largely
a task in early visual processing, involving low-level processes: local,
numerical and bottom-up. Most segmenting algorithms can be broadly divided into
categories based on opposing strategies: local, edge-operator methods and
region-based, histogram methods. A recent algorithm developed by S. and D. Geman
uses ideas from statistical mechanics to divide up an image into maximally
homogeneous regions with shortest possible boundaries. The approach used in this
research is inspired by Geman's work and involves segmenting by minimizing
energy functionals. These functionals reflect properties that one would expect
of any segmenting scheme. Preliminary work shows that the Geman scheme can be
thought of as a continuous spectrum of methods bridging edge-operator methods
and region- based methods. The research in this project will be focussed along
three lines: 1) Theoretical investgation regarding the existence and smoothness
of solutions, 2) Extension to multi-grid relaxation and related questions of
shape representation, and; 3) Extension to segmentation based on image features
other than or in addition to the gray level.
