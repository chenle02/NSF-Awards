This project focuses on a model for Quaternary blind thrusting in the
southwestern Sacramento Valley based on preliminary analysis of seismic
reflection data. The study will develop and use a methodology for distinguishing
between active fault-bend and fault- propagation folding based on the
interaction between fault kinematics and surficial processes. Results are
expected to provide criteria to distinguish fold styles in active blind
thrusting, which will be useful in seismic risk analysis and neotectonics
generally.
