The Intelligent and Interactive Media (IIM) REU Site at North Carolina State
University immerses a diverse group of undergraduates in a vibrant research
community working on cutting-edge interactive and intelligent media including
serious games and game technologies, interfaces, visual experiences, and natural
language dialogue. The IIM REU at NC State recruits broadly, but focuses on
providing opportunities for students from underrepresented groups, and from
colleges and universities with limited research opportunities, reaching students
not typically exposed to research. The IIM REU engages faculty and graduate
student mentors with undergraduates to create a supportive culture of
collaboration while promoting individual contributions to research through just-
in-time training for both mentors and students throughout the summer. REU
students present their work at an undergraduate research competition, develop
videos to convey their research to K-12 students, and are encouraged to submit
their technical papers as peer reviewed publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Site's explicit training in research skills and mentoring to support students
with diverse backgrounds through the Affinity Research Groups model, and its
engagement and integration with the STARS Alliance (http://starsalliance.org) to
recruit students from underrepresented groups, creates great potential to
inspire students to enroll in computing graduate programs. The project's focus
on relevant cutting edge interactive technologies is a proven focus that can
improve retention for minorities and women. REU students become part of the
STARS Computing Corps, a computing leadership consortium dedicated to broadening
participation in computing, providing REU students access to excellent mentoring
and networking resources through STARS while also giving them the chance to
extend their REU experiences into the academic year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Intelligent and Interactive Media REU website (http://research.csc.ncsu.edu/iim-
reu/) provides additional information to students, educators and researchers.
