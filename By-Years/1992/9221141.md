A collaborative interdisciplinary materials research program on dilute magnetic
semiconductors (DMS) and magnetic semiconductors is proposed. This program
involves a unique combination of high magnetic fields, low temperatures,
advanced optical techniques, and new materials development in order to study the
microscopic interactions of magnetic ions in a host semiconductor. The
organizations involved are: the MIT National Magnet Laboratory (NML), the
Physics Department at Tufts, and the Chemistry Department at Brown University.
The plan is to study the magnetic, optical, and electric-transport properties,
as well as the crystal chemistry of several classes of dilute magnetic
semiconducting materials. This grant supports the effort at Brown University.
