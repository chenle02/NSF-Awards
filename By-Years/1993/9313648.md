9313648 Wu This renewal grant concerns theoretical studies of lattice models in
statistical mechanics with emphases on exact results and applications. Lattice
models which retain the essential physics of real systems are crucial in
materials research. The research will include the study of several two-and
three-dimensional systems which describe a wide range of physical phenomena
ranging from adsorption, percolation, directed polymers, and membrane
transitions, to high temperature superconductors. In addition, results of
lattice model studies will be applied to analyze several long-standing
unresolved problems in the mathematical theory of knots. %%% ***
