Shipman shall continue his theoretical research on the chemical compositions of
white-dwarf atmospheres. The emphasis will be on interrelating the observed
abundance patterns via evolution and accretion processes, using appropriate
models of the white-dwarf atmospheres. The research involves numerous
collaborators. When stars like the Sun exhaust their nuclear energy sources,
they shrink to about the size of the Earth. New observations of such stars,
called white dwarfs, show that the chemical abundances in their outer layers are
much more varied than expected. A good interpretation of these observations
promises a much improved understanding of just how solar-like stars become white
dwarfs. Shipman will interpret the observations using models of the stars, of
their atmospheres, and of gases that may accrete from companion stars.
