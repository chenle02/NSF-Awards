Walla Walla College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits
per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection
enables the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with
the national scientific and educational community, and to access network
resources. Areas of science to be addressed on the Internet by Walla Walla
College include physics, computer science, engineering and chemistry. The
library also expects to benefit from the connection. This award funds part of
the costs for two years.***
