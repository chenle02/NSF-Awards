0448117 Dionysiou Advanced Oxidation Technologies (AOTs) are among the most
promising emerging chemical oxidation processes for the treatment of organic
pollutants of different chemical composition. AOTs are based on the generation
of very reactive radicals, which in general have very high second order reaction
rate constants with most organic contaminants. For this reason, AOTs are
characterized with high reaction rates and short treatment times. In modern
environmental engineering, AOTs are anticipated to play a crucial role in water
treatment as stand-alone processes or in combination with conventional
technologies. The PI proposes to expand on-going research and educational
activities on the treatment of organic contaminants in water using AOTs.

The proposed research will be useful for the development of new remediation
technologies for the destruction of environmental contaminants and chemicals
that can be used in chemical and biological terrorists actions. The educational
plan will promote understanding of issues relevant to AOTs and drinking water
quality and treatment, and will intensify interaction between drinking water
professionals across disciplines.
