Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments will be carried out to test and
build an understanding of the relationship between atomic dynamics and structure
in solids. The motion of hydrogen in metals at low and high concentrations in
glassy and crystalline solids will be examined. Concentration and temperature
dependent spin-lattice relaxation rates and translational diffusion coefficients
will be analyzed to see if there is evidence for preferred hydrogen atom siting
in amorphous alloys of nickel and zirconium. Similar measurements will be made
in crystalline hydrides to determine whether layered structures lead to
predominately two-dimensional diffusion of hydrogen. Experiments will be carried
out to see if there is evidence for premelting of a crytalline lattice around
suloute atoms in a macroscopic alloy.
