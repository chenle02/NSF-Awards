In vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics perform the diagnostic, surgical and
biological procedures necessary for in vitro fertilization cycles, as well as
egg freezing procedures and egg and embryo banking. IVF clinics are highly
competitive with one another because their success rates are published, and
patients are willing to travel to clinics with higher success rates. Especially
at high volume clinics, they are interested in innovations that will increase
their profitability by driving patient volume through increased success rates.
This team aims to create a commercial device that unearths new sources of
information of egg/embryo quality that can be incorporated into an algorithm to
predict the chance of IVF success.

This team is proposing the creation of an algorithm that can assess the quality
of an egg or embryo by looking at metabolic and subcellular features of that egg
or embryo and correlating those features to ultimate potential to lead to a live
birth. The embryologist can use this algorithm to choose the embryo for
implantation that is most likely to lead to birth, which should increase
success. Clinicians can also use the algorithm on a patient?s eggs, to give the
patient a more accurate assessment of her individual fertility potential.
Quantifying metabolism is the core piece that will be used to create the
algorithm.
