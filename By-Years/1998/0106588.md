This is a project in the area of mathematics called number theory. Professor
Katz will investigate varieties defined over finite fields, in particular their
cohomology and the distribution of the zeros of L functions on such
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project in the area of mathematics
called number theory. The main focus of this project can be described as the
study of certain kinds of solutions to polynomial equations called "modular
solutions." Many of the applications computer scientists have for number theory
involve these kinds of solutions. Professor Katz is considering questions
involving the number of such solutions, how this number changes as the
polynomials change, and how the solution sets of different polynomials are
related. &lt;br/&gt;
