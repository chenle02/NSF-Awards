Digital image processing is a rapidly evolving field with growing applications
in science and engineering, such as high- definition television (HDTV). Many of
the theories and concepts pertinent to image processing are within the scope of
understanding by undergraduate students who learn them in prior courses. The
introduction of image processing to the undergraduate curriculum facilitates the
understanding of many important, yet abstract, techniques students acquire in
signal processing, communication theory, and random variables courses. Moreover,
this provides them with an excellent preparation for advanced study in related
fields. Experiments based on image processing are an integral part of the course
and the establishment of an image processing laboratory enables students to
carry out experiments that supplement lecture materials. These experiments cover
a wide range of practical applications that extend from the acquisition of an
image to the edge detection of a noisy image. The conduct of these experiments
necessitates a high-speed computer equipped with a frame grabber, a video camera
and a high-resolution monitor. For educational purposes, an image-processing
laboratory manual and an integrated software package capable of implementing all
proposed experiments are planned.
