9704724 Muraki The theme of proposed work centers on the generation and
propagation of nonlinear waves in PDE models which derive from physical systems
of current interest: a) self-focussing of light in nematic liquid crystals, b)
interfacial pattern formation in chemical reactions, c) wave behaviors in
atmospheric weather systems. The mathematical objective is to quantify
relationships between spatial structure, instability, and dynamics as pertains
to wave behavior in nonlinear PDE systems. In all of the proposed projects, the
model equations involve coupled PDE systems where the wave behavior is strongly
coupled to other background influences. The complexity of these models requires
the development of new methods for nonlinear waves which combine the techniques
of asymptotic analysis, modern dynamical systems theory, and numerical
simulation. These projects focus on the understanding of nonlinear waves through
the identification of solutions representing the primary wave modes, along with
their dynamics and interaction properties -- while remaining relevant within the
underlying physical context. Change in nature is often mediated by waves -- a
process in which spatial features evolve over time. Familiar examples are
outward spreading of ripples in a pond and waves in the form of atmospheric
turbulence, which result in the "bumpy" flights experienced by aircraft. The
science of waves (as with science in general) is becoming increasingly
quantitative, due to higher-precision instrumentation and larger-scale
computing. The interpretation and understanding of greater amounts of refined
data demands an equal enhancement of our ability to analyze increasingly
sophisticated mathematical models of wave generation and propagation. The
proposed research seeks to develop analytical and computational techniques to
quantify wave behavior in model equations for optical, chemical, and weather
systems and to re-interpret the mathem atical implications within the original
scientific context.
