This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Research project is
designed to develop a universal Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
controller/data station for step-scan and rapid-scan operation of any FT-IR
spectrometer. Research to determine the feasibility of this approach will apply
control theory and mathematical analysis to servo design and signal processing
The theoretical results will be tested with a prototype instrument. The
anticipated result is the technology to design, assemble and market a new
generation of flexible FT-RI computers
