The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program is the successor to the
Trustworthy Computing (TC) program. With the increasing importance of
cybersecurity to the nation as a whole, and to the Foundation as a research
area, improving communication between program officers and researchers supported
by NSF and other government funding agencies, coordination among PIs from the
different perspectives sponsored by SaTC, and outreach to the broader community
is increasingly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SaTC program provides
national visibility with the participation of the Social, Behavioral, and
Economics (SBE) Directorate, the Office of Cyberinfrasture (OCI), the
Mathematics Division of the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS),
and the Engineering Directorate (ENG) in addition to the Education and Human
Resource (EHR) directorate. It is arguably the largest single research program
in CISE. Across the Foundation, the FY expenditure is estimated to be greater
than $100M. There are currently over 500 active awards in the program. The PI
meeting will be a large, major event for the Foundation and the community. For
this event there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize the
technical program, the venue and conference logistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
grant provides funding for the venue and conference logistics, including
conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.
