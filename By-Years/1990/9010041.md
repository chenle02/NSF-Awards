This is a research planning grant for the purpose of supporting Professor
Kime's activities to determine the feasibility of her proposed research. In
addition she will consult with experts to develop approaches to certain aspects
of her proposed project. The project itself deals with the Schroedinger equation
which describes the quantum mechanical behavior of microscopic systems. The
dynamics of these systems involves certain applied forces which are described
mathematically. Professor Kime will study how and to what extent these forces
can be prescribed to achieve a desired outcome.
