L-functions have played a pivotal role in the modern development of number
theory and they can be used to study a wide variety of problems. The tools used
to study L-functions draw from many branches of mathematics including analysis,
algebra, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics
while number theory has important applications outside of mathematics to fields
such as theoretical computer science and cryptography. Many of the topics
investigated in this project concern the distribution of zeros of L-functions
and related topics in arithmetic. This relationship is central to two of the
seven Millennium Prize Problems, the Riemann hypothesis and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The investigator will continue training and
mentoring graduate students in this research area, and this project will provide
research training opportunities for them. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One of the
problems in this project will investigate a thin family of Dirichlet L-functions
which experimentally has significant and previously undetected bias in
distribution of the gaps between their zeros. This bias seems to have an
arithmetic explanation that corresponds to the non-vanishing of a certain Gauss
type sum connected to moments of these L-functions. Other problems study the
distribution of zeros and moments of the Riemann zeta-function, the prototypical
example of an L-function, giving insight on previously unexplained, and in some
cases previously unobserved, phenomena. The investigator also intends to combine
tools from Fourier analysis with the theory of L-functions to study prime
geodesics and to give improvements of several conditional estimates in prime
number theory, assuming the generalized Riemann
hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
