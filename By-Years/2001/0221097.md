P.I. Widder, Edith (Harbor Branch Oceanographic Inst.) Proposal #:
0221097&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to upgrade the Low Light Auto-
Radiometer (LoLAR). LoLAR is a submersible, radiometrically calibrated detector
that was developed with joint funding from NSF and ONR. It is currently deployed
on the Johnson- Sea-Link submersible, down to depths of 1000 m to measure
downwelling irradiance with respect to the vertical distribution and migration
patterns of mesopelagic organisms, as well as to make in situ measurements of
bioluminescence. LoLAR combines the high quantum efficiency of a photomultiplier
tube with a solid-state autocalibration circuit. The funds requested would be
used to redesign LoLAR based on a proven auto-calibration concept, using recent
technological developments that make it possible to greatly reduce the cost,
size, and complexity of the system with the intent of developing a versatile
instrument that can be made accessible to a wider range of users.&lt;br/&gt;
