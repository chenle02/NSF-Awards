9512362 Zavaliangos This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation)
Award is to assist in the purchase of several components of an automated
specimen preparation facility for mechanical and metallurgical testing. This
equipment will greatly improve the testing efficiency and quality in the area of
processing-structure-property relationships by permitting changes in the
microstructure to be accurately measured. It will be used both in research and
in senior design projects. It will be used for metals, polymers, ceramic and
composite type materials. ***
