The proposal is in the area of the theory of hypergeometric functions associated
to root systems, and their q-deformations. A number of key results have been
obtained by the investigator in the course of previous NSF supported research.
These results have led to the resolution of various conjectures of Dunkl,
Macdonald, Koornwinder and others. It is proposed to examine some of the
outstanding problems in this area, which have to do with certain positivity
conjectures of Macdonald, Stanley, and the proposer.

The research described above should lead to a better understanding of several
different areas of mathematics including algebra, representation theory,
combinatorics, analysis, and multivariate statistics.
