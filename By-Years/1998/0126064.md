The investigator would apply a method of expert-knowledge and statistical
technique to the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data
set to identify and measure latent competencies that students must use to get
correct solutions to test problems. The TIMSS was conducted in both mathematics
and science, but the final negotiated project will be conducted in mathematics
only. The purpose of this investigation is to provide a technique that can help
classroom teachers and administrators make better use of test score data. The
investigator has developed a technique (Rule Space method) to enable the
creation of a scale score on underlying knowledge states. This process will test
through statistical analysis the existence of attributes of the test items that
identify cognitive processing skills and knowledge underlying student
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
