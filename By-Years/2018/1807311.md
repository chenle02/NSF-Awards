This award will help support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual
ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2018, which will be
held January 7-10 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana. SODA is co-sponsored by the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics (SIAM) . SODA is the premier annual research conference in
the field of discrete algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in
theoretical computer science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a
typical year has over 300 attendees. It is co-located with two smaller
workshops, ALENEX (Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation) and
ANALCO (Meeting on Analysis of Algorithms). SODA is attended by researchers from
all over the world. The field of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high
participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student
authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves
as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the
talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.

The award will provide partial support to approximately twenty students, partly
defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support
students from under-represented groups.
