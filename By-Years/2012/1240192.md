This award supports the scientific workforce development activities of the Santa
Fe Institute (SFI) in complex adaptive systems. These activities include
workshops and working groups, the visiting scientist program and the Complex
Systems Summer School. SFI is a private, non-profit independent research and
education institution that occupies a unique place in the academic landscape. It
is dedicated to long-term, creative, trans-disciplinary research across the
physical, computational, biological and social sciences, focusing on complex
adaptive systems. This support will expand the inclusion of the broader
scientific community in the activities at SFI, maintain the robustness of the
workforce development activities, and allow for discovering and communicating to
a broad audience the common fundamental principles in complex physical,
computational, biological, and social systems. The award will permit SFI to
explore new research areas through workshops and working groups, to expand the
breadth of its international scientific community, and to provide support for
its educational activities.
