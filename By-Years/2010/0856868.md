Stanton 0856868&lt;br/&gt;Naval Postgraduate School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds
are provided to continue observations of turbulent fluxes, heat content, and
current profiles in the ocean boundary layer below sea ice in the Beaufort Sea
and Transpolar Drift regions of the Arctic Ocean. A series of ice-deployed
Autonomous Ocean Flux Buoys (AOFB) will robustly measure heat, salt and momentum
fluxes near the ocean-ice interface using direct, eddy-correlation techniques.
Significant scientific and logistic leverage results from collaboratively
deploying the AOFBs on the same ice floes as systems concurrently measuring the
ocean temperature and salinity structure, the conductive fluxes through the ice
cover, and at some stations, the bulk atmospheric and radiative fluxes, all of
which are components of the Arctic Observing Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
