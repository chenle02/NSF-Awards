Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0219745&lt;br/&gt;Ciardo -&lt;br/&gt;College of William and
Mary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is devoted to the development and
implementation of novel sequential and parallel algorithms for the verification
of asynchronous software systems, such as communication protocols and
distributed or embedded software. Existing automated techniques based on state-
space exploration, in particular symbolic model checking based on Binary
Decision Diagrams (BDDs), focus on verifying synchronous hardware and software.
Although symbolic model checking may in principle be applied to asynchronous
software systems as well, this poses new challenges that are not, or only
insufficiently addressed in the literature. Most importantly, the inherent
complexity of asynchronous software makes state-space exploration a time-bound
problem, in addition to a memory-bound problem. The research addresses these two
fundamental limitations by developing algorithms that employ Multi-valued
Decision Diagrams (MDDs) and Boolean Kronecker Operators to encode sets of
states and transitions, respectively, in contrast to BDDs traditionally used for
both purposes. This paves the way for exploiting the property of event locality
that is inherent in asynchronous software and, thereby, for greatly improving
the efficiency of sequential algorithms and enabling their efficient
parallelization.
