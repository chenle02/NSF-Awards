This research will investigate the social organization of an apparently
communal halictine bee, Lasioglossum (Chilalictus) erythrurum. Three approaches
will be employed: (1) laboratory studies involving direct observation of
behavior among females in observation nests, (2) ecological studies of natural
nest aggregations, and (3) isozyme studies of the genetic relatedness among
interacting females (intra-colony relatedness). This will be the first such
study for any apparently communal hymenopteran. The results will provide a
unique opportunity to study the evolution of alternative forms of primitive
social organization in the Hymenoptera. Dr. R. H. Crozier will provide essential
laboratory space for the behavioral aspects of the research and collaboration
for the genetic aspects.
