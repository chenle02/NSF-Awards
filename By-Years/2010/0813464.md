Girl Scouts of Western Washington (GSWW) is collaborating with Seattle
University to develop an innovative new model for science learning in youth
programs. The project is designed to increase the use of science inquiry among
adult Girl Scout Leaders, facilitate learner-centered inquiry, change the
culture of program delivery, and enhance science literacy. New parent
volunteers, who are Girl Scout troop leaders, will be trained to deliver
inquiry-based science to girls ages K-3 in environmental science, wildlife
biology, ecology, and botany in a manner which makes scientific questioning and
exploration integral to the girls' experiences. Deliverables include a training
curriculum adapted from the NSF-funded Fundamentals of Inquiry, quarterly
training workshops for adult volunteers in inquiry-based science methodologies
and content, an enhanced volunteer support system (including online and peer
networks, science activities, and resources), and a replicable model for
incorporating science into community youth programs. The inquiry activities will
be modified for use in an informal learning setting and may be easily integrated
into the existing science activities for Brownie Girl Scouts such as community
service, camping, cookies, and "Try It" events. Potential strategic impact
includes the advancement of a new model for volunteer training which secondarily
changes the organizational culture and expands the current understanding of how
science learning occurs in community contexts. The proposal includes a
comprehensive, mixed methods evaluation to be conducted by the Puget Sound
Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology. It is anticipated that this
project will reach 360 women and over 1,600 girls in disadvantaged urban and
rural communities in western Washington.
