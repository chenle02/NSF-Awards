Research will be performed in two areas of theoretical high energy physics:
phenomenology and fundamental theory. The first is concerned with theoretical
predictions (based on a new symmetry of nature: supersymmetry) of an array of
ongoing experiments to discover new principles of how particles interact. These
include testing of whether the proton is stable or whether it decays into
lighter particles, detection of cosmological dark matter whose composition is as
yet unknown but is believed to make up more than 90% of the matter of the
universe, etc. This research is exciting in that any of these experiments could
revolutionize our understanding of particle theory. The second area is concerned
with superstring theory, an effort to unify all the forces of nature including
gravity into a single theory. Research here is concerned with 11 dimensional
M-theory (of which 7 dimensions are compactified into a very small volume)to
resolve outstanding problems of black hole physics, the quantum theory of
supermembranes, etc. This research aims at the exciting possibility of the
discovery of a fundamental new theory of all particle physics.
