Long-term research abroad: High resolution STIM in biology and material science.
This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-Term
Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to enable
U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research
institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct
of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,
expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected
on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to the applicant's field of
science, the prospective potential of the applicant for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. The project is under the
direction of Professor Harlan W. Lefevre, Department of Physics, University of
Oregon, Eugene, OR, in collaboration with Professor George Legge, Director,
Micro Analytical Research Centre, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne,
Australia. The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,
international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if
applicable, language training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance
of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
