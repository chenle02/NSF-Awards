Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is adapting and implementing a web-
based homework delivery system, WQS, created at the University of Kentucky (UK)
under NSF funding (DUE-99542436). First, WQS is being used to deliver extensive
sets of homework problems in college algebra, first term calculus, first term
calculus lab, and business calculus. The materials are providing assistance for
students with weak skills in certain prerequisite topics, as well as help on new
course topics. Second, the project is adapting a problem-solving course
developed at UK for prospective high school mathematics teachers in which
students use the Maple to design web-based problems, posting them on the web via
WQS. Finally, the PIs are conducting academic year and summer workshops for
college faculty and current high school teachers to design web-based problems
and use WQS with their own students. Assessment includes multiple student and
faculty surveys and comparative studies to determine the value of WQS for
students in university courses by measuring communication between faculty and
students, collaboration among students, and improvements in student performance.
