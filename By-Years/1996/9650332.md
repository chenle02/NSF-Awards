In accordance with the Chemistry Department's goal of providing a premier
education in chemistry for its undergraduates by the year 2000, the department
is equipping the Chemistry Interactive Learning Center (CILC) with a network of
16 Pentium-based computers and 1 SGI Indigo2 Workstation. This center is an
upper-division teaching facility that permits learning to take place with
integrated flexible instructional formats and is essential for the
implementation of curricular changes that enhance student training for the real-
world workplace. The curriculum changes target the use of cutting-edge computer
and multimedia technologies to integrate concept learning with the development
of communication, management, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills in
the following chemistry major courses: Basic Inorganic Chemistry, Quantitative
Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Polymer Chemistry. The
CILC can be a crucial segment of the learning infrastructure available to
chemistry students. The CILC is to serve as a model for other university
chemistry departments considering the use of multimedia technologies to
integrate concept learning with skills development in integrated
course/laboratory instruction.
