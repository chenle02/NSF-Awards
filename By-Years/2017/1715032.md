For about fifteen years, astrophysicists have known that galaxies generally
house supermassive black holes (BHs) at their centers. Although usually detected
only through their gravity, there is another method to reveal otherwise
unobservable BHs: stellar tidal disruptions, which are the destruction of a star
that happens to pass extremely close to such a BH. The exciting and innovative
techniques already developed to tackle this situation will be extended and
improved and will have significant impact across many fields that require
numerical calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over roughly the last decade,
dozens of these Tidal Disruption Events have now been discovered from the
luminous flare each one produces. This characteristic flare gradually decays
over a span of weeks to months. Unfortunately, the old theory has trouble
explaining the new data, and its assumptions must be questioned. Recent work has
opened new ways of thinking about these events, but progress has been hampered
by the extreme computational demands of conventional numerical simulation
methods. The present team has built a new simulation infrastructure that
overcomes these obstacles, and permits high-quality calculations incorporating
full general relativity and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics. This tool
enables three new avenues of research: (1) understanding the nature of both the
accretion flow onto the black hole and the ejection of unbound debris after the
star is torn apart; (2) exploring how black hole spin may shape the accretion
flow and possibly support relativistic jets; and (3) providing quantitative
predictions of the light curves and spectra
produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Societal benefits come from training a young
scientist in the broadly applicable techniques of large-scale numerical
simulation, expanding modern instructional methods in undergraduate physics
education, and developing the innovative computing methodology for future public
release.
