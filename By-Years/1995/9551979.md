Equipment to enhance an astronomy course for non-science- majors is being
purchased. The equipment enables students to better determine stellar spectral
class and distance and to image very faint objects. These are fundamental
concepts in the university's efforts to teach non-science-majors how astronomers
can deduce properties of distant objects, including their distance, from the
tiny amount of light received. For many students, this course represents their
most advanced instruction in science and forms the basis for their view of
science throughout their lives.
