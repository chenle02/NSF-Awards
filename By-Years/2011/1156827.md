The MetroBotics REU Site project provides funded academic year research
opportunities for students from public urban institutions within the New York
City area. The project engages undergraduates in robotics research in the Agents
Lab at the City University of New York (CUNY). The Agents Lab focuses on
effective coordination of robust human/multi-robot teams. A rough-and-ready,
multi-agent approach is taken, in which small, low-cost robots collectively
perform exploration tasks. This team-based strategy differs from state-of-the-
art systems in which a single expensive, high-end robot is fielded---but if that
robot fails, then the entire operation halts. The multi-agent alternative
provides redundancy and requires a system that can coordinate in dynamic,
uncertain environments, that can adapt to changing team composition, and can
interact with an untrained human operator. The MetroBotics project provides
opportunities for undergraduates to participate in this research and to
experience the investigative process within a vibrant group setting over an
extended timeframe. The target population for the MetroBotics project consists
of students underserved by traditional REU Sites, frequently underrepresented in
computing, who work while taking classes, who are first in their families to
pursue higher education, and who take care of parents or who are parents
themselves. These aspects present particular difficulties for students
interested in research. MetroBotics strives to get motivated students out of
mundane jobs and into the lab during the academic year, giving them a context to
deepen technical skills acquired in the classroom and direct access to mentors
who can support a dialogue concerning research career options.
