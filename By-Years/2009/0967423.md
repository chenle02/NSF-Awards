The proposed project is to carry out a fundamental study of carbon as a new
element for quantum dot-like fluorescent nanomaterials. Recently, the PI?s group
found and reported that small carbon nanoparticles could be surface-passivated
to exhibit strong fluorescence in the visible and nearinfrared spectral regions.
The focus of the proposed project will be on the further exploration and
development, both fundamentally and technologically, of these fluorescent carbon
nanoparticles (dubbed ?carbon dots?). While the original discovery of carbon
dots was driven largely by carbon being obviously non-toxic, subsequent studies
have revealed their many superb characteristics, including their being highly
competitive in fluorescence performance. There are very good reasons to expect
that with further development the carbon dots technology will play a significant
role in advanced optical imaging and sensing for biomedical and human health
related applications. In addition, an understanding of the fact that nanoscale
carbon exhibits semiconductor-like optical properties should contribute to the
fundamental knowledge on materials at the nanoscale, which may inspire the
discovery of new concepts and new materials.
