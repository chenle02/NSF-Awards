9353433 Todd The objective of this research is to develop a new method for
determination and visualization of the concentration and flow of gases and
vapors in air. The method is based on coupling the chemical detection technology
of optical remote sensing with the mapping capabilities of computed tomography.
Chemical concentrations determined by using a network of infrared beams
projected through air at many angles are coupled with real-time measurements
obtained through use of an optical remote sensing system to obtain path-
integrated concentrations of chemicals over the entire path of the beam. The
initial phases of this research involve modification and evaluation of
tomographic reconstruction algorithms and image processing techniques for
reconstructing chemical concentrations in air. Application-specific measures
developed to evaluate algorithm performance and image quality will be followed
by simulation studies to determine conditions for laboratory validation of the
method. Results of this research are expected to be applied to identification
and characterization of the motion and dispersion of air pollutants after their
emission from sources. This is the initial increment of an award to provide
support for this Presidential Faculty Fellow who was selected through evaluation
procedures conducted by the National Science Foundation and based on criteria
contained in NSF 93-114 which contains the nomination guidelines. ***
