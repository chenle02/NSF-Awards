CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Postdoctoral
Research in Distributed Robotics

This proposed research is intended to create more versatile robots by using
self-configuration: the autonomous organization and reorganization of large
numbers of modular robots into geometric structures. Structures of such robots
would be well-suited to a variety of situations where environmental models
(e.g., terrain, hazards) and task specifications (e.g., sensing, manipulation)
are uncertain. To create autonomous robotic systems of this nature, the
fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science-base for modular self-
reconfiguring systems. The postdoctoral research associate will explore new
ideas on distributed planning and control and focus on general rather than
architecture-specific algorithms. The plan is to use existing designs and robot
systems to demonstrate the applicability of such algorithms to locomotion and
simple manipulation tasks.
