This project supports a two-day workshop to provide technical assistance to
minority serving institutions (MSI) considering submission to the MSP Targeted
competition. Each team attending the workshop consists of a scientist or
mathematician, an education faculty member and a school district representative.
To be eligible to attend, the team sends in a short description of what is
planned. Follow-up evaluation focuses on the number of proposals submitted and
the number of awards made.
