Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies general properties of
mathematical structures. Work in model theory often answers questions in other
areas of mathematics. In the recent years there have been exciting new
developments in applications of model theory to combinatorics, analysis and
algebra. This project advances research on definable topological groups, their
actions on compact manifolds and equidistribution related problems. The project
also addresses combinatorial questions in the context of not-independence-
property (NIP) relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon the
investigator's previous work on definable group actions and combinatorial
properties of theories without independence properties. The research undertakes
a systematic study of orbit closures for topological groups actions and extremal
combinatorics in the not-independence-property (NIP) setting. More specifically,
the project studies extremal combinatorics in NIP theories, e.g. densities of
graphs definable whose edge relation has NIP. The project will also investigate
Elekes-Ronayai problem for hypergraphs definable in o-minimal and strongly
minimal theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
