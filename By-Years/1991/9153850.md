This project will improve the quality of mathematics and science education on
the Blackfeet Indian Reservation through a multi-faceted program: 1) A two day
reservation- wide conference designed to bring together various community
groups, along with state officials, university system personnel, and national
leaders; 2) four intensive two-week summer workshops for local educators,
students from BCC, and interested community members; 3) eight 1 to 2 day
workshops during the regular academic year for local educators, students from
BCC, and interested community members; 4) the piloting of a Mathematics and
Science Associate Degree program involving 10 Blackfeet students. The
reservation wide conference will include: education policy makers such as school
board members and district administrators, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian
Health Service officials, Tribal Elders, Montana State University personnel, and
officials from the Office of Public Instruction; nationally known Indian
educators and scientists; local teachers, parents and students. The focus will
be the current state of math/science education on the Blackfeet Reservations.
The summer workshops for 16 teachers and 10 students will study new methods for
improving math/science education among American Indian students and adaptation
of activities to the Blackfeet culture. The academic year workshops will
acquaint 20 educators with nationally known math/science curriculum projects;
their content and pedagogy. An unusual feature of the project is having
Blackfeet students mentor practicing teachers to provide a cultural background
for teachers. Mentoring for math/science content in the other direction provides
science/cultural balance in a meaningful way. The Principal Investigator for the
project is Mr. Gerard Vandeberg. Cost sharing equals 37% of the NSF award.
