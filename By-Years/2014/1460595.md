This project is targeted at ergodic theory of infinite-dimensional random
dynamical systems. The main goal is the analysis of steady statistical patterns
in stochastic processes associated with random media such as random Lagrangian
systems, directed polymers, random growth models, and models of stochastic
hydrodynamics. Ergodicity is a form of stochastic stability that means that the
long-term statistical properties of the system are not sensitive to the initial
state. In particular, it makes measurements related to complex systems
meaningful. Long-term statistical patterns in deterministic and random dynamical
systems can be described via stationary distributions, and it is the description
of these stationary regimes that the project aims at. It builds around the
momentum that has been created by recent progress by the PI in ergodic theory of
the Burgers equation and related systems. The central role of the Burgers
equation is due to the fact that it is fundamental in modeling a variety of
phenomena from traffic to the formation of large scale structure of the
Universe. It is simultaneously a fluid dynamics model, a growth model, a
conservation law, and is tightly related to stochastic control, directed
polymers, and an important KPZ universality class of models of statistical
mechanics. The proposed program will extend the understanding of statistical
patterns for the Burgers equation and related complex random dynamical systems
in noncompact settings.

Studying ergodic properties of stochastic partial differential equations or
similar models in unbounded domains calls for development of new mathematical
techniques. The project will use and enhance modern methods of mathematical
statistical mechanics, probability theory, and dynamics, techniques developed
for first-passage percolation and last passage percolation models, lattice
animals, concentration inequalities, stochastic control, thermodynamic limits
for Gibbs ensembles and hydrodynamic limits for interacting particle systems,
along with variational approach and analysis techniques such as inequalities and
embeddings, typical for partial differential equations. The description and
analysis of stationary distributions will be obtained via sample measures, one
force one solution principles, random one-sided Lagrangian minimizers and their
polymer counterparts.
