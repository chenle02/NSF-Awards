This SBIR Phase II project proposes to research and develop ways to increase
accessibility and utilization of Earth systems science data and visualizations
for secondary school teachers and students. The commercial product will consist
of a DVDROM, curriculum, and web site. Building on WorldLink Media, Inc.'s
previously published CD product, Interactive Earth, the firm will develop an
integrated tool set for data display and image interpretation that will enable
students to inquire, hypothesize, analyze, discover, and communicate with peers-
replicating the work of real scientists. Much more than a static software
program, the Interactive Earth DVD-ROM will be part of a "learning platform"
that includes an in-depth curriculum package, access to a rich archive of global
data via the web, and professional development opportunities. Partnerships with
NASA's Earth Observatory web site and the World Resources Institute's
EarthTrends project will enable classroom access to extensive global data sets
and visualizations. TERC, a research and education organization, will develop a
curriculum that aligns with the National Science Education Standards. This SBIR
project recognizes the vital interplay between a curriculum developer (TERC),
data providers (NASA and World Resources Institute), and a media designer and
tool-builder (WorldLink) in creating exemplary learning materials. Earth science
is of national strategic importance as a field of research and innovation. The
potential contribution to our schools and students is not just in Earth systems
science, but in the broader applicability of the skills developed by students to
related domains of science, math, geography, and other fields. These thinking
skills include inquiry, visual literacy, understanding systems and models, and
the ability to apply knowledge and problem solving to a range of real-world
issues.
