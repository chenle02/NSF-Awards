The primary focus of the proposed research is to obtain experimental
measurements of charge density changes at surfaces, with a particular emphasis
on polar oxide surfaces. For the oxide surfaces, the charge transfer at the
surface between the metal cation and oxygen will be measured from precision
electron diffraction measurements. In addition, the redistribution of charge
density will also be measured. These measurements will be compared to quantum-
mechanical calculations, primarily using density functional techniques, done
both as part of this effort and with theoretical collaborators. Questions of
interest include how covalency and ionicity change at the surface, as well as
rehybridization of the d-electrons and valence changes. Simultaneous with this
work, ancillary data which may be significant in its own right on the character
of steps on oxide surfaces will also be obtained, for instance step structures
on antiferromagnetic NiO (111) surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A continuing
effort, albeit at a smaller scale, will be development of direct methods for
surfaces. The idea is to test whether statistical methods such as multivariant
statistical analysis or principle component analysis can be applied to the end
product of direct methods, greatly simplifying the final analysis. If this
concept works, it would have potential applications in other areas, for instance
protein crystallography.
