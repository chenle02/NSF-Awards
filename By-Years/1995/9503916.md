9503916 Gee Gee, in collaboration Kent, will measure the magnetization of 500
samples of basalt from the Ocean Drilling Program and Deep Sea Drilling Project.
They will also measure the magnetite chemistry on 100 samples by electron
microprobe. The combined data will be used to evaluate several hypotheses about
the variation of the intensity of magnetization of the ocean crust with the age
of the crust. This variation may be related to magnetite originally present in
the basalts or it may be the result of alteration. This has been a long-standing
enigma and these researchers may have found the solution. ***
