In plants, development takes place continuously from activities of small groups
of pluripotent cells known as meristems. The entire above ground portion of a
plant develops from continuous events in a meristem found in the shoot apex, the
shoot apical meristem. Since it is not uncommon for many plants to live for a
century, the continuous activities in shoot apical meristems describes processes
unmatched elsewhere in biology. This study will focus on how molecular events in
the meristem function to make a plant. Genes with meristematic enriched
expression, designated "meri", will be studied. Expression patterns for specific
cDNAs in hand will be confirmed and localized on a tissue specific level.
Additional meri clones will be isolated. The transcriptional promoter for the
most specific clones will be defined, fused to a reporter gene (GUS) and
transferred to Arabidopsis plants. Transgenic plants expressing the chimeric
meri-GUS gene will be analyzed for histological expression to confirm
localization studies and to determine how the meri genes are expressed in the
dynamic events in meristems. Furthermore, the response of the meri genes to
physiological cues will be examined by crossing the 'meri-GUS' plants to a
transgenic line capable of heat inducible hormone alterations. These studies
will provide insight into how genes within the shoot apical meristem function in
development, and hence insight into how the meristem "makes" a plant.
