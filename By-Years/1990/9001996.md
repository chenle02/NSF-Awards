Dr. Nancy E. Levinger has been awarded a Postdoctoral Resaerch Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Levinger's doctoral degree was from the University of Colorado
under the supervision of Professor W. Carl Lineberger. Dr. Levinger intends to
continue research at the University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of
Professor Paul Barbara. Dr. Levinger's area of training and research will be the
role of solvation in chemical reactions at a molecular level. Femtosecond
spectroscopy will be used to distinguish solvent-mediated intermolecular charge-
transfer reactions from intramolecular charge-transfer reactions. The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
