An investigation of the effect of bridging groups on the magnetic properties of
high-spin organic molecules will be conducted. Emphasis will be placed on
defining the structural parameters which are necessary to maximize coupling of
multiple spin centers in organic molecules. A program of targeted synthesis of
specifically defined high-spin precursors will be coupled with measurements of
the magnetic properties of the resultant high-spin molecular species: this will
establish the type of bridging groups which most effectively couple via an
intramolecular process. A highlight of the research will be the development and
subsequent evaluation of magneto-optical switches which are capable of rapid
changes in magnetic properties when exposed to appropriate wavelengths of light.
%%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing
investigations of Professor D. A. Dougherty at the California Institute of
Technology. These studies will be focused toward the synthesis and design of
organic molecules which exhibit magnetic properties when exposed to heat or
light. The target molecules, which are effectively known as organic magnetic
switches, will be evaluated for their magnetic properties by utilization of
specialized equipment designed to operate at liquid helium temperatures.
Advances in this field will provide the basic information required to develop
organic magnets with unique optical properties for utilization in electronics
applications.
