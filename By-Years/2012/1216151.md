ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;21 May 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1216151&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI: W.
Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests two
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment items for the University of Delaware for
use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely a new double-articulated side A-frame
and up-grades to an existing portable deck winch. Both items will enhance safety
and provide greatly improved support capabilities to a wide variety of
scientific projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and
Intellectual Merit: The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit
of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP. The research
projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.
During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate
students to seagoing oceanography. Specifically, College of Marine and Earth
Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house
events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises. The
College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool. The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is
scheduled to support over 90 NSF-funded days in CY 2012.
