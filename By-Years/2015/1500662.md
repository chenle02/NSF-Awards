The Second Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Graduate Research Workshop in
Combinatorics (GRWC), which will be held in Ames, IA during June 1-12, 2015,
will involve approximately 35 graduate students, 6 postdoctoral researchers, and
more than a dozen faculty members in an intense two-week collaborative research
experience. Participants will work to solve important, relevant problems from
graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory, finite geometry, and
other modern sub-disciplines of combinatorics. Students will prepare open
problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of faculty mentors from the
organizing committee, which consists of faculty from Iowa State University, the
University of Colorado Denver, the University of Denver, the University of
Nebraska Lincoln, and the University of Wyoming. These problems, presented at
the workshop by their proposers or hosted on the workshop's secure problem wiki,
will be worked on by small groups of participating students, postdocs, and
faculty. For more information about the GRWC, including a detailed description
of the workshop format, please see the workshop website at

collaborations at the heart of the GRWC is to produce high-quality, publishable
research on a variety of topics. Another longer-term goal of the workshop is to
help student participants expand their professional research networks. A strong
research network is often a crucial part of building a generative and
sustainable research program, and establishing these connections at an early
career stage can have a long-term positive effect on the quality, impact, and
depth of a professional's research portfolio. Participation in the GRWC will
allow students to cultivate a large professional network of peers from the
combinatorics community with whom they will be able to interact and collaborate
throughout their careers. The GRWC will also offer professional development
workshops to help students and postdocs prepare for job searches and future
careers in academia, industry, or government. This award supports students and
postdoctoral researchers only; faculty support is provided by the organizing
institutions.
