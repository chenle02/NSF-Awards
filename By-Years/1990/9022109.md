During the first phase of this NSF sponsored Small Business Innovation Research
project, Intersonics Inc. demonstrated the feasibility of employing a
polarimetric method to measure precisely the spectral emissivity and optical
properties of reflecting and partially specular surfaces. The measured
emissivity was used to correct radiometric data obtained from a conventional
pyrometer resulting in a non-contact true surface temperature determination of
radiating bodies. The phase II research to be undertaken, will further asses the
validity of the approach on different materials and different surfaces. Two
independent methods will be employed to determine the true emissivity, and the
results of the two approaches compared. This will provide an objective
assessment of the true potential of the instrument, and the limits of it's
accuracy to non-contact high temperature measurements of smooth as well as rough
and film covered surfaces. Phase II experiments will include: (i) optical
properties of: smooth solid and liquid metal surfaces at high temperatures;
rough surfaces with varying roughness: materials with single and multi-layer
dielectric films; (ii) dielectric function and spectral emissivities of
incandescent surfaces using their self emission at non-normal angles; and (iii)
spectral emissivities of materials of commercial interest. It is expected that
this project will result in the development of an instrument which will have
large demand in order to achieve process temperature control in numerous
manufacturing operations.//
