This project establishes a facility to improve undergraduate education in
political science. The system has the capability not only to hold the Political
Science Department's extensive national survey and demographic data, but also to
afford easy and simultaneous student access and use of the data in research
methods and statistics courses in the department. Through the interactive use of
the data base management system and the graphics capabilities of the statistical
package, students gain experience in computerized data analysis.
