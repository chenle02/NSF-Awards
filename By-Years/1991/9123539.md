The objective of this study is to assess the current state of the United States
pharmaceutical manufacturing industry with respect to its counterparts in Japan,
England, France and Germany. The effort will consider research issues in
automation, manufacturing and drug development and delivery systems coupled with
government regulations to develop a competitive benchmark for pharmaceutical
manufacturing in the United States versus foreign competition. A major product
of this endeavor will be the identification of research areas and trends where
production systems methodologies can play a vital role in the future development
of this manufacturing sector.
