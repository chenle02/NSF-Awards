Dr. Patricia Gregg is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, Columbia University. Dr. Gregg will investigate the role that magma
injection and dike propagation have on the break up of continents along rift
zones. The research goals will be accomplished by examining data from local
arrays of seismic stations, GPS networks, and InSAR deformation data. These data
will be integrated in computer models that take into account changes like
temperature and strength of the rocks with increasing pressure and depth into
the crust. The results from this investigation contribute to better
understanding of the rift systems and they will help in the assessment of
hazards like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition, Dr. Gregg will work with undergraduate and graduate students in
assisting with their mentoring in research projects. This investigation will
contribute to a larger international effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
