Whitehead 9633063 A laboratory and theoretical study of buoyancy-driven flows
involving pairs of driving forces, either from temperature and salinity, or from
temperature and surface stress, will be conducted to see if multiple states
predicted in simple models also exist in more complex system. To that end
additional physical processes known to be important in the ocean, such as
vertical transport, rotation and surface stress will be included in later
experiments. The results will more clearly quantify the interdependence of salt
forcing and heat flow in the ocean and the role of double diffusion and wind
stress.
