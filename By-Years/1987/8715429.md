The goal of this project is to formulate a methodology for early post-
earthquake damage detection for lifelines and to collect and utilize field data
from the September, 1975 Mexico earthquakes. Considerable data on water
transmission system damage, as well as water pressure gradient changes, were
recorded by the General Directorate of Hydraulic Construction and Operations
(D.D.F.) in Mexico City. These data can be used to help formulate an early post-
earthquake damage detection methodology for lifelines. This methodology has the
capability to preserve surviving storage supplies without having to cut off
vital supplies to undamaged areas, and expedite and more effectively manage
ensuing response and recovery efforts. Four major tasks are being addressed: (1)
Collect, review, and document water system performance data from the 1985 Mexico
earthquakes, (2) Develop comprehensive earthquake vulnerability models for
critical water system components, (3) Formulate an early post-earthquake damage
detection methodology, and (4) Demonstrate this methodology for the September
1985 Mexico earthquakes. The major emphasis is on tasks 2 and 3.
