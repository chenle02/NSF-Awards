*** ABSTRACT 96-60819 Miller This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will focus on the development of point sensor for high sensitivity in-
situ remote trace gas analysis. The proposed technology is expected to provide
two or three orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity over existing near
infrared technologies and allow the development of diode-based, portable
instruments for high sensitivity (ppm-ppb range) point monitoring of trace
gases. This technology also allows for the development of versatile sensors
suitable for the detection of chemical/biological agents in both gas and liquid
media for a broad scope of applications in science and industry. During Phase I,
PXL will design and test a proprietary sensor component and will develop, and
experimentally confirm a numerical model that simulates the proposed system.
Using the confirmed model, numerical simulations will be conducted to develop
the instrument's optimized design and to predict its performance. The Phase II
research program will develop a point sensor based on the proposed technology
for the remote monitoring of ammonia in off-gas waste streams in real time. The
proposed sensor will particularly benefit industrial process control,
underground pipeline and tank leak detection, and geological exploration for oil
and natural gas. It will also find applications in clinical/medical diagnostics,
environmental monitoring, detection of battle field chemical and biological
warfare agents, and other personal safety devices. The broad scope of
applications indicates a large potential market for this technology. ***
