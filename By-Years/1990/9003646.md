This research will analyze the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta, California,
earthquake source mechanism by comparison with the great 1906 San Francisco
earthquake which ruptured the San Andreas fault in the same segment. One of the
most interesting and unexpected aspects of the Loma Prieta earthquake is that
the mechanism indicated by preliminary results has a significant thrust
component (about 1/2 the total) which suggests an uplift of about 1 meter. If
the oblique-slip mechanism is characteristic of the events occurring along this
segment, we would expect a long-term uplift rate of 1 cm/year, which appears
much higher than inferred from the regional geomorphology. The seismograms from
the 1906 event will be analyzed to look for the presence of a similar thrust
component. This research is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
