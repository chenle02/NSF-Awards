A major goal of behavioral neuroscience research is the identification of the
neurobiological processes which underlie learning and memory. One important
model system for examining experience-based changes in neuronal activity is
long-term potentiation, or LTP. This is a relatively long-lasting change in the
efficiency of synapses, which results from stimulation with a brief, high
frequency train of weak electrical pulses. This form of "neuronal plasticity"
was first discovered in the hippocampal formation, a brain region known to be
involved in memory formation. Dr. Rose' recent work has shown that by using a
pattern of electrical stimulation which mimics either of two prominent
electrophysiological activity patterns of the hippocampus (complex spike
discharge and theta rhythm), he could markedly reduce the threshold for inducing
LTP. This effect, termed "primed burst" (PB) potentiation, is invoked quite
reliably by as few as five appropriately patterned stimuli. Because of its low
threshold, and of its similarity to well-known electrical activity patterns, it
is proposed that a PB-like process may occur within the hippocampus during the
formation of new memories. Dr. Rose is recording electrophysiological activity
from the hippocampi of normal, awake rats to evaluate this hypothesis. This work
is clarifying both the physiological and behavioral conditions which promote PB
potentiation, thus suggesting their role in the learning process. He is also
examining the correlation between PB potentiation and memory by examining the
effects of stress and aging (two conditions known to impair mnemonic function)
upon the capacity of hippocampal synapses to show this PB effect.
