The concentration and chemical speciation of volatile components in the Earth's
upper mantle play an important role in geologic processes. Despite their
importance, we know little about their actual modes of storage in the various
geochemical reservoirs. Previously, infrared spectroscopy was used to establise
that variable quantities of OG occur in pyroxenes, garnet and olivine brought to
the Earth's surface as xenoliths in alkalic magmas. Preliminary indications are
that the OH concentration of these minerals is correlated with their environmmet
of formation and may thus reflect ambient hydrous volatioe activity. The PIs
plan to determine the actual OH content of important mantle minerals,
concentrating on the subcontinental mantle of southern Africa. They will
calibrate the IR method using a variety of methods. This will allow them to
quantify in absolute terms the abundance of inter-mineral partitioning of OH in
these rocks and perhaps to provide D/H ratios. In order to relate the observed
OH contents of the samples to volatile activity of the sources, they will
measure the OH contents of garnets grown synthetically under controlled
conditions of pressure, temperature and volatile activity in a piston cylinder
apparatus. The results are expected to have an important bearing on
understanding how volatiles are distributed in the upper mantle as well as how
they behave int eh processes of melt generation and subduction.
