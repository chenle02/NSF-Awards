The proposed research will investigate the biogeochemical cycle of
dimethylsulfide (DMS) in seawater. The ocean is a major source of biogenic
reduced sulfur to the global atmosphere, at a level roughly equivalent to
anthropogenic SO2 emissions. DMS accounts for some 90% of the marine biogenic
sulfur flux. The objective of this investigation is to elucidate the rates,
pathways, and processes involved in the formation, transformation, and
consumption of DMS in the ocean. This biogeochemical information is vital to
understanding the DMS concentration profiles which have been observed in the
field and may influence future sampling strategies. One a larger scale, a fuller
understanding of the marine biogeochemistry of DMS and the processes involved in
DMS cycling in seawater will aid in defining the relationship between oceanic
biogeochemical processes and the production of the volatile biogenic sulfur
compound which plays a major role in the global atmospheric sulfur cycle. Four
working hypotheses will be addressed: 1) Degradation of algal
dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP, the DMS precursor) and release of DMS is the
result of normal metabolic processes by phytoplankton; 2) release of DMS results
form physiological stress on the phytoplankton; 3) microbial degradation of
DMSF- containing algal material is a source of DMS in seawater; 4) microbial
degradation is a sink of DMS in seawater. The approach to assessing these
hypotheses will combine laboratory and field incubation experiments. Laboratory
studies will be conducted under controlled environmental conditions and using
selected individual and mixed culture algal and bacterial species. Experimental
conditions will be varied to examine specific factors which may be important in
DMS cycling. Field studies will then be used to examine the processes under
natural conditions.
