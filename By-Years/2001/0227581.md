Dr. Louis Dale has done extraordinary work at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, serving as an effective mentor, especially of minority students, for
30 years. Dr. Dale's work is outstanding taken in the context of the university
environment in which he operates. He is a tenured faculty member of mathematics
who at the beginning of his career was the only African American faculty member
in his school -- a minority in a majority-dominated institution. Throughout his
career he has served as a mentor to minority students and his mentoring programs
have developed in a consistent fashion over the years. He has written a book on
mentoring and taken his programs to HBCUs in Alabama. His mentoring work with
students is supportive, but at the same time is rigorous and demanding,
challenging them to become the best that they can be. The number of students he
has mentored who have earned Ph.D.s and who have gone on to the professoriate at
other colleges and universities is one of the strongest indicators of Dr. Dale's
effectiveness as a mentor.
