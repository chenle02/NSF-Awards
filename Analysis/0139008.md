ABSTRACT

The work described in the proposal concerns several topics in Classical
Analysis: approximation theory, several complex variables, miscellaneous
problems on complex polynomials and classical operator theory. The most central
questions for the project are: uniqueness of best approximation by harmonic
functions in the supremum norm in dimensions three and higher (the two-
dimensional case has been recently settled by the PI and H.S.Shapiro), sharp
estimates relating to multidimensional analogs of H. Bohr's phenomenon for power
series, counting zeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials, Agler-Cole-Wermer
interpretation of Ando's theorem in C^2 and, finally, understanding the spectral
picture of the celebrated double layer potential operator -a topic going back to
the pioneering work of I. Fredholm.

Most of the questions in the project are rather simply stated and, accordingly,
will attract a fair number of graduate students and young researchers. The
problems are also open-ended and suggest several new paths of investigation in
these classical areas away from the well traveled tracks. The investigations
undertaken in the project have well-defined applications to Mathematical Physics
(Potential Theory), Applied Mathematics (polynomials, special functions) and
Numerical Analysis (explicit solutions of some of the most important boundary
value problems). The project entails active involvement of undergraduate and
graduate students at all stages of the project and, via local network of
workshops and seminars for teachers, to disseminate some of the more elementary
off-beats of the proposed work among high school students interested in science.
