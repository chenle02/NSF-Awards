This PFI:Accelerating Innovation Research Technology Translation project focuses
on development of a dry powder, roll-to-roll process for manufacturing battery
electrodes to replace slurry-based electrode manufacture. This is an additive
manufacturing process to be used for the fabrication of Li-ion batteries. The
technology is important because it eliminates slurry production, coating, and
drying operations from lithium ion battery manufacturing as well as the need to
recover and/or dispose of solvent. This has the potential to reduce the capital
and operating cost of a battery plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery
toward commercial application. (1) Adhesion and cohesion properties of
electrodes. With the removal of solvent in additive manufacturing process, the
dispersion of the binder materials among other materials can be challenging,
which compromises cohesion and adhesion properties. Research will be done to
optimize the mixing process, the sequence of adding powders, and the powder
dispensing process, in order to achieve uniformly distributed binder, which
could lead to high adhesion and cohesion. (2) Electrochemical properties. With
the removal of solvent, the manufactured electrode could exhibit structure
difference in porosity, tortuosity and pore size, which could affect the
electrochemical properties. A detailed study and optimization of each step
during the additive manufacturing process, including multi-nozzle spray process
and subsequent hot rolling/heat treatments, will be conducted to ensure
comparable performance with conventional electrodes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personnel involved in this project, two graduate students,
will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through taking business
courses offered at their respective institutions and participating in NSF
I-Corps.
