The problems to be investigated are in the area of dynamical systems on
homogeneous spaces which are obtained as a quotient of a Lie group by a discrete
subgroup. Such spaces arise naturally from problems in number theory. The main
objective is to continue the path of establishing dynamics on homogeneous spaces
as a powerful tool to approach certain problems in number theory. The following
problems will be main objects of the study: (i) "effectivization" of orbit
closure and equdistribution results for orbits of certain subgroups (ii)
establishing "rigidity" results for invariant measures and orbits of ''certain
subgroups" on homogeneous spaces; special attention will be given to the case of
Radon measures on geometrically finite manifolds and Raghunathan's conjecture in
positive characteristic setting.

Lie groups and their discrete subgroups are one of the central objects of study
in mathematics. During the past 40 years, techniques and ideas from dynamics on
homogeneous spaces have been fruitful in answering certain long standing
questions in number theory, in particular in Diophantine approximation. The
relevant results are mostly in the rigidity theory of the kind that a rather
weak initial information about an object almost fully classifies the object.
This proposal seeks continuation of this path.
