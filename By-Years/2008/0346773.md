Four species of fruitfly are endemic to the hot Sonoran Desert of Arizona and
Mexico. These flies live in association with decaying arms and stems of giant
columnar cacti. In order to understand how organisms are able to adapt to the
harsh desert environment and the toxic chemicals found in certain natural foods,
we are studying these desert flies as a model system. The work in involves
seasonal monitoring of the availability of decaying cacti as breeding sites and
the insects associated with them. It also uses laboratory tests of traits such
as heat and desiccation resistance to understand the basis for adaptations to
these conditions. As global warming continues, it is imperative that we
understand the capability of organisms to adapt to changing conditions or face
extinction. The results of this work are directly applicable to all organisms,
including insects that vector disease and insects that are agriculture pests.
