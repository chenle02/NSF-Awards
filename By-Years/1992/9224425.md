9224425 Brand This award supports a feasibility study to determine if a reliable
and practical method to cryopreserve algal strains can be developed.
Specifically, Dr. Brand, in collaboration with Dr. Diller and Dr. Starr will
develop means to cryopreserve the strains of algae in the University of Texas
Culture Collection of Algae. Cryopreservation, if successful, will (1) stabilize
and protect the algal resources, (2) diminish the day-to-day cost of maintaining
the collection, and (3) make storage and shipment less expensive and more
efficient. Prokaryotic algae (cyanobacteria) in general are amenable to storage
under conditions currently used to cryopreserve other bacteria. Recent advances
in techniques for cryopreservation of other organisms indicate that many of the
eukaryotic algal strains will be amenable to cryopreservation without a major
experimental effort. Protocols will be developed which permit cryopreserved
cultures to be thawed and grown in small batches, thus making these generic
resources available and useful for collections anywhere in the world which
maintain algal strains for research, teaching and/or technology development. ***
