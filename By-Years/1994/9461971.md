9461971 Hashish This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will explore a new low-cost atomiztion process for making ultrafine powder from
metal alloys. The process uses ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) waterjets to atomize
molten pre-alloy metals. Although water is already used in some metal
atomization processes, this method of using UHP waterjets up to 100,000 psi
represents a significant departure from current methods. Highly energetic
waterjets will require much less water, which will result in a nearly dry
process and a smaller proceqsing system. UHP nitrogen jets will also be
explored. The costs of atomization, for production of ultrafine powders, is
expected to be reduced due to compactness of the equipment and to the high
efficiency and high yields of the process. Materials-processing applications,
among others,in injection molding and ceramic powder operations.
