9458176 Ellington In vitro selection techniques will be used to determine how
proteins containing arginine-rich motifs can specifically recognize their
cognate RNAs. The possible sequence motifs available to both RNA and protein
partners of the interface will be scanned and an attempt to identify `codes' for
protein: nucleic acid interactions determined. %%% Commonalities in the
complementary interfaces formed by proteins and nucleic acids are critical to
understanding most life processes. In vitro genetic selections will be done in
order to determine what set of protein sequence motifs. The range of possible
`answers' to the molecular recognition `problems' will be investigated and
improvements made, if possible. ***
