This award supports 4 postdoctoral research fellowships at the Institute of
Mathematics and Its Applications at the University of Minnesota. The
postdoctoral fellows will spend 50% of their effort at the Institute and 50% of
their effort at either Honeywell or 3M coporate research centers. Honeywell and
3M will contribute one-half of the cost of these postdoctoral fellowships. In
addition, the University of Minnesota will provide substantial cost-sharing on
this project. The postdoctoral research projects will involve diffractive optics
and scattering, inverse problems in sonar, fluid mechanics, scattering from
coated objects, and magneto-optic recording media.
