Fretting fatigue and fretting corrosion are common types of tribological damage
caused by oscillating contacts. The level of surface temperature generated by
friction in the contact zone under these conditions and its effect on the
fretting process will be studied. Experimental temperature measurements obtained
by infrared microscopy will be combined with tribological fretting data and with
relevant heat transfer analyses to formulate a model for the role of temperature
in fretting damage. Effects of sliding distance and velocity as well as of oxide
films will be included. The study will result in a better understanding of the
fretting process and could lead to better guidelines for materials selection and
development for fretting conditions.
