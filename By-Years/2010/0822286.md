Building on their experience of developing and testing four hands-on, inquiry-
based modules for the study of engineering/technology education at the high
school level, an established, multidisciplinary team extends their work with a
professional development model that implements those modules. A module on
medical technology is added that addresses the Standards for Technological
Literacy. The module uses real-world examples and practicing engineers and
technicians to introduce students to engineering design, analysis and decision-
making processes. This project advances knowledge about effective instruction
and curriculum design in engineering/technology education in order to achieve
public literacy and better preparation for the next generation of engineering
and technology professionals, including teachers. A model is designed, developed
and tested that delivers effective teacher professional development to both
inservice and preservice teachers to enable the successful implementation of
engineering curricula. Hypothesis-driven research is performed to evaluate the
individual and combined impacts of the curricular materials and the teacher
professional development framework on classroom instructional practices and
student learning, interests and attitudes and to evaluate which curriculum
components are most effective in promoting student learning and interest as a
function of gender and ethnicity.
