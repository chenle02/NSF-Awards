9361437 Hannon AstroPower proposes the development of monlithically integrated
bicolor edge emitter-detector pairs for wavelength-division multiplexing in
fiber optic communications. This device utilizes laterally graded A1xGa1-xAs
layers formed by liquid phase epitaxial deposition onto a continuously moving
substrate. Multiple light emitting diodes and detectors can be colinearly
integrated in the same device to emit/detect light of different wavelengths. The
A1GaAs system allows for composition control so that an array of devices
sensitive to different wavelengths can be fabricated on the laterally graded
structure. This program will explore the limits of the moving substrate
technique in forming laterally graded layers. The optoelectronic integrated
circuit will be designed for optimum emission and detection capabilities.
AstroPower has extensive experience with the design, fabrication, and
characterization of LEDs and detectors as well as with liquid phase epitaxy --
all of which will have a strong impact on the success of this program. ***
