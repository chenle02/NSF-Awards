This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the
subfield of surface chemistry. Professor Ellis will study adsorbates on metal
surfaces using multinuclear solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
This research will use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the isotopes
carbon thirteen and deuterium to study the molecular structure and motions of
olefins adsorbed on solid surfaces of catalytic interest. Other systems of
interest include alkali metal ions and transition metals on alumina and effects
of cobalt promoters on hydrodesulfidization catalysts. The results obtained from
this project will be useful in understanding chemical transformations that occur
on metal supported heterogeneous catalytic surfaces.
