Climatic changes in East Africa are affected by variations in the south Asian
monsoon and by ENSO. A record of climate change in this region will provide
important data from a region where our knowledge is limited. This proposal
requests support to study high sedimentation rate cores from Lake Turkana in
East Africa. Its major goal is to determine the chronology of the cores and to
reconstruct the climatic changes which occurred in this region during the last
4000 years. This project is important because sedimentation rates are high
enough to expect that annual to century scale climate changes will be resolved.
