9407284 Reed U of Southern California Dr. Christopher Reed, Chemistry
Department, University of Southern California, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the study of weakly
coordinating anions. In this study, Reed will prepare a variety of new anions
which contain no good coordination sites and in which the charge is delocalized
over a large volume. These will be used as counter ions both to obtain low-
coordinate cations and to stabilize complexes of very weak donors such as xenon,
hydrocarbons, etc. Using the of non-coordinating anions the magnetic properties
of admixed-intermediate spin state Fe(III) complexes will be investigated order
to establish the relative ligand field strengths of these anions. In general,
negatively charged chemical species (anions) tightly associate with species
bearing a positive charge (cations). This project will focus on the preparation
of anions whose shape and charge distribution prevents them from closely
approaching a cation. This will result in highly reactive cations, whose
properties will be evaluated. While there are implications to several areas of
chemistry, one of the most important is in the design of new catalysts for
several industrially important processes.
