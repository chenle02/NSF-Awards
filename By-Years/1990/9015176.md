The research focuses on two questions important to our understanding of the
dynamics of convection on the Sun: 1) Can the pattern of convection on the Sun's
surface be attributed to the depth variation of the specific heat of the fluid,
as its constituent gases become ionized? 2) How well can the nonlinear dynamics
of the observed convection be represented by a smaller model involving
interactions of only a few linear eigenmodes? These questions will be addressed
by a computer simulation involving code optimization for the parallel/vector
environment at the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility; and the construction
of a graphical interface for simulation data, which will provide a testing
ground for advancing the state of the art in scientific visualization. Special
emphasis will be given to: (a) incorporation of next-generation software for
interactive data rendering in three dimensions (b) creation of modular, high-
level (Unix/C) software tools that could be utilized by other researchers for
building interfaces, (c) operation of the interface over a network (with X
Windows).
