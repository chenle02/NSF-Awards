9626997 Olson The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (LACMNH) will
develop "Cats! Wild to Mild" a traveling exhibit on endangered wild and domestic
cats. This will be a 5000 sq. ft. exhibit intended to engage families, school
groups, and adults in the history, biology, and evolution of the family Felidae.
The primary objectives of the exhibit are to awaken interest in scientific study
in children, to provide parents and children with a stimulating interactive
environment, to increase public knowledge about the status and conservation of
wild cats, and to promote responsible pet care. The exhibit will include a large
number of mounted cat specimens and various interactive activities in addition
to label panels. A broad menu of complementary programming is planned, both for
use at LACMNH and by museums hosting the exhibit. Items and activities include:
teacher enhancement activities, curriculum guide, and other materials, pre-and
post-visit materials for students, family take-home materials, kits for teachers
and families, a CD-ROM and a place on the museum's WWW page with an extensive
amount of information about cats and activities for the user, among other
things. The formal education materials will be designed to integrate the study
of cats into state-mandated areas of the curriculum such as reading,
mathematics, and social studies. An audience that is specially targeted is the
traditionally underserved group. The exhibit will have a five year tour at
fifteen venues and will open at LACMNH early spring, 1997.
