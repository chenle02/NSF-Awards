The funding from NSF will provide partial participant support at several
workshops and working meetings of the Cyber Education Project (CEP). CEP goal is
to establish Cyber Science curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs and
to develop program criteria leading to Cyber Science program accreditation by
the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). At these planned
meetings, CEP group will solicit, develop, and refine learning outcomes from a
broad swath of cyber educators and industry supporters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
fostering dialogue among academia, the private sector, and government, the CEP
will promote and drive more-rapid maturation of Cybersecurity and Cyber Science
learning objectives, while significantly improving the collaboration among the
sectors that will operate, sustain, and employ the persons and technology that
underpin the essential core of the Nation?s critical infrastructure. The CEP
expects to see a significant increase in the number of students enrolling in
Cybersecurity and Cyber Science once such programs are established; stronger
partnerships between employers and academic institutions that find, educate, and
hire these candidates; and increased research activities to continue forward
progress on relevant hard problems.
