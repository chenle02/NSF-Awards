The Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI) program is part of the Quantum
Leap, one of the research Big Ideas promoted by the National Science Foundation.
This award is a QLCI Conceptualization Grant, which supports activities to build
capacity among teams planning for the large-scale, interdisciplinary Challenge
Institute projects that aim to advance the frontiers of quantum information
science and engineering. Research at these Institutes will span the focus areas
of quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum simulation, and/or
quantum sensing. The Institutes are expected to foster multidisciplinary
approaches to specific scientific, technological, and workforce development
goals in these fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Conceptualization Grant will
develop well-formulated plans for a future Challenge Institute proposal along
the themes of open quantum systems, new materials for quantum computing, quantum
sensing, quantum simulation, quantum optics, and quantum education
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
