The proposal seeks to enhance the teaching of science using Space Science as a
vehicle which is both appealing and inherently interdisciplinary. This three-
year program will train 120 middle school teachers from the Western
Massachusetts area in a model program which emphasizes a disciplinary approach
to the subject and the development of an ongoing support mechanism which will
enable teachers to work together in keeping their teaching current and insure a
long-term continuation of their educational process. The program consists of the
following components: (i) preliminary spring meetings; (ii) a 3-week summer
institute; (iii) an academic year follow-up program; (iv) support mechanisms
including a bulletin-board network, a part-time space science resource teacher
at the Children's Museum at Holyoke, and an academic alliance of middle school
science organized by the SPACENET alumni. An amount equivalent to 24.3% of the
NSF award is being contributed by the University of Massachusetts, Five
Colleges, and other sources.
