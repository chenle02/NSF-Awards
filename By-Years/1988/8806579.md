It is planned to increase the scope and availability of the computer graphical
approach for the study of molecular rotation- vibration dynamics. This involves
the use of rotational energy (RE) surfaces and leads to a number of
semiclassical quantization methods which use RE surface geometry to calculate
eigensolutions. It is necessary to implement the multiple surface graphics
technique on lower cost machines to permit interactive hands-on applications.
One set of projects will include a study of the simplest multi-sheet RE surface
problem: the asymmetric rotor coupled to a spin. This will subsequently lead to
nuclear spin coupling or superhyperfine structure analysis and to full vibration
rotation problems. A second set of projects will involve direct numerical
generation of RE surfaces from generic hamiltonians and ab initio force field
models.
