This research is to study deformation in a highly active thrust tectonic
setting, the Tien Shan region in Western China. Crustal shortening across the
range occurs largely by thrust faulting. The study will use classical geologic
mapping of surface structures to estimate amounts of shortening across the
range. Because Late Cenozoic sedimentary rocks are folded, bounds on the amounts
of shortening will yield bounds on the rates of deformation. Mapping the
geometry of deformed surface rocks will constrain models of the subsurface
shapes of the deeper faults. Knowledge gained here will be applied to thrust
deformation regimes in the U.S. such as the Transverse Ranges of Southern
California. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
