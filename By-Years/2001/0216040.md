This proposal provides funds for the purchase of a solid-state, frequency-
stabilized, single-mode cw laser system that will have several applications
within the context of an undergraduate research and education program. The laser
will be used to pump a 12 femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser for the research purpose
of probing and modifying collective motion of atoms in solids using shaped
pulses, ultra-short pulses, and optical control feedback techniques based on
genetic algorithms. The educational applications focus on optical trapping and
acceleration of particles via a laser-tweezer technique, interferometry, and
non-linear optics.
