9404700 BRAZEL Among the more important dimensions of environmental change is
the expansion of deserts. Although climatic factors are known to contribute to
desertification, the dynamics through which winds, precipitation, and
evapotranspiration affect the form and migration of sand dunes is not well
understood. This doctoral dissertation research project will model the
meteorological conditions that activate sand dunes in the Mojave Desert of
southern California. Photographic and written accounts of will be compared with
climatic records of wind speed and duration, precipitation, and potential
evapotranspiration to identify conditions leading to dune mobility. Using an
index of dune mobility developed in other locales, special attention will focus
on the ways that climatic changes as well as human activities, such as increased
use of off-road vehicles, affect vegetative cover that tends to stabilize dunes.
This project will contribute to new understandings in a number of ways. It will
advance knowledge about desert climatology and the influence of both climatic
and anthropogenic factors on landforms in arid regions. It will increase
understandings of aeolian geomorphology, and it will provide new insights into
the possible consequences of climatic change on the form and character of
deserts. As a doctoral dissertation improvement award, this award also will
provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent
research career.
