Two main concepts in Earth sciences are the scale of geologic time and the
magnitude of change possible when integrating over billions of years. Tied to
these ideas is the continuity of life through this great span of time. These
concepts are key to understanding the natural world around us and are necessary
to many aspects of a successful society, such as the generation of energy, the
location of natural resources, and the development of legislation that allows
for long-term social stability. Communication of these ideas to the broader US
population has been weak, resulting in poor understanding of the processes that
generate energy for society and ineffective and/or inefficient environmental
regulations. Thus the goal of this research experience is to expose students to
these central concepts of Earth history while also providing education about
career opportunities available to geoscientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each
student will be assigned a mentor who will guide them through a summer research
experience related to the interaction between Earth science and life. The
program will include a multi-day field trip designed to expose students to the
relationships between life and physical processes, and will present field work
in a form that is accessible and intellectually enriching. The program will
provide students with weekly professional development seminars and will follow
up with fall semester opportunities to engage with peers in research
presentations. Student recruiting will be targeted to freshmen and sophomores
from universities without stand-alone undergraduate Earth science programs and
from local community colleges, to broaden undergraduate exposure to the Earth
sciences. There are more than 100,000 community college students in the Houston
area and targeting Houston's community colleges will help increase the diversity
of the applicant pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
