Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. The acquisition of modern MS instrumentation is
essential for the prosecution of frontier research in several fields of
chemistry. The Department of Chemistry of the University of Missouri-St. Louis
will acquire a quadrupole mass spectrometer with the help of this award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program. The instrument will enhance research
in the following areas of chemistry in this PUI institution: 1) Isolation and
synthesis of natural products 2) Study of stabilized diradicals 3) Organic
oxidation chemistry 4) Synthesis and characterization of silicon short chains 5)
Characterization of novel probes of folate transport 6) Chemistry of
metallaboranes and organometallic complexes of palladium and platinum.
