This award provides funds to support graduate students and young researchers to
attend the conference Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy III, to be held
from July 18-21, 2001, at the Penssylvania State University, University Park,
PA. The primary focus of this cross-disciplinary conference is on applying
advanced statistical techniques for the analysis of observational data in
astronomy. One of the topics of the conference will be statistical methods for
extremely large data sets and information systems. Another topic is statistical
aspects of dealing with data resulting from the current revolution in
observational cosmology. The organizing committee and speakers represent both
communities and cross-disciplinary discussion is encouraged.
