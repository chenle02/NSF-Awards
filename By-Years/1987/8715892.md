The atmospheric processes that bring about the conversion of the gases of
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and organic compounds to water soluble acids
and salts are not well understood. Laboratory and field observations have
identified chemical processes that can affect and promote these transformations,
but the relative importance of the several oxidizing and catalytic systems
present in the atmosphere remains largely unknown. Attempts to understand the
relationships between gaseous emissions and remotely observed deposition of
their oxidation products are frustrated by this lack of knowledge about the
fundamental conversion processes occurring in nature. There is currently great
interest in clouds as potential "reaction chambers" for the oxidation of gases
into less volatile and water soluble compounds. Many fundamental aspects of
sulfur chemistry in the remote marine environment are especially poorly
understood. The principal goals of the research project are: 1) To measure
vertical distributions of sulfur dioxide and dimethylsulfide over the
Northeastern Pacific Ocean and to determine the primary factors responsible for
the observed distributions; and 2) To determine the relationships between
dimethylsulfide, sulfates, cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplet size
distributions in the remote marine environment. The first step in accomplishing
these goals will be the development and testing of instrumentation for airborne
studies of the sulfur chemistry in the marine atmosphere. Limited airborne
measurements over the Northeastern Pacific Ocean will be carried out over the
next two years. The results of these studies should add significantly to our
knowledge of sulfur in the marine environment and its role in global
tropospheric chemistry and climate.
