The PI proposes to develop a comprehensive model for thermal plasma arcs while
including flow and heat transfer to particles. A full 2-dimensional simulation
of the plasma on a macroscopic level will be developed while a separate but
linked microscopic model of the particles will be attempted. The PI claims that
"New Science" involving the details of the microscopic model for the particles
will be developed. This will include the consideration of non-spherical
particles and a Lagrangian formulation of the governing equations. Sophisticated
gridding techniques will be used for the particle interactions.
