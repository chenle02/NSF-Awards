9416297 Dixon This project connects two North Texas institutions to the Internet
over 56kbps lines. They are Texas Wesleyan University and the Dallas Education
Center. Faculty and students at the schools benefit from access to the resources
of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are
able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in
pursuit of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support
of the project for two years.
