This project is concerned with the design of a new Reformulation-Linearization
Technique (RLT) and the development of its application to various classes of
problems arising in production, location-allocation, economics, and various
engineering and systems design and operational contexts. At the heart of this
methodology is a procedure developed under a previous National Science
Foundation project for generating tight, higher dimensional, linear programming
representations for linear and polynomial zero-one mixed-integer programming
problems. The basic RLT procedure possesses a considerable degree flexibility
that can be exploited to develop effective algorithmic variants. Various
transformations and implementation schemes will be investigated in order to
enhance the capability in solving both discrete and continuous nonconvex
decision problems. The utility of the RLT scheme in generating facets and tight
valid inequalities for important discrete classes of problems will also be
explored. This will benefit other algorithms for mixed-integer zero-one
problems. The methodology developed will be specialized to solve indefinite and
concave quadratic programs, linear complementarily problems, location-allocation
problems, and fixed-charge problems that arise in the different aforementioned
applications.
