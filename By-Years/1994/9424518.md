9424518 Platz This grant supports a Joint US-Poland Workshop on Reactive
Intermediates to be held in Zakopane, Poland, 13-18 August 1995. The organizer
for the U.S. side is Dr. Matthew S. Platz of the Department of Chemistry of Ohio
State University. Fourteen U.S. scientists will participate. Professor Jerzy
Gebicki of the Technical University of Lodz is the organizer in Poland. Eight
senior Polish scientists and several junior Polish scientists will participate.
The workshop will bring together U.S. and Polish scientists with common
interests in the chemistry of reactive intermediates. The workshop will allow
focused, in-depth discussion of the chemistry of reactive intermediates. The
organizers anticipate the workshop will facilitate the development of new
research collaborations between U.S. and Polish scientists with common interest
in complementary expertise in organic synthesis, spectroscopy, kinetics, bio-
organic chemistry, and theory. This project in chemistry fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in
Poland and the United States to combine complementary talents and pool resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
