This project focuses on understanding stochastic spatial models in three
settings: chemical reactions, viral phages cooperating to attack bacteria, and
lesion formation from multiple sclerosis. Traditional modeling approaches often
omit randomness and heterogeneity. Such assumptions yield tractable equations
but sacrifice salient features of the processes being modeled. Stochastic
spatial models provide a more nuanced perspective. Exploring the theoretical
frontier will allow us to better harness their untapped potential. This project
synergistically incorporates research training for undergraduates, junior
researchers, and students who are incarcerated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is
limited understanding of annihilating and coalescing particle systems with
asymmetric diffusion rates. Objective One devises new methods, such as couplings
and multi-scale percolation constructions, to describe phase-transitions in
these systems. Objective Two involves cooperative infection dynamics in spatial
Susceptible-Infected models. The emergence of large-scale infections in these
models on sparse random graphs and integer lattices will be studied. Objective
Three proposes a new modeling paradigm for axon demyelination due to multiple
sclerosis. Variants of stochastic growth models such as internal diffusion-
limited aggregation and the Eden model will be utilized. The goal is to capture
aspects of inflammatory processes that damage the central nervous system by
studying the interplay between growth and suppression in these
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
