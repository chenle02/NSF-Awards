GER-9553623 Brown Aspiring scientists will be trained at the University of New
Mexico (UNM) to investigate questions of complexity, scale, and spatial and
temporal variation in ecological systems. These students will be recruited from
underrepresented groups and populations with unusual academic backgrounds. They
will be supported in their efforts to pursue individualized, multidisciplinary,
and collaborative thesis research projects through the provision of brad-minded
faculty advisors, theoretical and empirical training, and the mathematical,
statistical, and analytical tools they need to investigate a wide array of basic
and applied environmental problems. These students will augment the existing
pool of graduate students at UNM, many of who were drawn to UNM because of its
strong research programs in population and community ecology, landscape and
ecosystem ecology, biogeography, evolution, systematics, and behavior or due to
the opportunities provided by UNM's NSF- LTER program (Sevilleta station) and
multidisciplinary training opportunities among biologists and: a) computer
scientists at UNM who are developing state-of-the-art software for simulation
modeling, image analysis, and signal processing, and b) natural, social, and
computer scientists at the Santa Fe Institute who are studying complex systems.
