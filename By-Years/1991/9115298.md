This research is a study of the vertical magnetic structure of ocean crust
rocks collected by Ocean Drilling Program. Modified conventional magnetic survey
and inversion analysis techniques will be applied to vertical sections in
fracture zones. A high resolution magnetic survey will be carried out with a
submersible on the Blanco Scarp face to augment existing deep-tow magnetic data
from the area. Funds are provided to develop, test and apply the magnetic
analysis and inversion techniques to these data sets.
