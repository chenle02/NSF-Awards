This award will support collaborative research in applications of information
theory in statistics between Dr. D. V. Gokhale of the University of California,
Riverside and Dr. Ruben Klein of the Labratorio Nacional da Computacion
Cientifica (LNCC), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The specific areas are discrete data
analysis including contingency tables; design analysis of questionnaires;
approximations to density and distribution functions; and estimation of
parameters under specified constraints. A unique feature of the proposal is that
it will enable the interaction of several prominent researchers from the U.S.
and Brazil with expertise in information theory and statistics to continue an
on- going collaboration.
