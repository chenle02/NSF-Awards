With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa
will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer. Some of the
studies that will exploit this instrument include a) the structure of
intermediates upon photoionization of carotenoids in mesoporous molecular
sieves; b) formation of porous materials; c) ligand bridges on tetra-nuclear
chromium assemblies within the insulin-signaling chromodulin oligopeptide; and
d) interactions of the protein with electron transfer cofactors of Photosystem
I. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer
is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the
lifetimes of free radicals, which are often essential for the initiation of
tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, in particular biological chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
