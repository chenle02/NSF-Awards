Public policy and system engineering for cyber security depend on effective
techniques for assessing and comparing architectures, designs, algorithms,
protocols, implementations and performance within hostile and malicious
operating environments. This workshop is to advance a general approach to
predictive measurement for cyber security and information assurance based on
work factor analysis. Various frameworks for analysis will be adduced across
classes of algorithms, systems and architectures and application areas. The aim
of these frameworks include enabling market mechanisms for security based on
sound metrics, assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure against
nation-state threats, and evaluating the effectiveness of asymmetric cyber
operations against adaptive organizations.

This workshop will raise awareness across the many communities increasingly
involved with cybersecurity and will encourage greater participation in
discussion of critical issues at the intersection of public policies for
cybersecurity and science of security.
