9401950 Gordon In this project, the PIs will analyze, interpret, and publish an
extensive data set from the BEST (BEnguela Current Sources and Transport)
Experiment. Data from a moored array of current meters and Inverted Echo
Sounders (some with pressure sensors), and a CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-
Depth) survey will be used to study the transport of Indian Ocean water into the
Atlantic, and its mixing processes, particularly the formation and transport of
eddies. ***
