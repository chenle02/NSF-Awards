Under this award, Dr. Hogan will conduct three experiments in observational
cosmology. The first will be a search for cosmic deuterium in the absorption
spectra of distant quasars. The statistics of quasars are well enough understood
to make it possible to infer from such data how nucleosynthesis occurred during
the big bang. The second experiment will be a study with the Very Large Array of
small scale irregularities in the background radiation. This will enable the
investigators to put better experimental limits on theories of the formation of
cosmic structure. Finally, a long standing search for Lyman-alpha emission from
galaxies at very high redshift will be continued. Recent advances in technology
will permit interesting new limits to be placed on processes occurring during
the formation of the very first galaxies. Dr. Hogan, a leading young theorist,
has been very active in designing and performing observations to test critical
aspects of modern cosmological theories.
