9452308 Williams A computer interfaced isothermal titration calorimeter is used
as part of the laboratory in introductory biochemistry to improve the student
understanding of thermodynamic principles in biological molecules. The
calorimeter is also used to train biochemistry students in modern biochemical
research; mainly advanced study of the interactions between biological
macromolecules.
