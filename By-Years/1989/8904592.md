This award provides one-half of the funds required to purchase equipment items
needed to upgrade the Sedimentary Basins Research Facility in the Department of
Earth, Atmospheric & Planetary Sciences at MIT. The remaining funds required
will be provided by the institution. Equipment items included in the upgrade are
a microscope and a cathodoluminescence-fluorescence optical system. A
sedimentary basin is a site of pronounced sediment accumulation. Commonly,
sediments fill major depressions in the Earth's crust, producing deposits that
are 1-10 kilometers thick. Crustal subsidence on such scales occurs in a variety
of tectonic settings, ranging from tensional rifts and passive continental
margins to foreland regions associated with active compression. A major focus of
sedimentary basin studies at MIT is to identify and isolate basin formative
mechanisms so that basin history can be understood. The objectives of such
studies are to reach better understanding of basin evolution and to improve
knowledge of the processes (such as oil formation and migration) that operate at
deep levels in the basins.
