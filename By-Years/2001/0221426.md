This project will enhance a facility for calibration and testing of
seismometers. Specifically, the project will upgrade two existing, observatory-
class shake tables with new electronics and interferometric optical displacement
sensors. The facility will be made available to all qualified researchers in the
academic, government, and commercial sectors, and will be a invaluable community
resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
