The goal of this project is to holistically examine how complex mixtures of
gases react with sulfuric acid to form new particles and to develop a simple
framework and model for predicting this process. The new model will particle
formation on the basis of characteristics of the gaseous mixture, rather than a
complete set of chemical reactions. A complementary instrument will be developed
measure the potential of a mixture to form new particles as well. The
combination of this model and measurement suite will simplify representation of
particle formation in large scale atmospheric models in an affordable and robust
method. This will provide insights into particle formation - one of the greatest
uncertainties in existing atmospheric models. Particles formation impacts other
important processes including the transmission and absorption of light and cloud
formation and properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will directly support
a female junior faculty member, one graduate student, and the incorporation of
particle formation concepts into a series of atmospheric chemistry workshops for
elementary school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
