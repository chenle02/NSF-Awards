This award will provide partial support for participants from the US to attend
the International Conference on Powders and Grains to be held in Stuttgart,
Germany from July 18-22, 2005. This conference is held once every four years
(1989-France, 1993-England, 2001-USA) and brings together contributors from
physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. This conference's focus is on
the influence of the microscopic properties on macroscopic behavior of granular
media. Invited and contributed talks and posters to be presented are on a broad
spectrum of topics such as, Rapid Flow of grains, Vibrations and Waves in
Granular Materials, Mathematical Modeling, Nanoparticles as Granular Materials,
Soil Properties and Deformation, etc. The detailed program is available at the
website:http://www.ica1.uni-stuttgart.de/~pg2005/. Funds from this project will
be used to support the attendance of junior faculty, post-docs and graduate
students who will not otherwise be able to participate in the conference. The
selection process will be based on need and will seek to ensure participation
from a diverse group of researchers, especially those from under-represented
groups.
