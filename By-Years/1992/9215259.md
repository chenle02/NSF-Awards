Concurrent engineering strives to perform design activities simultaneously,
rather than in series as in the case of traditional design. This may result in
reduction of the duration of the design project, cost savings, and better
quality of the final design. The concurrent strategy, however, might increase
the complexity of the design process and make it more difficult to manage. The
aim of this research is to develop a methodology for management of the design
process in a concurrent engineering environment. The methodology includes the
development of a prototype system that will decompose and simplify the design
process and reduce the computational time of product development. Information
flow and organizational characteristics of complex design projects will also be
analyzed. The system includes a multi-agent architecture to model the concurrent
engineering environment, a negotiation model for conflict resolution and a
module to integrate product modularity concepts with the management of design
changes.
