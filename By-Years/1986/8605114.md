A computer will be acquired to support algorithm development and computer
calculations of genetic data. The computer will support studies aimed at
understanding the relationship between complex genetic loci, the efforts of
multiple alleles and pleiotropic action linkage analysis, and the influence of
environment on phenotypic expression of genotypes. On the whole, these studies
will improve our fundamental understanding of gene action.
