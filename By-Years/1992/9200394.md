This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award will support eight students
in a research program focusing on mathematical problems in graph theory. The
highly visual and intuitive nature of this subject makes it particularly
suitable for students just beginning research careers. There are many
opportunities for algorithmic thinking, computer experimentation and
combinatorial applications. Several graph theorists as well as other colloquium
speakers will visit during the research period as part of the scheduled
activities. Research topics include studies of how graph invariants determine
other invariants in product graphs, T-coloring of graphs, separation numbers of
graphs and determination of the orders of graph subtrees. Students are expected
to have an oral presentation ready at the end of the project. They will be
encouraged to prepare their results for submission to research journals. The
entire group will attend the Pi Mu Epsilon summer meeting at Miami University.
In addition to the principal investigator, two other faculty and two graduate
assistants will act as advisors.
