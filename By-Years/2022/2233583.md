The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project is enabling enhanced prediction of severe weather formation to a
timing resolution of hours instead of days. Improved weather predictions have a
significant impact on peopleâ€™s lives, allowing for better planning, proactive
evacuations, and reducing deaths, injuries and property damage, especially in
vulnerable populations. With climatologists predicting dramatic increases in
damaging and dangerous severe weather over the next decades, accurate prediction
of severe weather is even more critical. This project will launch a robotics-as-
a-service business around the technology which can rapidly reach sustainability,
generating economic impacts while providing significant environmental,
scientific, and societal benefits. As the technology matures and becomes more
widespread, entirely novel analysis and predictive models will be developed
around the data being produced, unlocking even higher value economic insights
for insurance, energy, financial, and transportation
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The part of the atmosphere from the
ground up to about 3,000 feet is called the atmospheric boundary layer. This
area is difficult to monitor but has a huge impact on gas, heat, and energy
exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. This project enables better
monitoring and understanding of this area, unlocking scientific, logistical, and
policy advancements that will drive new innovations in climate, environmental,
and weather science with high impact on humanity. The proposed technology
enables gathering high spatial and temporal resolution atmospheric data with a
swarm of synchronized sampling aircrafts. The swarm system will use lightweight
design approaches and proprietary optimization techniques for portability, swarm
capability, flight endurance, and low cost. Using automation and robotics,
including remote operational support, this project will enable data that can
potentially be deployed globally to be gathered in a scalable and low-cost
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
