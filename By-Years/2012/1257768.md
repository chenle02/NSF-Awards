Many animals communicate with members of their own species using specific
sounds. These vocalizations are behaviorally relevant to the animals because
they facilitate important behaviors such as mating, maintaining a territory, or
finding offspring on return from foraging. When an animal hears one of these
behaviorally relevant sounds, it must make an appropriate response based on the
information in the sound. To do this, the animal's auditory system must detect,
discriminate, and categorize each of the sounds.

The goal of this project is to understand how neurons in the auditory midbrain
achieve these tasks. The inferior colliculus is the first site in the ascending
auditory system where individual neurons respond selectively to vocalizations
but the mechanisms by which they do this are not well understood. Previously
recorded vocalizations that were emitted by male mice when they were interacting
with females will be presented as stimuli to female mice. Responses of
individual neurons in the inferior colliculus will be recorded before and after
pharmacological inactivation of inhibitory receptors to test the role of
inhibition in shaping responses to vocalizations.

The importance of this research is in understanding the ways in which the brain
has evolved to optimally respond to behaviorally relevant signals. This research
will increase the understanding of how sound perception helps animals survive. A
variety of broader impacts will result from this project, including training
opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. These students will be
trained in neurophysiological techniques and will learn quantitative techniques
through the groups active collaborations with mathematicians. This group of
collaborators will develop and assess a neuroscience curriculum for middle
school students, including units on acoustic communication, the auditory system
and hearing loss. Included in this curriculum will be the development and
assessment of alternative media methods, such as comics and graphic novels, for
teaching about neuroscience.
