The widespread belief that science and imaginative literature are "two
cultures," incommensurable ways to different kinds of knowledge, emerged in the
19th century, breaking up the Enlightenment dream if arts and sciences
harmoniously progressing as a joint guide to the perfection of humanity.
Professor Joravsky, in his analysis of major writers and scientists in France
and Russia from the 1860s to the early 20th century is attempting to explain the
emergent rift between literary and scientific culture. He is using a comparative
approach in order to bring out the interaction between ideas and social context.
He is illuminating the role of political ideologies by examining the
transformation of positivism from a visionary ideology to a limited philosophy
of science. He is paying special attention, in this regard, to the problem that
the literary imagination presents to those of positivist inclination. Prior to
beginning this grant, the Professor Joravsky has devoted his attention to the
French side of the comparison. During the course of this grant, he is
concentrating on the Russian side and is carrying the comparative study to the
mid-20th century.
