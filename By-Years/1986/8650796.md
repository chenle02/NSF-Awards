This project is designed to upgrade significantly the scientific equipment
available for teaching five laboratories in Eastern Washington University's new
Biotechnology Program -- Hybridomas and Monoclonal Antibodies, Plant Tissue
Culture and Differentiation, Recombinant DNA, Biochemistry and Fermentation, and
Metabolism. The award will effectively put the 1-1/2-year-old experimental
program onto sound footing as a permanent offering of the department. The
requested equipment includes state-of-the-art microscopes, ultracentrifuges, an
enzyme-linked immunoassay reader, fermentation apparatus, incubator, and a
biohazard safety cabinet. During its first eighteen months, the program has
attracted 20 majors and 178 other students. While still on a trial footing, it
has placed more than a dozen graduates into positions in the local bio-
technology industry.
