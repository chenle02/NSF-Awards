This CRPA award addresses the exciting contemporary chemical science that occurs
in interstellar space. The new interferometers coming online this year will
enhance this new area of science and further intrigue those who engage. The plan
in this award is to build an exhibit that will interest the audience with the
space-based aspects, but will also engage them in understanding the chemistry
that occurs in space. This is a collaborative effort between the University of
Virginia and the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The exhibit is relatively small facilitating
its mobility. Thus, the authors will travel the exhibit to smaller venues in
rural areas and embrace citizens who are typically under-served by educational
opportunities of ISE venues. The target audience is 12-15 year old
youths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clearly, this project is meant to engage the public
in both Space science and Chemistry with the ultimate hope that some individuals
will even think about careers in the joint science field that is emerging from
these types of behaviors.
