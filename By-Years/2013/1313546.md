Researchers have developed two point-of-use water treatment technologies that
can be used alone, or in combination. These ceramic based water purifiers can be
produced using local labor and materials in the developing world. The research
team has demonstrated social acceptance and technological efficacy in a
Guatemalan community as well as demonstrating human health benefits of the
technology for an HIVpositive human cohort in South Africa. Building on the
originally developed technology, the team has developed an additional point-of-
use technology that is roughly 3-5 times less expensive than the original
technology. The team has also developed particular expertise in the use of
silver nanotechnology as applied to the media used to create the original
technology and has developed an different, silver-ceramic point-of-use
technology that will be about 3-5 times less expensive than the original
technology. Researchers have developed a technique of applying silver to ceramic
porous media that does not require pre-synthesized silver nanoparticles. This
new technique has the potential to significantly reduce filter production costs
compared to current methods.

The team proposes to further specialize in creation of the two types of ceramic
point-of-use water purification technologies. The team is taking steps to create
infrastructure for production of these technologies in the U.S. as well as in
South Africa. The ceramic filters have a potential market in the U.S. for
households using well-water, as well as with disaster-relief agencies and the
U.S. Department of Defense for use in conflict areas where purified water may
not be readily accessible.
