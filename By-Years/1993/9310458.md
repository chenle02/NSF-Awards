9310458 Fisher This two year project will develop, implement and evaluate an
ethics education curriculum in introductory psychology. The curriculum will
provide the students with knowledge and skills which can help them identify
ethical issues in human subjects research, consider moral ambiguities which
arise within various experimental contexts and generate resolutions sensitive to
alternative ethical approaches to specific research designs. Classwork wiill
expose students to cases illustrating research methodologies of increasing
ethical complexity, in major areas of scientific inquiry in the field of
psychology. The case studies will provide students with experience in evaluating
the applicability of scientific norms and the Ethical Principles of the American
Psychological Association to a broad range of research problems. During the
first year of funding, instructional materials and evaluation techniques will be
developed and piloted, followed by a 2-day summer faculty workshop. During the
second year, the ethics education curriculum will be incorporated into
introductory psychology courses at Fordham and Loyola Universities. Evaluation
of the project will focus on faculty and student satisfaction with the clarity,
difficulty level, and relevance of the curriculum as well as knowledge and
skills in ethical reasoning gained by students. ***
