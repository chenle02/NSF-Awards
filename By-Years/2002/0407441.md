&lt;br/&gt;This project is studying the formation of brown dwarfs by
characterizing the initial mass distribution function of substellar objects. In
order to understand the properties of the substellar population and to test
theories of brown dwarf and star formation, two fundamental questions are being
addressed: (1) what is the lowest mass object which can form in isolation, and
(2) how does the substellar initial mass distribution vary with environment? Two
spectrophotometric surveys are tailored to these questions on the basis of the
unique spectral characteristics of substellar objects. The surveys look for the
presence of methane absorption, typical of young brown dwarfs of 0.2 Jupiter
masses, and for water absorption, present in the infrared spectra of all young
brown dwarfs, and they take advantage of a new generation of wide-field infrared
cameras with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and field of view. Thus
the substellar initial mass function is determined to much lower masses and over
a much wider range of environments compared to previous work. The program will
also produce a very populous sample of young brown dwarfs amenable for follow-up
studies.&lt;br/&gt;
