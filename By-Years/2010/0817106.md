Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Architecture students typically learn about
structural design elements in a traditional lecture setting without linkages to
the design studio. As a result, architecture students are unable to integrate
their technical knowledge into their building designs effectively. This project
is taking advantage of recent developments in multimedia computer technology and
is creating a set of computer-aided, web-based learning modules to teach
fundamental concepts in building structures to architecture students. Each
module is devoted to a long-span building system (either steel-framed systems,
truss systems, arches, or domes) and consists of two parts: an introduction and
system selection submodule, and an analysis, design, and visualization
submodule. The modules being developed through this project are improving the
technical education of architecture students by enhancing their ability to
integrate structural systems into their designs and by increasing their
understanding of technical content. Workshops and online courses are being
developed to disseminate the results of the project and to enable other
institutions to adopt the educational materials.
