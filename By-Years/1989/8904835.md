This research will integrate the fields of magnetostratigraphy, sedimentology,
biostratigraphy and structural geology to analyze a latest Cretaceous to early
Tertiary sedimentary basin, here termed the Axhandle Basin, that developed atop
an active thrust sheet in central Utah. The analysis will define the geometry,
sedimentation patterns and sedimentation rates of the basin during the time that
shortening occurred on the underlying thrust system. As a result, the timing and
shortening history of the thrust system may be interpreted and compared with
similarly well dated tectonic analyogues such as those in the Tertiary of the
Himalaya and Pyrenees. Understanding the tectonics and sedimentation of such
basins will aid the search for hydrocarbon resources.
