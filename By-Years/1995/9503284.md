This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
involves the continued study of the fundamentals of enhanced fluidity liquid
chromatography. Enhanced-fluid mobile phases are developed by adding large
portions of compressible fluids such as carbon dioxide to typical liquid
chromatography eluants at elevated temperatures. The result is the generation of
higher efficiency and faster separations similar to those exhibited in
supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Professor Susan Olesik and her
students at Ohio State University will characterize the macroscopic and
microscopic properties of enhanced fluid mixtures at various temperatures and
pressures using viscosity, density, diffusion coefficient, solvent strength, and
solute partial molar volume measurements. These solvent combinations will also
be applied in reverse-phase, normal-phase, and size exclusion chromatographies.
In addition, this technology will be used in the development of a novel
chromatographic technique coined `liquid adsorption critical chromatography`
(LACC), which is applied to the determination of polymer functional group
distribution. Liquid chromatography (LC) is one the most widely used analytical
methods in industry and during its advent supercritical fluid chromatography
(SFC) was thought capable of incorporating the power and applications of LC and
gas chromatography into one technique. However this was not found to be so, with
the major disadvantage being the poor ability of supercritical fluids to
dissolve polar analytes. Prof. Olesik has conceived of a new twist on the use of
supercritical fluids to yield mobile phases capable of dissolving a much wider
range of analytes with a significant enhancement in the efficiency and speed of
separations over that exhibited by the traditional liquid chromatographic
techniques.
