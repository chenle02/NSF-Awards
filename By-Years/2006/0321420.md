This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project combines large-
scale simulation of wave propagation phenomena with optimization. Simulation in
itself is seldom a final objective. Rather, simulation is usually a step in an
iterative process to solve the real problem, that could be the determination of
material properties from indirect measurements, imaging, parameter estimation or
optimal design, to name a few. All these problems share the need to couple a
large simulation package with an optimization one. This project will formalize
this concept and proceed to create a set of tools to facilitate this coupling in
the area of transient wave propagation phenomena, with special applications to
piezoelectric transducer design, oil exploration and production, and optimal and
protective structural design. These applications are chosen to exemplify the
usage of the toolbox and emphasize its generality. It will couple a wave
propagation finite element system and a system for 3D forward and inverse
geological modeling, with a number of optimization programs.

The target market for the proposed solution is small to medium sized companies
in need of a set of affordable design tools that will cover a number of
different classes of application areas which have been previously available only
to large firms. The results of this project will have a broad impact on a large
number of small and medium size industries that rely on Computer Aided Design
and Engineering to develop their products, accelerating and making more
efficient the process between product conception, production and market
introduction, key in a highly competitive world.
