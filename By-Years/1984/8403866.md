The synthesis of mechanisms is often based on the precision point approach, an
extremely accurate method that has been used successfully in the past. However,
the accuracy is not necessary nor attainable in real design. This research
utilizes an alternative technique, the selective precision synthesis technique,
whereby instead of precision conditions,realistic error envelopes are created
for the mechanism parameters, thusenabling the designer to specify the levels of
tolerance for the performance parameters. The method has been used successfully
for planar mechanisms and is extended to spatial (three-dimensional) mechanisms
in this project.
