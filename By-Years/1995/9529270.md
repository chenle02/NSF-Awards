Dr. Ciardullo will use imaging and spectroscopy of planetary nebulae in several
nearby galaxies to simultaneously address three important problems: (1) the
extragalactic distance scale; (2) the nature of dark matter halos; and (3) the
production rate of planetary nebulae and the relation of that rate to other
stellar population tracers.
