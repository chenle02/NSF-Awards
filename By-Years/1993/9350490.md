9350490 Moyer This proposal seeks funds to develop and produce a set of 12
instructional video-based units on key topic in the life science. The video
units are to be produced by The Educational Film Center in association with the
Montgomery County (MD) School System and are designed to enrich existing as well
as newly developing life science curricula. The units will provide a bridge for
teachers as they incorporate the new educational technology and modern cognitive
theory in their science reform curricula. The final products will consist of 12
video units both produced in laser disc-software and video cassette-print
formats and teacher support materials directed to middle school teachers. ***
