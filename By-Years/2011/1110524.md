The Lynch School of Education and the Urban Ecology Institute at Boston College
are partnering with the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) to develop,
test, evaluate and disseminate a year-long set of urban ecology course materials
for use in high school-level capstone science courses. The standards-based
materials emphasize locally-relevant field studies and incorporate principles of
Universal Design for Learning and Educative Curriculum. Other features include
(1) an on-line resource center that links to professional development resources,
(2) a student-written urban environment newspaper called "Green Times," and (3)
a writing support toolkit. Evaluation and research studies focus on measuring
effectiveness of the materials in promoting content understanding, self-efficacy
in science and inquiry abilities of students in urban high schools, particularly
those from underrepresented groups.
