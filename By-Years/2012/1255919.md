Pairing is a fundamental problem of establishing secure, i.e., authenticated and
confidential, connection between two previously unassociated devices over a
short-range wireless radio channel. Lack of prior security context or a common
trust infrastructure triggers the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks.
Addressing this threat necessitates user involvement in the device pairing
process. Despite extensive prior research, the pairing problem has not been duly
addressed so far. The fundamental difficulty stems from a complete lack of user
motivation in the pairing process, which leads to different forms of human
errors, undermining the overall security and/or usability of the process. This
project aims to address the problem of secure device pairing via playful user
engagement. First, it is investigating the use of a rewarding functionality
based on the principles of extrinsic motivation to improve the security and
usability of traditional device pairing mechanisms. Second, in order to make
secure device pairing fun and enjoyable, it is adopting computer games to
facilitate user involvement. In other words, the user would be asked to play a
simple game which accomplishes the pairing task as a side effect. Specifically,
a suite of playful solutions for device pairing are being designed and
prototyped in this project. The project is providing advanced mentoring to many
students as well as integrating the proposed research with ongoing security
curriculum, enabling participants to acquire rare skills at the intersection of
Human-Computer Interaction, and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace. It is also
facilitating outreach to high school and K-12 students, and minority
populations. The prototypes arising from this project have the potential to be
deployed in practice, making device pairing not only usable but also pleasurable
for day-to-day users.
