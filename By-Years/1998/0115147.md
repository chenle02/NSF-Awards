This project proposes a study of how firms search for and discover opportunities
to innovate. More specifically, the researchers seek to understand the role of
employee motivation in this process. Building on behavioral research on
individual-level innovativeness and search research on organizational-level
innovation, they ask how intrinsically-motivated employees search for
innovations, and how their process differs from that of extrinsically-motivated
employees. The project will also examine whether differences in motivation can
explain the occurrence of more radical innovations. Three topics are to be
examined:&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the characteristics and phases of the search and
discovery process?&lt;br/&gt;2. How and in what ways is motivation linked to the
search and discovery process?&lt;br/&gt;3. Can the search and discovery process
be outsourced?&lt;br/&gt;Two detailed case studies, a field study and laboratory
studies will be utilized to obtain important new multilevel, real-world evidence
of the search and discovery process, in contrast to much past individual-level
work on innovation which has been based primarily on laboratory studies. These
extensions of existing theory will help to establish the role of individual and
firm determinants of search and their interdependencies. This is the first study
that examines individual search processes related to intrinsic/extrinsic
motivation and resultant radicality of innovation. The study will also extend
inquiry beyond problem-solving to other significant, but less-researched phases
of the innovation search process, and provide evidence for how to select for and
motivate people in teams that target different types of innovations.&lt;br/&gt;
