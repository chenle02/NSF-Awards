In recent years, ecologists and other biologists have come to appreciate the
importance of physiological studies in understanding the distribution of
particular animal and plant species in nature. Such studies of plants, as well
as related genetic and systematic analyses, require well-controlled growth
facilities so that plants can be raised under reproducible conditions. The
ability to determine, and to alter at will, factors such as light intensity, day
length and temperature is crucial for investigation of the physiological and
morphological responses of plants to their environments. Beyond their use in
understanding ecology, studies of the effects of environmental factors can
eventually play an important role in the development of new and improved strains
of crop plants. The funds provided by this award will initiate the planning
phase of the construction of a research greenhouse at the University of Alaska
in Fairbanks. Costs of construction are to be assumed by the University. A
supplementary NSF award to provide environmental control systems for the
greenhouse and to provide plant growth chambers to be housed in the greenhouse
complex is anticipated. The University currently lacks adequate growth chamber
and greenhouse facilities, a major shortcoming of one of the few, if not only,
universities well- positioned for significant studies of Arctic and Subarctic
environments. Furthermore, construction of the greenhouse will improve the
quality of studies to be performed in collaboration with the Long Term
Ecological Research Site recently established near Fairbanks.
