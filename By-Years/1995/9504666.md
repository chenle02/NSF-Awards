Dr. Eric R. Bittner has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Bittner received his doctoral degree from the University of
Chicago under the supervision of Professor John Light. Dr. Bittner will continue
research at the Universityof Texas at Austin under the sponsorship of Professor
Peter Rossky. His postdoctoral research will target quantum simulations in
liquids. He will develop a dynamical description of transient quantum phase
coherences between a solvated system and its surrounding bath. Specifically, he
will examine the relaxation of an excited electron in water where relaxation of
the electron occurs as a series of non-adiabatic transitions from one electronic
state to another mediated by the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
for the nuclear motion of the solvent molecules. The work will contribute to the
development of a theory of coherent control of dynamics in a realistic chemical
condensed phase. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
