Between the Indian plate and Asia are several large blocks or terranes that may
have been accreted against Siberia during latest Paleozoic or Mesozoic time. One
of the larger of these, the Tarim block of western China, has been the focus of
a paleo- magnetic project to determine past positions relative to Asia by
development of an apparent polar wander curve (APW). This project will expand
this analysis to several blocks adjacent to the Tarim block in order to
determine the degree of allochtoniety and degree of similarity of their APWs to
Tarim. Results should help refine the Paleozoic and Mesozoic accretion history
of western China.
