The objective of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
project is to to understand the design practices of contemporary engineering
workplace and to understand how the design process is organized. A related
purpose is to understand how professional practices relate to nominally similar
practices in university engineering classes, and how any continuities and
discontinuities between work and school might inform efforts to design
engineering classes. These objectives are being accomplished through an
exploratory, comparative, field-based ethnographic study of the design practices
of professional engineers versus engineering students. Researchers are observing
practicing engineers in the workplace - what they do, who they communicate with,
what they say, and how they are organized. The results of the research will be
the documentation and analysis of these observations.

The primary benefits of this research come in two areas: First, current theories
of engineering design can be tested for validity against real data on what real
engineers do every day. Second, education of engineers can be enhanced by
preparing students more directly for what they will be doing in the workplace.
