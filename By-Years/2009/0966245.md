The University of Akron S-STEM program is providing scholarships to a single
cohort of students. While stipends are only provided for four years, a five-year
matriculation period was chosen to allow the students to include either a co-op
or internship appointment as part of their academic program. During their first
two years, the S-STEM scholars are participating in a learning community (LC).
Courses associated with the LC include: pre-calculus, analytical geometry-
calculus, principles of chemistry and a one-credit-hour discussion course.
During the summers following their freshman and sophomore years, S-STEM students
are being offered the opportunity to participate in a week-long laboratory and
team building retreat at The Wilds Conservation Center. During their junior
year, the S-STEM participants are meeting in a one-credit course to plan an
interdisciplinary team project, which will then be completed as a course project
during the students' senior year. To both leverage the university's research
expertise and to enable the cohorts to participate in a truly interdisciplinary
project, the senior project is in the area of bio-innovation or environmental
applications.
