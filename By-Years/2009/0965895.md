S-STEM scholarships are being awarded to two consecutive annual cohorts of 12
students who are interested in biology and chemistry. Because supportive social
networks are key factors in STEM retention, we are designing programs to support
STEM students from diverse backgrounds guided by two themes: 1) research
preparation and opportunity and 2) interdisciplinary connections. These programs
build on existing programs and incorporate new initiatives including a three-
week pre-college bridge program focused on data analysis; science advising
clusters; a new first-year interdisciplinary course emphasizing research
preparation and interdisciplinary communication; peer-led supplemental
instruction and group study; a new workshop series in Research Preparation and
Career Opportunities; expansion of our Summer Science Program; and attendance at
professional meetings by cohort members. This project is retaining students from
groups with traditionally low STEM retention rates, and thus is broadening
participation in STEM fields. By opening programs to the broader STEM community,
the S-STEM cohort's influence is strengthening the overall culture of the
institution's STEM students.
