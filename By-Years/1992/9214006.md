This award supports Professor Robert B. Gennis and a graduate student of the
University of Illinois to collaborate in biochemistry research with Professor
Marten Wikstrom and his research group at the Department of Medicinal Chemistry
of the University of Helsinki, Finland. The primary objective of their research
is to characterize the structural and functional details of the predominant
membrane- bound enzyme in Escherichia coli which catalyzes the oxidation of
ubiquinol and the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. This electron transfer
reaction is coupled to the net translocation of protons across the cell
membrane. The research plan involves a synergistic combination of molecular
genetics expertise in the U.S. group and biophysical and spectroscopic expertise
in the group in Finland. The type of oxidases being studied by these scientists
are a major family of enzymes directly involved in biological energy
transduction. The proposed research should provide the experimental basis for
understanding the architecture of these enzymes and the molecular basis of
proton translocation.
