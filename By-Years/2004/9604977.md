9604977 O'Day This Americas Program award will fund a 3-year cooperative
research project between Dr. Peter O'Day, University of Oregon, and Dr. Juan
Bacigalupo, University of Chile, on a study of the role of IP3-Receptor in
visual transduction, the orchestration of retinal biochemistry that generates
visual excitation. The investigators will focus on the question of how two
specific biochemical signaling pathways interact in visual transduction in
retinal cells from Drosophila. Whether direct interaction between the two
pathways is fundamental to transduction is an important question whose
examination may provide models for other transducing systems. The researchers
intend to use biophysical and biochemical approaches with mutational analysis to
examine the connection. The proposed work is important, not only for
understanding the biochemical orchestration of invertebrate visual transduction,
but also for bringing out some fundamental issues of signal transduction The
collaboration will facilitate the exchange of scientific information,
technologies, and strategies, thereby enhancing and broadening the experimental
approaches available for the long term programs of both groups. ***
