The University of New Mexico has an extremely high enrollment of
underrepresented minorities. Many of these students are majoring in the sciences
and are attempting to gain research experience but are finding it difficult
because of the lack of common-use resource facilities on campus. This proposal
requests funding to establish a laser scanning confocal microscopy facility.
Confocal microscopes provide a marked reduction in the out-of-focus haze that
tends to make many studies employing conventional flourescence microscopy
impossible to carry out. In addition, the thin optical sections produced by
confocal microscopy can be used in conjunction with computer reconstructions to
produce highly informative 3-D images. Such features make the confocal
microscope an extremely powerful research tool that is ideally suited for the
wide range from evolutionary/ecological studies to cellular/molecular
investigations, an in many cases, preliminary data are presented to demonstrate
the feasibility of these confocal analyses. The faculty members contributing to
this proposal have active research programs that involve numerous minority
undergraduate and graduate students. These students and other minority students
enrolled at the University of New Mexico would greatly benefit from having
access to a confocal microscope. Thus, the acquisition of the confocal
microscopy system requested in this proposal should significantly enhance the
training of minority students at out institution.
