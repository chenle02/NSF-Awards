9523050 Johnson This Academic Research Infrastructure (Development) Award is
made to partially fund the development of a Microstructure Analysis System using
electron backscatter patterns (EBSP). The new EBSP system will be used for
research in a variety of areas such as fracture initiation, recrystallization
and polyphase deformations. This system will permit the complete determination
of both the microstructure and local grain the complete determination of both
the microstructure and local grain orientations of polycrystalline materials
with a resolution on the order of microns. The basis of the EBSP technique is to
focus a narrow beam of electrons on a very small sample of the material and
probe this region to produce a pattern of light and dark bands known as the
Kikuchi pattern. The pattern can be identified and attributed to lattice plans
in the material. From this identification, the local crystal orientation is
determined. ***
