The mathematical problem of water wave concerns the motion of the interface
separating an inviscid, incompressible and irrotational fluid, under the
influence of gravity, from a region of zero density (i.e. air). It is assumed
that the surface tension is zero. In previous works, the PI established the
local in time well-posedness of the water wave problem in Sobolev spaces of
sufficient regularity. The focuses of this project are on the understanding of
the nonlinear effect, the effect of the bottom topography to the long time
behavior of the surface wave motions, and on finding some appropriate functional
space settings describing not so smooth water wave motions.

Water waves are one of our most familiar experiences in daily life. The causes
of phenomena such as the rogue waves and wave breaking are still subjects of
active research. Their understanding is of great importance to marine life and
oceanography. This project aims at providing some qualitative understanding of
water wave motion.
