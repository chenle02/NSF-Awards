A central question in biology is how the information encoded in a eukaryotic
genome is packaged and decoded. The goal of this research is to provide an
improved understanding of the structure of a eukaryotic chromosome, and how
chromosome structure influences genomic function. A broader outcome will be
development of public-domain educational software that will be freely available
students over the internet. This software represents an alternative to textbooks
for teaching the principles of protein and nucleic acid structure and function,
and has the potential to transform the way these topics are taught at the high
school and college level. In addition, the project will provide training in
research principles and fundamentals at the post-doctoral, doctoral, and
undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to understand the
relationship between chromatin fiber dynamics in vitro and interphase chromosome
structure in vivo. Model chromosomes will be assembled in vitro from pure
protein and DNA components and used to determine the factors that specify
chromosome structure and nucleosome-nucleosome packaging, including the core
histone N-terminal tail domains, the nucleosome acidic patch, linker DNA, and
chromosomal proteins. To obtain this information, the research will employ a
broad experimental toolbox, including fluorescence microscopy to measure
chromosome shape, analytical ultracentrifugation to measure chromosome size, and
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to measure nucleosome-nucleosome
packaging dynamics. The research is expected to yield data in support of a new,
transformative model of interphase chromosome structure and
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
