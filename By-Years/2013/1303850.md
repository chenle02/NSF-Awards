The 9th International Nanotechnology Conference on Communication and Cooperation
(INC9) will bring together renowned and technologically advanced thinkers to
exchange information and ideas with regards to nanotechnology. Specific topics
that will be emphasized in INC9 are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Bridge
to Medical Engineering: Bio-transistors, personal health and environmental
monitoring&lt;br/&gt;2) Flagship projects in Europe: Brain research, Graphene
Center, Large multidisciplinary centers &lt;br/&gt;3) Bridge to photonics: high
density optical interconnects and integrated silicon photonics&lt;br/&gt;4)
Bridge to Energy Efficiency: low energy electronics and lightning in Japan,
Europe and US&lt;br/&gt;5) Panel on innovation in
nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will provide a unique
opportunity for academics and industry leaders to interact on issues in
nanotechnology. In order to further strengthen the dialogue, leaders and policy
makers from a number of continents will join researchers from industry and
academia to hold discussions on a variety of efforts in nanosciences, along with
opportunities for collaboration. Young scientists will also be invited to
present posters highlighting their work.
