This project will investigate the role of androgenic steroid hormones, including
testosterone, on the structure and function of the brain region known as the
medial amygdala. This nucleus, which is part of the limbic system, is known to
play a role in reproductive behaviors and chemical senses such as olfaction and
detection of pheromones. The central question is how androgens affect the number
of neurons, the size of neurons and the synaptic connections between neurons in
the medial amygdala in both normal male rodents and genetically male rodents
with a dysfunctional gene for the androgen receptor. The project will employ
neuroanatomical and behavioral testing methodologies to probe the relationship
between changes in the brain and changes in behavior. Many of these changes may
be crucial for important transitions during puberty, when the brain must be
reorganized to mediate the onset of adult behavior. In recent years it has
become increasingly clear that this pubertal transition is a crucial period of
intense brain plasticity. Thus these studies are designed to enhance our
understanding of mammalian behavioral and endocrinological development and adult
function. The project will also provide outstanding training for undergraduate
and graduate students embarking on careers in the life sciences. In addition to
learning specific techniques, the students will also gain background knowledge
of basic endocrine mechanisms and training in the experimental logic of
hypothesis testing.
