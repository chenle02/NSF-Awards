9731274 Klentschy The Valle Imperial Project in Science (VIPS) Local Systemic
Change project represents a unified regional effort of 16 participating school
districts, the Imperial County Office of Education, and San Diego State
University to improve K-6 science instruction. Located on the California-Mexico
border, the Imperial Valley region experiences geographic isolation, poverty,
and limited access to science education training. However, the uniqueness of
this project is not in the magnitude of need, but in the capacity of the
districts to draw on local experience and science expertise to efficiently
transform this NSF supported effort into an independent, self-sustaining
program. The LSC is based on five essential elements: high quality curriculum,
sustained professional development, dependable material support, strong
administrative and community backing, and a comprehensive assessment and
evaluation plan. Inquiry based units from each of the major science disciplines
comprise the heart of the science program. Teachers receive a minimum of 100
hours support in the use of these materials, through intensive training on grade
level units, inquiry-based instruction of science content, and individual
classroom support. Institutes, symposiums, leadership training, and a graduate
degree program exemplify the advanced training component of the program. Student
assessment will focus on embedded unit clusters, end of unit performance tasks
and the evaluation of student notebooks. A regional network of science
professionals, educators, business leaders, and representatives of higher
education will provide collaborative and comprehensive governance for the entire
initiative.
