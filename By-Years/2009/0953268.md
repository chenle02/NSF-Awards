Recent trends are rapidly shifting developer and user expectations of
programming languages and application programs. Firstly, growing program
complexity is increasing the demand for higher-level programming languages.
Secondly, growing availability and accessibility of the Internet is driving the
demand for a portable distribution format for software, along with a safe and
secure runtime environment. High-level managed languages along with their
associated runtimes are ideally suited to deliver the features required for
future software systems. Managed language runtimes provide their features by
performing a number of auxiliary tasks during program execution. However, these
tasks often also interfere with normal program execution, create stalls, and
ultimately result in degrading program performance. As future applications
necessitate even more expensive features to improve speed and protect against
more sophisticated software attacks, the overhead of performing such inline
auxiliary tasks is likely to become prohibitive.

This research develops a new virtual machine framework to exploit the
opportunities provided by multiprocessor systems to effectively parallelize
inline auxiliary tasks, and enable unhindered execution of the main program
thread at runtime. The framework implements a novel parallelization model for
virtual machines to allow each auxiliary task to execute in its own thread, and
on a separate processing core. Each auxiliary thread is generated using program
slicing to only calculate the state necessary for its correct execution. Thus,
auxiliary threads execute independently, concurrently, and communicate their
results to the main thread before they are due. Relieved of the stalls caused by
the auxiliary tasks, the framework can allow accelerated program completion, and
support even more beneficial and expensive tasks for future programs.
