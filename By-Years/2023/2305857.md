The center of our Milky Way Galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole, known as Sgr
A*. The black hole is 4 million times the mass of the Sun. It was first
identified by radio emission from hot gas orbiting near it. The brightness of
the black hole regions changes on hourly time scales. Radio astronomers have
observed this variability for the last ten years. The goal of this project is to
use available data to look at the properties of the black hole. The investigator
will study the flow of material near the black hole where its brightness
changes. An important goal is measuring the direction the black hole rotates and
comparing it with the rotation direction of the entire Milky Way. The analysis
will measure the rotation axis by modeling the changes in the black hole over
the past 10 years. The investigator has initiated two public exhibits on radio
astronomy at Northwestern's main library. This exhibit will focus on the impact
of radio astronomy in our daily lives, the diversity of radio telescopes
throughout the globe, and artistic aspects of detailed radio images.

The investigator focuses on three topics related to the variability of Sgr A*.
One is to address the magnetic field orientation of optically thick variable
emission from Sgr A*. How does this angle relate to the spin axis of the
accretion flow and the large-scale jet-like feature. To address this issue,
full-Stokes analyses of adiabatically-expanding synchrotron hotspot will be
carried out. Second is to model simultaneous observations from NSFâ€™s Very Large
Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), to
characterize the intrinsic variability of Sgr A* by applying the adiabatic
expansion model. Using optical, infrared and radio light curves of Sgr A* the
investigator will determine the submm/radio spectrum and emission variability
across multiple flares. Third, archival VLA data taken with the VLA over the
last ten years will be used to address the nature of variability on longer-than-
hourly time scales. This study will determine the dynamics of the underlying
variability statistics on timescales up to a decade, in order to determine if
the physical parameters of hotspots have changed with time, informing the
history of the accretion flow.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
