Dr. Jonathan V. Sweedler has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Sweedler's doctoral degree was from the University of Arizona
under the supervision of Professor M. Bonner Denton. Dr. Sweedler intends to
continue research at Stanford University under the sponsorship of Richard Zare.
Dr. Sweedler's area of postdoctoral research will be development of a capillary
zone electrophoretic method capable of assaying the large number of aminoacids,
neurotrans- mitters and neuropeptides contained in single neurons. The
Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
