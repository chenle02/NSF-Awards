There is a great need for safe, energy efficient, on-site methods for the
decontamination of various chemical toxins. 99.8% of all polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) in current electrical applications are used as dielectric fluid
and amounts to about 30,000,000 gallons. The USEPA is reducing the risk of
exposure to PCBs by requiring the accelerated phaseout of PCB transformers but
there is presently no method available for the on-site treatment of PCBs and
there is no mild chemical method for their ultimate disposal. Envirocon Systems
has evaluated a novel PCB dechlorination method developed at the University of
Louisville and believes this method has potential utility for the detoxification
of transformer PCB fluids that presently represent a significant health hazard.
Currently the University of Louisville hydrogenation method uses expensive noble
metal catalysts but operates at room temperatures to achieve virtually complete
dehalogenation in minutes. We propose to work with the University of Louisville
group to systematically evaluate different catalysts, solvents and processes in
order to find a commercially feasible and mobile PCB treatment protocol. Among
the major advantages of the method is the avoidance of extreme conditions such
as high temperatures which, in the case of partial pyrolysis, leads to increased
production of dioxins and dibenzofurans.
