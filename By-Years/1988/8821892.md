This is a Phase II SBIR project. The Phase I proof-of-principle experiments
demonstrated the feasibility of a new fiber optic sensor designed to measure
dynamic high pressure. The sensor design incorporates an electroluminescent
emitter combined with a piezoelectric or ferroelectric current source. The Phase
II program will seek to optimize the sensor and improve the responsivity and
reproducibility. Optimization will begin with a survey of several potential
sensor materials. These will include some new materials as well as customized
fabrications of materials used in Phase I. Optimization will also include
improvements in the optical, electrical, and acoustical coupling between the
sensor components. The Phase II evaluation procedure will include detonation and
impact generated shock waves as well as the laser generated shock waves
predominently used in Phase I. These new shock wave sources will extend the test
pressure range up to 1 Mbar (100 GPa).
