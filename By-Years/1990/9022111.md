This is a proposal for the first U.S.-Taiwan joint workshop on photosynthesis.
This workshop is organized by Dr. Richard Dilley, Purdue University and Dr. R.
L. Pan, National Tsing Hua University supported by the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative
Science Program. The Cellular Biochemistry Program of the Division of Cellular
Biosciences has contributed $2,000 to support this joint workshop. This workshop
covers topics important to understand photosynthetic processes and provides an
opportunity for scientists to exchange and to advance the research in this
field. It provides a forum to plan future research programs related to
photosynthesis study in the subtropic island region of Asia and will increase
cooperative research activities in this field between US and Taiwan scientists.
