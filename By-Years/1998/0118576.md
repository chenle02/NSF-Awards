0118576&lt;br/&gt;Hemley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This twelve-month award will
provide support for15 US students and junior researchers to participate in the
first multidisciplinary summer school on "High Pressure Phenomena" held at the
Enrico Fermi International School of Physics in Varenna, Italy, from July 3-13,
2001. The course spans fundamental physics and chemistry, earth and planetary
science, materials science and technology, and biology. The PI will co-direct
this school with Guido Chiarotti of the International School for Advanced
Studies in Trieste, Italy. The course is largely financed by the Enrico Fermi
school, the Italian Society of Physics (SIF), Italy's National Research Council
(CNR), and UNESCO. At least 80 participants - students, observers, and lecturers
- are expected to attend. The course offers opportunities for graduate students
and post-doctoral fellows to learn many fundamental concepts applications of
high-pressure research. It provides as well the opportunity to develop further
international research experiences or collaborations in these fields.
