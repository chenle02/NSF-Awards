Symmetry plays an important role in geometry and topology and can best be
treated in systematic fashion through introduction of the theory of groups. The
existence and classification of finite groups of symmetries of manifolds of
dimensions less than five will be studied, with particular emphasis on group
actions on four-dimensional manifolds. Here breakthroughs by S. Donaldson and M.
Freedman in recent years have produced powerful new methods that opened up a
host of formerly inaccessible problems.
