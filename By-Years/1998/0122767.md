Scholarships are being awarded to 29 academically talented, low-income students
majoring in mathematics, computer science and eligible fields of engineering
technology. The program is providing faculty mentoring to all scholarship
recipients and tutoring to aid in the transition from high school to university
level studies. Special efforts are underway to aid the students in overcoming
the barrier presented by traditionally high attrition rate courses. Both
cooperative work programs and research participation are available to the
students.
