In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Jakob Magolan of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Idaho will develop a unique class of synthetic methods that rely
on the merger of heterogeneous catalysts and reagents with one-pot multi-step
approaches. Some of these methods will utilize site-isolation, a unique property
of insoluble reagents that enables the co-existence of seemingly incompatible
reactive sites (such as acids and bases) in the same reaction mixture. This
strategy, which remains largely unexplored by the synthetic community, will be
exploited to achieve unusual one-pot synthetic transformations. New tandem
concurrent heterogeneous catalysis strategies will be applied to a range of
chemical transformations including reductive amination, aromatic amination,
synthesis of 1,3-diketones, crossed aldols, and efficient preparation of several
common heterocyclic motifs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One pot multistep reactions
could have significant advantages in reducing waste generation and costs in
chemical synthesis, as they minimize the number of isolation steps that are
labor intensive and often generate a significant amount of waste solvents. Site
isolation can also lead to reactivities that are difficult to achieve. These
strategies are broadly applicable for use in the synthesis of a wide variety of
compounds that are of interests to the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural
industries. The development of green chemistry themed experiments utilizing
heterogeneous tools for use in undergraduate teaching laboratories is also
planned. This project will provide excellent training of graduate and
undergraduate students. Undergraduate summer research students will be recruited
from within the University of Idaho as well as various 4-year colleges across
the state. Efforts will be made to include students from minority groups that
are underrepresented in the sciences.
