The U.S. medical system faces an impending crisis: how to provide for the
medical needs of a rapidly aging population. This project will investigate new
technologies for "just-in-time" preventative health education in the home. Prior
work on using computer telephony to deliver health education and counseling to
people in their homes will be extended to mobile computing devices. Algorithms
will be investigated that passively and actively collect data from healthy users
of mobile computing devices and use that data to identify patterns of everyday
activity using probabilistic models. The activity of each person will be used to
present preventative health information and counseling at "teachable moments" --
the times when that information is most likely to impact the user's health-
related decision making. A prototype system for elderly individuals interested
in improving their exercise level and diet will be collaboratively developed by
technologists and medical professionals. A participatory design process will be
used to ensure the devices are easy to use, even for those who are not computer
literate. The prototype system will be evaluated in a small focus group study.
