Skeletons of massive corals are important recorders of climatic and
environmental change. Density bands in coral skeletons can be used as
chronometers much like tree rings, recording chemical information such as
variations in carbon and oxygen isotopes. In spite of the great interest and
importance of these features, little is known about how or why density bands
form, and about the precise relationships between environmental parameters,
coral physiology and the stable isoptope composition. This project will study
the control of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and density banding in coral
skeletons through carefully controlled laboratory experiments and routinely
monitored field colonies. In the laboratory corals will be grown using seven
different combinations of light and temperature. Conditions of growth such as
temperature, insolation, isotopic composition of the water, isotopic composition
of foods, and water composition will be continually measured. At the end of the
experiment skeletal growth will be analyzed for density patterns and carbon and
oxygen isotopes. Similar measurements will be made on a set of field colonies.
