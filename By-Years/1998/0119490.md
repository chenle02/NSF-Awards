The principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the mechanisms of tropical
cyclone (TC) initiation and their roles in the maintenance of synoptic
wavetrains observed in the Northwest Pacific. They hypothesize that the Rossby
wave energy dispersion from northwest moving TCs induces equatorward and
eastward synoptic wave disturbances. Through convective-circulation feedback,
these disturbances have the potential of forming new tropical cyclones and
repeating the cycle, thus maintaining the synoptic wavetrains. A three-
dimensional, high-resolution tropical cyclone model, developed by one of the
PIs, will be used to study this mechanism and related issues. An ocean model
will be coupled with the TC model to investigate the effects of ocean feedback.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planned research holds promise for resolving a long-
standing problem in tropical dynamics by identifying the processes responsible
for the coexistence of tropical cyclones and wave-like disturbances. Resolution
of the pertinent issues would expand our knowledge of tropical circulation
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
