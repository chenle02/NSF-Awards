Since the early 1960's, it is believed that the primary mechanism by which
steroid hormones exert their widespread effects is through the activation of the
genome. In hormone responsive cells, such as the brain, the steroids bind to
specific protein receptors. These steroid receptor complexes then bind to
acceptor sites in the nucleus to alter gene expression. However, the activation
of specific genes is too slow to account for some of the observed rapid
neurophysiological and behavioral responses to steroids. Recent evidence
indicates that the glucocorticoids, stress hormones of the adrenal, directly
modulate receptors for GABA, a neurotransmitter that is a potent inhibitor of
nerve cell activity. Moreover, Dr. Moore has demonstrated that these stress
hormones have a robust and rapid effect on behavior. The doctoral-dissertation
research of Miles Orchinik will determine whether the rapid behavioral changes
to stress hormones are mediated by their action on GABA receptors. Using
sophisticated state-of-the-art techniques, such as radioligand binding, ion flux
studies, and quantitative receptor autoradiography, these studies will advance
our understanding of how steroid hormones rapidly modify behaviors during
periods of stress.
