This planning grant gathers scientific community requirements for a set of
capabilities termed Scalable Data Analytics. The project investigates community
needs to support scientific discovery by providing an effective interface
between extant hardware resources, data sources and repositories, and system
software infrastructure. The proposed effort focuses on software environments
and tools for data acquisition, management, visualization, sharing, and analysis
for the working scientist, which can scale up to massively parallel and cloud
fabrics, but, crucially, which can as easily scale down to a single
laptop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software systems for data analytics are integral to
the fabric of scientific innovation. The ability to acquire, process, and
analyze large amounts of complex structured and unstructured data is at the core
of diverse disciplines. While scientists can exploit large repositories of
software tools optimized and refined over the years, significant new challenges
are posed by the rapidly evolving characteristics of scientific datasets. These
challenges are addressed by software systems that enable development of new
software incrementally, modification of existing methods, or techniques for
integrating pipelines of off-the-shelf components. For such application needs,
scientists increasingly rely on dynamic computer programming languages. These
languages facilitate interactive prototyping, support rapid development, and can
be embedded or used to manage complex scientific software pipelines.
