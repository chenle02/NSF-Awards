The equipment provided in this grant is for instrumentation of the design-
oriented undergraduate laboratories in power electronics. This laboratory
provides experience in subjects currently studied in the curriculum to be
studied or measured in the electronics laboratory. These deficiencies include
operating efficiencies of different types of linear and switching amplifiers,
component losses in power conversion circuits, and frequency domain
characteristics of closed-loop and open =-loop electronic and electro-mechanical
systems. The equipment provided stimulates and expands the design, measurement,
and analysis skills of students in the critical area of power electronics. The
institution is providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than
the funds provided by the Foundation.
