Reiter 9805507 Chaos and Crystallographic Symmetry Recent investigations have
led to illustrations of attractors arising from the iteration of functions that
are measurably chaotic but nonetheless have specified nontrivial symmetry. This
requires determination of classes of functions with suitable equivariance
properties along with searches for parameters yielding nontrivial behavior and
visualization techniques suited to the attractor. This investigation is designed
to advance that work to the crystallographic space groups. The classes of
equivariant functions need to be identified, nontrivial parameters located and
the attractors visualized. It is expected that viewing parameters can be changed
in real time at low resolution and fixed images and animations routinely created
at high resolution. This task is challenging and interesting because of the
mathematical complexity of the 230 crystallographic space groups and the
difficulties in rendering attractors in three dimensions in a manner in which
the symmetries are apparent. It is expected that this work will allow viewers to
experience the features of these symmetry groups in new ways. The general focus
of this project is to find and visualize certain complex mathematical objects in
three dimensions using a high performance workstation; the particular objects
are chaotic attractors with crystallographic symmetry. These mathematical
objects have an underlying chaotic structure while at the same time exhibiting a
high degree of symmetry. The symmetries which will be considered are those
associated with crystals; these symmetries have been of great interest to
chemists for that reason. Similar two dimensional objects have been the subject
of considerable recent study by mathematicians and this project is designed to
extend our understanding of objects of this type to three dimensions. A graphics
workstation with massive memory will be used to create high quality images of
these complex objects. Sin ce these complex objects are the result of literally
millions or billions of data points, creating insightful, meaningful visual
representations of the data is essential to understanding them. The high level
visualization techniques and the resulting insights into the three dimensional
symmetries of these objects should be of interest to mathematicians and others,
like chemists, who can benefit from understanding these symmetry groups. The
project is designed to fully involve several undergraduate students in the
research and hence these students will not only gain valuable experience with
using this high performance workstation but they should also be among the first
to view these symmetry groups in the new ways resulting from this research
project.
