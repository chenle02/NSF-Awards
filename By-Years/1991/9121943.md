The research under this project is to develop improved procedures for the
earthquake analysis and design of concrete dams, an important component of the
national infrastructure system for supply of water and power. The research
addresses some of the most important issues that need to be resolved: (1)
consideration of spatial variations in the earthquake input around the canyon
and their influence on arch dam response; (2) rigorous treatment of dam-
foundation rock interaction in analyzing arch dames; (3) computation of
earthquake-induced sliding and rocking displacements of a gravity- dam monolith,
and the development of improved criteria for overturning and sliding stability;
and (4) improved modeling of water- sediment rock interaction. Analytical
procedures and computer software will be developed and a systematic series of
analyses will be performed to develop a fundamental understanding of the
significance of various factors influencing the earthquake response of concrete
dams. The developments and results expected from this investigation will enable
better evaluation of the response of concrete dams to earthquake ground motion,
thus improving the capability to assess the safety of existing structures and of
designs proposed for structures to be constructed.
