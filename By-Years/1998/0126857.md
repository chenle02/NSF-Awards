Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing access for two
community colleges to the 300 MHz NMR spectrometer on the campus of the State
University of New York New Paltz. Students in the community colleges are now
being introduced to NMR techniques in their sophomore-level organic chemistry
class. The techniques learned at this level are then expanded in advanced
chemistry courses when they transfer to a four-year institution. Students at the
collaborating institutions, Dutchess County Community College and Ulster County
Community College, did not previously have access to an NMR spectrometer and the
community colleges were not likely to have the resources to purchase and
maintain a high-field instrument. Thus, students taking organic chemistry at
these institutions were not exposed to experimental NMR spectroscopy in their
curriculum and this presented an additional barrier for them to overcome when
they transferred into a Bachelor program. This project is adapted from the
collaborative programs at James Madison University, Rider University, and
Indiana University. An autosampler is installed on the 300 MHz NMR spectrometer
at SUNY New Paltz. Silicon Graphics Workstations equipped with the compatible
NMR operating software is installed on the community college campuses. Samples
are transported to New Paltz, loaded into the NMR autosampler, and students at
the community colleges are then be able to control the NMR spectrometer in real
time over the internet. The project also includes initial and ongoing training
by the Project Coordinator of the students and faculty at the community colleges
in NMR theory and the operation of the spectrometer.&lt;br/&gt;
