A research program in theoretical astrophysics and gravitational physics will
be initiated. This research will be pursued using both analytic and numerical
methods. In some cases, observations will be made to compare theoretical
predictions with the behavior of real astronomical systems of interest. The
topics to be investigated include: a) generation of gravitational radiation in
stellar collapsed and collision b) tidal disruption of stars by massive black
holes c) magnetized stellar winds d) the eclipsing millisecond pulsar (PSR 1957
+ 20).
