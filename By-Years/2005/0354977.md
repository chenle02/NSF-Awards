This experimental research program is aimed at continuing the advancement of
atom optics with explorations of new atom-manipulation methods and potential
applications, and with new studies of nonlinear physical phenomena. Quasi-two-
dimensional BECs held in optical potentials will be used in three main
experiments. In one experiment, quantum point contacts for matter waves will be
studied. Using the wide range of configurations afforded by laser light in the
creation of atomic potentials, an array of channels for the transport of atoms
between two spatially distinct regions will be constructed. The quantum-
mechanical nature of these channels will be experimentally characterized,
leading to potentially significant and practical atom optics developments. In a
second experiment, a quantum state engineering technique analogous to the
optical Guoy-phase mode converter will be developed for matter waves. Finally,
ring-shaped dark solitons and their modulational instabilities will be studied.
The broader impact of the program is in the education of optics graduate
students.
