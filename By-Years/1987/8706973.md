Strictness analysis deals with the question: given divergent term M, when is
term NM divergent? It has been shown that, in a higher- order functional
language, strictness properties of terms can be viewed as a collection of
"strictness types" possessed by terms. This project explores the contention that
strictness analysis may profitably be considered a form of type inference. The
primary research goal is to investigate aspects of strictness in a higher-order
functional language, including the following: (a) type-theoretic
characterization of strictness, (b) completeness of inference rules for
strictness analysis (c) inherent complexity of strictness analysis, (d)
efficient algorithms that combine type checking and strictness analysis, (e)
polymorphic invariance and strictness analysis. These are two secondary research
goals: (i) development of programming tools for the analysis, and, direct
execution, of inference rules, (ii) investigation of other program analysis
problems, including those of structure strictness analysis and permutativity
analysis.
