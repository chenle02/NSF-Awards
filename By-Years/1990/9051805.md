The objective of this project is to enhance selected courses in the engineering
technology, engineering transfer, and technology curriculum by utilizing
materials inspection and analysis and testing equipment that directly interfaces
with computer-assisted data acquisition hardware and software. Data obtained
through traditional materials testing and electronic image analysis is used to
identify correlations present, and draw conclusions based on the comparison of
electronic graphic characteristics and physical and mechanical properties of
selected materials. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
