This project will test the configuration of an improved isotope detector system
for measuring trace levels of noble gas atoms such as krypton in samples where
isotopic analyses can be used for age dating and other environmental and medical
applications. The new detector system to be tested is novel because it captures
the trace atoms by implanting them in silicon or germanium targets and then
releases them by means of laser annealing for subsequent mass spectrometry. The
tests will determine if non.selective ionization during the laser annealing
process can interfere with the mass spectrometry measurements. If this Phase I
project in the Small Business Innovation Research program is successful, a
krypton counting system can be configured in Phase II and would have
applications in areas of research such as polar ice cap dating, groundwater
transport and solar neutrino experiments.
