This research, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program, uses
nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to obtain experimental information on the
angle-dependent interaction between molecules by making measurements of nuclear
spin relaxation times in dilute mixtures of gases. These measurements will
provide directly the cross sections for transfer of rotational angular momentum.
The molecules to be studied are important constituents in the atmosphere, the
interstellar medium, flame systems and infrared lasers. In addition to the gas
phase studies, changes in chemical shifts and the relaxation times due to
collisions with paramagnetic species will be studied. Platinum atoms and
paramagnetic transition metal complexes on solid supports will provide the
paramagnetic centers. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of mobile species on
zeolites and other classes of molecular sieves will also be attempted.
