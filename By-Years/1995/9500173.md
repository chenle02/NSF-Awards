9500173 Calvin One of the objectives of this research is to compare different
algorithms for global optimization problems using an average performance
criteria. Several classes of functions are considered, including smooth
functions and non-differentiable continuous functions. The set of functions is
endowed with a probability measure and the expected performance with respect to
the given probability distribution of different algorithms are compared. This
average performance can be traded off with the computational requirements of the
algorithms. A range of algorithms is considered, from simple ones that choose
the observations on a fixed grid of points to complex methods that choose each
site to maximize some functional of all previous observations. A second
objective of the research is to develop efficient algorithms for global
optimization, where efficiency is measured in terms of average performance. The
outcome of this research will serve several purposes. First, it will fill a void
in global optimization studies. The void is the proliferation of algorithms with
no systematic methods of assessing their performance quality. This research will
provide a characterization of global optimization algorithms. Second, the
knowledge gained from the results of the algorithmic performance quality will
help identify areas where additional work is needed. Third, by benchmarking the
algorithms, the current state of research advancement in global optimization can
be characterized. This characterization is necessary in projecting future
research directions in the area. Fourth, the research will also help to validate
and invalidate some of the assumptions made in developing global optimization
algorithms. Finally, the outcome of the research will provide some insights in
choosing the techniques and algorithms to solve problems with certain structures
and characteristics. The insights gained can translate into savings in time and
resources by researchers from better problem understanding and savings in time
and cost due to misapplications of algorithms. .
