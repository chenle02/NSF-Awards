This proposal outlined a combined theoretical and experimental program of
atomic-scale studies of ferroelectric ceramic materials, such as lead zirconium
titanate (PZT) and tin-doped compounds (PSZT). 17O NMR/NQR measurements will
determine electric field gradients as a microscopic probe of the local
electronic structure. Electronic structure calculations in the framework of
Local Density theory will be used to help interpret these measurements. The
influence of doping on the ferroelectric to antiferroelectric transition will be
investigated. %%%% This proposal combines the theoretical and experiemtnal
studies to investigate the effect of doping on ferroelectrics such as PZT and
PSZT. Local electronic structure will be carefully studied. Electric field
gradients as measured from NMR/NQR measurements will be interpreted with the
help of calculations from the Local Desity theory.
