9453116 Saltman This Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement project
is the result of a collaboration between the National School District and the
University of California, San Diego (USCD). The project will combine the
resources of the school district, USCD, private industry, and the community to
institute and support an integrated, inquiry-based, hands-on science curriculum
in all National City elementary schools. The curriculum to be implemented will
include NSF funded FOSS and EDC-Insights materials as instructional modules for
grades K-6. Each year 60 lead teachers will attend a four week inservice
program. The institute will be held in conjunction with a district wide summer
enrichment program that will allow a practicum for the lead teachers. The summer
leadership institute will be staffed by university scientists, science
educators, and master teachers from a previous NSF funded project. Parent and
community members will be enlisted to assist in both managing and maintaining
the instructional materials. This cadre of 60 lead teachers will form a science
leadership team at each school site to oversee continuing science education
reform. They will provide full day staff development programs and weekly school
year selected inservice programs for 350 participants. Staff and parent
volunteers will attend six Saturday academic year sessions and receive
university extension credit from UCSD for their participation. Cost sharing is
31% of the total NSF requested budget. ***
