The Herpetology Collection in the California Academy of Sciences includes more
than 220,000 specimens and 5,000 type specimens, and has representatives of more
than half of the world's known amphibian and reptile species. The entire
collection has been entered into a computer database that is actively used for
managing the collection and for supporting specimen-based research. Dr. Alan
Leviton, Curator in charge of the collection, proposes final validation of the
database against the original label data, and installation of new storage
equipment for the growing collections of frozen tissues, dried skeletons, and
whole specimens in alcohol. The proposed curatorial projects will make the
collections more accessible and usable to the research community. Final
verification of the collection database will provide investigators with reliable
information about which specimens are available for loan and study. The database
will also provide the curators with background data for important decisions
regarding collecting expeditions, donated and orphaned collections, and specimen
exchange requests.
