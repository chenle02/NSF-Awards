This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Schey's Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at the Medical
University of South Carolina. The thrust of Dr. Schey's research is the
development and construction of a versatile time-of-flight mass spectrometer and
its application to the analysis of very large molecules of biological interest.
A versatile, tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be constructed which
is ideally suited to produce structural information on very large molecules.
Ionization by matrix- assisted infrared laser desorption and broadband emission
from a point source flashlamp will be investigated to improve ionization
efficiency for biomolecules. Photodissociation by both CO2 laser and flashlamp
emission will be explored as a means to characterize the structure of large
biomolecules. The ability of surface induced dissociation to generate
structurally important fragmentation will be evaluated.
