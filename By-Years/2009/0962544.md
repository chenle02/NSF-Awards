This project will investigate several research topics on the effects of plasma
and neutral gas transport processes on the ionosphere and surrounding regions.
The methodology is based on time-dependent, high-resolution, physics-based
theoretical and assimilative models in addition to auxiliary data from ground-
based radars and magnetometers, particularly the Poker Flat (PFISR) and Resolute
Bay (RISR) incoherent scatter radars. The scientific problems under
investigation pertain to the ionosphere, thermosphere, exosphere, plasmasphere,
polar wind, and to coupling mechanisms relevant to these regions. A focused goal
of the project is to better understand the effect of mesoscale plasma structures
on global-scale flows using ensemble Kalman filtering of high-latitude
ionospheric electrodynamical variables. Other specific topics include: the
atmospheric response to the recent extreme solar cycle phase minimum and to
sporadic space weather events; the generation and evolution of ionospheric
disturbances; and the climatology of atmospheric waves.
