This action supports an ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM)
for research, education, and training in nanoscience and biotechnology. Twenty
faculty from Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Pharmacy, Electrical and Computer
Engineering, and Mechanical, Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering will use
the instrument to carry out research on several projects. Research areas include
bacterial biofilms, microbial diversity in marine environments, protozoan
biochemistry and metabolism, nanostructures in spintronic materials, collective
electrodynamics of nanostructured oxides and borides, metal-insulator transition
in two-dimensional semiconductors, novel green routes to the synthesis of
conducting polymers, chemical vapor deposition of metals, and structure-property
relations of thin films for electronic applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
SEM will facilitate research programs that are supported by awards from several
Federal agencies: NSF, AFOSR, ONR, DOE, NIH, as well as from industrial
companies and private foundations. The instrument will catalyze new
interdisciplinary collaborations in nanoscience and biotechnology. The SEM will
be integrated into interdisciplinary graduate courses in nanotechnology and
biotechnology offered by several departments. It will be used in undergraduate
laboratory courses, undergraduate projects and co-op internships. The SEM will
be integrated into the "Building Bridges" and the ACS Project SEED outreach
programs for middle and high school students, and the Connections. Program for
women and underrepresented populations. &lt;br/&gt;
