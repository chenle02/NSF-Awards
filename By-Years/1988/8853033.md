A comprehensive state-of-the-art electrochemical instrument is being acquired to
allow hands-on experience in teaching young student scientists basic
electroanalytical chemical instrumental methods of analysis such as
polarography, pulse polarography, stripping voltammetry, and cyclic voltammetry.
The system includes a control unit, a static mercury drop electrode unit and a
digital plotter. The instrument is being used each year by 80 students in five
undergraduate courses which serve chemistry majors. Direct experience with up-
to- date scientific equipment is essential to modern science. It is anticipated
that better trained scientists entering graduate and professional schools and
beginning professional science careers will result. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
