NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden
participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering. The
fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the
future. This fellowship to Theresa McHugh includes a research plan that
investigates water vapor adsorption in the microbial ecology in dryland soil.
The host institution for the research is U.S. Geological Survey, Southwest
Biological Science Center, Moab, Utah, where the sponsoring scientist is Sasha
Reed. Research results are being used in an established education program in
Moab called "Guiding Science: Communicating Colorado Plateau Science to
Recreational Guides," for regional guides who interact with tens of thousands of
tourists each year. The host institution for a teaching component of the
fellowship is Western Washington University, Bellingham, Washington, and the
sponsoring scientist is Deborah Donovan. The teaching component involves faculty
members from Northwest Indian College and Bellingham Technical College to
incorporate a reformed biology curriculum centered on inquiry-based activities.

Water is fundamental for life, and the structure and function of arid and semi-
arid ecosystems are more strongly controlled by the availability of water than
any other biome. While dryland ecosystems obtain water from sources other than
precipitation, very little is known about how liquid water supplied to dryland
soils via water vapor adsorption (also called "non-rainfall" water) helps
regulate dryland communities and their activity. During times when the soil is
drier than the overlying air, atmospheric water vapor can be captured or
adsorbed by the soil, subsequently forming liquid water within soil. Although
this phenomenon can occur quite regularly in regions throughout the world, it
remains a relatively unexplored area. This research investigates water vapor
adsorption as a critical source of water for dryland microorganisms using a
series of field and lab studies in the arid Southwest.
