The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology using
amino acids as starting materials for the synthesis of cell-surface
carbohydrates, and the mechanism-based inhibitors of carbohydrate processing
enzymes. Targets include aza-sugars, indolizidine and pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
Current methods will be extended to produce fucolipid biosynthesis inhibitors
and complex alkaloids such as lycoricidine. Also, Schiff bases will be used to
produce aza-C-glycoside, UDP-galactose and GDP-fucose analogs to serve as
glycosyltransferase inhibitors. Schiff bases will also be used to synthesize
optically pure C2-symmetric chiral ligands, ligands that have potential for use
in asymmetric, metal catalyzed epoxidations. With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robin L. Polt of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona. Professor Polt will focus
his research on the synthesis of glycosidase and glycotransferase inhibitors.
These inhibitors are important for the study of the biosynthesis of cell-surface
carbohydrates.
