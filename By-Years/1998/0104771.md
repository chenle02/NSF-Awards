provide funds to offset participant costs for the Geological Society of America
(GSA) Penrose Conference entitled "Longevity and Dynamics of Large Silicic
Systems" that will be held at Mammoth Lakes, California on June 14-21, 2001. The
funds will be used to provide support for travel and registration of students
and early-career researchers that will be selected on the basis of need. The
applicants for those funds will be asked to provide a curriculum vitae, a poster
title for a presentation at the meeting, and a statement of financial need. The
results of the conference will be published on GSA Today and posted on the GSA
web site.&lt;br/&gt;
