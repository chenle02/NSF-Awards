The highly productive Peru upwelling system is regularly perturbed by periodic
El Nino-Southern Oscillation events that result in warmer-than-average sea
surface temperatures and a sharp reduction in the reduction in the region's
productivity. An historical record of El Nino in Peru Margin sediments has been
derived from the distribution of alkenones and Uk37 as proxy for paleo-sea
surface temperature. This research will enhance and expand on these results with
a more detailed study of Peru sediments extending over 500 ybp. The initial
focus of the study will be to deconvolute diagenetic and input driven changes in
the sedimentary record of chlorins and carotenoids. By measuring the
distribution of both pigments (carotenoids, chlorins) and their degradation
products (loliolides, pyrroles), transient changes in depositional conditions
will be able to be identified. This information will be combined with data from
the total pigment in sediment expressed as the molar sum: (pigment + degradation
product), to measure changes in original input. Changes in hydrography preserved
in the alkenone record with expected changes in the nature and intensity of
primary production preserved in the record of algal pigments in sediments will
then be compared.
