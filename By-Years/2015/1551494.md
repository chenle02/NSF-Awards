The investigators will advance the goals of the Institute for Scientist &amp;
Engineer Educators (ISEE) through inputs gained at the planned workshop, with
the theme "Building Institutional Capacity". The ISEE is piloting new Chapters
to expand beyond the University of California, Santa Cruz, where ISEE is
headquartered. This expansion has been driven by the impact of ISEE's programs
and by ISEE alumni's enthusiasm for staying connected to a community that values
education and mentoring efforts. ISEE alumni from institutions across the U.S.
will share ideas about the challenges and important positive steps needed to
build influence toward inclusive teaching and mentoring at their home
institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommendations from this workshop will be
applicable beyond ISEE and collaborating institutions, to the astronomy
community in general. The recommendations from this workshop will contribute to
an expanded plan for leaders in astronomy, and related fields, to engage with a
more diverse community of scientists.
