"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with
retrieval of information contained in the tables, figures and references
contained in digital document on the web. At present a large amount of
information present in tables and figures in documents is not easy accessible by
automated methods. End-users cannot confidently pose a query and retrieve data
presented in tables and figures in documents directly through a search engine.
While there has been substantial research on table boundary detection and some
research on table content extraction, none of these methods tried to identify
the data and segregate it from the metadata present in the tables and figures
which would represent a significant step forward. The research goal of this
proposal is to make fundamental contributions in digital document processing and
information retrieval. The objective is to identify data clearly, separate it
from the metadata automatically, and store in a digital repository. An end-user
will then be able to effectively query and retrieve datasets or their
interesting parts.
