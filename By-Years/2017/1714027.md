Hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs. Graphs comprise of edges connecting
two vertices, while hypergraphs consist of edges connecting any number of
vertices. Hypergraphs appear in a wide range of applications, where the edges
model relationships between vertices. An example is a social network, where the
edges represent clubs, and vertices represent people. Cuts are objects that
capture how tightly connected a hypergraph is. This project will consider faster
algorithms for various problems involving hypergraphs cuts. This research will
be conducted at the National Institute of Informatics, Japan, in collaboration
with Professor Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi, an expert in graph theory and graph
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hypergraphs can be dense, therefore, processing
the hypergraph incurs substantial cost in both space and time. Finding a sparse
hypergraph that approximates all the cuts allows one to use the sparse
hypergraph in place of the original hypergraph, which might be much faster.
Finding sparse approximation of cuts on graphs has been resolved. For
hypergraphs, similar developments are on the mathematical side. However, the
algorithms are not efficient. Currently, finding a sparse approximation might
take more time than it is worth. This project will generalize the graph
techniques to hypergraphs, and lead to faster algorithms. The project will also
explore characterizations of hypergraph cuts, including answering questions on
uniqueness and recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia
and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S.
graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the
Promotion of Science.
