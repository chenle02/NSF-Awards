A strong discordance exists between displacement estimates for Cordilleran
tectonic terranes inferred from paleomagnetic studies as opposed to geologic
studies. Existing paleomagnetic data from southern Alaska suggest large
northward displacements of the Chugach-Prince William (CPW) terrane with respect
to the southern Alaska terrane since the lower Tertiary, but geologic evidence
suggests the two terranes were juxtaposed in early Tertiary time. However, the
paleomagnetic data base for the CPW terrane is small and highly variable and may
therefore be unreliable. This study will resolve the discrepancy by detailed
paleomagnetic analysis of a suite of ophiolitic and dike rocks already obtained
from the Kenai Peninsula and Knight-Island. The results will clarify the
tectonic evolution of the northern Cordillera, particularly the Alaskan segment,
and will have bearing on orogen-parallel displacement estimates for accreted
terranes in other orogenic belts.
