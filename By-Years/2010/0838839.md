This proposal seeks funding to enhance the capability of IceTop (a surface array
of detectors complementing the IceCube Neutrino Observatory built at the South
Pole Station) to determine element composition of solar energetic particles in
the energy range 1-10 GeV. This will be accomplished by recycling components of
the former South Pole neutron monitor to construct an enhanced suite of new
detectors whose response functions (primarily due to hadrons) have a different
dependence on energy and element composition from those of the IceTop detectors
- primarily due to photons and leptons. The proposed project will advance
understanding of the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles
with the specific focus areas of the research in the following: (a) deploying an
instrument with unique sensitivity to the relative abundance of protons and
helium nuclei in solar flare-related particle events at energies above 1 GeV;
(b) determining helium abundance for about ten Ground Level Enhancements (GLE)
events expected to occur during the project's lifetime through 2014; and (c)
putting this information into the context of data on solar energetic particles
at lower energy and other observations (optical, radio, X-ray, etc) of these
flares. The project will provide data relevant to important societal issues such
as space weather studies and enhance the usefulness of data from other
instruments.
