9875544&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research is to develop for the
area of solid state materials chemistry a rational synthesis of acentric and
chiral polymeric coordination networks using metal-ligand coordination as the
molecular basis for the construction. Three novel aproaches will be examined:
(1) crystal engineering of acentric interpenetrated diamonoid networks; (2)
design of acentric and chiral two-dimensional square grids based on metal
pyridinecarboxalates; (3) synthesis of acentric, pillared two-dimensional sheets
of basic trinuclear carboxalates with three-fold rotational symmetry. The
educational aims will focus on curriculum development, the encouragement of
underrespresented groups to become scientists and engineers, the involvment of
undergraduate and summer high school students in research, and public outreach
that emphasizes environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Crystal
engineering of organic solids via non-covalent bonding such as hydrogen bonding
is emerging as a very important area in the design, synthesis, and materials
property optimization for nonlinear optical device materials, and for the
development of novel chiral zeolytic materials for separations processes
employed in the protection and conservation of the environment.&lt;br/&gt;***
