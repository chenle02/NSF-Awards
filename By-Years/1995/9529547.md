9529547 Peacock On July 31, 1995, Tropical Storm Erin was upgraded to hurricane
status and appeared to be headed directly for the southeast Florida coast,
prompting officials to urge almost 400,000 residents to evacuate coastal areas
and mobile home parks. This award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research Program and will enable the researchers to collect perishable data in
an investigation of both mitigation and evacuation actions taken by households
in response to the storm. While the research will focus on mitigation and
evacuation decisions in the face of the hurricane risk, models developed will be
extended to earthquakes and other hazard situations, especially in regards to
housing and insurance. ***
