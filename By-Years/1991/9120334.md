The project deals with the optical determination of chemical composition and
chemical reactions of a single, electrodynamically levitated aerosol particle.
Raman and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques will be developed for this
purpose. Physical and chemical phenomena around a single particle will be
controlled and measured with especially conceived methods. The effect of the
enhanced electrical field near the particle surface will be considered in the
spectroscopic methods. By using particles with different (unreactive and
reactive) cores and surface layers, it is possible to separate the particle core
and surface effects. A new technique is proposed to study microparticle
chemistry at elevated temperatures using laser heating. The project will advance
the Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy applied to ultrafine
particles. The results will be useful for basic understanding of phenomena
taking place at the scale of a single aerosol particle, and has applications in
pollution control, material synthesis by aerosol processes, pharmaceutical and
other industries.
