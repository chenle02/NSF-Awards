This SBIR Phase I research project will lead to an electrical panel with modules
that provide interfaces between the electrical grid and the residential
customer?s on-site loads and other energy systems. Through the use of
interactive solid state meters, the utility will be able to intelligently
regulate loads and dispatch on-site energy systems. The on-site energy systems
include, but are not limited to, controlled loads (e.g., water heating),
pluggable EVs, generation systems (e.g., PV panels), and energy storage (e.g.,
spent EV batteries). The panel and modules represent the most integrated and
economic system attempted so far to enable more intelligent energy management
and will encourage renewable energy and conservation. In addition, new grid
stabilization opportunities will be created for the utility. The proposed
approach will use advanced power electronics, along with state-of-the-art
communications techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
research are (1) to enable utilities and over 50,000,000 residential customers
to implement safe, convenient and economic energy management techniques, (2) to
encourage renewable energy, and (3) to provide distributed generation and
storage systems that assist the utility in stabilizing the grid. This would lead
to more reliable and less costly energy for the customer, along with reduced
greenhouse gas. &lt;br/&gt;
