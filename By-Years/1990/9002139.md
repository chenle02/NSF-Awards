Kump proposes: 1) to test a new approach (neutron activation) for distinguishing
among the many stable isotopes of iron, and, 2) to find out whether enough
fractionation occurs in nature to permit the use of iron isotopes to
characterize the history of natural systems. The wide range of isotopic masses
for iron (54 to 58), together with its involvement in microbially-mediated
reactions, other redox reactions, diffusion, transport and precipitation,
strongly suggest that isotopic effects are likely, and that their interpretation
will lead to a better understanding of natural processes that are important both
in research and in environmental assessment.
