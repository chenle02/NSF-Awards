Proposal DMS-0402294 Principal Investigator: Jie Qing (University of
California, Santa Cruz) Title: Geometric PDE in conformal geometry and
relativity

ABSTRACT

Dr. Jie Qing proposes to study conformally compact Einstein manifolds.
Conformally compact Einstein manifolds play crucial roles in the so-called
AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a very promising theory that predicts certain
connections between quantum gravitational theory and certain conformal field
theory. In mathematics it has been known that conformally compact Einstein
manifolds provide a powerful approach to the study of conformal geometry. Recent
development in the study of the scattering matrix in providing rather global,
natural way to understand the holography principle in physics seems very
fascinating and promising. Dr. Jie Qing is also interested in developing and
study theory about asymptotically AdS/dS space-times. For a start, one considers
static asymptotically AdS/dS space-times. The theory is not as well-known as the
study of asymptotically flat space-times. But it is as significant, if not more,
in the classic relativity and quantum gravitation theory.

The proposed research is to study the primary object in the theory of holography
principles that relate quantum gravitation theory and some conformal field
theory. It has become a part the field where mathematicians and physicists can
interact. It is a part of the efforts to find a unified theory for all
fundamental interactions including the strong and weak nuclear interactions,
electromagnetism, and gravity. Advancements in this field will greatly improve
our understanding of the nature in theory. The proposed research is a very
important part of the undergraduate and graduate education programs in the
department of mathematics at University of California, Santa Cruz.
