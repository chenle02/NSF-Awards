The overall goal of this research is to establish a science base for automated
assembly by analyzing its basic components. The research involves development of
algorithms and interactive systems that analyze the low-level geometry of
assembly lines and their components, such as part feeders, sorters, and
fixtures. An underlying theme is the use of simple sensors and actuators such as
light beams and parallel-jaw grippers. Although the hardware bears a close
resemblance to existing hard automation systems, this research introduces
computational methods to rapidly configure and reliably control this hardware.
At a higher level, modular components such as flexible feeders and conveyor
belts are interactively configured to facilitate the design and evaluation of
assembly lines prior to installation. The research addresses basic theoretical
questions such as the complexity and completeness of algorithms and involves
several companies in efforts to transfere basic results into industrial
practice.
