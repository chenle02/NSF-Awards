With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Waymouth will investigate
the mechanism and stereochemistry of stereospecific catalysis and
cyclopolymerization with Group IV metallocenes. Specific aims are as follows:
(i) to develop detailed understanding of the mechanism and stereochemistry of
cyclopolymerization with homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, (ii) to exploit
the cyclopolymerization methodology to synthesize a variety of main-chain chiral
polymers, and (iii) to apply mechanistic principles for the design of second
generation metallocene catalysts for olefin hydrogenation, polymerization, and
diolefin cyclization reactions. %%% Although Ziegler and Natta announced their
discovery of heterogeneous catalysis nearly 40 years ago, surprisingly little is
known about the mechanism of these reactions. Dr. Waymouth has developed a new
class of soluble catalysts that offer the potential for gaining new mechanistic
insight into polymerization reactions. It is likely that an increased level of
understanding of polymerization mechanisms will result from Dr. Waymouth's
investigations. This, in turn, is expected to lead to the development of
valuable new synthetic polymers.
