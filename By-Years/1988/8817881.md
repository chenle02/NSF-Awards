The purpose of this proposal is to assemble a team of experts to assist the
Emerging Engineering Technologies (EET) Division in continuing to develop an
Emerging Technologies Initiation (ETI) activity for identifying new concepts and
research areas. These new concepts and research areas should promote
multidisciplinary engineering research and also strengthen the ties among the
academic research community. The staff of George Washington University's
Graduate Program in Science, Technology, and Public Policy will interview key
people in Federal agencies whose programs focus on emerging technologies and
produce a series of white papers on selected technologies. These papers will be
used by the EET staff to help compile a final list of candidate technologies to
be discussed at the Forum scheduled to be held in October l988.
