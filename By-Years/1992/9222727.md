9222727 Duncan This is a longitudinal study of income dynamics and other social
processes among Hispanics. It builds upon a survey administered in 1990 to a
national sample of 2,043 Latino households that had participated in the 1989
Latino National Political Survey. In 1991 and 1992, reinterviews were conducted
with these same households, producing longitudinal information on income,
employment, and family structure dynamics, comparable to data collected at the
same time on the original sample of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The
present project will extend this time series of annual interviews with Latino
sample households to 1996, and a special effort will be made to secure
interviews with households that had become nonresponse since 1989. This research
will provide a substantial information base that follows Hispanics over a period
of years, allowing social scientists in several disciplines to trace changes in
families and their incomes over time. When combined with the already-funded
Panel Study of Income Dynamics which studies chiefly non-Hispanics, this
extensive new data set will answer many scientific and policy questions about
the opportunities and life courses of Hispanics, including Hispanic immigrants.
