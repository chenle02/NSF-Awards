This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes the
development of a high sensitivity, large dynamic range force transducer capable
of measuring transient force changes in tension and compression. The operating
principal is based on the change in optical properties at the molecular level
with loading of a pre-stressed polymer material. The polymer acts as a linkage
to which a force would be applied either in compression or tension. The
molecular deformation of the polymer linkage will be analyzed using miniature
optical components arranged as a phase-modulated polarimeter capable of
birefringence measurements on the order of 10^-9. Calibration of the measured
birefringence with known loads will provide the necessary calibration
parameters.

Potential commercial instrument would be capable of directional force, pressure
and acceleration measurements and would be extremely accurate for measuring low-
level forces. Since the force transducer is based on optical techniques, it
would be immune to electronic noise, and would allow measurement of rapidly
changing loads.
