9630842 Hirsch The Sinorhizobium meliloti-alfalfa symbiosis, which leads to the
formation of novel structure--the root nodule in which atmospheric nitrogen is
reduced to ammonia--has been well studied. On the other hand, the mycorrhizal
symbiosis, which enables plants to grow in phosphorous-deficient soil, is less
well studied. Chemical signals produced by both the plant and the bacterium are
involved in establishing the interaction between the two organisms. Dr. Hirsch
and her colleagues have determined that VAM-fungi induce the expression of at
least two plant genes in mycorrhizal roots that are usually triggered by
inoculation with rhizobia. Alfalfa plants will be studied for their early
responses to the VAM fungi. The roots will be inoculated with the spores of the
fungi, the progress of infection by fungal hyphae will be followed, and the
timing and patterns of expression of selected plant genes will be analyzed. This
award supports feasibility of using the expression of these early nodulin genes
as molecular indicators for developing a bioassay to detect a putative Myc
factor, i.e., a chemical signal that induces the expression of specific plant
genes in VA-mycorrhizal roots, and is involved in establishing this important
symbiosis.
