Title: Detonation Shock Dynamics and Multi-step Kinetics

There are three outstanding problems in our pursuit of a fundamental
understanding of detonation dynamics, all of which are important in an
engineering tool, such as those above, that utilizes detonations. These concern
the propagation and stability of curved detonations with realistic reaction
kinetics; the problem of how a deflagration (flame) undergoes a transition to
detonation (DDT) and the mechanisms which cause a detonation to ignite or fail
(criticality). One of primary goals of this project is to obtain intrinsic
surface propagation laws for both steady and unsteady curved detonation waves
that are governing by several forms of realistic, but fundamental, reaction
kinetics. Also, one of the most important concerns in engineering applications
has to do both with the successful initiation of detonation and preventing
premature failure. Mathematical investigations of these events will be
conducted, including research on a new mode of detonation propagation that must
be accounted for in failure problems, namely the edge-detonation. Subscale
mathematical modeling will be used, applying rational asymptotic perturbation
methods to derive, for example, intrinsic surface propagation laws for the
motion of the detonation wave in a given system.

The aim of this project is to further our understanding of the basic
mathematical physics of detonations in explosive systems ranging in size from
micro-detonic applications to the collapse of stars (supernova). Traditional
applications of detonation theory have focused on important issues such as
safety, to defense and mining related uses. In recent years, there has been
substantial interest in modern high-tech engineering applications ranging from
hardening, forming and welding of metals, to precision cutting devices and thin-
film manufacturing.
