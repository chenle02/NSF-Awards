This project addresses the mathematical foundations of physical principles that
underlie the design of optical and electronic devices. The pervading concept is
the principle of "resonance", which lies behind lasers, filters, antennas, and
light-emitting diodes, etc. The technical term "embedded eigenvalue" in the
title refers to a mathematical concept that is intimately intertwined with
resonance; it is related to specific configurations of electromagnetic fields in
a structure or device and how they interact with external inputs. The project
combines theory with computer simulations. The principal investigator runs a
research seminar, which integrates seasoned researchers, a post-doctoral
associate, doctoral students, and undergraduate students, each of whom is
involved in a specific aspect of the project. Emphasis is placed on developing
methods at the interfaces of mathematics, physics, and engineering, paying
special attention to bridging communication gaps between the disciplines and
training a new generation of researchers who can work in an interdisciplinary
setting.

Classically familiar examples of embedded eigenvalues are induced by finite
symmetry groups of a differential operator. Recent demonstrations of non-
symmetry-induced spectrally embedded bound states in electromagnetic structures
have opened the way toward a richer set of resonance phenomena. This project
develops a theory of asymmetry and embedded eigenvalues. The investigations
employ functional analysis and partial differential equations, complex analysis,
spectral theory, and analytic geometry. These are the specific problems of the
project: (1) It investigates the precise connection between asymmetry, embedded
eigenvalues, and reducibility of an analytic variety called the "Fermi surface"
for periodic operators, including the partial differential equations (PDE) of
physical systems and mathematical graph models; (2) The principal investigator's
recent work shows that bilayer quantum-graph graphene is special in that its
Fermi surface is always reducible, regardless of the type of asymmetries in the
potentials on the edges connecting the two sheets of graphene. The project seeks
the mathematical reasons behind this and the PDE counterpart; (3) The
investigator and collaborators are developing numerical algorithms for probing
the very complex situation of embedded eigenvalues for the Maxwell equations of
electromagnetics; (4) The existence and construction of embedded eigenvalues for
the Neumann-Poincare boundary-integral operator that is fundamental to the
theory of "plasmonic resonances" is also being studied.
