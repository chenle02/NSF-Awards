This project involves a broad study of blind equalization algorithms for
combatting intersymbol interference in a data communication channel. The "blind"
aspect of the algorithm is that adaptation can proceed without the need for
transmission of special training data. The project will evaluate a variety of
adaptation algorithms with regard to performance, convergence speed and
implementation. Blind equalization has major advantages for use with point-to-
multipoint communication networks, digital microwave radio links, and
transmission monitoring devices.
