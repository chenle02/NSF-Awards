This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop an Ultra-Violet (UV) water remediation process using a novel Surface
Discharge Pulsed UV lamp (SD lamp) to treat organic contaminants. The objective
of the Phase II research is to extend Phase I accomplishments and to develop a
prototype Surface Discharge UV water treatment system for subsequent
commercialization. For UV water treatment, the SD lamp offers advantages in
terms of inherent UV efficiency, spectrum, high intensity and the absence of
concerns linked to the use of mercury. Prior Phase I studies have shown that the
effectiveness of SD lamps is greater than that of commercial mercury lamps by
more than what would be expected based on UV efficiency alone. The proposed NSF
Phase II Project will examine the reasons for this high effectiveness and to use
this information in order to develop a Phase II prototype SD UV water
remediation system. This Phase II work will be carried out in conjunction with a
major UV water treatment company.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of water
treatment. The Surface Discharge UV lamp is expected to replace mercury lamps
currently used in most UV water treatment systems.
