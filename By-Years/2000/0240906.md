Award is for a geophysical survey and piston coring project in the south central
Pacific. The object of the project is to conduct seismic profiling, geophysical
surveys, and collect piston cores as a site survey for potential future ocean
drilling in this area. These data will help define Southern Ocean structure in
the Pacific prior to the separate of Australia from Antarctica and the opening
of the Drake Passage. The ultimate goal of this project is to decipher the
workings of Earth's climatic systems during periods of very warm climate (the
early Eocene). The results will help test computer models of Earth's climate
under conditions very different from today's, define the important climate
feedbacks that are important to maintain warm systems and contribute to our
understanding of how the world may respond if the present warming trends
continue.
