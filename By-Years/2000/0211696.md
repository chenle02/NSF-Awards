David Rohrabacher of Wayne State University and Michael Taschner of the
University of Akron are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on effects of coordination site
geometry on rates of electron transfer reactions of cuprous (Cu(I)) and cupric
(Cu(II)) complexes. The main focus of the research will be to explore how
ligands that constrain geometry about one or both copper centers influence the
kinetics and mechanism of electron transfer (ET) between the two copper atoms.
Main interest will be on the influence of solvent molecules on the ET rates of
complexes involving macrocyclic and tripodal ligands, effects of trigonal and
trigonal-pyramidal ligands that mimic coordination sites in specific copper
proteins, and reorganization barriers in metastable intermediate species in
reactions that involve macrocyclic ligands. Electron transfer reactions in
related complexes containing both ruthenium and copper will also be
investigated. New ligands to be used in each of these research areas will be
synthesized at The University of Akron. Kinetic, electrochemical and
spectroscopic studies will be performed at Wayne State
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electron transfer reactions involving
transition metal ions are of central importance in many areas of industrial
chemistry and biochemistry and also in the emerging field of molecular
electronics. This study focuses on rate processes that are known to be
controlled, in greater or less degree, by conformational changes in the first
coordination shells of the metal ions. This type of process has also been
identified (sometimes quite tentatively) as playing a major role in many more-
complex systems of practical interest. The relatively uncomplicated cases that
are studied in this project are exceptionally suitable for developing and
testing understandings that can then be applied to the more complicated cases
that are of central importance in biological and technological applications.
