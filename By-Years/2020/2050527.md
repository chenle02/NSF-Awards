This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) and the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of
Notre Dame. The site's goal is to provide realistic research experiences to
undergraduate students and high school physics teachers. This project's primary
impact is in training the next generation of scientists who will be essential
for our society's and economy's continued well-being and for maintaining a
robust national defense. The RET component aims at creating enthusiastic high
school teachers who, in turn, will convey the excitement of physics to their
students, the future physicists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will work
with a faculty mentor on a specific research project. They will be exposed to
physics research in other areas via weekly seminars, workshops, interactions
with other participants, and field trips to nearby national laboratories. They
will participate in a "Physics Olympics" with REUs from Purdue and Michigan
State Universities, prepare a research report at the end of the program, and
make oral presentations at the REU-RET Symposium. They will also maintain a
research logbook and have the opportunity to attend courses in computer
programming and scientific writing, a GRE-preparation class, and an "Applying to
Graduate School" workshop. A series of workshops will also be held as part of
the Ethics component. Projects will be available in Astronomy, Astrophysics,
Biophysics, Cosmology, Condensed Matter Physics, High-Energy Particle Physics,
and Nuclear Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
