This research project focuses on the investigation of the dynamic and quantum
statistical behaviors of three- and four-level atomic systems, especially
effects related to controlling dynamic instability and chaos, and quantum
tunneling between bistable and/or multistable states. Other proposed works
include experimental studies of quantum noise correlation, quantum chaos, and
cavity QED effects with multi-level atoms inside optical cavities and at low
light intensities. The group is also exploring the use of quantum nanostructures
as artificial atoms for multi-state systems, which can be used to study quantum
interference effects and to build optical switches and other practical opto-
electronic devices for all-optical communications and quantum information
processing. The broader impact involves the education of both graduate and
undergraduate students as well as applications in optical communication and
quantum computing.
