This award provides partial support for participants in the 2022 East Coast
Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), which will be held October 22-23, 2022 on
the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing, MI. The symposium expects
between fifty and seventy participants, including many graduate students and
postdocs. This will be the nineteenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator
Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting was held at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, TN in the Fall of 2003, and since then, meetings have been held each
Fall.

The conference focuses on operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras) and
noncommutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas, including
ergodic theory, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics.
The ECOAS enables participants to become acquainted with the forefront of
research in operator algebras and noncommutative geometry and neighboring areas,
while also providing early-career researchers with the opportunity to present
their own work and to network and interact with each other as well as with more
experienced researchers. Additional information can be found at the conference

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
