This study is a combined analytical and experimental investigation of mixing
from chaotic advection, and the influence of molecular diffusion on this
process. Experiments will be conducted with fluids of different diffusivities
but similar other properties. The apparatus will be a modified version of that
used previously by this investigator which allows three-dimensional motion to be
generated. Chaotic advection offers new possibilities for efficient mixing
devices. Molecular diffusion effects have largely been ignored in prior studies
of this phenomenon.
