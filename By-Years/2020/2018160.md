This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation programs. The State University of New York (SUNY) at
Buffalo is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer
equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professor Steven Diver and
colleagues: Timothy Cook, Bing Gong, Janet Morrow and Javid Rzavev. This
spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that
accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as
permitting study of biologically-relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy
is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of
the structure of molecules. NMR is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.
Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is important to chemists who are
carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching
as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students
in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby universities in
Western New York such as Canisius College, Dâ€™Youville College, Hauptman-Woodward
Medical Research Institute and Medaille College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award
of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all
levels. This instrument acquisition impacts studies of chalcogen-containing
cationic dyes used in photocatalysis. The instrumentation is used in
investigations of small molecules activation using coordination-driven self-
assembly and nanoporous organic structures based on folding and assembly. In
addition, the spectrometer provides information to aid the design, preparation,
and studies of size-selective macrocycle catalysts of importance in
manufacturing. The instrument is also used to explore the use of iron(III)
coordination complexes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents and
guides the design of polymer assembly with defined molecular
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
