Dynamics and thermodynamics of the upper atmospheric regions including
mesosphere and thermosphere must be studied on a global scale because of the
central importance of horizontal transport, planetary-scale waves, and coupling
of these regions. Most investigations of these regions have been in the northern
hemisphere, while those in the southern hemisphere have been made in Antarctica
and at low midlatitudes in Australia and New Zealand. This grant will support
U.S. involvement in operating an optical high-resolution spectrometer at the
University of Canterbury's Mount John Astronomical Observatory. The PI will
expand upon optical investigations of the simultaneous dynamics of the southern
hemisphere mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)'s motions and temperature. He
will re-investigate the climatology of these motions, along with kinetic
temperature at those heights.
