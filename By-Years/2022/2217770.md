Societies function poorly without free speech. They also function poorly when
members cannot agree on basic facts. This research seeks to discover technology-
aided social structures that minimize the adverse impact of confusion about
facts while promoting free speech. To accomplish these goals, the project
develops, prototypes, and tests market mechanisms to dissuade sources of
information from dissembling, to decentralize detection of false claims, and to
change the incentive structure under which producing false claims is cheaper
than producing honest news. It also seeks to decentralize governance so that no
single party, neither a government nor a private firm, has content moderation
authority. Finally, it provides a principled basis for updating Internet and
media law concerning platform liability exemptions for user-generated
content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed mechanism extends established
economic theories of signaling and screening that allow authors to credibly
signal information regarding the veracity of their claims while helping
recipients believe which claims are honest. This mechanism puts the burden of
proof on the author, in contrast to extant mechanisms that put the burden of
proof on the recipients of information or on the platform. Testing is
accomplished in a laboratory setting, using randomized control trials, the gold
standard for establishing causality. Experimentation tests, for example, whether
more honest candidates are more likely to win a tournament and whether more
honest firms can sell more products. The claims made by authors will be
decentralized. Based on market design principles, the detection and the
adjudication of false claims will also be decentralized. Security, privacy, and
anonymity is proposed to be enforced by technology advances in the developed
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
