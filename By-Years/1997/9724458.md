This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the St. Johns University to acquire an inert
atmosphere drybox system. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) the role of steric and electronic effects in
the reduction elimination of alkyl hydrides from a series of Ru(II) complexes,
(2) synthesis of Ru(II) hydrocarbyl hydrides, (3) synthetic and reactivity
studies of high-valent Mo(VI) oxo alkyl hydrides, and (4) synthesis of new
heterobimetallic compounds. The inert atmosphere drybox is a must for research
which involves air- and moisture sensitive materials. The use of the drybox
allows the researcher to manipulate chemical synthesis of unstable or pyrophoric
materials.
