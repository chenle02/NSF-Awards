Computer-controlled, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a basic
analytical tool and the foremost preparative technique for solution
characterization and separation of organic and biochemical materials. The
chemistry department at the institution identified as a curricular deficiency
the lack of opportunity for the students to utilize such instrumentation. Alumni
had indicated that their preparation for industrial employment and graduate
study would have been greatly enhanced through HPLC experience. Through this
project, the department acquired a HPLC system possessing the durability and
versatility to instruct students in organic chemistry laboratory courses and to
enhance the education experience of undergraduates involved in independent study
research projects. The acquisition of a Waters DeltaPrep(TM) 3000 HPLC system
has helped the department to meet its curricular goals. The institution has
contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
