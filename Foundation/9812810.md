9812810 Scheepers This award will provide partial support for the featured
speakers and also for some graduate students and other young mathematicians to
attend the 1999, 2000, and 2001 BEST conferences, `BEST' being a deceptively
lighthearted acronym for `Boise Extravaganzas in Set Theory,' a series of
conferences devoted to one of the oldest and deepest topics in the Foundations
of Mathematics. The general format will be to build each of the three-day
conferences around four one-hour lectures by distinguished set theorists and to
round out the program with shorter talks contributed by those attracted to the
featured speakers. This strategy has been successful in the past---the series of
conferences began in 1992---and participants are widely representative of set
theoretic research across the U.S. and Canada, with increasing participation
from countries overseas. Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and
by underrepresented minorities has been encouraged. The talks are held in
barrier free classrooms at Boise State University, and efforts are made to
accommodate special needs among the roughly twenty annual participants. The host
institution provides office support and secretarial facilities without cost to
the participants or to the government. ***
