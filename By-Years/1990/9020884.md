Hierarchial Data Format (HDF) is a popular object-oriented file format
originally developed for use in a suite of software tools developed and released
by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Those tools have been
enormously popular, since then, HDF has been adopted for use by other kinds of
software throughout the country in other supercomputer centers, national
laboratories, universities and industrial labs. HDF files can contain text
raster and other kinds of image files, binaries, and custom formats. An HDF file
is self-describing and extensible, two very important features in ensuring
portability across hardware platforms and a growth path for the future. HDF
development is nearly complete. What is needed from this point forward is
support for incremental enhancements, more complete documentation, and service
for a growing national base of users. This proposal will provide that support
for two years.
