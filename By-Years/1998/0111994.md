This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the causes
of cabinet instability in the presidential regimes of Latin America. The
appointment of a president's cabinet and its subsequent performance generally
get a high level of attention both from observers of current politics and from
scholars. Notwithstanding the general perception that cabinet turnover is
important in determining the outcomes of the policy making process, there has
been little work done that discusses the causes of instability, that suggests
theoretical arguments about the relationship between these factors and cabinet
turnover, and that tests these arguments empirically in the context of
presidential political systems. This project tackles these issues by proposing a
theory that relates institutional features of the political environment and the
rate of cabinet turnover in presidential regimes. The research has testable
hypotheses and uses original data on cabinet changes to test them in 11 Latin
American countries. This data set will contribute to the debate on cabinet
stability by providing a means to measure different conceptions of turnover and
relate these to the institutional context.
