INT 9515470 Rajagopal The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research project
between K. R. Rajagopal of the University of Pittsburgh and Jan Kratochvil of
the Czech Technical University is to develop a unified theory and coherent model
that can explain a range of inelastic phenomena in solid materials.
Specifically, the researchers intend to address the details of microstructure
and their impact on the evolution of mechanical properties in a body, which may
possess more than one stress-free configuration. In the process, the researchers
plan to incorporate in this theory their experimental observations concerning:
1) dislocation structures and non-local effects due to such dislocation
structures; 2) "fading memory" for stress based on a "path length" measure in
strain space; and 3) maximized dissipation. Their findings should contribute to
our understanding of the basic physical properties of mechanics and yield
results that can benefit current technology where inelasticity in materials such
as metals or polymers presents persistent manufacturing and infrastructural
problems. This mechanical engineering research project fulfills the program of
objective of advancing basic scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in
the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of mutual interest and competence. ??
