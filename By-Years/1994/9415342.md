9415342 Smith The research proposed in this application is concerned with an
improved 2-D ultrasonic transducer by using opto- electronic transmitter
technology to replace power amplifiers and coaxial cables. Low power diode
lasers, optical fibers and photo conductive switches will be used in the new
system. The research has the potential to eliminate the bulky transducer cables
now used in high density ultrasonic arrays, and thus allow the system to be more
flexible and to consist of more transmit channels. ***
