The long-term goal of this project is to reveal how neuronal activity produces a
lasting change in synaptic transmission and subsequently alters the electrical
signaling in a neuronal network. One fundamental feature of the central nervous
system is that neuronal activity can modify the characteristics of the
postsynaptic response. This use-dependent change in synaptic strength may alter
information processing in a neuronal circuit and information storage within the
brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the proposed mechanisms for synaptic
plasticity is that AMPA-type glutamate receptors present in the postsynaptic
membrane undergo dynamic changes in response to alterations in synaptic
activity. Alterations in the number of AMPA receptors and in their
phosphorylation state can change the amplitude of the synaptic current and
thereby alter the postsynaptic response. Recent work by Dr. Liu and her
colleague has shown that the repetitive synaptic activation of a subset of AMPA
receptors that are permeable to Ca2+ results in the rapid appearance of
Ca2+-impermeable synaptic AMPA receptors in a cerebellar interneuron, the
stellate cell. This switch not only reduces the amplitude of the synaptic
current, but also prolongs the decay time course of the synaptic current.
Interestingly, the reversal of this process, changing from Ca2+-impermeable to
Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors, occurs after epileptic seizures. This change may
be involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced neuronal
death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Liu
will study the physiological consequences of the activity-dependent switch in
AMPA receptor subtypes. This investigation could further our understanding of
how synaptic plasticity may alter input-output relationships within a cerebellar
neuronal network that is essential for several forms of well characterized motor
learning. This study may also increase our understanding of cellular mechanisms
underlying neurological disorders associated with excessive activation of
Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors. &lt;br/&gt;
