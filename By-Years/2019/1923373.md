Appalachian State University (AppState), partnering with the Friday Institute of
Educational Innovation at North Carolina State, proposes a project -- CS4App:
Bringing Computer Science to High Schools in Rural Appalachia -- to expand and
diversify Computer Science (CS) education in rural high schools. The project
will gain insight into the obstacles to CS education faced by high school
students living regions such as Appalachia with high rates of poverty, and it
will develop a comprehensive program to prepare and support their teachers in
teaching an AP Computer Science Principles (CSP)
course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS4App will develop a Networked Improvement
Community (NIC) partnering AppState faculty and regional teachers with an
interest in offering CSP at their school. The Friday Institute will deliver an
effective blend of research-based teacher professional development (PD)
including a 4-week, intensive training in the summer and continued interactions
during the school year. The PD will introduce CS technical and pedagogical
content, as well as leadership development, inquiry-based instruction, and
student equity issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
