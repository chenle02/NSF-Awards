Nicholas Korevaar will continue his work on surfaces of constant mean curvature
in three dimensional space. Historically most research was directed at surfaces
of zero mean curvature, these are known as minimal surfaces. Prototypical
examples being soap films. During the last five years there has been a great
deal of activity in the realm of non-zero mean curvature; here soap bubbles are
the typical examples. This work received its impetus from Wente's counterexample
to the Hopf conjecture. During the last year Kapouleas has shown how to
construct many more such examples of different topological types. Korevaar's
work is in many ways complementary to this and a natural development in the
sense that he is looking at the structure that such surfaces must have rather
than attempting to construct more examples. Korevaar's earlier work with his
collaborators has led to a good understanding of the behaviour of these surfaces
near to infinity. His attention will now turn to an investigation of the
structure in bounded regions of space. This will involve an interaction of ideas
from geometry and the theory of partial differential equations. He will also
carry out related research into capillarity questions and into convexity
theorems for solutions of elliptic equations.
