0134217&lt;br/&gt;Piazza&lt;br/&gt;Under this CAREER Award, methods in
computational mechanics will be developed to study the function of healthy and
diseased human feet and ankles. Though injuries and musculoskeletal disorders
outnumber those seen at any other joint, especially among the elderly, the foot
and ankle are two of the least well-understood areas of the human
musculoskeletal system. Mechanical analysis has lagged behind that of other
joints due to difficulty in defining axes of joint rotation and significant
inter-subject variability. The research plan focuses on refining computational
tools that will be used to locate the two major joint axes of the ankle
noninvasively in individual subjects through mathematical optimization
techniques. Subject specific models, which can be used by orthopaedic surgeons
to study the effects of an untested variation in a surgical procedure while
minimizing the risks to patients, will be based on MR scans of the lower legs of
fifteen subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of the plan
focuses on fostering interest in biomechanics in general and the foot and ankle
problem in particular among undergraduate kinesiology and engineering students,
with an emphasis on reaching underrepresented groups Two new laboratories will
be developed and a seminar series to bring together basic scientists and
clinicians and to expose students to career possibilities in biomechanics and
related fields will be introduced.&lt;br/&gt;
