With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Zenzi Griffin will conduct three
years of psycholinguistic research on the time course for structuring sentences
in speech. Predictions come from two contrasting views of syntax. In one view,
syntactic structures such as clauses and verb phrases are selected as chunks
that guide subsequent word preparation. In the other, the structures result from
a sequence of smaller decisions about what to mention next. This research will
make use of the tendency of speakers to look at objects in a visual scene while
deciding how to refer to each one. Preliminary results suggesting that
indecision about what to mention next may be reflected in eye movements. The
experiments will test language planning and production in monologues and
dialogues in response to visual scenes and to written words.

This research addresses how implicit knowledge of syntactic structure is used in
speaking. The contrasting views imply different representations and processing
mechanisms, which in turn affect conceptualization of how children learn to
produce multiword utterances, how the ability is disrupted in some aphasias, and
what forms of training can improve performance. Determining how humans use
syntactic knowledge to produce sentences allows for more sophisticated
comparisons between syntactic processes and other human abilities. In addition,
relating eye movements to language production reveals interactions between very
different cognitive systems, which may be used to improve language recognition
systems in human-computer interaction. Finally, the project will train several
undergraduate research assistants to use cognitive research methods.
