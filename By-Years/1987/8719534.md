This project studies by analytical and experimental means the cyclic behavior
of thin plate steel shear walls. The investigation will include tests of several
quarter scaled, one bay, three-story high walls models. The objective is to
determine the viability of steel plates being used as an alternative of
reinforced concrete shear walls in providing resistance to lateral seismic
forces. The results could significantly impact the design/construction practices
in seismic zones.
