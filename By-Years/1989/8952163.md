This funding supports the incorporation of parallel computation into the
existing undergraduate computer science curriculum. Specifically, it integrates
parallel topics and laboratory experiences into Programming Languages, Computer
Organization and Architecture, Operating Systems, and Algorithm Design. There is
also an emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and Database Management. The
equipment funded provides a flexible, highly configurable laboratory that
supports the curriculum changes. The institution is providing matching funds in
an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
