The goal of the proposal is to study efficient mixed finite element methods for
the computation of transport maps in optimal transportation problems. The focus
is on problems in which the cost of transport is a quadratic function of the
distance. They lead to Monge-Ampere equations. The first part of the project
consists in clarifying the applicability of finite element type methods to weak
solutions of the equation. The key approach here is approximation by smooth
functions. In the second part, techniques of mixed finite element analysis are
adapted to the approximation of smooth solutions of the equation.

Optimal transportation has a growing application in various fields ranging from
theoretical ones such as geometry and analysis to applied fields such as
biology, pattern recognition, image processing, fluid mechanics, geophysics,
meteorology, optics, oceanography and cosmology. This has created the critical
need for efficient and robust numerical methods backed up theoretically to solve
optimal transportation problems. The efficient and reliable methods developed
from this project could be used to solve optimal transportation problems which
appear in many other applications e.g. weather forecasting, traffic congestion,
economics, mesh equidistribution, texture mapping, etc. The proposal studies the
Monge-Ampere equation of optimal transportation with the goal of clarifying
theoretically the use of the efficient mixed finite element methods. It advances
knowledge towards the resolution of some open problems in analysis and geometry
involving Monge-Ampere type equations.
