Plant carbon isotopes preserved in the sedimentary record are valuable proxies
for paleovegetation and paleoclimate in the absence of pollen or macrofossils.
Plant carbon isotopes will be measured from leaf waxes preserved in a suite of
samples that capture known periods of high CO2 concentration in the Eocene and
Oligocene to reconcile conflicts in our understanding of the factors that
influence plant carbon isotopes over geologic time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
carbon isotopic composition of plants is used to understand past changes in
environment, vegetation, and climate. This project will use the geologic record
to examine changes in plant carbon isotopes during times of high atmospheric
CO2. The project will benefit society by improving an important proxy for
understanding Earth's past climate. In addition to training of an undergraduate
and graduate student, this project will foster a broader public understanding of
scientific research by expanding on current exhibits in collaboration with the
Cincinnati Museum Center, a large urban cultural institution.
