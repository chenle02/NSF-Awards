This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
an easily used sensing technology capable of the multiplex detection of trace
levels of foodborne pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli 0157:H7, hepatitis A),
viruses (Hepatitis, Norwalk group), and toxins (e.g., botulinum toxins,
shellfish toxins) with a simple direct detection assay format (no labels or wash
steps required). The detection sensitivity of the proposed technology will rival
that of more complicated amplification and labeled detection methods with
projected sensitivities in the femtomolar concentration range for toxins,
proteins, and other small bioactive molecules, and less than 100 organisms/ml
for bacterial and viral pathogens.

The commercial application of this project is in the area sensors for use in
clinical diagnostics, point-of-care health applications, water quality
monitoring, process control, and environmental air quality monitoring. The
proposed technology is also expected to fulfill the needs for a sensitive,
easily used biowarfare agent monitoring system for military and homeland defense
programs.
