This research project will advance intelligent search engines by developing
query-concept learners. Techniques for detecting concept drifts as well as
multi-resolution image characterization will be developed. In particular the
research will be based on two online algorithms, MEGA and SVMActive. It will
also integrated text attributes in image searching and apply the technology to
video data. The career development plan will include sponsoring undergraduate
and graduate projects as well as incorporating the research into the Computer
Science curriculum.
