The goal of this project is to correlate degradation rates to strain rates in a
fashion that creates general guidelines by which bioprocessing systems can be
modified to minimize plasmid DNA degradation and maintain biological activity.
To this end, specific hypotheses regarding mechanisms to minimize the impact of
shear, and how to scale behaviors based on molecular characteristics, will be
tested. This knowledge will then be applied to the maintenance of supercoil
structure and biologic activity. These hypotheses include: (1) altering
molecular diffusion times by increasing solution viscosity to protect DNA from
shear induced degradation, (2) reducing shear stresses arising from velocity
gradients by reducing the lengths of DNA particles, (3) increasing the level of
turbulence which intuitively should promote conformational alterations that
enhance covalent bond breakage, and (4) using the knowledge gained after testing
in 1-3 toward protecting plasmids during atomization. Different aerosolisation
strategies (e.g., turbulence, temperature, and particle size) will be analyzed
with the help of computational analysis to optimize the atomization process. The
success of an atomization strategy will be judged based on the molecular
stability and biological activity of the plasmid DNA after aerosolisation.
