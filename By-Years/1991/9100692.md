This renewal grant is in support of research in computational statistical
mechanics. A variety of projects will be studied which are amenable to solution
using advanced computational techniques. Techniques will be developed and
refined for the large scale simulation of phase transitions in systems with
competing interactions. Dynamical critical phenomena will be studied. Other
research topics wil include capillary condensation, high resolution Ising model
simulations, finite size effects in the classical Heisenberg model, random
systems, magnetic superlattices and surface phase transitions. Various
techniques will be used to implement these simulations including Monte Carlo,
Monte Carlo renormalization group, molecular dynamics and spin dynamics.
Computational simulations of systems composed of many particle represent an
alternative to the usual theoretical calculations and experimental
investigation. The principal investigator on this grant is an accomplished
expert on simulations of physical phenomena. The principal investigator will
study a variety of current problems in statistical mechanics which are amenable
to solution using computational simulation and will also develop associated
algorithms to facilitate these simulations. The research topics are of intrinsic
interest in condensed matter physics in addition to having possible application
to magnetic materials, surface behavior of materials and algorithm development.
