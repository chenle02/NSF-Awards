9615809 Klein This project will investigate the effects of systemic initiatives
on student achievement. Selected projects from NSF's SSI, USI and LSC will be
identified in collaboration with NSF (nine in all). Data will be collected to
determine if students in these sites, who have received program reforms, score
higher on relevant achievement measures, and other outcomes, than do comparable
students from other schools. Achievement will be measured on currently available
tests in each site. A second analysis will examine the relationship between
student success and the degree of implementation of systemic reform. RAND will
conduct common data analysis across the sites, building a mosaic of evidence
about the impact of systemic reform on student achievement in each site.
