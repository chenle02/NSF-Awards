This ten week REU site program at California State University, Los Angeles
(CSULA) is focused on alternative fuel resources and sustainable energy. Twelve
undergraduate students will participate in intensive training and hands-on
research aimed at developing, testing and implementing non-fossil-fuel based
energy technologies. The students will work in a clinic-like atmosphere with
multidisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers. The engineers are skilled
at developing and implementing technologies and the scientists have insight into
the underlying chemical, biological, and physical concepts. In addition,
participants will get specific and intensive training on research methodology,
proper writing and presentation techniques, fundamental principles and project
management, which will provide them with a broad and important set of tools to
use in their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this REU site
program is to inspire a young, talented, and traditionally underrepresented
group of students to continue their research careers and obtain advanced
graduate degrees. &lt;br/&gt;
