Impacts of stochastic ecological immigration history on evolutionary
diversification

The determinants of biodiversity are of central interest to evolutionary
biology. While it is understood that the processes of evolutionary
diversification and extinction, coupled with ecological immigration, contribute
to diversity in biological communities, the nature of how these processes
interact to shape diversity is not clear. These complex interactions require
both theoretical and detailed experimental investigations. This research
investigates how immigration history impacts the evolutionary diversification
process. Large-scale microcosm experiments in a bacterial experimental adaptive
radiation in the laboratory will test how elements of immigration history
influence the rate and extent of diversification. The development a synthetic
model of evolutionary community assembly incorporating effects of immigration
and applying analytical tools from physics and applied mathematics, will enable
the identification of parameter combinations significantly contribute to the
dynamics of diversification.

Training objectives include learning and applying modeling approaches from
physics and applied mathematics, such as stochastic differential equations and
branching processes, to address the complex biological phenomena. Understanding
the forces that generate and eliminate diversity in communities is of critical
importance for the conservation and restoration of native habitats. Broader
impacts include actively mentoring and advising undergraduate students and K-12
educational outreach.
