This award supports cooperative research between Joseph Dannenberg of Hunter
College at the City University of New York (CUNY) and Oscar Ventura of the
University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. They will study the theory of
boron anionic heterocycles derived from hydroxamic acids. Molecular orbital
calculations will be used to model the tautomerism (interconversion of
structural isomers) of substituted hydroxamic acids. These acids are inhibitors
of urease but not in the presence of boric acid so the reaction between this
acid and hydroxamic acid will be studied. This is a project of fundamental
interest to chemists and the two collaborators are well qualified and
productive. Both have a history of effective international collaboration.
Dannenberg's experimental skills complement the theoretical ones of the
Uruguayan. Therefore this project represents a cooperation in frontier chemistry
between U.S. and Latin American scientists and a good example of fulfillment of
the goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.
