This award provides support for a five-day International Conference on Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) Modeling Fluids and Complex Fluids to be held at
the Centre for Nonlinear Studies, Northwest University, Xi'an, P.R. China, June
13-17, 2011. The award will provide partial support for US participants, with a
special emphasis on graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and researchers
from under-represented groups.

Some important progress has been recently made in analysis and understanding of
Partial Differential Equation that describe many important fluid phenomena
related to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, motion of liquid crystals and other
applications. In addition, significant progress has been made in the analytical
and numerical study of non-Newtonian complex fluids and polymeric flows, and in
the study of transport and mixing in fluid turbulence. This international
conference is aimed at presenting and developing the recent successful
approaches and at fostering collaborations between researchers from different
disciplines including PDEs, harmonic analysis and numerical computations. It is
expected that this conference will yield new strategies for the resolution of
many remaining open problems. Plenary talks by leading experts in the field will
be combined with shorter talks, discussions and poster presentations. All junior
participants will be encouraged and given an opportunity to present their
results. The National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of the P.R. China and
the Centre for Nonlinear Studies at Northwest University will provide funds to
cover the local expenses in China.
