The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research between Dr. Janet G.
Osteryoung of North Carolina State University and Zbigniew Stojek of the
University of Warsaw, Poland, is to investigate analytical pulse voltammetry.
The researchers will employ pulse voltammetric techniques in these areas: (1)
host- guest chemistry, to elucidate fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic
molecules; (2) analysis of benzodiazepine tranquillizers by adsorptive stripping
voltammetry for chromatographic detection; (3) normal and reverse pulse
voltammetry in resistive media; and (4) a comparison of staircase voltammetry
with linear scan voltammetry for systems involving adsorption. Results are
expected to advance understanding voltammetric techniques employing stepwise
changes in potential. This project in electrochemistry fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
