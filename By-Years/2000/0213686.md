Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0213686, Harry Yeh, U. of Washington
&lt;br/&gt;"International Travel Grant to Support U.S. Involvement in
HAZARDS-2002"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action provides support for U.S.
participation in the international symposium HAZARD-2002, to be held in Antalya,
Turkey, October 2002.&lt;br/&gt;The symposium is organized biennially by the
Natural Hazards Society, and presents a wide range of state-of-the-art natural
hazards mitigation strategies, from fundamental understanding of the phenomena
to evacuation planning. The topics include meteorological hazards such as
hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, tornadoes, fires, droughts; geological hazards,
including earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions; hydrological and
marine hazards, for example tsunamis, storm surges, floods, sea-level rise, and
marine biological hazards; and technological hazards, including air and water
pollution. The participants supported by this award include key persons as well
as junior members of the U.S. natural hazards research community. Their
participation at this symposium is critical for fostering cooperative research
efforts. Research in natural hazards, and in particular tsunami research, has
become increasingly international in its focus. Strong international cooperation
is necessary since tsunamis, for example, can affect not only the region near
the source but also distant regions through propagation across
oceans.&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this symposium will be disseminated to U.S.
researchers in natural hazards.
