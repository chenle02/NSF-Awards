The 7th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the 7th in
a series of annual international conferences concerned with developing methods
for analyzing the data that come from educational settings and using those
methods to better understand students and the settings in which they learn. Its
Young Researcher Track brings young researchers together with senior people in
the EDM community to help them broaden their perspectives on educational data
and how to mine and analyze it for assessment purposes and to learn more about
how people learn. Activities are designed to help prepare the next generation of
cyberlearning and learning technologies researchers. This activity supports the
mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics.

The EDM community is unique in its synthesis and cross-fertilization of three
STEM education cyberlearning-related research capacities: (1) developing methods
for analysis of fine-grained educational data, (2) evaluating cutting-edge
learning technologies, and (3) using insights gained from these analyses to
refine theories of learning proposed in the cognitive, social, and learning
sciences. The conference balances theoretical grounding, analysis of fine-
grained educational data, application of the findings to design of learning
environments, and rigorous evaluation of the learning environments. Young
Researcher Track activities are designed to help young researchers gain a
variety of perspectives on the methods and technologies involved in educational
data mining and how use them to best effect; the ways in which analysis of
available data can be used to inform education and design of learning
technologies; and the ways such data can be used to advance understanding of
processes underlying learning. NSF funding will be used to support some of the
cost of travel and accommodations for advanced graduate students from US
universities.
