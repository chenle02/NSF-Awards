This project provides for the purchase of equipment for a modular laser-based
spectroscopy and kinetics laboratory to be used in the teaching of physical,
instrumental, analytical, and biochemistry courses. The equipment includes a
diode laser and a nitrogen-laser pumped dye lasers, monochromators, and
detection electronics (both PMT and CCD). With this equipment, students in
instrumental and physical chemistry courses will be able to easily and rapidly
construct apparatus for the measurement of Raman spectra, fluorescence spectra
(laser and lamp excitation), interferometry, two-photon spectroscopy, and rapid
kinetics (flash photolysis). The equipment is designed for maximum versatility
in experimental design and a minimum of instructor intervention. Two
configurations (Raman and fluorescence spectrometers) will be used throughout
the curriculum as state-of-the-art instructional instruments. The equipment will
also be available for undergraduate research projects.
