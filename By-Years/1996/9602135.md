9602135 Yao The genetic properties of rRNA will be investigated using
Tetrahymena thermophila as a model organism. Work from this laboratory has
demonstrated that one of the variable regions of the ribosome, D8, has an
essential conserved role in cell growth. Furthermore, that work has shown that
some variable regions can accommodate short insertions without affecting
ribosome function and antisense ribosomes" have been made and used to suppress
specific regions in the mRNA. That study will be continued by determining the
optimal length of the antisense RNA, the best target regions in the mRNA and the
most appropriate sites within the rRNA variable regions for such insertions. The
interaction between the targeted mRNA and the ribosomes will be studied. The
antisense ribosome technology will be used to develop a new strategy for cloning
Tetrahymena genes by their null phenotypes. Additionally, the study will create
rRNAs that contain active ribozymes as inserts. The well characterized "hammer-
head" ribozyme will be inserted into a characterized variable region of the
rRNA. The ability of this ribozyme to cleave targeted mRNA in vivo will be
determined by analyzing the phenotype and molecular composition of transformed
cells. %%% The ribosomal RNAs of eukaryotes are composed of well conserved
sequences that are interspersed with highly divergent regions. Despite extensive
study, only some conserved sequences and none of the variable sequences have
been linked to specific ribosome functions. This study will give insight into
the genetic properties of the rRNA, especially the variable regions and explore
a novel role of the ribosome using Tetrahymena thermophila as a model organism.
This ciliated protozoan has only one copy of the rRNA genes in its germline
genome. Transformation methods for replacing the rDNA with reconstructed copies
have been developed making Tetrahymena the only organism in which both classical
and molecular genetical analysis of rDNA can be conducted.
