James Madison University will offer a week-long workshop for college and
university faculty. The workshop will focus on lasers and their application to
solving chemical problems. The offering will consist of a one week intensive
exposure to both the theory and practical application of laser technology to
areas of interest to all branches of chemistry. The course will include (1)
lectures on the fundamentals of lasers and related topics, (2) laboratory
experiments to illustrate the principles presented in lectures, (3) lectures and
laboratory experiments dealing with current applications of lasers to chemically
interesting problems, and (4) an opportunity to engage in a special project of
interest to the participant, the technology of which will be transportable to
the participant's home institution. A major feature of this workshop is to
provide exposure to laser technology at a level appropriate for incorporation at
the undergraduate level. In addition to the NSF funds, participants'
institutions will provide about 25% in travel expenses.
