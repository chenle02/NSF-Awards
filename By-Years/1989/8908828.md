This project will use mobile phases in their near-critical, retrograde region in
a mode similar to supercritical chromatography. There is evidence of a
retrograde, cross-over phenomenon in ternary systems (2 solutes in a
supercritical solvent) which can be used to separate very similar compounds.
Separations cost escalate rapidly as the structure of the molecules to be
separated becomes more similar. Supercritical separations have already shown an
ability to achieve remarkable resolutions, as for example, between polymers by
molecular weight only. When used in a chromatographic mode, truly astonishing
results may be possible. This could have an important impact on a number of
industries as widely separated as advanced high performance materials and
pharmaceuticals.
