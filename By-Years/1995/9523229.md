This project will analyze the evolutionary relationships of Otavipithecus
namibiensis, the recently discovered Miocene hominoid species from Namibia. The
Miocene hominoids, a diverse assemblage of fossil apes which occupied the Old
World from roughly 22 to 5 million years before present, gave rise both to
humans and our closest living relatives, the African apes. Consequently,
understanding the evolutionary relationships of these early apes is crucial to
the study of human origins. This study also will address a specific
methodological problem in hominoid studies: the role of quantitative
morphological characters in the reconstruction of hominoid evolutionary
relationships. Current methods of coding quantitative characters into discrete
character states for cladistic analysis and several statistically-based methods
new to primate systematics will be applied to morphometric data taken from
hominoid mandibles. The relative effectiveness of these methods will be
compared. The study sample will comprise fossil and extant hominoid mandibles
housed in collections in the U.S., Europe, and Africa, with an emphasis on
constructing valid biological samples and maximizing sample sizes. Evolutionary
analysis will be performed using current computer-assisted methods of phylogeny
reconstruction, and previously stated hypotheses concerning the evolutionary
relationships of Otavipithecus namibiensis will be examined in the light of
these results. In addition to being a detailed investigation of the evolutionary
affinities of Otavipithecus, this study will provide the first rigorous
examination of the role of quantitative character coding in primate phylogeny
reconstruction, the results of which ultimately may be generalized to additional
anatomical regions in hominoids, as well as to studies of other primate groups.
