This project seeks to construct a 16-element array receiver system called OMAR
(One Millimeter-wave Array Receiver) at the 50 m Large Millimeter Telescope
(LMT) located in Tonantzintla, Puebla, Mexico. OMAR will be installed as a
common-user facility instrument, available for American astronomers. LMT is a
joint project of the University of Massachusetts and the Instituto Nacional de
Astrofisica, Optica, y Electronica (INAOE). OMAR is designed to operate in the
210 - 280 GHz (~1 mm wavelength) atmospheric window, and will be equipped with
state-of-the-art receivers. OMAR will build on the proven experience and the
heritage of success of the UMass instrumentation group in building state-of-the-
art focal plane arrays. OMAR will provide an unprecedented combination of
sensitivity, mapping speed, spectral coverage, spatial and spectral resolution
in the 1 mm band, that will enable a wide variety of scientific projects
covering the gamut of distant galaxies to comet flybys in our own solar system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OMAR will be the first heterodyne array receiver at
millimeter wavelengths that is equipped with sideband-separation super-
conducting receivers. In each pixel, 8 GHz of effective bandwidth per sideband
(16 GHz total) will be available without the use of mechanical tuners. OMAR will
be deployed as a 16 element dual polarization array which will be arranged in a
2x4 (8 beams) format. OMAR will be used with on-the-fly (OTF) mapping mode to
provide an unprecedented combination of sensitivity, mapping speed, spectral
coverage, spatial and spectral resolution in the 1 mm band. OMAR is a
technically innovative instrument that will define the state-of-the-art for SIS
heterodyne array receivers. As a purely technical advance, this project will
implement a high level of integration of mixer, amplifier, local oscillator
injection components in a innovative sideband separation system that will have a
significant impact in the field of heterodyne focal-plane arrays.
