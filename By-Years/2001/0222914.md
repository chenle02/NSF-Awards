In the last decade, computer systems have increasingly become participants in
complex, distributed communities comprising people and computer systems, rather
than devices used by individuals. This major shift engenders a significant
challenge for computer science: to determine ways to construct computer systems
able to act effectively as team members. Although many current computer systems
have sophisticated capabilities as individual actors, most lack capabilities
required for working successfully as members of a collaborative group. This
proposal addresses problems central to this challenge. It focuses on providing
the foundation for the design of decision-making components of software agents
that can handle multi-agent, dynamic team contexts. The proposed research
comprises three activities: (1) empirical investigations, including examination
of the influence on individual and group behavior and outcomes of policies and
mechanisms for producing appropriately helpful behavior in collaborative
settings and for governing commitment to group activities; (2) development of
formal theories that may be used to address abstractly questions of these
mechanisms; and (3) construction of more sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;collaboration-
capable software agents. The research will contribute to the development of
collaboration-capable software agents and collaborative human-computer interface
systems, and&lt;br/&gt;thus will significantly increase the effectiveness of
heterogeneous teams of people and software-systems agents.
