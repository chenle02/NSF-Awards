9722507 Ingle This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research collaboration
between Prof. James Ingle of Stanford University and Prof. Rodolfo Cruz-Orozco
of the Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas in La Paz, Mexico. The
researchers aim to study unusual and geologically important subtropical shallow
water carbonate environments in the La Paz area of Baja California Sur, Mexico.
Results of this research will have immediate application to the interpretation
of the modern, Quaternary, and Cenozoic oceanographic and paleoclimatic history
of this climatically sensitive region; understanding the formation and
preservation of carbonate sediments in tectonically active settings; and
monitoring and protection of fragile marine environments in a proposed
ecological reserve. This project will help to further international scientific
collaboration between Mexican and U.S. scientists and graduate students and will
substantially broaden our understanding of the little studied but
environmentally unique and geologically important shallow carbonate environments
of the southern Gulf of California. ***
