The principal investigator will study the factors that influence trace element
partitioning in crystals during growth, and particu- larly the influence of
surface structure. He will concentrate on a study of calcite, utilizing a
variety of spectroscopic techniques that enable detailed examination of the
mineral surface. He will also study surface-controlled differential partitioning
trends in dolomite, topaz and quartz. In general he hopes to develop an
understanding of the principles governing the influence of mineral surfaces on
the differential partitioning of trace elements in minerals.
