Production of offspring in plants can involve pollen produced within the same
plant or pollen from other plants. The balance between these two modes has a
profound influence on the distribution of genetic variation in the population
and also its evolutionary dynamics. The proposed research will examine the
extent to which individuals in a natural population reproduce via self-pollen,
and examine the relative importance of several factors that favor low to
moderate levels of self-pollination. These include a decline in fitness of
offspring derived from self- pollination relative to those that result from
cross- pollination and the potential for competition between self and cross
pollen. Agriculturally important traits are often selected through breeding
programs that involve many generations of self-pollination. In some cases, lines
of agricultural plants have been selected for their propensity to self-pollinate
since this prevents the dilution of desirable genetic traits by genes from
unselected plants. The genetic implications of imposing higher than usual rates
of self-pollination on plants are poorly understood. The proposed research will
investigate some effects of self-pollination and contribute to our understanding
of long term agricultural selection programs.
