Disruption of the cell envelope is one of the first steps in the recovery of
materials contained within microbial cells. Conventional techniques typically
involve high shear, heat generation, and multiple stage processing, all factors
which can lead to degradation of the desired product. Furthermore, these
techniques often lead to the creation of small cell wall fragments which adds to
the burden of downstream purification. This work suggests a method of cell
disruption which may avoid these difficulties, improve product yields, and prove
more economical as well. The method, a modified form of explosive decompression,
is based on the large specific volume changes which may be rapidly effected upon
depressurization of a supercritical fluid or low-boiling liquid. Any process
requiring microbial cell disruption may benefit significantly from the proposed
explosive disruption method. Downstream processing accounts for 50 percent to 80
percent of the total cost in the production of most bioproducts. The development
of this technique for cell disruption could lead to the economical recovery of
many important proteins for human health care that will otherwise be neglected.
