A charge-coupled-device (CCD) mosaic will be constructed for use on the new
WIYN telescope. This array of four custom 2048x2048 pixel CCDs will be the
primary imaging detector for the WIYN Observatory. The construction of the
detector/controller/software system will be shared between the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) and Indiana University. The mosaic will cover an
area 9.6 arc minutes on a side with only 2.8 arc seconds separating the four
CCDs. A versatile filter/shutter assembly will be constructed equipped with
three interchangeable filter wheels. The controller will have a wide range of
operating modes which, coupled with a broad filter complement, will accommodate
a large variety of scientific programs. Special hardware and software will be
used to enhance the capabilities of the system for time-resolved stellar
photometry.
