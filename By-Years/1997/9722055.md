Theoretical calculations on the ro-vibrational excitation, dissociative
attachment and impact ionization of small diatomic molecules are performed using
a combination of density functional and R-matrix methods. The goal is the
development of accurate approximation schemes that are applicable to a broad
class of electron-molecule collisions.
