The goal of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the growth and
resorption of blood vessels in response to stresses and strains in the vessel
wall. The work includes a) experimental and theoretical work to relate
structural and mechanical parameters of the wall to stresses and strains, b)
determination of factors that determine growth and resorption, and c)
determination of the relationship between stress and growth. The work will
provide new fundamental knowledge about the way tissues respond to mechanical
intervention. The research strongly depends on advanced engineering techniques
to describe tissue characteristics, and should contribute to the developing
field of "tissue engineering".
