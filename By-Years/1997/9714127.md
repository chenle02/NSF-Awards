Professor Michel Broue of the University of Paris VII will give a series of ten
lectures entitled "Blocks, Deligne-Lusztig varieties and reflection groups." In
these lectures he will explain recent advances in the modular representation
theory of finite reductive groups obtained by using Deligne-Lusztig varieties to
study the modular representation of these groups, and how the results thus
obtained give strong indications that there is an as yet undiscovered "generic"
representation theory from which the modular representation theory of finite
reductive groups can be recovered by specialization. He will also relate this
progress to long-standing conjectures in modular representation theory and
discuss directions for future research. The lectures should be of interest to
experts and students in all areas of finite group representation theory as well
as researchers in other fields, particularly those interested in the various
aspects of complex reflection groups.
