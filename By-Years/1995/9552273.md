MP-IDEA focuses on precalculus classes and is supported by industry partners
and by an emerging network of regional colleges. MP-IDEA has 4 components: (1)
design precalculus courses that are relevant, that are realistic, and that give
students skills and concepts to succeed in future math courses and in the
workplace; (2) incorporate the intelligent use of modern technology into the
math classroom, specifically, graphing calculators and computers; (3)
incorporate alternative assessment practices in the mathematics classroom,
specifically, the introduction of industry-based student research projects; (4)
incorporate cooperative learning techniques in the mathematics classroom, thus
improving student attitudes, achievement, and interpersonal skills. This project
improves mathematics instruction, implements six recommendations of the SCANS
report, and serves as a regional model for improvement in postsecondary
mathematics instruction. An exceptional element of MP-IDEA is educational
partnerships with engineers and scientists at regional industries. These
volunteers consult with MP-IDEA faculty to write industry-based math projects
specific to the math that students in precalculus courses are learning. The math
projects encourage cooperative learning, introduce students to modern
technology, and provide a relevant means of assessing student learning.
