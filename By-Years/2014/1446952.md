This travel grant assists in the formation of a new community around Search-
Based Software Engineering by funding travel for students to a new symposium.
Search-based software engineering (SBSE) views software engineering problems as
optimization problems utilizing metaheuristic techniques to discover near
optimal solutions. The symposium will bring together researchers (and their
students) from many different areas of Software Engineering. The travel support
will enable students to participate and learn from others in the field and
advance their research.
