Developing large-scale, reliable software capable of exploiting the potential of
concurrent and distributed hardware systems will demand the support of powerful
automated tools, especially analysis tools. The constrained expression approach
to analyzing such software systems seems to have several advantages, including
broad applicability and reasonable efficiency, relative to other proposed
approaches. Results of initial experiments with the approach, based on manual
application and preliminary prototypes of some of the needed tools, have been
encouraging. They have also raised some interesting theoretical questions and
demonstrated the need for more extensive experimentation with large, more
realistic examples. This project is to investigate ways to improve the
efficiency, power, and ease of use of the constrained expression approach to
analysis. The goal is to design and construct the more robust, flexible and
efficient prototype tool implementations needed to support more extensive
experimentation, and begin experimenting with them.
