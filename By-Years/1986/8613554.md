The flow quality around the circuit of the boundary layer wind tunnel being
built at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory will be investigated using
static and stagnation pressure tubes, hot-wire anemometry, pressure transducers,
and flow visualization equipment. Distributions of mean velocity and turbulence
intensity will be obtained at a number of cross-sections so that the performance
of the contraction, the first diffuser, the first and second corner turning
vanes, the wide-angle diffuser, the fan system, and the turbulence management
devices can be quantitatively ascertained. Flow patterns and causes of flow
unsteadiness and separation will be studied using the flow visualization
equipment and pressure fluctuation measurements together with hot-wire
measurements. The supercomputer facilities at the University of Minnesota will
be used for flow calculations for the contraction and vaned bents, and the
results will be compared with the experimentally measured performance. The P.I.
is highly qualified to carry out this project. A Standard Grant is recommended
for one year only in the amount of $80,514.
