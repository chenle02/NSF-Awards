In the field of astronomy, adaptive optics are used to correct for the image
aberrations that occur as starlight passes through the Earth's atmosphere:
Dynamic changes in the refractive index refract the light, causing stars to
"twinkle." The adaptive optics that are used in large terrestrial telescopes
consist of a wavefront sensor to measure the aberrations of a "guide star," a
natural or artificial point source reference beacon in the field of view of the
object of interest, and a deformable mirror that can dynamically change its
shape correct the image to restore diffraction limited imaging. The adaptive
optics used in astronomy to obtain clearer images of celestial bodies in outer
space will be re-applied in the field of biological imaging to correct image
aberrations from changes in the refractive index within a cell. A fluorescent
bead will be used as the reference beacon and implanted near the object of
interest, such as the nucleus of a cell. Expected outcome is the correction of
highly aberrated images, thereby obtaining the resolution limit set by
diffraction of the imaging system. Once developed, the microscope will be
available in a new research center, funded by the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (www.cirm.ca.gov).
