Abstract CTS-0102911 Mark McCready, University of Notre Dame



This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 00-119. The aim of the
proposal is to develop nanostructured catalysts for gas-liquid reactions, which
have a system of macro-pores designed to take advantage of oscillatory
convection that can be created by large-scale hydrodynamic disturbances. It is
expected that the efficiency of the reactor would be improved by such a
combination.
