This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Kristin Bowman-James of the University of Kansas at
Lawrence to investigate the coordination chemistry of anions using new classes
of macrocyclic receptors. Specific recognition of negatively charged molecular
ions, which are abundant species in the environment and biological systems, is a
major challenge. This project will identify the binding patterns for a variety
of anions at the molecular level and also explore the sensor capabilities of
modified receptors. The ultimate objective of this project is to establish a
framework for the strategic design of selective binding agents and
sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to explore the basic
chemistry underlying the selective binding of anions with receptors that possess
both amine and amide or amine and thioamide functionalities. The strategy is to
examine systematically the influence of selected aspects of the ligand design on
anion coordination: hydrogen bonding capability (amides vs. thioamides), ligand
preorganization (syn or anti orientation of amide/thioamide groups), size,
dimensionality (monocyclic vs. bicyclic), and charge (neutral vs. quaternized
amines). Attachment of electrochemical and fluorescent probes will be used to
explore the capability of these receptors as anion sensors. Substrates will
include small inorganic anions, such as halides, pseudohalides and other halide-
containing anions as well as oxo anions, with both trigonal and tetrahedral
structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of current concerns about groundwater
contamination by anions such as nitrate, phosphate, and fluoride, as well as
homeland security issues involving cyanide and arsenate, this study will lay the
groundwork for future applications in anion sensing and removal. Both
underrepresented groups and women have been involved in this research and active
recruitment of underrepresented groups will continue.&lt;br/&gt;
