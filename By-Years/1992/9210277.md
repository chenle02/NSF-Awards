This proposal studies a dialysis flow cell which has been formulated by the PI
and is termed an "antisedimentation dialysis system." In this system, two
streams containing solute particles and solvent flow countercurrently in
channels which are placed on opposite sides of a semipermeable dialysis
membrane. The exits of each channel contain a barrier membrane which allows only
passage of the solvent. When the dialysis membrane does not permit passage of
solute, strong solute gradients in the flow direction develop as solute piles up
at the flow exit barriers. For a semipermeable dialysis membrane, solute
transport reduces these gradients and causes the concentration to become more
uniform. This process can be used to measure hindered diffusion coefficients of
solute through the pores of the semipermeable dialysis membrane barrier, and
more importantly, can be used in fractionating solutes.
