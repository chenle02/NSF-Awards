This proposal will continue three more years of the work currently supported by
Cooperative Agreement ATM-8714335. The research involves radar observations at
the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, which is located near Lima, Peru, and will be
conducted by Cornell scientists and students, resident staff members of the
Observatory, and visiting scientists and students from other institutions in the
United States and other countries. This Cooperative Agreement provides the main
financial support for the Observatory. The topics to be investigated include:
(1) the energetics and dynamics of the equatorial F region and protonosphere,
(2) plasma instabilities in the equatorial E and F regions, (3) mesospheric and
stratospheric dynamics and energy transfer processes, and (4) changes in the
geomagnetic field.***//
