This proposal requests funds to obtain a C-H-N-(O-S) Elemental Analyzer. A
C-H-N-(O-S) analyzer of the type requested is required to answer many basic
questions relating to physiological, cellular and molecular biology with respect
to bioenergetics, reproduction, ecophysiology and life history. Some specific
examples include the effects of changing water quality on shellfish examples
include the effects of changing water quality on shellfish physiology, the
characterization of prey food quality for predation experiments, the
establishment of relationships between physiological traits of genetic stocks of
various species, the quantification of changes in nutritional characteristics of
algae and marsh plants, etc.
