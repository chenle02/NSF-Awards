Abstract

Award: DMS-0603850 Principal Investigator: Steve Zelditch

Global harmonic analysis is concerned with the impact of global geometry,
particularly the geodesic flow, on the behavior of eigenfunctions, eigenvalues
and waves on a Riemannian manifold. By comparison, local harmonic analysis uses
only local analysis on small balls. As an example of the impact of global
geometry, ergodicity of the geodesic flow implies the uniform distribution of
eigenfunctions in the unit cotangent bundle. A new result in this direction is
part of the proposal: ergodicity of the geodesic flow can be used to determine
the asymptotics of the complex nodal hypersurface of eigenfunctions. In another
direction, sup norms of eigenfunctions are related to existence of focal points
for the geodesic flow and to the first return map on geodesic directions at the
focal point (a joint project with C. Sogge and J. Toth). Asymptotic geometry
aims to apply similar methods to study problems in complex geometry, in
particular to the program of Yau, Tian, and Donaldson to study approximation of
all hermitian metrics on a positive line bundle by Bergman metrics. A joint
project with J. Song is to use asymptotics of Bergman kernels on toric varieties
to study a problem of Phong-Sturm on how the geometry of the symmetric space of
Bergman metrics of height N approaches the Monge-Ampere geodesic geometry of the
full infinite dimensional space of hermitian metrics. In another direction, an
ongoing joint project with B. Shiffman is to study statistical algebraic
geometry of high degree varieties as the degree tends to infinity. This has
applications in string theory (joint work with M. Douglas).

Both topics involve the application of ideas and methods regarding the relation
of classical and quantum mechanics to geometry and analysis. In each area there
is a small "Planck's constant" which tends to zero. In the global analysis of
eigenfunctions, it is one over the eigenvalue; in geometry it is the degree of a
polynomial. As the "Planck constant" tends to zero, analytic objects (quantum
mechanical) such as eigenfunctions or Bergman kernels tend to geometric objects
(classical mechanics), which are much easier to understand. Physicists,
engineers and mathematicians have been studying the relations between classical
and quantum mechanics for almost a hundred years now, but the relations are so
difficult that fundamental problems remain. To take a venerable example,
Chladnyi first demonstrated two hundred years ago that, if one puts sand on a
vibrating drum, the sand will move to the "nodal line". Despite the two hundred
years, no one knows how nodal lines snake around on general drums. One project
above is to determine the "complex" nodal line when billiards played on the drum
move in a chaotic way. Thus if one "thickens" the nodal line in complex
directions, one can understand how it snakes around on chaotic drum heads.
