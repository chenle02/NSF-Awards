The purpose of this project is to build an educational infrastructure that will
involve the computational science research community, the Center for Research on
Parallel Computation (CRPC), the NSF Metacenter, and the state and regional high
performance computing centers in a national endeavor to facilitate the
transition to parallel computing by the science and engineering user community.
This effort includes the identification, development and packaging of
appropriate curricula and course materials by the CRPC and distribution of those
materials to the staff of national, state and regional supercomputer centers,
which will teach courses to the end users. Materials will be taught to the
supercomputer staff members at workshops designed and staffed by the CRPC.
Materials will be distributed to the general user community via the Internet
(Mosaic and other network interfaces) and CD-Rom.
