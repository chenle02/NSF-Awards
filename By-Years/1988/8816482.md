The project concerns the study of small clusters of rare gas atoms; most
importantly, He clusters. The "charge seeded expansion" method of producing Ar,
Kr and Ne clusters will be used to study the "magic numbers" or highly
structured mass spectrum generated by this method, while a separate He cluster
source is developed. The structure and dynamics of He clusters will be studied
(once produced) as a function of the number of atoms in the droplet. Using the
dielectric resonance of an ion in a liquid drop, the dependence of the drop
radius on mass and the dissipative behavior of drops will be studied. These data
will provide information concerning the onset of superfluidity in He clusters of
microscopic size.
