This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support four research projects in the Department of
Mathematics at Columbia University: Computational Studies of Automorphic Forms,
directed by Isaac Efrat, Dorian Goldfeld, Herve Jacquet, Peter Sarnak, and
Andrew Winkler; Accurate Perturbative Bounds in Dynamical Systems, directed by
David Rana; Geometric study of Three-Manifolds, directed by Craig Hodgson; and
Presentations and Fundamental Domains for Arithmetic Kleinian Groups, directed
by Ted Chinburg.
