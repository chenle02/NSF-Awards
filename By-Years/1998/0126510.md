Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project sets up a web-based
resource center at Alabama State University using adaptations of WeBWork and
WWWAssign, to strengthen the algebraic and computational skills of students, and
to make WeBWork and WWWAssign available to regional colleges and high schools.
WeBWork and WWWAssign are adapted and used in conjunction with other methods to
provide and collect information through the Internet to offer college
mathematics homework assignments and college and high school mathematics algebra
review and practice modules across the web. The project has the following
outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;(a) WeBWork is adapted in mathematics courses of all levels
at our institution.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Homework assignments and tests are offered in
the resource center in electronic form using WeBWork and/or WWWAssign, with
automatic grading and reporting of scores to instructors and immediate feedback
to students.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Web-based review materials containing WeBWork
practice problem sets are written to accompany the assignments and tests so that
students who encounter difficulties can review and practice the material between
attempts. &lt;br/&gt;(d) Web-based practice tests are created.&lt;br/&gt;(e)
Workshops are conducted and assistance is provided for regional postsecondary
and secondary teachers interested in learning about the WeBWork and WWWAssign
systems.&lt;br/&gt;Ongoing evaluation and dissemination programs also are fully
integrated into the project.&lt;br/&gt;
