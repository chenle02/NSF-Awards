Climate change is having a profound effect on many organisms. The purpose of
this project is to develop, analyze, and use a new class of mechanistic models,
integrodifference equations, that include growth, dispersal, and climate-driven
range shifts in order to study and predict the effects of climate change on
animal and plant populations. Integrodifference equations reduce the problem of
determining the persistence of a population in a changing environment to a
simple eigenvalue problem. Researchers will analyze the effects of climate-
driven range shifts on age- and stage-structured populations with complex life
histories, perform analyses of two-dimensional range-shift models on realistic
geometries, build and analyze models with explicit habitat quality functions,
and build and analyze range-shift models that contain interspecific
interactions. Sensitivity analyses will be performed in order to determine which
demographic stages have the strongest influence on persistence in a changing
environment.

The Earth is getting warmer. In response to this warming, many species have
shifted their ranges poleward in latitude or upward in elevation. The purpose of
this project is to develop mathematical models and tools that will help us
determine which species can continue to keep pace with climate-driven habitat
shifts and which species are at risk. Researchers will start with models that
include growth and demography, dispersal, and climate-driven spatial shifts and
extend these models to include age and stage structure, complicated life
histories, population interactions, habitat quality, and realistic geometries.
These extensions will help us more accurately assess the effects of climate
change on animal and plant populations.
