Dr. Elliot Bernstein is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate reaction intermediates isolated in very cold
molecular clusters. This research is of fundamental importance in assessing the
influence which various solvents have on reacting solutes during a chemical
reaction. Bimolecular chemical reactions in isolated van der Waals clusters will
be studied using time of flight mass spectroscopy, fluorescence excitation,
dispersed emission, and phosphorescence excitation techniques. The reactions of
interest are photoinduced and can be classified as: 1) solvent assisted and
stabilized electron transfer, 2) addition to substituted ethylenes, and 3)
aromatic ring substitutions. Nanosecond time resolved experiments will be
performed to determine cluster structure and energy levels, to identify the
potentially reactive systems, and to characterize the product and transition
state systems. Cluster reaction dynamics will be investigated through picosecond
time correlated single photon counting and various two color pump/probe
techniques. Theoretical studies of these cluster reactions will involve an
extension of the RRKM calculations which Bernstein has previously applied to
bimolecular cluster reactions.
