This is a proposal for funds to acquire two ultracentrifuges and rotors for use
by four of the seven laboratories at the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
Department of Plant Biology, which are involved in research in molecular
biology, biochemistry, and physiology. Projects include understanding how
proteins are sorted to and within the chloroplast, how cells perceive and
respond to nutrient deprivation, how photosynthetic cells alter their light
harvesting apparatus in response to changes in light quality, how red and blue
light effects photomorphogenic changes, how light affects ionic fluxes, and how
photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism is regulated. In these four
laboratories the centrifuge is the most heavily used piece of equipment. Most
experiments require the use of ultracentrifuges.
