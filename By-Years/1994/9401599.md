9401599 Liu This project is to investigate systematically the interaction
between the Tropical and subtropical thermocline circulation's by developing
both a general circulation model and analytical models. Two main topics will be
investigated: the exchange of water between the tropical-subtropical system and
what determines the structure of the mean equatorial thermocline. The research
is directed towards providing a valuable contribution to the understanding of
the climate variability both for the Atlantic and Pacific regions.
