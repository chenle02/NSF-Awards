This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Hanley's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. The thrust of Dr. Hanley's research is the use of
sophisticated surface spectroscopies to examine the energetic particle-surface
interaction. The experiments will investigate chemical reactions of molecules on
surfaces induced by energetic ion and atom bombardment. Vibrational and other
non-destructive surface spectroscopies will be used to correlate bombardment
induced surface reactions with molecular mass spectra observed by secondary ion,
secondary neutral and fast bombardment mass spectrometry. These experiments will
be performed on models of adsorbate-covered surfaces, organic solids, and
multicomponent surfaces formed by vapor deposition on single crystal surfaces
under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The role of projectile charge state and
chemistry will also be examined. These experiments will attempt to determine the
basic physical processes leading to ejection of secondary molecular ions and
neutrals ultimately leading to an improved interpretation of mass spectra of
real systems typically probed by energetic particle bombardment.
