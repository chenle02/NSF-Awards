Our society is in the midst of a great revolution due to Big Data. This
revolution affects every aspect of our lives from online to offline, from
business to science. Privacy today is both a major social concern and an
intellectually challenging problem; the problem is exacerbated by the Big Data
trend. Differential privacy is a principled approach to achieving the goal of
privacy which, conceived as it was in the context of large databases, is
especially suited for Big Data. This workshop will bring together researchers on
differential privacy with the world's leading Big Data theoreticians to
congregate at the Simons Institute in the Fall of 2013 to create a rare
opportunity for true breakthroughs both in Privacy and in Big Data.

The Simons Institute will be hosting a special semester on "Theoretical
foundations of Big Data analysis" during Fall of 2013, which will bring together
several experts in analysis of big data. The purpose of the workshop will be on
the one hand to develop new differential-privacy-inspired techniques for
allowing large-scale data analysis without threatening the privacy of
individuals, and on the other hand for the two communities to explore together
the statistical concepts and techniques which are at the basis of both. The
four-day workshop on "Big Data and Differential Privacy" will take place
December 11-14, 2013 at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing,
located in Berkeley, CA.
