Muscle contraction requires a cyclic interaction between myosin heads and actin.
According to current views this process involves some changes in the geometry or
the structure of the actomyosin complex during the force generating step of the
contractile cycle. The goal of this project is to arrive at a detailed
description of the structures and functions of myosin and actin, their
interaction with each other and the regulation of this interaction. Most models
for muscle contraction show that the force in a muscle cell is generated through
cyclic interaction of myosin crossbridges with actin. Although the molecular
details of this process are largely unknown, impressive progress has been made
in the recent past in elucidating the structures of myosin and actin.
