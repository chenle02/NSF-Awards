9731213 Wilson This award provides funds to support a six month research visit
by Dr. W. Stephen Wilson, Department of Mathematics, Johns Hopkins University,
for collaboration with Professor Goro Nishida, Division of Mathematics, Graduate
School of Science, Kyoto University, Japan. The collaborators will attempt to
prove a conjecture on the unstable Brown-Peterson homology of spaces. This
conjecture was first made nearly 20 years ago in the USA by American and
Japanese mathematicians. In recent collaboration between U.S. and Japanese
mathematicians, significant progress has been made on the problem, and the PI
and his collaborators have sketched an approach which is expected to resolve the
question. The conjecture states that n-dimensional elements in the Brown-
Peterson homology of a space are an n-th type of torsion free. The collaborators
will translate the problem into classifying spaces for a cohomology version and
then prove various homotopy decomposition theorems Solution of the problem will
be of mutual benefit to U.S. and Japanese mathematicians. This project is
supported under the Science Fellowship Program between the National Science
Foundation and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership. ***
