The goals of the CH4 component of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS)
Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions (LAII) Flux Study are to: 1) produce regional
CH4 flux estimates, and 2) perform field experiments that will elucidate the
controls and feedback on CH4 and CO2 emission from tundra environments. The
region flux estimates will be made using time series chamber measurements of CH4
flux at permanent sites along a transect covering a range of physiographic
provinces. The locations and times of measurements will be coordinated with
atmospheric CO2 studies of, with vegetation mapping studies, and with soil
chemistry studies. The field experiments will involve manipulations of soil
temperature and water table level, jar and core experiments at a range of
temperatures and moisture contents, and a series of isotope labelling
experiments. The experiments will provide information on CH4 oxidation to
temperature and moisture changes, and the role of recently-fixed carbon in CH4
and CO2 emissions. These experiments will be performed in collaboration with
other LAII-Flux investigators.
