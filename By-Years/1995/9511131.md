This is a collaborative proposal with George Loewenstein of Carnegie-Mellon
University (SBR-9520891). The PIs propose to investigate the lack of personal
consistency in patience across choice situations. The authors hypothesize that
traditional economic discounting models are inadequate to explain such
inconsistency. Instead the PIs propose that temporarily high discount rates are
promoted by situations in which transient factors influence the desirability of
choice alternatives. Such factors include drive states and emotions, for
example. The following four hypotheses encompass their theory. First, changes in
immediate transient factors have a greater impact on behavior than changes in
delayed transient factors. Second, our actual response to a transient factor is
greater than anticipated. Third, we underestimate the impact of future transient
factors on our future behavior. Fourth, people underestimate the impact of
transient factors on the behavior of other persons. The authors propose to do
four studies, each of which will manipulate a transient factor. The basic
paradigm is to offer participants a choice of an inferior option now or a
superior one later. The PIs will observe how the choice behavior is influenced
by varying the transient motivation for the options.
