Donald Marshall This proposal requests support for a conference that will be
held at the University of Washington-Seattle from March 27-29, 1998. The
objective of the conference is to give needed exposure to a number of important
topics in the theory of Several Complex Variables that have been relatively
overlooked on the programs of recent national and international meetings in that
field. Specifically, the conference targets the large research area associated
with the analysis and geometry of Cauchy-Riemann manifolds and also seeks to
focus attention upon emerging connections of SCV to such subjects as symplectic
geometry, PDE and global analysis.
