This project is supporting expansion and continuation of a successful series of
faculty development workshops run by the Geosciences Division of the Council on
Undergraduate Research (GeoCUR). These workshops are held in conjunction with
annual and sectional meetings of the Geological Society of America (GSA) and the
American Geophysical Union (AGU), and at the national meeting of the Association
of American Geographers (AAG). They are designed to help faculty develop and
sustain undergraduate research programs. This project is making these workshops
available to a wider audience, as well as serving as a means of leadership
development for rising and current geoscience faculty. Alumni of past GeoCUR
workshops are now actively involved in leadership positions within CUR, and they
are facilitators for this series of workshops.
