The research project exploits relations among (1) discrete integrable models in
statistical mechanics, (2) representation theory of affine and quantum affine
algebras, and (3) the combinatorics of dynamical systems such as cluster
algebras. From the physical point of view, the project has applications to wall
crossing formulas in string theory and the wave functions of quasi-particles
responsible for the quantum Hall effect in condensed matter physics. The
problems investigated include fermionic constructions of affine Lie algebra
modules and their fusion products; Applications of methods from statistical
physics to give explicit solutions for the cluster variables in cluster algebras
related to discrete integrable systems such as T-systems or Q-systems, thereby
giving proofs of the relevant positivity conjectures; and non-commutative
generalizations of these systems, related to the Kontsevich non-commutative
wall-crossing formula, or the quantum cluster algebras which describe quantum
discrete Liouville or Hirota equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is at
the boundary between mathematics and physics. It seeks to apply techniques from
statistical mechanics to solving problems in combinatorics and representation
theory of affine Lie algebras and their quantization. The prime characteristic
of these problems is integrability, that is, they arise from systems with a high
degree of symmetry. Often this symmetry allows for finding explicit solutions in
the form of physical partition functions, which are manifestly positive sums
over configurations of a system. This positivity property is frequently a
conjectured property of the underlying mathematical objects.
