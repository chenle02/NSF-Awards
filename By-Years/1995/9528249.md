Braun, Douglas 95-28249 Dr. Braun's project is a combination of both observation
and theory to determine and interpret the characteristics of acoustic scattering
and absorption by solar active regions. The measurements include a database
consisting of recent high quality solar observations carried out at the
geographic South Pole in 1990 and 1994 and on Kitt Peak. To be determined are
the complete acoustic scattering properties for a wide variety of active regions
with different surface morphology and at different stages of their evolution.
The theoretical effort will be to model acoustic scattering by sunspot flux
tubes, improving on the PI's present model with a more realistic treatment of
the effects of the magnetic fields in the sunspot scatterer. Finally, using both
theoretical modeling and observations, the scattering signatures produced by
completely submerged inhomogeneities will be explored. ***
