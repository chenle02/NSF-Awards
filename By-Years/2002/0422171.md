This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will
solve challenging problems in processing, tracking, and communicating vibration
recordings from remote locations in pipelines to determine whether a pipeline
has suffered an integrity breach. The solutions include design of new battery-
powered, wireless-enabled, rugged field instruments for the harsh pipeline
environment, and the development of advanced signal processing methods to
characterize and interpret the complex acoustic &lt;br/&gt;energy in pipelines.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research project will be to
provide the industry with state-of-the-art, cost-effective equipment that will
allow owners and operators to protect their investment in pipeline
infrastructure and to meet the mandated pipeline integrity management
regulations safely, efficiently and effectively. The societal impact will be
increased personal safety through faster and more accurate inspection methods
and the preservation of continued affordable energy transportation into the
future. &lt;br/&gt;
