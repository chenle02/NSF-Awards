With support from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor William M. Jones of the
Univerisity of Florida will continue his work to examine the rearrangements of
alkyl groups from metals to carbene centers. The rearrangment will be attempted
with first and second row late transitions metals by using ligand strain energy
to drive the reverse of the migratory insertion reaction of the carbene. The
synthesis of stable carbynes will be attempted using the same strategy. In
addition the transition metal complexes of strained allenes, their valence
isomers, and tropynes will be synthesized and studied. %%% The fundamentally
important migrations of molecular fragments from metals to carbon will be
studied. These migrations are the key steps in numerous important processes
including the Fischer-Tropsch reaction which converts carbon monooxide and
hydrogen into hydrocarbons which could potentially be used as fuel. The
practical limits of this reaction will be explored by examining the migrations
of various groups to form novel and isolable organometallic compounds.
