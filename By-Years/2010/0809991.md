The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Donald Land of the University of
California at Davis. Prof. Land's research program focuses on the development of
an overlayer-enhanced attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared
(OE-ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy technique for the study of solid interfaces that are
immersed in aqueous fluids. This technique offers unique complementary
capabilities to currently used surface spectroscopic methods like surface
enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Sum Frequency Generation (SFG)
Spectroscopy. Prof. Land and his students will perform detailed experimental and
modeling studies to optimize the performance of this unique spectroscopy to
facilitate its applications for the characterization of biomolecules that are
adsorbed to the surface of thin films. The study will provide an excellent
educational opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to carry
out a spectroscopic method development project with the potential to greatly
impact studies involving interactions between biomolecules on surfaces and at
interfaces.
