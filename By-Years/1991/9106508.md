With this Grant for Exploratory Research from the Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Professor Davis will study the dissociation and addition
reactions of C60, called buckminsterfullerene or fullerite, accelerated to high
relative translational energies in a crossed supersonic beam apparatus. The
dynamics of C60 by itself, in a Van der Waals cluster, or with adsorbed metal
atoms will be studied for the effects that substituents produce. Collisions with
different target molecules will also be investigated. %%% Since the discovery of
the molecule C60 (buckminsterfullerene or fullerite), chemists have wondered
about the physical and chemical properties of this soccer ball-shaped molecule,
since, because of its high symmetry, it is expected to be unusually stable with
respect to chemical reaction. A recently disclosed method for making large
quantities of C60 allows this unique species to be studied by a wide variety of
techniques. This current study will help to answer a large number of questions
about the properties of fullerite in particular and will help form a basis for
understanding fullerenes in general.
