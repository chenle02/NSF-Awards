The very general problem of solving non-linear systems of equations efficiently
has many important applications, in virtually every area of science and
engineering. Steven Smale and his students and collaborators will use methods of
geometry, especially Newton's method and path following, to study their
relevance to these problems, with the aim of eventually leading to substantial
reduction in costs of computation.
