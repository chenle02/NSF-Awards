This interdisciplinary research project is concerned with the fields of chemical
engineering and biology and involves isolation of proteins from
hyperthermophilic bacteria. Study of biomolecules from these novel
microorganisms requires creative approches to optimizing growth, separating
bioproducts, and isolating proteins. Using a blend of two purification schemes,
affinity chromatography and high liquid chromotography, in a recently developed
technique - high performance liquid affinity chromatography (HPLAC) - selected
proteins from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles will be isolated and purified.
In this combination, advantage is taken of the selectivity of the affinity
system and the speed and high resolution of the liquid system. The use of the
HPLAC technique is expected to eliminate the high protein losses associated with
multistep purification. The stability of proteins from hyperthermophilic
bacteria is of great interest in optimizing high temperature reactions in
industry.
