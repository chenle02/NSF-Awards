The problems comprising the project are (1) to study moduli spaces in real
algebraic geometry as real hyperbolic orbifolds, which this is possible, with
particular emphasis on the real forms of the Deligne-Mostow quotients of the
complex hyperbolic space; (2) to prove that the moduli space of K3 surfaces with
a polarization of given degree has contractible universal cover, and a similar
result for the complement of the complex hyperplane arrangement associated to an
arbitrary Coxeter group; (3) to try to construct complex hyperbolic reflection
groups in arbitrarily large dimensions, or prove that they do not exist; and (4)
to see if the monster simple group manifests itself in a certain simple way in
terms of a certain quotient of complex hyperbolic 13-space. The common thread in
these projects is the role in algebraic geometry of discrete groups acting on
Hermitian symmetric spaces like the ball and the type IV domains. Besides these
discrete groups, there are a number of other important groups involved, like the
fundamental groups of hyperplane complements, and certain quotients of these
fundamental groups (perhaps including the monster).

The study of symmetry is called group theory; a group is the collection of all
self-transformations of a picture, pattern, etc., that leave the picture,
pattern, etc. alone. The focus is on the transformation, for example, the act of
rotating a picture around a point in the plane. If the picture looks exactly the
same before and after the rotation, then it has rotational symmetry. To
emphasize this point of view we say that the group "acts" on the picture. There
are lots of different sorts of objects with group actions, including some that
are difficult of visualize but are still very important in physics and
mathematics. One of these difficult-to-visualize objects is called complex
hyperbolic space, and the possible ways that groups can act on complex
hyperbolic space have been studied by many mathematicians since the 19th
century. The easiest-to-understand transformations of complex hyperbolic space
are called "complex reflections", which (despite the name) are a sort of
rotation around an axis. Groups that are generated by this kind of
transformation play a privileged role in the field of algebraic geometry,
helping to explain certain patterns which appear when studying some important
objects, including what are called "binary quantics" and "K3 surfaces". The
investigator has also noticed some more patterns, currently unexplained, which
may connect complex reflections to a famous group called the "monster" simple
group. The specific technical problems to be addressed by the project all
attempt to advance our understanding of groups generated by complex reflections,
acting on complex hyperbolic space.
