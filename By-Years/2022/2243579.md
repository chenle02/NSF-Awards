The project supports travel to the 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) Cloud Summit at George Mason University Campus, Fairfax,
Virginia, October 21-22, 2022. The IEEE Cloud Summit provides a unique
international forum for researchers, developers, and practitioners to present
cutting-edge research and best practices and to exchange ideas and views on the
current trends and technical challenges related to Cloud Computing, Fog
Computing, Internet of Things, and Edge Computing as well as their applications
for societal benefit. The unique aspect of the IEEE Cloud Summit is that it will
provide participants with a venue to share ideas and learn from academic and
industry leaders. The conference's unique aspects, industrial tutorials, and
hands-on experience will significantly benefit the
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge shared and advanced at these
conferences has practical and meaningful application to many tools used in
research, as well as to the ethical, cultural, and social ramifications of cloud
computing technology. This grant allows the participation of students who would
otherwise be unable to attend the conference and extends the impact of research
presented to a broad audience of young researchers from across the country. IEEE
is an open access organization, and all research and results presented and
published at these events are freely available to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
