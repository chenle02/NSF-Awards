Lilja Automated assignment of separate loop iterations to different processors
is a powerful technique for scheduling programs to run on parallel computers.
This project is investigating four research approaches to loop scheduling:
investigation of processor allocation strategies, minimization of time in loop-
control critical sections, techniques for scheduling loops with large but
regular execution time variations, and adaptive techniques for minimizing memory
reference effects. Research methods include simulation and measurement of
prototype implementations on several parallel computers.
