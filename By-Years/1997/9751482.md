Computer-aided design tools and rapid prototyping methodologies are no longer
considered exotic in nature but, rather, fundamental concepts of the engineerilg
profession. These tools enhance, rather than supplant, a sound theoretical
background. Students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department
receive this sound theoretical background but had not received the practical
background necessary to bridge the gap between education and industrial
practice. This bridge is particularly necessary at the university, where more
than 40 percent of the ECE undergraduate students are part-time students who
have full-time industrial jobs. In these jobs, students are already contributing
to the field in their roles as technicians, engineering assistants, and
cooperative education students. An informal survey of high technology companies
in the area shows an apparent consensus for an increased emphasis on teaching
computer-aided design techniques at universities. At the same time the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is calling for the
inculcation of design content throughout the undergraduate engineering
curriculum. The rapid prototyping facility that this project provides meets the
needs of the industrial and accreditation requirements. The capability is used
in multiple undergraduate courses, including the computer engineering senior
capstone sequence, and in undergraduate research. *
