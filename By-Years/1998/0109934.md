0109934 &lt;br/&gt;Baumann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does peer review science insure
that science is of interest only to "peers"? Is peer reviewed science performed
by mission oriented agencies (e.g. EPA, USDA &amp; USGS) of interest only to
employees of the agency or their disciplinary mission? Is the scientific
curiosity of university faculty of interest to anyone other than the curious
faculty member? Questions, such as the above, have been and continue to be asked
by the public and their elected representatives as society faces increasingly
complex water management decisions and science seems incapable of providing
relevant input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCOWR is proposing to organize a day-long
series of sessions at its 2001 annual meeting in Utah to examine past and
current management method enployed to plan, review, and conduct water research
as well as evaluate the relevance of water research findings to society's need
for new knowledge to support increasingly complex water management decision-
making. A Water Resources Update issue will be produced from the day-long
sessions as well as a summary dialogue paper for the dialogue section of the
journal of the American Water Resources Association and /or EOS.&lt;br/&gt;
