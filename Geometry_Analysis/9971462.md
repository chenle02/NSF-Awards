Abstract

Award: DMS-9971462 Principal Investigator: Terrence J. Napier

A complex manifold X is said to be holomorphically convex if, for every
infinite subset S without limit points in X, there is a holomorphic function f
on X which is unbounded on S. The principal investigator plans to work on
holomorphic convexity properties of coverings of projective varieties. He also
plans to work on problems concerning Lefschetz type theorems and the structure
of complete Kahler manifolds which have been partly motivated by the study of
covering spaces. He proposes to apply recent advances in the theory of singular
metrics to these problems.

Holomorphic functions on regions in the complex number plane (or on more general
complex spaces) are the natural analogues of differentiable functions on the
real number line from differential calculus. A very broad, deep, and old problem
is to determine how the geometric structure of a (complex) space is related to
its holomorphic structure. This question has motivated a large amount of work in
mathematics and has itself been motivated by work in many fields (for example,
physics). Kahler manifolds are spaces in which the (infinitesimal) holomorphic
structure is connected with the (infinitesimal) geometric structure in a natural
way. Holomorphic convexity is an analogue of geometric convexity (for example, a
region in the plane is geometrically convex if any line segment connecting two
points in the region lies entirely within the region). It has been known for
forty years that, for a noncompact complex manifold, holomorphic convexity is a
strong condition which tells one a great deal about the holomorphic structure.
Thus a natural question in the context of the broader problem mentioned above is
when is a Kahler manifold holomorphically convex?
