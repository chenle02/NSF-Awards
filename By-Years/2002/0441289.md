The Lawrence Hall of Science will host a follow-up conference to the January,
2004 conference of the National Coalition for Science in After-school. The goal
of this 2nd conference is to take the emerging National Coalition for Science in
After-school further, bringing in additional organizations and points of view,
to take the vision the next step into action plans that will establish an
infrastructure, a research agenda and framework, an advocacy campaign and a plan
for sustainability that will include further networking among participants. The
conference will contribute to the enhancement of science education for the more
than ten percent of the Nation's youth who currently participate in after-school
programs, many of whom are least well served in the formal educational system.
The conference will bring together leaders in science education and after-school
programs to combine their best thinking about ways to share current ideas and to
create new partnerships, models, research initiatives and organizational
structures to advance their work. The conference will allow current and
potential leaders in STEM and after-school organizations to inform one another,
share best practices and form strategic alliances. In addition to traditional
dissemination mechanisms (website, listserv, conference report), the conference
will result in an action plan that includes extending membership in the
Coalition to additional organizations and its messages to new audiences,
including those who work with students with disabilities, community
organizations and parent advocates. In addition to Lawrence Hall, the lead
organizations in the Coalition are the Exploratorium, TERC, the Children's Aid
Society, the National Afterschool Association and The After School Corporation.
