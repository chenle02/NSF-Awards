This award will support research on dynamic properties of polymers, including
dissipative processes. The project builds upon research on the equilibrium
properties of ferroelectric random copolymers, which is currently being funded
by NSF. The U.S. investigator is Philip Taylor of Case Western Reserve
University and the Venezuelan investigator is Rafael Rangel of the Instituto
Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC). Dissipative processes involved
in equilibrium states are of increasing importance. In this project, Taylor's
experience with equilibrium processes, statistical mechanics of chain molecules,
and polymer physics will be combined with Rangel's experience with dissipative
processes, non-equilibrium systems, Ginzburg-Landau theory, and multifractality.
The analytical work will initially be in Venezuela and the computational work
will be in the United States, where the availability of the Ohio Supercomputer
Center will be advantageous.
