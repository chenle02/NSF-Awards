This project will study the complexity of interactive computational models. One
goal of this research is to improve known results on the complexity of models
such as interactive proof systems, multi-prover systems, and games against
nature. Research on these models has applications to problems in optimization
and automata theory, and in understanding properties of some types of stochastic
processes, such as their rate of convergence to absorbing states. Another goal
is to address a major question in theoretical computer science--how randomness
and nondeterminism help in computation.
