The study proposed here is aimed at evaluating the importance of subgrid-scale
land-atmosphere interactions at different spatial and temporal scales. The
Colorado State University Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (CSU-RAMS) will
be used for this purpose. The domain simulated by this state-of-the-art
numerical atmospheric model can vary from a few kilometers to a few thousand of
kilometers. Thus, subgrid-scale processes in a single grid of a GCM, for
instance, can be investigated at the grid scale with this model. Funds are being
provided to augment the project supported by Climate Dynamics (NSF) with an
experienced post doctoral researcher plus supplies.
