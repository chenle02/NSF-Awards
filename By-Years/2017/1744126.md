The Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing will organize three workshops
at UC Berkeley as part of the Simons Institute program on The Brain and
Computation. The conceptual affinity between the brain and the computer dates
back to the mid-20th century, as the pioneering theoreticians of both fields
(von Neumann, Turing, McCulloch, Pitts, Barlow) were beginning to leverage their
interests in the other field to gain a better understanding of their own. Both
fields have exploded in the past decades in terms of new knowledge, methodology,
and prestige. But as they have become more technical and sophisticated, they
have also grown further apart. These workshops aim to rekindle the affinity
between these two fields, recognizing the enormous potential for what could be
achieved in a unified research effort. They will bring together groups of
outstanding researchers in both Brain Science and Theoretical Computer Science
to attack some of the most important current problems in Brain Science that
particularly require joint scrutiny and collaboration: Representation, Coding,
and Computation in Neural Circuits; Targeted Discovery in Brain Data; and
Computational Theories of the Brain. Each of the three workshops will bring
together a group of outstanding researchers in both Brain Science and
Theoretical Computer Science. These workshops will be open to all potential
participants, and video recordings of presentations will be distributed to the
public for comment and engagement. The organizers will welcome students to
attend the workshop, and will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of
backgrounds to participate.
