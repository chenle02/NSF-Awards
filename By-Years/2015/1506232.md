Cosmic rays are highly energetic sub-atomic particles from space that travel at
velocities near the speed of light. The origin and acceleration mechanism for
ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which likely come from extreme astrophysical
phenomena outside our galaxy, are currently unknown. The Pierre Auger
Observatory is the largest cosmic ray detector ever operated, with an
instrumented area of more than 3000 square kilometers. Built in Malargue,
Argentina by an international collaboration, the Pierre Auger Observatory was
designed to study the origin and interactions of the highest energy particles in
the Universe. The Observatory has been operating since 2008. This award provides
partial funding for continued operations. The Observatory will continue to be an
important venue for the training of students and postdocs and will promote
public outreach initiatives through its Visitor Center. The public release of
online data for school projects around the world will be expanded by
implementing new tools for easy visualization and analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pierre Auger Observatory measures the energy spectrum,
composition, and arrival direction of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. More than
100,000 events have been detected with energies above 3x10^18 eV. Over the
course of this award, additional measurements, upgraded detectors, larger
statistics, and improved data analysis methods will further advance our
understanding of cosmic ray physics.
