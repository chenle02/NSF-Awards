This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in
the commercialization of high power, large area, deep UV LEDs based on a novel
vertically conducting geometry that is arbitrarily scalable. AlInGaN based deep
UV-B LEDs (Ã« = 300 - 340 nm) have recently been developed and commercialized but
have not reached the performance metrics of shorter wavelength UV-C LEDs, or
longer wavelength visible LEDs. These devices have been able to penetrate some
niche markets but because the output power is far below that which is required
for penetration of the largest UV-B market segments (e.g. biomedical
instrumentation and industrial curing) they have been limited in their reach.
Visible LEDs faced a similar challenge 5-10 years ago and it was recognized that
to compete with existing technology, high power large area LEDs were required.
This approach has been limited for deep UV LEDs because the insulating UV
transparent substrates combined with relatively large resistance AlGaN materials
result in current crowding and non-uniform device bias when geometry is scaled
up. To address this challenge, the company is developing vertically conducting
large area LEDs with expected minimum output powers of 10 mW per 1 mm x 1 mm
device.

Deep UV light emitting diodes represent a new opportunity for commercialization
of semiconductor products for component and systems use. U.S. based
manufacturers have succeeded in competing globally in the visible LED market
with two of the five largest LED manufacturers being based in the U.S. with two
in Japan and one in Germany. This optoelectronic field continues to grow each
year and if the outcome of this effort is successful its outcome will contribute
to the advancement of a novel light source. The creation of this company will
capitalize on the high-tech research that is being performed at the University
Of South Carolina by providing an environment in which to transition this
knowledge into a commercial setting as part of efforts to transition the local
economy from traditional industries such as textile manufacturing.
