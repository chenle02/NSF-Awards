This SBIR Phase I research project will demonstrate an opto-fluidic chip-scale
bio-sensor system for label-free, high-throughput, real-time monitoring and
detection of dynamics of multitude of biochemical reactions in small volumes and
at low cost. Numerous applications urge development of new biological sensors
that provide high-sensitivity and resolution to enable detection of single or
small number of molecules and high-throughput enabled by large numbers of
parallel testing channels to increase test variation spectrum and reduce false
alarms. The proposed approach significantly enhances the biosensor sensitivity
and resolution by utilizing the results of research on novel polarization
sensitive excitation and detection of surface plasmon polariton resonance in
metal films perforated by 2D nanohole arrays made of optimized metal-dielectric
composite nanostructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This bio-sensor system will have
direct technological and commercial impact because it provides unique
performance characteristics (e. g., label-free, high throughput screening, high-
sensitivity) at low cost. The proposed bio-sensor system will also impact
detection of bio-chemical agents in military, homeland security, agriculture,
and environment monitoring applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
