A more comprehensive and current approach to the teaching of undergraduates in
Biology and Chemistry is being made possible with the addition of a High
Performance Liquid Chromatography System (HPLC). HPLC is recognized as an
instrumental technique of major importance in both biology and chemistry. The
project director, who has been actively involved in the development of HPLC
instrumentation and software, along with his colleagues, is revising the
curriculum in both the biology and chemistry programs so as to provide students
with practical, hands-on experience with this fundamental instrumental
technique. Seven courses in the two departments are being affected by the
project, as well as the independent study and undergraduate research programs.
The HPLC system is complementing existing laboratory instrumentation and
computer equipment, opening up new learning opportunities.
