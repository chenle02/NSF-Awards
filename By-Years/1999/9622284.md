9622284 Govindjee The objective of the proposed research is an investigation of
the development of material models and their computational realizations for
elastomeric composite systems. Results from statistical physics and rigorous
numerical analysis will be used to develop constitutive models that can predict
damage and healing in carbon-black filled elastomers in a fashion that is
amenable to large scale inelastic computations. The fundamental nature of the
research is closely linked to applications and industrial interest and the
results will have applicability beyond the specific class of material being
studied. ***
