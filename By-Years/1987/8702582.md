There are numerous and important areas of human medicine where heat transfer
plays a major role. The study to be performed deals with such an area. A thermal
model of an entire limb will be developed which will take account of a complex
vascular organization. The predictions of the model will be compared with
experiments involving the hand and the arm. If successful, the model will yield
a greatly improved quantitative interpretation of physiological measurements and
will enable more accurate predictions of whole limb heat transfer both for
thermoneutral conditions and conditions of thermal stress.
