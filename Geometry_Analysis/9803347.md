Abstract Proposal: DMS 9803347 Principal Investigator: Shing-Tung Yau We propose
to apply techniques of nonlinear partial differential equations to solve several
problems in geometry: the problem of defining center of gravity, angular
momentum in general space time and their applications to the nonlinear stability
of Schwarzchild solution. The problem of studying coupled Einstein-Dirac
equation and their physical significance. The problem of applying nonlinear
analysis to simplicial complices, including graphs and buildings that can be
used in combinatorial questions and discrete group theory. The problem of
deforming Riemannian metric by using Hamilton's equation and understanding their
long time behavior that may lead to understanding of topology of three
manifolds. We also want to study the space of Lagrangian three manifolds in
Calabi-Yau manifolds whose moduli space will lead to understanding duality
questions in string theory. The success of this proposal will bring in strong
interaction between mathematics and modern and classical physics. Here classical
physics include general relativity, where strong geometrical and analytical
technique play a very important role. Modern physics includes String theory
whose impact on mathematics has been tremendous. The study of nonlinear system
of equations should give a breakthrough in understanding low dimensional
geometry and topology . A thorough understanding of such equations should bring
in new technique to solve difficult problems in applied mathematics. Hopefully,
eventually some fluid equations can be treated by similar technique.
