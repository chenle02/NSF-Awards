Research on the design of feedback control for multiple-time-scale systems will
be conducted. The research addresses both linear and nonlinear systems. Feedback
design for such systems will be decomposed into two separate design problems,
which are solved sequentially. First, a fast controller is designed to meet
design specifications for the fast dynamics. Second, a slow controller is
designed to meet design specifications for the slow dynamics. The research on
linear systems will emphasize the development of the sequential design procedure
for frequency- domain loop-shaping and optimization. As a case study, the
procedure will be applied to the design of autopilot control for the
longitudinal motion of an aircraft. The research on nonlinear systems will
emphasize the derivation of stability conditions using Lyapunov analysis, and
the employment of an integral manifold approach to achieve higher accuracy in
meeting the design specifications.
