This award provides support for approximately 40 students to attend the 2011
American Society of Mechanical Engineers International Mechanical Engineering
Congress and Exposition, which will be held in Denver, Colorado, November 11-17,
2010. Students will be notified of the funding opportunity through a broadly
circulated announcement, and they will be asked to submit a brief resume, a one-
page explanation of why they want to attend the Congress and a supporting
statement from their faculty advisor. Applicants will be selected for support by
a group of faculty based on their interest in attending the Congress, their
understanding of the opportunities that attendance offers, and the letter of
support from their faculty advisor. Students will also be expected to present
their research in a student poster symposium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
expected that this opportunity will enhance the education of the involved
students, who will serve as role models for others as well. A goal in the
selection of the students for support will include diversity, which will further
enhance the benefits of this support.
