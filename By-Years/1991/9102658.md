The biogeochemical cycles of antimony, arsenic, and selenium in the marine
environment are complex, and include processes such as oxidation-reduction
reactions, selective biological uptake, and kinetic controls on their chemical
speciation. However, the potential toxicity of several metalloid species and the
anthropogenic mobilization of these elements by fossil fuel combustion, are
compelling reasons to fully understand the cycling of metalloid in the ocean. Of
the three elements, very few data are available on antimony speciation and
distributions in the open ocean. Selenium and arsenic have been extensively
examined in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but several aspects of their
cycling remain to be elucidated. This research utilizes samples collected from
vertical profiles and horizontal transects in the North and South Atlantic, and
eastern tropical North Pacific. Selective hydride generation methods will be
used to analyze the samples, and the data will be augmented by nutrient and
trace element results from other researchers working at the same stations. The
primary objectives of this research will be: (1) to quantitatively describe the
marine biogeochemical cycle of antimony; (2) to establish whether refractory
organic arsenic compounds that have been found in coastal waters are present in
oligotrophic waters, and if so, their role in the arsenic cycle; (3) to evaluate
whether the chemical speciation of arsenic and antimony responds to suboxic
conditions in the water column; and (4) to determine the fraction of dissolved
selenium which is bound in soluble peptides and proteins.
