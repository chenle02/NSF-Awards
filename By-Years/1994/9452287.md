9452287 Bibby We will develop an optics laboratory to teach modern applied
optical techniques to a spectrum of students ranging from Physics majors to
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering majors. The technical focus of this
project is on optical signal processing and on the use of interferometry. The
experiments that will be developed will emphasize interferometry in optical
metrology and include holography and fiber optics. Two categories of students
will benefit from this project-- upper-level Physics students, who are taking
the main sequence of optics related lab courses, and students from other
disciplines such as Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and
Materials, and Geo-Environmental Engineering, who seek to learn applied optics
as a tool to solve problems in various branches of engineering. Recent advances
in applied optics offer new tools which these students can use to approach a
variety of technical challenges.
