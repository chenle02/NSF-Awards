The NSF Convergence Accelerator program supports use-inspired, team-based,
multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and
will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current high-precision inertial sensors are
bulky and prohibitive, holding back a wide impact, e.g., for self-driving cars,
wearable healthcare devices, and secure navigation in GPS-denied environment.The
goal of this project is to develop the functional inertial sensing modules and
control units and converge on a fully integrated quantum-enhanced inertial
measurement unit (QEIMU) prototype as the end- of-project deliverable.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is in developing a
multilayer silicon nitride platform on which team members will fabricate and
assemble quantum-light sources, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.The QEIMU
prototype will improve key performance metrics for gyroscopes and
accelerometers, including the angle random walk (ARW), sensitivity, and bias by
one-to-two orders of magnitude and, at the same time, enjoy low cost,
compactness, a clear pathway to mass productivity, and robustness. Such unique
features will make the QEIMU widely and readily available for the commercial
markets of self-driving cars, aerospace navigation, and handheld sensing devices
as well as space and defense-oriented applications, thereby creating near-term
and profound societal impacts within 5-10
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The QEIMU module is envisaged to be
installed on 1) autonomous vehicles for secure navigation without GPS signals;
2) mobile devices as a complementary precise indoor positioning technique; and
3) activity recognition systems for medical diagnostics, home monitoring,
assisted living, and sport-related applications. The broader impact of this
project will be on inertial sensors market and their adoption in many markets
that are currently untapped. The impact will also be on engagement and education
of underrepresented groups in quantum technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
