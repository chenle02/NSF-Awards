A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy/Gas Chromatography (FT- IR/GC)
analysis system has been requested. This FT-IR/GC is unique in that it permits
separation, identification, and quantification of isomeric compounds and
selected unstable radical intermediate species, which are either difficult or
impossible to measure using conventional GC and GC/MS techniques. The proposed
system consists of a high performance spectrometer, matched computer post-
processing hardware and software, a gas chromatograph, and an optical fiber
probe to allow in situ measurements of reacting gas composition in different
combustion environments. The instrument package will make the analysis of
certain key unstable combustion intermediates feasible for the first time. As
such, the new FT-IR/GC system will significantly enhance the present diagnostic
capabilities of the Fuels Research Laboratory and increase future research
capabilities and flexibility.
