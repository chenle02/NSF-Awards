This action is to provide funds for the construction of an enclosure to the
National Geotechnical Centrifuge. Centrifuge modeling is a useful tool for
studying a wide variety of geotechnical earthquake engineering problems. The
state of stress and strain in an earth structure is dependent upon the
overburden pressure, which is analogous to the hydrostatic pressure which
increases with depth in a body of water. This overburden pressure is a result of
gravitational loading. When testing a scale model of an earth structure, this
gravitational loading must be correctly scaled, and this requires that gravity
be increased in proportion to the reduction in the scale of the model: a half-
scale model has to be subjected to twice the normal gravity loading. This
increase in gravity loading can be obtained by testing the scale model in a
centrifuge. The National Geotechnical Centrifuge was donated by NASA AMES to the
University of California at Davis. It has been converted for use as a
geotechnical engineering centrifuge, and more recently it was moved to the Davis
campus. It is now operational at the new location, but funds were not available
to provide a roof for the enclosure. As a result, the centrifuge is operating in
the open air, which severely limits the capacity of the machine due to windage
losses: as the arm turns it acts as a large centrifugal fan. These windage
losses are unavoidable, but they can be reduced significantly by appropriate
design of the enclosure. For the National Geotechnical Centrifuge, the open pit
installation performance can be increased from 100 g-tons to 500 g-tons by
installing a suitably designed enclosure. The increased performance provides a
capacity which is sorely needed in the United States. Researchers needing this
capacity must currently perform their tests on a centrifuge in Cambridge,
England. This is both costly and slow. The construction of an enclosure for the
National Geotechnical Centrifuge will provide a facility that will increase
dramatically the experiments that can be performed in geotechnical engineering,
in particular in earthquake engineering.
