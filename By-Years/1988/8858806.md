Dr. De Micheli is studying computer-aided-design (CAD) algorithms and their
implementation in a design system environment. His long-term goal is a hardware
synthesis system that can transform automatically a procedural description of a
hardware design into a geometric description of a VLSI chip suitable for
fabrication. He plans to extend previous research on logic synthesis to
structural synthesis. This involves the automation of specific decisions that a
hardware architect has to take in order to cast an abstract behavior of a
digital system into an interconnection of units performing the given task. The
main issue to be addressed here is that of architectural partitioning--deciding
on tradeoffs in the coarse grain parallelism. Secondly, he will investigate
circuit synthesis for fast VLSI digital computation units. He seeks specialized
synthesis techniques, as well as circuit optimization methods at electrical and
geometric levels of representation. The goal is to synthesize automatically
circuits with minimal computation delay, given limitations of circuit area and
power.
