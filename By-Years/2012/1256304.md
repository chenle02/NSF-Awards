1256304 &lt;br/&gt;Lenhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial
travel support for young researchers to attend the 17th biannual International
Conference on Biopartitioning and Purification (BPP 2013), which will be held in
Newport, RI, October 6-10, 2013. Award funds will be used primarily to subsidize
the travel and registration fees for US students to attend the conference;
similar subsidies may also be made available to US junior faculty attending the
conference. The scientific scope of the conference will include areas such as
thermodynamics of phase formation and the partitioning of biological, molecular
aspects of interactions between biologicals and media, multi-mode
chromatographic processes, high titer processes, affinity-enhanced
bioseparations, purification unit operation modeling and optimization,
rational/high-throughput bioprocess design, particle/virus-like particle
purification, DNA/RNA purification, and emerging bioseparation technologies. The
goal is to define the topical areas as inclusively as possible so as to attract
a wide variety of relevant submissions, select those of highest quality for
inclusion in the program, and then to organize the oral presentations into
cohesive topical sessions. A number of invited keynote lectures by
internationally recognized leaders from both industry and academia will be
invited. Information on the conference will be made available primarily via the
conference website, which is being modeled on that used for BPP 2011
(www.bpp2011.org). The organizers will seek publication of research presented at
the conference in a dedicated issue of a leading journal. BPP 2013 represents an
outstanding opportunity for students to obtain a distinctive perspective over
bioseparations and bioprocessing more generally in an integrated context that is
not limited to an individual unit operation.
