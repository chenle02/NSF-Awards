This CAREER award is supporting research to resolve key questions about the
emissions of N2O (nitrous oxide) to the atmosphere. Both observations and
modeling will be used to help improve the understanding of how agricultural
soils and surrounding waterways contribute to the global problem of rising N2O
levels. The project includes activities and collaborations that bring interest
in scientific research to K-12 students, particularly those who are under-
represented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two questions that are
motivating and guiding the proposed investigation are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Why are
state-of-the-art models and inventories unable to accurately reproduce regional
scale N2O emissions?&lt;br/&gt;2. What are regional-scale controls on current
and future N2O emissions in North America?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this
project, tower and aircraft measurements over soils and waterways encompassing
natural and fertilized lands in the Corn Belt and along the lower Mississippi
River basin will be combined with a regional Lagrangian transport model to
determine contemporary emissions of N2O. Geostatistical modeling will be used to
establish the statistical relationship between variables such as temperature,
precipitation, inundation state, and soil moisture and regional emissions.
