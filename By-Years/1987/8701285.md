Aquatic flowering plants are notoriously difficult to identify because their
morphology varies greatly with differing water levels and other factors of the
environment. Graduate student Thomas Philbrick, under the supervision of faculty
advisor Dr. Gregory Anderson at the Univesity of Connecticut, is studying the
effects of growth conditions on the morphology of 17 North American species of
the aquatic angiosperm genus Callitriche. He is supplementing this morphological
study with biochemical analyses of variation in chloroplast DNA, in order to
identify reliable markers of genetic divergence among species and construct a
robust taxonomy for the group. The results of his study will lead to improved
classification of these plants and better understanding of the evolutionary
history of divergence among the species.
