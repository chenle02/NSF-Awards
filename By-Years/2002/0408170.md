The overall objective of our research program is to build large systems that
display basic cognitive behavior, including self-organization, and on-line
adaptive learning. There are several major components to our program: (1)
Algorithms; (2) Systems integration; (3) Applications; and (4) Implementation.
The research proposed here concentrates on the implementation of these systems
using molecular scale devices. In particular we are proposing to look at the
computational component involved in implementing biologically inspired models
using molecular scale devices. Because of the limited funds and time for an
SGER, we start with Associative Memory (AM), a simple, but powerful model that
forms the basis of most of our more complex models. These approaches could
eventually lead to a fundamental shift in how we build and use computers. Beside
the intellectual outcomes of the research, the broader impact will be achieved
through the dissemination of knowledge of the field of research and the proposed
activities through short thesis projects, internal and public seminars, and
components in on-going courses.
