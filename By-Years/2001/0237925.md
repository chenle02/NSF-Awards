In the past decade, exciting new mathematics and resulting putative experiments
have been proposed that involve quantum mechanics in an essential manner. A
recent technological advance is the development of laser and pulse shaping
techniques. These techniques make it possible to control processes at the atomic
level, where the dynamics evolve according to the laws of quantum
mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is a general
methodology for the control of quantum mechanical system. The theory developed
will have significant impact on promising applications of quantum mechanics. For
example, it will render possible the implementation of quantum information
processing for efficient computation and communication, it will shape chemical
reactions in order to achieve a desired outcome and it will aid the storage and
retrieval of information in memories that approach the molecular size. Apart
from control theoretic aspects, this investigation will shed light on aspects of
the quantum theory that are still not fully understood. These include the nature
of the entanglement with other quantum systems and with the environment, the
characterization of quantum versus classical dynamics and the limits and power
of quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;
