The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the University of
Minnesota will hold a three week conference on Molecular Minimization Aspects of
Large-Scale Optimization. The third week will be devoted to molecular and
structural optimization, in particular, the global minimization problem. The
conference will bring together two scientific communities (the biological,
biochemical and biophysical and the mathematical programmers) which have much to
discuss together but have yet to develop a common language and conceptual
framework. Issues which will be addressed include: 1. New algorithmic advances
for global minimization in protein folding; 2. Global molecular conformation
problems; 3. Electrical impedance tomography; 4. Problems with multiple local
minima; and 5. Parallelization and the use of high performance computers. The
discussions will attempt to (I) identify the precise physical problems from the
practioners point of view; (ii) determine the available methods for attacking
these problems; and, in the long term (iii) narrow the gap between the two.
