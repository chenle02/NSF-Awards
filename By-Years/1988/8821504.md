The astrometric measuring engine (AME) at Lick Observatory is used to measure
the positions of stars on photographic plates. These data have been used to
study the motions of the stars, studies that have important implications for our
knowledge of the structured of our galaxy. The AME has been a very productive
instrument. The National Science Foundation provided the funds for the
acquisition of the AME, and twice in the past has provided funds for partial
support of modifications to the machine. It is now planned to replace the
antiquated, failing PDP-8 computer that now controls AME with a modern, general
purpose, computer. The PDP-8 will be replaced with a Sun 4/200-HM-p14 computer
connected to a VME crate. This system will provide for control of the
positioning of the AME, for data taking with the Reticon detectors, and for on
line data reduction. This new powerful system will allow faster and more
efficient operation, and will allow tasks to be done that are now impossible.
The Sun will also provide computation facilities for members of the Lick
astrometric group. At the same time, some optics on the measuring machine will
also be replaced. This would allow alignment procedures to be done more quickly,
and also allow plates to be measured with large images of stars.
