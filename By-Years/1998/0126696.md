Chemistry (12)

This award is providing a dedicated molecular modeling Linux Cluster for use
across the chemistry curriculum, including the integration of molecular modeling
modules in honors freshman chemistry, honors organic, and experimental physical
chemistry. A new computer laboratory course, Computational Nanotechnology is
providing undergraduate chemistry students and other science majors an exposure
to modern research techniques and emerging scientific are as. Computational
Nanotechnology is training a new generation of skilled workers in the
multidisciplinary approaches necessary for continued progress in nanotechnology
and is providing significant laboratory research experience. In this course,
students are designing, building, and testing molecular devices, materials, and
nanostructures adapted from the research and educational literature, including
organic and protein-based molecular motors, surface interaction and self-
assembly, and molecular dynamics simulations.
