With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Parker will obtain detailed
fundamental knowledge of the factors that determine the reactivity of organic
radical ions and doubly charged ions in solution. His approach utilizes
relationships developed for isodesmic reactions to obtain thermodynamic data for
a variety of reactions directly from reversible electrode potential
measurements. The thermodynamic data thereby obtained will permit prediction of
bond dissociation energies and can be used to suggest new reactions that are
based upon knowledge of relative bond strengths in radical ions and doubly
charged ions. %%% Organic radical ions are reactive species that possess an
unpaired electron in addition to an electronic charge. Dr. Parker has developed
a method that will permit bond dissocia- tion energies in these species and in
doubly charged ions to be determined. This, in turn, will provide a data base
for determining the energetics of a variety of reactions that proceed via
intermediate radical ions and doubly charged ions. The information thereby
obtained will provide fundamental new knowledge that is likely to lead to
improved understanding of the chemistry of these reactive intermediates.
