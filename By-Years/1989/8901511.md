Recent failures of transformers indicate that the models used by manufacturers
and designers may not be adequate to study the voltage oscillations which occur
within transformers. To study this problem, it is proposed to develop large-
scale distributed transformer models from the standpoint of system
identification. The goal is to independently estimate the parameters of the
transformer models based on measurements. In this study, two transformers will
be modeled from measured frequency response data in the range of 50 Hz to 1 MHz.
The significance of the proposed research is that the transformer manufacturers
can use the technique proposed here to independently validate their proprietary
design model and use a validated model to study the internal voltage
oscillations of transformers. The proposed technique can also be used by power
system engineers to develop transformer models and to study transient voltage
distribution, harmonics and surge performance analysis, and use the models in
EMTP applications and to study RF EM noise generated during the transient
operation of HVDC stations.
