9320037 Leonov A combination of theoretical and experimental research will be
conducted to describe secondary laminar flow of viscoelastic fluids in channels
with non-circular cross-sections. Rectangular, elliptical, and trapezoidal
sections are to be imvestigated. The theoretical models for the fluid will be
the Giesekus model and one developed by the Principal Investigator. The
numerical simulation will be with Finite Elements. The experiments will be with
several non-Newtonian liquids, to be rheologically characterized. Measurements
will be with LDV and birefringence techniques. Secondary flow can occur in
internal flow passages such as occur in molding and extrusion of polymeric
materials. It affects processing pressures and the final shape of manufactured
parts. ***
