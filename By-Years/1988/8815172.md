This proposal, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, uses fast
laser techniques to study the dynamics of physical and chemical processes in
liquids and at liquid vapor interfaces. Ultrashort pulse laser studies will be
performed in the bulk and the interface of the liquid and its vapor.
Orientational structure, composition, and dynamic processes at liquid interfaces
will be studied. The effects of the asymmetry in forces present at an interface,
but not in the bulk liquid, result in a change in dielectric and transport
properties, thereby altering molecular motions, chemical equilibria,
photoisomerization and other physical and chemical nonradiative processes.
