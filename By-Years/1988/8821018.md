This award supports a project to examine the processes that affect
concentrations of contaminants in the Greenland Ice Sheet. The proposed work
represents a continuation of research initiated at Dye 3, Greenland; a one-year
field sampling program began there in August 1988 and is scheduled to continue
until August 1989. The sampling program includes collection of aerosols and
gases at frequent intervals, and collection of fresh and older surface snow. In
addition, real-time continuous monitors for aerosol light scattering,
condensation nuclei, and ozone have been operating. The proposed project is a
one-year effort that contributes to the Dye 3 program in two ways. First,
limited snowpit sampling will be conducted during the summer of 1989 at Dye 3.
This will permit assessment of the changes in chemical composition of the snow
during aging over periods of less than one year. Second, the aerosol and snow
samples collected during Dye 3 program will be analyzed for anions, cations and
trace metals. It is expected that the results of this project will assist
interpretation of snowpit and ice core data, by providing information on the
transport and deposition processes in Greenland.
