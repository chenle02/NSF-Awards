9731506 Grove This work will involve experimental studies aimed at
understanding the conditions and time scales of mantle melting processes beneath
active ocean spreading centers. The experiments will determine diffusion rates
of rare earth, high field strength and large-ion lithophile elements in garnet
and high-Ca clinopyroxene at elevated pressure (1 to 3 GPa) and temperature
(1250oC - 1500oC) conditions. These are the conditions relevant for mantle
melting beneath mid-ocean ridges. The results of the experiments will be used to
estimate the time scales and styles of melt generation processes. To infer the
nature of the melting processes we will analyze the element abundances in the
products of melting (mid-ocean ridge basalts) and the solid residues left behind
after melt extraction (abyssal peridotites). The experimental results and the
element abundances in the natural samples will then be used as input to models
of melt production. The primary unknown in these melting models is the solid
state diffusion rates for the elements, which will be provided by the
experiments.
