This Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Minority Post-Doctoral Research
Fellowship aims to: (1) investigate the psychological factors driving the
preservation of skin bleaching products and practices in Tanzania, and (2)
design a culturally sensitive emancipatory (freedom) education dissemination
model that can begin to inform the Tanzanian community about the psychological
and health related risks of preserving skin bleaching products and practices in
Tanzania. A multi-method approach to data collection (in-depth interviews,
observation, and archival review) will be used with the target population for
the first part of the study; and participatory action research methods will be
used with participants for the second part of the study. This research will
occur during a 24-month post-doctoral period split evenly between the proposed
host institution (Emory University) and the foreign institution (University of
Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, East Africa) respectively. This will allow the
applicant to further enhance her career development by enriching her
methodological and statistical skills, teaching skills, publishing/dissemination
skills and conference/workshop/training involvement. Research in this area has
the potential to influence government policy pertaining to the preservation of
skin bleaching products in Tanzania and promote national social change geared
toward psychological and health liberation.
