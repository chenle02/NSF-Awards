This award will support efforts to bring together geospatial scholars from
around the world for the Geocomputation 2015 conference at the University of
Texas-Dallas in Richardson, Texas. NSF support will facilitate the participation
of up to 50 scholars and graduate students. This now-biennial conference usually
is held in Europe, with this event being only the third time it has been held in
the U.S. Geocomputation 2015 will advance the spatial research, promote teaching
and learning, and enhance existing networks among U.S. and international spatial
scientists. The conference will provide opportunities to share latest research
and advance knowledge about critical meta-topics in a wide range of social and
environmental science research involving geocomputational issues. It also will
facilitate scientific collaboration among young, underrepresented, and
international researchers who may not ordinarily have such networking
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In geocomputation as in many other
scientific fields, advances in research and education increasingly rely on the
development of international collaborations that bring together skilled scholars
and educators from many different nations. The Geocomputation conference is an
especially important forum that brings together a high caliber of geospatial
scientists performing innovative and transformative work in computational
science and methods. Examples of critical topics that the conference will cover
are visualization and virtual reality, optimization of operating across a range
of spatio-temporal scales, data mining, and knowledge discovery. Their practical
applications will be found in a broad spectrum of natural science, social
science, environmental, and engineering scientific fields as well as in a
broader range of real-world domains.
