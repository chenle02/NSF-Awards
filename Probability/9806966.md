9806966 Wellner

This award provides funds to partially support a research conference in high
dimensional probability to be held at the University of Washington, August 1-9,
1999. The purpose of the conference is to bring together analysts, probabilists,
and statisticians with interests in this area of research. This is currently a
very active area of research in probability, which is demonstrating its
relevance to applications in statistics, other areas of probability, and to
problems in physical science.
