ABSTRACT DMS-9705775 Kolountzakis Kolountzakis will study properties of
translational tilings of Euclidean Space using Harmonic Analysis. A function
f(x) is said to "tile" the Euclidean space with the discrete "tile set" A if,
when translated at the locations of A, it adds up to a constant w (the "weight"
of the tiling), almost everywhere. One obtains an equivalent condition for this
to happen: the Fourier transform of the distribution with one point mass at each
point of A must be supported at the zeros of the FT of the function f, plus the
point 0. Among the problems Kolountzakis proposes to study are: (a) the
structure of tilings of the line with tiles of non-compact support, (b) the
periodic tiling conjecture in higher dimension, (c) results related to the
uniqueness of the Poisson Summation formula, (d) further estimates on the
Steinhaus problem, (e) the problem of simultaneous fundamental domains in
general abelian groups and (f) non-translational tilings of space via methods of
non-abelian harmonic analysis. The study of tilings of space using a certain
building block called the "tile" has significant connections with
crystallography. Interest in this has been renewed after the, relatively recent,
discovery that non-periodic tilings (i.e., pavings of space which are not
"determined" by how they look in an arbitrarily large but finite part of the
space) do exist in nature. The question of which are the possible ways that
space can be tiled is the paramount one in this field. The proposed research
will help to understand the situation in higher dimensions. Another domain of
application of the proposed methods concern the theory of Wavelets
