One of the features of stars, which when it exists reveals a great deal about
their structure, is pulsation. Several kinds of pulsating stars are known, two
of which are the RR Lyrae stars and Cepheid variables. The pulsations of these
two kinds of stars are driven in their envelopes by convective.pulsational
coupling, turbulence, and opacity variations in the partially ionized hydrogen
and helium atmospheres. The Principal Investigator proposes to study numerically
and analytically the pulsation mechanisms of these stars and to make comparisons
with observations.
