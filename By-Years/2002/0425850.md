Despite vast difference in their physical scales and constituent components,
there are fundamental functional similarities among metabolic, genetic, and
neuronal networks. They must measure their environment, process the measured
information, make estimations of the quantities of interest, and respond
appropriately. This project will study the ability of biological networks to
perform information processing tasks efficiently and robustly, in order to
identify their common design principles. It will study these principles in the
context of biological networks of sufficient complexity to capture information
processing qualities, yet of sufficient simplicity to yield generalizable
insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific Aims:&lt;br/&gt;1. To define information
theoretic quantities measuring efficiency of a network in processing information
in a given environment, and to quantify the functioning of simple,
experimentally relevant genetic network topologies in this fashion.&lt;br/&gt;2.
To investigate maximizing, extracting, and efficiently representing the
predictive information [11] in input data as a biological design
principle.&lt;br/&gt;3. To discover, by stochastic simulation of simple genetic
network topologies, architectures of biological networks which support multiple
functions and therefore are in principle
evolvable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partnering with (i) Leading Edge
Partners, an organization bringing professionals to deliver seminars to New York
City (overwhelmingly minority) public high school students and (ii) Columbia
University's Science Honors Program, coordinating lectures to New York City k-12
students as well as their families.&lt;br/&gt;
