This workshop evaluates the possible opportunities for new and innovative social
scientific research presented by the increasing interplay between social science
scholars and law school faculty. Law schools have hired an increasing number of
PhDs in the social sciences; law professors are increasingly more interested in
empirical social science research methods; and there has been a strengthening of
research and educational ties between law schools and other academic departments
and units. The workshop evaluates these trends and considers ways in which this
interplay may be organizationally and programmatically consolidated in order to
ensure continuation of high quality research by socio-legal scholars in the
future.

This workshop will lay the foundations for enhanced collaboration among law and
social science programs and centers/institutes with respect to research
projects, as well as graduate training and mentoring.
