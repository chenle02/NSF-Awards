This REU SITE proposal requests support for eight undergraduates to participate
in archaeological analysis of animal bone remains, stone artifacts, and medieval
Norse artifacts at the Hunter College Bioarchaeology Laboratory. The focus of
the program will be on the northern circumpolar zone, including collections from
Iceland and Kodiak Island, Alaska. Students will develop skills in observation,
quantification and scientific reasoning through contact with real archaeological
collections and problems. The Hunter Bioarchaeology Facility has a 10-year
record of attracting women and minority students to the social sciences.
