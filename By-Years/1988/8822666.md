This project by Clifford Bunton of the University of California at Santa
Barbara, is within the Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed at studying
reactions at the surfaces of aggregates. When surfactant organic molecules are
placed in water, they form aggregates known as micelles. This research will
investigate the effect of these micelles on organic reactions which occur at
their surfaces; this will also provide information about micellar structure.
This research will involve a study of chemical reactvity in colloidal self-
assemblies of synthetic surfactants and the examination of the structures of
these assemblies, largely by light scattering and NMR spectroscopy. The aim of
the work will be the understanding of the factors that control chemical
reactivity at submicroscopic interfaces, especially in water. Theoretical models
of ion-binding at these interfaces will be tested.
