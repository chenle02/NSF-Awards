9319699 Kapp This is a proposal to continue the PI's studies of the circuits in
the brain that give rise to learned arousal, a behavioral state characterized by
vigilance or enhanced readiness to process sensory information from one's
environment. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that the central nucleus
of the amygdala, a structure-long implicated in emotional arousal, contributes
to a learned increase in arousal by exerting a modulatory influence on the
activity of two groups of brain cells which enhance the impact of sensory events
on the animal. The analysis of anatomical substrates for conditioned arousal is
interesting and important. The results will provide important information
concerning brain circuits that provide the optimal conditions for detecting and
processing sensory information.
