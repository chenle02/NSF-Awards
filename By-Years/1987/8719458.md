We propose to develop High Performance Engineering Information System (EIS)
based on Incremental Computation Models. These models utilize results of
previous computations stored in persistent cache structures by merging them with
new results obtained from computations performed on the incremental changes of
the database. Because computation is performed on small increments rather than
the whole database, incremental computation models achieve performances that are
far beyond the reach of ordinary models. High performance EISs will be able to
support engineering knowledge bases of significant size, explicit models of
interdependent knowledge, optimization techniques for deductive queries, and
efficient methods for organizing and accessing large numbers of engineering
facts and rules. The persistent cache structures of the incremental models
provide an innovative self-improving performance capability for computation
intensive EICs.
