The technique of incoherent scatter of radar waves to probe the ionosphere has
revealed a wealth of information concerning the temperature, composition and
motions of the ions and electrons, and indirectly has provided much information
on the neutral energetics and dynamics at heights above 100 km. A scientific
session is to be held at the COSPAR meeting in Helsinki in July, 1988, on the
subject of Incoherent Scatter Radar Research, with reviews by a distinguished
set of international scientists who have worked with the technique. Dr. Ganguly
has been asked to organize it and convene the meeting and edit the proceedings,
and this grant provides support for him to do so.
