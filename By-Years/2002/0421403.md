Researchers at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) will utilize the
nanoprobe instrumentation cluster, comprised of upgrades and modular additions
to an atomic force microscope (AFM) and tribodindenter nanomechanical testing
system, to support integrated research in nano- and meso-structured materials,
including linear/star block copolymers, ionomers, nanophase-separated blends,
polymer liquid crystal patterned materials, polymer/clay nanocomposites,
nanostructured films from aqueous polymer dispersion blends, nanostructured
coatings, self-assembled organic/inorganic hybrids, conductive polymer blends
employing carbon nanotubes, self-assembled biopolymer synthetic analogues, smart
surface-attached polymers, patterned polymeric molecular sieves, barrier
coatings and separation membranes based on dendrimers. AFM will interrogate
surfaces on the scale of a few nanometers while the triboindenter will probe
mechanical properties on the next higher order of scale. Combined with other
methods, structure-properties will be correlated across morphological
hierarchies that span the nanoscopic-to-microscopic-to-macroscopic spectrum. The
instruments will play critical roles in programs funded by NSF MRSEC, NSF-IGERT,
NSF-REU, and other-funded research at USM. Partnership between the academic
researchers and instrument developers has been established. The principal
investigators have a project and management plan that includes advanced
training, scheduling, future direction and facility maintenance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern
Mississippi (USM) will utilize a nanoprobe instrumentation cluster to support
integrated, multidisciplinary research in finely-structured heterogeneous
materials that include block copolymers, ion-containing polymers, blends, liquid
crystals, nanocomposites, organic/inorganic hybrid materials, coatings and
membranes. Combined with other characterization methods, the structure and
properties of these materials will be interrogated and correlated across scales
that range from molecular sizes to the macroscopic realm. The instruments will
play critical roles in programs funded by NSF MRSEC, NSF-IGERT, NSF-REU, and
other-funded research at USM in the pursuit of sophisticated, multifunctional
materials. Partnership between academic researchers and instrument developers
has been established. The principal investigator Mauritz, Morgan and Nazarenko
have a project and management plan that includes advanced training, efficient
scheduling, future direction and facility maintenance. &lt;br/&gt;
