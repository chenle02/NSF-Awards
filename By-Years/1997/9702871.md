9702871 Van der Weide Rising clock rates and densities of computational
integrated circuits engender severe difficulties in inter-chip communication and
testing. The research in this CAREER program will explore micromachined antenna
structures to achieve zero-skew clock waveform distribution and localized
excitation and testing of these circuits, even those exhibiting quantum effects
of electron confinement. The educational goals of this program seek to extend
these localized field measurements to a larger scale, making planar high-
frequency circuits come alive to students, particularly through laboratories
accessed via near-real-time Web-based instrumentation. ***
