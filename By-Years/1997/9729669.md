9729669 RHODES The pituitary gland is a small organ located at the base of the
brain in mammals. In response to signals from the brain and the bloodstream, the
pituitary secretes hormones that regulate growth, reproductive development and
status, milk production, the response to stress and control of functions such as
body temperature and metabolism. During development, genes are turned on and off
in a regulated program that allows the specialized hormone-releasing cells to be
derived from simple, common precursor cells. Molecules known as transcription
factors act as switches to coordinate this program of gene activation. Using
state-of-the-art molecular technology, Dr. Rhodes will determine the specific
mechanism of a pituitary transcription factor called P-Lim. P-Lim is essential
for pituitary development since individuals with mutated P-Lim do not develop
pituitary glands and thus, die shortly after birth. The results from these
fundamental studies will significantly further our understanding of pituitary
development and function. Moreover, the knowledge gained from work on the
pituitary can impact on related processes, such as the development of the
nervous system, the blood and the limbs.
