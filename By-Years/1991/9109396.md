Dr. Stout will study the interaction of metal ions with natural
polyelectrolytes. With the ultimate aim of characterizing metal ion-humic acid
binding, she will initially examine some systems that are less complex. A
carboxylate-substituted polysaccharide, alginic acid, will serve as the first
model polyectrolyte since, it shares many of the properties of humic acid, but
is structurally well-defined. The mode and extent of Eu3+ metal ion binding to
alginic acid will be investigated using lanthanide luminescence spectroscopy. As
a result of these studies, Dr. Stout will have a better understanding of the
potential of lanthanide luminescence spectroscopy for use in subsequent work
with humic acids as well as the limitations of the technique. %%% Research
Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior independent Federal research
support to develop a competitive research project. This project involves the use
of ionic probes that luminesce to gain knowledge about the identity and nature
of the binding site for metals thus revealing substantial information about the
nature of polyelectrolytes such as humic acid. This project may have important
consequences in environmental chemistry.
