This project aims at continuing development of reliable, accurate and efficient
numerical algorithms for approximate polynomial algebra, along with
implementations for expanding the capacity of a software toolbox ApaTools. In
addition to those robust algorithms/software developed under previous NSF
support, The PI proposes to design and implement algorithms for three
fundamental algebraic problems: the approximate irreducible factorization of
multivariate polynomials, identification of the multiplicity structure, and
numerical elimination in solving polynomial systems.

This research is to be carried out in the intersection of computer algebra and
numerical analysis with an outcome consists of algorithms and software packages
for solving mathematical problems. The results of this project are expected to
supply critical tools for application areas such as robotics, molecular
conformation, chemical equilibrium, automatic control, and other branches of
mathematics such as algebraic geometry.
