In arid and semiarid regions of the United States, droughts can have substantive
and even disastrous economic consequences on direct water users and on other
activities related to the use of water. Traditionally, impacts on off- stream
water uses such as in agriculture, municipal and in industrial activities, have
been measured during droughts. Effects on in-stream and non-diversionary water
uses have been heretofore largely ignored, as have the secondary (market-linked)
economic impacts of reduced direct water diversions. A model will be developed
where direct and secondary economic impacts will be measured including the
effects on both market and non-market goods. This economic analysis will
incorporate input-output techniques with discrete stochastic programming
analysis and will be driven by historic meteorological data and hydrologic
models. It will also reflect institutional and legislative constraints, and
estimated farm, business and household reactions to drought. A real case study
will be used to calibrate and test the model, and the existing water supply and
storage systems will be tested against diverse disaster scenarios.
