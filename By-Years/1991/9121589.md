This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Chad Mirkin's
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award in support of his research
at Northwestern University. Early transition metal metallocene-mediated,
electrocatalytic oxygen atom transfer reactions will be studied. The goal of the
research will be to develop electrocatalytic oxidation reactions by
electrochemically, photochemically and chemically generating highly reactive
organometallic species bound to a polymer support for use as oxygen atom
transfer catalysts. Oxygen atom sources will be carbon dioxide and water and
typical substrates will be olefins. Expected products will be epoxides and
ketones. Catalyst species will be site-isolated on supported surfaces and
spectroscopically characterized. Individual steps in the catalytic cycle will be
defined by infrared and ESR spectroscopy. %%% Catalytic oxygen atom transfer
reactions are of great commercial importance. The epoxidation of olefins is
currently carried out on a large scale. New, more efficient catalysts could have
a major impact both on commercial technology as well as on understanding
fundamental oxidation mechanisms.
