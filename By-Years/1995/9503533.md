9503533 Hu The research project aims at investigating the response statistics
and structural reliability of nonlinear dynamic systems subjected to non-
Gaussian excitations. Many physical phenomena can be more realistically modelled
as nonlinear systems subjected to non- Gaussian excitation including earthquake
loadings.
