This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and 250 MHz and 300 MHz NMR consoles. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas such as the following: (1)
chiral metal complexes for asymmetric catalysis, (2) conformational analysis of
complex carbohydrate systems, (3) construction of unusual molecular systems, (4)
activation barriers for carbene rearrangements, (5) perforin-mediated cytolysis
(6) catalytic dendrimers for asymmetric catalysis, (7) high potential iron
proteins, and (8) structure and dynamic behavior of selected carbanionic
species. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
