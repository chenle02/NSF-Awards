Abstract CTS-9528941 Varma The proposed research focuses on the fundamental
aspects of the SHS processes involved in the formation of intermetallic
compounds. In order to utilize this technique effectively, and to control the
process, a fundamental knowledge of combustion synthesis mechanisms involving
the evolution of non-equilibrium initial products toward the final product is of
critical importance. The two major objectives of the proposed work are: (1) the
analysis of the initial product structure formation, and (2) the measurement of
the effective and detailed kinetics of the formation of intermetallics in a
combustion regime. The approach involves obtaining a clear understanding of the
evolution of product structure from when the product first appears to when the
final product is formed by the post combustion processes. Four basic initial
product formation mechanisms are presented for gasless combustion synthesis. By
varying the experimental conditions such as green density, particle size,
initial temperature, cooling rate, etc., and from the initial product structure,
the PI hopes to determine the appropriate conditions for each of the formation
mechanisms. A variety of experimental techniques will be used in the proposed
research. These include combustion wave quenching, modified particle-foil
technique, time resolved X-ray diffraction (TRXRD), new method of microscopic
high speed video recording and a novel experimental apparatus for monitoring the
kinetics of admixed gas evolution and ionization in the reaction zone.
