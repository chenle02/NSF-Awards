A significant challenge in mathematics education is the explication of the
development of new mathematical conceptions on the part of students. The current
reform is predicated on our capacity to provide students with rich and improved
opportunities to learn mathematics based on a coherent knowledge of how
mathematical concepts develop in students. The PI argues that the Mathematics
education community is, in general, moving forward without an adequate
understanding of how learners develop new concepts and that this shortcoming is
severely limiting the success of efforts to design high quality curricular
materials, carry out effective mathematics teaching and improve mathematics
education. To goal of this SGER proposal is to bring some redress to this
situation.
