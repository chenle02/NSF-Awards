The fundamental goal of this research is to develop and study mathematical
models for the dynamics of structured populations in order to explore and to
contribute to the understanding of the effects that physiological traits which
determine the growth, fertility and mortality rates of individuals can have on
the dynamics at the population level. While some models which have appeared in
the literature will be studied and extended, the focus will be on the careful
derivation of models for certain types of structured populations and
multispecies interactions involving primarily size and developmental stages (and
in some cases chronological age) to which an importance and interest has been
attached in the biological literature and which have not been previously
modelled. A full range of standard as well as recently developed analytical
tools will be applied in order to gain an understanding of the resulting model
dynamics and how they depend on the internal structure of the populations, on
key model parameters, on nonlinear density effects and on the nature of the
interspecies interactions. Problems to be modelled were chosen in part because
there are biological studies available for comparison to the model results. As
part of the proposed research, certain recently developed analytical methods
will need to be extended in order to handle the type of models to be used in
this study. The numerical analysis of models is expected also to play an
important role.
