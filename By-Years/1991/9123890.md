The time immediately following the metamorphosis and settlement of benthic
organisms is critical to their ability to become part of the existing community.
Because of their small size and simpler morphology, juveniles endure more
intense interactions with a wider spectrum of species. In addition, tremendous
changes in the ecological relationships between species can occur between life-
history stages and the importance of these study will focus on the settling and
juvenile stages of 7 dominant species within subtidal marine epifaunal
communities along the coast of southern New England. The study sites chosen
exhibit extreme (1 to 2 orders of Magnitude) differences in larval settlement,
and each has a distinct group of dominant species. Experiments will be conducted
to test processes that predation to recruitment, i.e. differences in larval
settlement and examine how relationships change with life-stage. The importance
of any event occurring during juvenile life-history stages will be judged
relative to phenomena occurring during larval settlement and within the adult
community.
