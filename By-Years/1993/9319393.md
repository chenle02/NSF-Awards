Benchmarks have been used to test everything from the speed of a processor to
the access time of a memory system. The computing community relies on them
heavily to assess how fast a given hardware or software system operates. They
are of fundamental importance in everyday computing. However, up until now, the
study of the art of designing a good benchmark has focused on making the
benchmark ``realistic'' in predicting how well it will perform for the intended
applications; the issue of making benchmark results trustworthy has been
relegated to ``trusted'' or third party agents, and little attention has been
paid to the question of making benchmarks themselves ``uncheatable.'' The
project studies the problem of how to make benchmarks resistant to tampering and
hence more trustworthy. The plan is to use modern cryptography and complexity
theory to make this possible. Basically the trust in individuals and
organizations is replaced by trust in the impossibility of breaking certain
computational problems. The advantage of this new approach is clear: the new
schemes will be scientifically trustworthy. There is a whole array of problems
that need to be formulated and solved, which are important in making uncheatable
benchmarks; some are practical issues, some are theoretical.
