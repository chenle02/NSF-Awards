Electron microscope tomography (EMT) is the method of computational
reconstruction of the 3-D electron density of an ultrastructural specimen for
combined projections around a tilt axis. The investigators have emphasized
analysis of stained plastic-embedded sections tilted around a single axis,
representing a logical extension of much of conventional biological transmission
electron microscopy. Performing EMT on thick sections is an important
application of this method, especially when dealing with the large-scale
organization of cellular organelles. The investigators will continue to analyze
thick sections imaged with inelastically-scattered electrons and to examine
mass-loss (specimen-damage) by electron spectroscopy. The group will also focus
its efforts on volume rendering to develop a consensus structure of the
organization of DNA transcription in vivo, and it develop techniques for
preparations of tomographic analysis.
