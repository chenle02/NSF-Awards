Navigating complex computer applications has become a critical problem.
Understanding what the innate human navigational abilities are and how they
relate to specific types of environmental complexity will facilitate the design
of assistive devices for the navigation of complex computer applications. Two
different techniques for using spatial information to help computer users
navigate complex applications have been proposed by the authors. These
techniques are derived from studies that have shown how the spatial distribution
of information constrains attentional processes in vision. In this project the
researchers are undertaking an examination of the relationship between the
structure of computer search tasks and the spatial structure of assistance
information. They are constructing four computer applications. In two cases the
task and guidance information structures are matched in terms of spatial
information needs and spatial information presentation, and in the other two
they are mismatched. Use of these applications by subjects will be compared on
the basis of speed and accuracy. The research is expected to produce a deeper
understanding of human-computer task performance under periods of stress and the
need for rapid decision-making.
