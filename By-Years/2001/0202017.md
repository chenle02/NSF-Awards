This dissertation research will investigate the development of political
consciousness in German young men. Nine young men in their third year of
vocational school in Berlin will be interviewed four times. All have been
interviewed in a previous wave of interviews. The nine have been selected to
represent a range of political positions from radical right to democratic and to
sample from a variety of vocational programs, including information technology
electrician, cook, and concrete worker. Oral histories, observations of work and
social life, and discussions of the previous interview will be used to
understand why some working-class men adopt radical right politics while others
develop a democratic political consciousness.
