This is a request to obtain funds to acquire an infrared thermal imaging system.
The equipment will be used by five investigators as part of several ongoing
studies of plant and animal physiology. The specific projects described in this
proposal utilize thermal imaging to monitor cutaneous vasomotor changes in dogs,
rats and rabbits with respect to heat, exercise and hydration; to study thermo
regulation in desert insects and Adelie penguins; to study heat and pollutant
effects on gas exchange in plants; to measure the influence of solar radiation
on amphibian thermal regulation.
