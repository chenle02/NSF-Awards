9615997 Bock Global Positioning System (GPS) technology allows near real- tine
determination of position anywhere on Earth with precision in the sub-centimeter
range. It is making a profound impact on understanding of diverse scientific
problems in the geosciences, including plate motions, earthquake cycles, crustal
dynamics, volcanic processes, glacier dynamics, sea level changes, and
atmospheric sensing. This award provides funding to support part of the
infrastructure needed for GPS-based studies by earth scientists. The University
NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO) provides infrastruacture support in a number of
areas, including data archiving and data analysis. This award to the University
of California at San Diego, a member of the UNAVCO consortium, will support an
archival data base from regional GPS networks that will be available on-line to
the geophysics research community. ***
