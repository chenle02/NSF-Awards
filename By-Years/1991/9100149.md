This research is to study communications and control requirements for multiple
autonomous robots to cooperate in accomplishing a task, where the robots are
organized heterarchically instead of using the more common hierarchical
(master/slave) control. Each behaves reactively, in accordance with sets of
relatively primitive motor schemas. The resulting organization does not require
an explicit world model, and should be more robust and hence more suitable for
operations in remote and/or hazardous environments. A key research issue is to
evaluate the efficacy of such systems operating under constrained inter-agent
communications. Such agents could be more economical to operate. The goal of the
research is to understand and develop control and communication mechanisms that
produce robust yet efficient cooperative robot behavior.
