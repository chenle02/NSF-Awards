The Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989, had a Richter magnitude of 7.1
and caused billions of dollars in damage throughout the San Francisco Bay region
and in Santa Cruz County. As part of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program (NEHRP) various Federal, state and regional programs have been carried
out in past years to promote the implementation of local-level earthquake
preparedness and loss reduction activities. The Loma Prieta earthquake provides
the opportunity to examine the specific lessons local agency staff have learned
through having their preparedness plans and loss reduction programs tested by a
major earthquake in the region. Agency staff selected from approximately 35
jurisdictions in seven Bay region counties will be asked whether their
mitigation efforts were effective or were likely to be effective in future
earthquakes, whether the earthquake has caused them to change their pre-quake
programs and plans, and what information sources and program guidance they now
think are the most useful. The implications of the findings for setting local-
level priorities for mitigation activities, and for the design of Federal, state
and regional programs to foster local level hazard mitigation activities are
addressed.
