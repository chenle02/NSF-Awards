Since the larger energy gap of (A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In(1-y)P has the potential for
larger conduction band discontinuity and can give insulator behavior, research
is proposed to demonstrate MODFET's and inversion mode MISFET's utilizing layers
of (A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In1-yP on GaAs. This work will begin by modifying an
existing OMCVD reactor to allow growth of the GaAs-(A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In(1-y)P
heterojunction. Growth studies will include impurity incorporation and
characterization of the electrical properties at various growth temperatures and
III-V ratios in the input gas stream. Measurements will be made to characterize
the (A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In(1-y)P layers and the GaAs- (A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In(1-y)P
heterojunction interface. High resistivity (A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In(1-y)P layers on
GaAs will be evaluated and the fabrication technology will be investigated to
permit the fabrication and evaluation of MODFET and MISFET devices. Possible
configurations for complementary MIS circuits and three-dimensional structures
based on GaAs-(A1(x)Ga(1-x))(y)In(1-y)P heterojunctions will be investigated.
