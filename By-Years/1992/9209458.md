To produce the dramatic increases in computer system performance needed to solve
the "grand challenge" computational problems, it will be necessary to
incorporate more parallel processing technology into new computer designs. A
major impediment to achieving high performance in a multiprocessor, however, is
the delay encountered when accessing the data memory. Current techniques for
reducing the memory delay, such as data prefetching, vector memory fetches, and
private data caches, have not been as effective in multiprocessors as in
traditional uniprocessors because they have failed to use all of the available
information. In particular, these techniques typically rely only on the
information available at run-time, which is insufficient in the complex
environment of a multiprocessor system. The primary objective of this research
project is to develop and analyze new techniques for improving multiprocessor
memory performance by integrating hardware and software strategies to utilize
all of the memory referencing information. The project will explore both
semantic information at compile-time and dynamic information at run-time to
improve data prefetching, processor scheduling, data placement, and cache
coherence enforcement. The new techniques generated through this research will
be validated using a unique combination of trace-driven simulations,
mathematical models, software prototypes running on actual parallel machines,
and implementation of new algorithms in a parallelizing compiler.
