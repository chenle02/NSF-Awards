This is the first-year funding of a 3-year continuing award. Although chess
computers now are competitive at master and grandmaster levels, that is where
their resemblance to human players ends. Psychological evidence indicates that
human chess players search very few positions, and base their positional
assessments on structural/perceptual patterns learned through experience. Morph
is a computer chess program that has been developed to be more consistent with
the cognitive models. The learning mechanism combines weight-updating, genetic,
explanation-based and temporal-difference learning to create, delete, generalize
and evaluate graph patterns. An associative pattern retrieval system organizes
the database for efficient processing. The main objective of the project are to
demonstrate capacity of the system to learn, to deepen our understanding of the
interaction of knowledge and search, and to build bridges in this area between
AI and cognitive science. To strengthen the connections with the cognitive
literature the system's knowledge is to come from its own playing experience, no
sets of pre- classified examples are given and beyond its chess pattern
representation scheme little chess knowledge such as the fact that having pieces
is valuable (leave alone their values) has been provided to the system. Further,
the system is limited to using only 1-ply of search.
