While distributed systems are now commonplace, the programming of distributed
systems is still a complex task. This research focuses on simplifying the
programming of distributed subsystems and applications by supporting
distribution in the language. The design of an object- based language, called
Emerald, and a distributed run-time system for Emerald, that facilitate the
construction of distributed programs will be undertaken. The novel features of
Emerald include: (1) a uniform object model that is used for programming both
private local objects and shared remote objects, (2) a type system that permits
multiple user-defined and compiler-defined implementations, and (3) an explicit
notion of object location and mobility. A prototype Emerald system is currently
operating on a small local area network of workstations.
