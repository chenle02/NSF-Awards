Calcite (CaCO3) is one of the most prevalent of boiler and heat exchanger scale.
Recent work has shown that trace concentrations of divalent iron (Fe2+) very
strongly inhibit the growth of CaC03, suggesting that iron of the appropriate
form and in sufficient concentration can lead to a significant reduction in the
amount and tenacity of such scale deposits. It is proposed to examine how iron
and other metal cations affect the nucleation and growth of a variety of scale-
forming carbonate minerals, and how various solution parameters enhance or
suppress crystallization. A model will be developed to predict carbonate crystal
growth inhibition, and electrolytic and magnetic means of introducing the metal
cations into solution will be examined. The build up of scale deposits inside
cooling water pipes and boilers is a multimillion dollar problem. Scale
significantly reduces heat transfer efficiency and can lead to blockage of water
flow passages. Understanding the mechanisms by which metal ions inhibit crystal
nucleation and growth can lead to cost effective means of maintaining peak
performance of heat exchange equipment.
