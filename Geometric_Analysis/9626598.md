9626598 Wong This proposal lies in the general area of several complex
variables, with an emphasis on Nevanlinna theory. More specifically, the
investigator will work on non-equidimensional and higher dimensional value
distribution theory and its applications to complex hyperbolicity. Unlike the
one variable theory, higher dimensional value distribution theory involves
sophisticated tools from complex differential and algebraic geometry, hence
interfaces with several other areas of research within mathematical sciences.
Interest in Nevanlinna theory was recently revived in a dramatic way with
Vojta's discovery of the analogies between it and Diophantine equations.
Diophantine equations are equations in integers - an important part of Number
Theory - and as evidenced by Fermat's Last Theorem are often very difficult to
solve. Vojta's discovery indicates that several major results in Diophantine
equations parallel those in Nevanlinna theory and that there may be hidden
connections between the two theories.
