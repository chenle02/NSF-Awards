Title: Student Travel Support for 29th European Conference on Object Oriented
Programming (ECOOP)

This award will support student travel to the 29th European Conference on Object
Oriented Programming (ECOOP). The conference will be held in Prague, Czech
Republic, in July 2015. ECOOP is the premier conference in object-oriented
programming languages and software engineering. Supporting student travel to
attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the
NSF. The award prioritizes broad student participation, paying special attention
to the selection of women and underrepresented minorities. Thus the broader
significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of
researchers in the area of object oriented programming and software engineering,
as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware
workforce. Apart from the conference itself, several satellite workshops feature
lectures from an impressive array of experts. Thus students have the opportunity
to learn state-of-the-art methodologies and novel techniques, and to interact
with senior researchers who are leading researchers in their areas of expertise.
