This award provides funding for two years for the Midwest Dynamical Systems
Conference. The 2016 version of this conference will be held at Indiana
University/Purdue University-Indianapolis from October 21-23, 2016. The site and
date of the 2017 conference has not been made; it will be decided upon by the
conference's Scientific Advisory board in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
subfield of dynamical systems. A number of important topics will be covered,
including but not restricted to parabolic dynamics, symbolic dynamics, rigidity
phenomena and the like. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to
attend and speak at this conference. The award gives early career researchers,
researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded
by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
