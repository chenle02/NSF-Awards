Research will be conducted on two classes of problems: the network flowshop and
the multipurpose plant. This work will center on developing automated scheduling
methods for batch systems including the selection of network structures and
identifying intermediate storage requirements. Ensure that the research is
realistic and relevant, the research plan includes active industrial
participation. This will take two forms: "Industrial Collaborators" consisting
of four companies will be directly involved in the research, and an "Industrial
Advisory Committee", comprised of representatives from twelve companies will
help to review and steer the research.
