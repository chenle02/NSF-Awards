This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic program is made to
Dr. Terrence J. Collins in the Chemistry Department of Carnegie Mellon
University to continue work on coordination complexes containing transition
metals in high oxidation states. Collins has developed macroamide ligands which
are not susceptible to oxidation and can be used to maintain Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni
in unusual high oxidation states. Synthesis of additional compounds of this type
will be attempted. Depending on the metal and structure of the respective
compound, it may serve as a model for methane monooxygenase, as an
electrocatalyst or chemical sensor, a catalytic O-atom transfer agent, or
exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling at low temperatures. The compounds will be
characterized using a variety of techniques, including electron paramagnetic
resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopies, and cyclic voltammetry. The
investigation will focus on four square-planar complexes of Mn(V) that are
known, as well as 5- and 6-coordinate systems. Synthesis of nitrido analogs of
some known manganese and iron compounds will be attempted. Oxygen atom transfer
reactions of Fe(IV), Ni(III), and Co(III) will also be investigated. The
reaction chemistry of a stable Fe(IV)-O-Fe(IV) species, which is known to
undergo three reversible oxidations, will be explored in detail. A detailed
magnetic study will be undertaken of a linear polymer of antiferromagnetically
coupled S=2 Mn(III) centers that shows unusual ferromagnetic interactions at low
temperatures.
