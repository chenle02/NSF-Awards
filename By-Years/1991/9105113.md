This proposal is to study the Sr-Nd-Pb-Th isotopic geochemistry of: (1)
volcanics and plutonics from five of the Canary Islands and (2) peridotite
xenoliths from Lanzarote, the easternmost island, and La Palma, the second
westernmost island. Preliminary Sr-Nd-Pb-Th isotope data from the westernmost
islands and published data from the eastern islands suggest systematic variation
in isotopic compositions as a function of distance from West Africa. It may be
that these variations reflect interaction of plume melts with the lithospheric
mantle, which changes from transitional continental-oceanic in the east (with an
enriched mantle composition) to predominantly oceanic in the west (with a
depleted mantle composition). The study has important implications for the
location (lithosphere, asthenosphere, plume) of the various mantle components,
and for the recycling of continental lithosphereic mantle during rifting.
