This engineering education research project seeks to investigate the effect of
informal, out-of-school learning activities on students' decisions to attend
engineering degree programs. The study builds on the success of the "Design
Squad" TV series that engages many middle-school aged youth. The study uses
survey methods as well as interviews to collect data which will be analyzed
using social cognitive career theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project will be to increase understanding of
how informal educational activities influence students' choices in college
majors and thus their ultimate career choices. The research focuses specifically
on young women who are a group generally under-represented in engineering degree
programs. The project builds on strong partnerships with many other youth
organizations such as the Girl Scouts of the USA. This project overlaps with
NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an
engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that
are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
