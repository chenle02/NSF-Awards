This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Gardens
for the replacement of a seed storage facility and greenhouses and for the
repair and renovation of laboratories which house systematic and evolutionary
botanical research and research training activities. These buildings were
constructed, respectively, in pre-1950, 1960, and 1969 and none of them has been
renovated to date. The ARFMP grant of $400,000 and $400,000 provided by the
grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research
training facilities which will permit current research and research training
programs to expand in scope and duration and to encompass an array of
experimental procedures that it is currently infeasible to use. This project
will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure both in
terms of health and safety and of the quantity, quality, and diversity of
research that can be conducted by providing space for research and research
training which is adequately heated, cooled, and ventilated and which conforms
to current building codes. This award contributes to the infrastructure of
science by providing an improved environment for the conduct of systematic and
evolutionary botanical research and for the training of quality graduate
students in a program that plays an important role in the research training of
minority students, that excels in its integration of field, greenhouse,
laboratory, and herbarium research techniques, and that fills an important need
in its production of well- and broadly-trained plant systematists.
