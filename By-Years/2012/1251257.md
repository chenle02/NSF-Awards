This award is for addressing the problem of the increasing amount of cryospheric
data being generated at an unprecedented rate, and in particular, for the
discoverability and higher-level data analytics such as anomaly detection in
these big data flows. This work builds on the results from the previously NSF-
awarded project aimed at the development of "datarods technology", in which the
data are organized in temporal columns (aka "datarods") that include multiple
time stamps and sensor values stored sequentially but not necessarily as a fixed
time interval. These will lead to investigation and development of innovative
techniques for the construction of "Condensate Databases" that are much smaller
(but yet capture key characteristics) of the original datasets. The challenges
lie in the fact that cryospheric data are massive and diverse, and have "normal"
and "abnormal" patterns spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.
Three main areas of the study are: (1) adaptive neighborhood-based thresholding
in both space and time; (2) compressive-domain pattern detection and change
analysis; and (3) hybrid condensation of multi-modal, multi-scale cryospheric
data. The techniques and software developed will be shared publicly via the
National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) existing support platform, and
publicized via scientific publications and presentations at top-tier conferences
such as the America Geophysical Union meetings. The next generation of
scientists and technical professionals will be trained in the interdisciplinary
domain of Big Data management, data analytics, and scientific discovery through
the student curriculum integration, distance learning, and education workshops.
