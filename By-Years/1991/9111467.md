A low-temperature heat-flux calorimeter is acquire to study the thermodynamic
properties of reactive intermediates on solid catalytic surfaces. The initial
use of the instrument will be in studies of the cracking of isobutane, the
synthesis of aliphatic amines, the hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of olefins,
and the reactions of hydrocarbons on platinum in zeolite-L. The efforts
supported by this equipment have significant implications for the petroleum,
drug, agricultural chemical, and specialty chemical industries.
