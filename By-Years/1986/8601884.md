In previous research, a model was developed for sintering kinetics in "model"
(i.e., flat) systems. This model has proven very successful and is now regarded
as state of the art. The present project extends the model to curved systems.
Upon completion of this work, the model will be in a form that will permit its
application to real industrial catalyst systems.
