The shelf areas of the Arctic Ocean comprise some 25% of the world's total, even
though that sea contains only 2% of the ocean's waters. The influence of the
shelf, then, is anomalously high in the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is known
that the influence of the shelf on the composition of ocean waters can be
quantified through measurements of various ratios of radium isotopes. Both Ra228
(T = 5.77 yr) and Ra224 (T = 3.64 da) are elevated in shelf waters as compared
to oceanic waters, and the ratio of these species to Ra226 (T = 1620 yr) yields
measures of the relative influence of the shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER
proposes to have radium measurements incorporated into the 2004 Shelf-Basin
Interaction Program cruise of Sep-Oct (R. Pickart, Chief Scientist). The work
will entail two parts:&lt;br/&gt;(1) measurements taken in the core of the
boundary current (along the Beaufort Sea shelf) will reveal the age and makeup
of the boundary current water, and (2) radium isotope measurements taken during
physical oceanographic surveys of small eddies in the region will reveal the
source of the eddy water, and possibly its fate. This work will enhance the
autonomous data collection by in situ moorings, provide new information on eddy
formation off the Beaufort shelf, and lead to eventual incorporation of radium
measurements in autonomous data collection efforts such as the proposed North
Slope observatory. &lt;br/&gt;
