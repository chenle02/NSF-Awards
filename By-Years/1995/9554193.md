9554193 Stewart The development and revision of explanatory models and the
articulation of theory and data each represents scientific problem solving. Our
research addresses problem solving so conceived and extends previous genetics
problem-solving research to evolutionary biology, including a study of the
transfer of problem-solving heuristics. Research questions include: 1. What
conceptual and heuristic knowledge do students employ to solve problems (use and
revise explanatory models) in genetics? 2. Do students who have received
instruction that makes explicit general problem-solving heuristics employ those
heuristics to solve problems in evolution? Data to address these questions will
include transcripts of audio tapes of: students as they solve problems: Teacher
interactions with students during problem solving; classroom conferences in
which students defend their problem solutions. Student's conceptual knowledge,
problem-solving heuristics, interactions between the two, an changes in each
during the development of the solution to a set of problems will be identified
during the data analysis. The research is significant as it will extend problem-
solving research to areas of science that are not highly axiomatized; contribute
to theories of problem solving and to instructional development in which model
revising is important: and demonstrate how evolutionary biology can be taught as
a problem solving science.
