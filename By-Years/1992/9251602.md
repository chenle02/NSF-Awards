The mathematical capabilities of undergraduate students is being enhanced by
integrating graphical, numeric, and symbolic mathematical software across a
broad spectrum of the mathematical sciences curriculum. This is a part of a
long- term plan to integrate state-of-the-art mathematical and statistical
problem-solving tools into the undergraduate curriculum.
