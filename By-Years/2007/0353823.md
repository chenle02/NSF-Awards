Indiana University (IU) will host twelve undergraduate physics majors for ten-
week summer terms in the three year period 2004-2006. The principal goal of the
program is to provide the participants with meaningful and challenging
experiences in scientific research working with faculty and staff at the IU
Physics Department, the IU Cyclotron Facility and the IU Nuclear Theory Center
in Bloomington, Indiana. Excellent students from schools throughout the US will
be recruited with preference given to those from institutions in the Midwest as
well as small institutions where research opportunities for undergraduates may
be limited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their individual research
projects, the students will attend weekly seminars on current research in
physics and will receive special instruction on machine shop techniques and
scientific computation. A unique feature of this program is the combination of
the IU Physics Department and IUCF, which together encompass a broad range of
disciplines in both experimental and theoretical fields. Multidisciplinary
research in areas such as biocomplexity, medical physics and material science
will be used to illustrate the application of scientific research to societal
benefit.&lt;br/&gt;
