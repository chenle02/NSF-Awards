0138353 Knap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to continue the now
47-year long series of (3000m depth) ocean hydrographic stations near Bermuda,
known as Station S or the Panulirus Stations. The data have already been used by
investigators in several disciplines to examine fluctuations at periods from
weeks to years in the western Atlantic Ocean. Changes over periods of decades
are starting to appear. The on-going dataset has proven to be an important link
in global ocean monitoring for both climate research and for evaluating temporal
changes of many parameters. Ancillary users have, through this program, enhanced
the measurements at this site to provide a rich array of data available to the
ocean sciences community. This time series is a contribution to the U.S. Climate
Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
