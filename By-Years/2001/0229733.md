The Garfield Park Conservatory will develop, install and evaluate "Sugar from
the Sun," a living plant exhibition that explores the fundamental biological
process of photosynthesis. The exhibit addresses common misunderstandings and
misconceptions about photosynthesis by engaging children and adults in
activities that explore the primary concepts that plants require air, water and
light to produce sugar, and that the sun is the energy source. The exhibit will
be constructed in the Conservatory's Sweet House, where tropical plants such as
mangos and bananas will provide the stimulus to engage visitors in learning how
plants manufacture sugar from the sun. Exhibits convey the science of
photosynthesis and inspire appreciation for the critical role plants play in
sustaining life on earth. Supplementary educational materials (self-guides,
exploration backpacks and an interactive website) will be layered into the
visitor experience, enabling visitors to develop a deeper understanding of
photosynthesis. The project also will develop a non-exhibit based model
dissemination package for teaching photosynthesis in other conservatories,
promoting active science learning about photosynthesis nationwide.
