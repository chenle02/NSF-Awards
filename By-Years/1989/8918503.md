The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland program development effort is to
foster cooperative research in theoretical physics. A group of four physicists
from the United States will visit Poland to attend the X School of Coherent
Optics being held in Ustron, Poland, September 18-27, 1989. While there,
individual researchers expect to develop several joint research proposals for
consideration under the National Science Foundation's U.S.-Poland Cooperative
Science Program or the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fund. If successful, the research
projects should contribute to our understanding of quantum optics.
