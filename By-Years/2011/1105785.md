The Barrett Lectures in Mathematics are a well known and highly regarded annual
lecture series with a distinguished list of speakers over many years. The 2011
Barrett Lectures are entitled "Recent Developments in Mathematical Relativity."
The four-day conference is organized by the University of Tennessee's
differential geometry group comprised of Professors Fernando Schwartz, Alexandre
Freire and Conrad Plaut. During the first three days, distinguished researchers
Igor Rodnianski, Richard Schoen and Robert Wald, will each deliver three hour-
long survey lectures representing the three main mathematical approaches to the
subject. Additionally, there will be two hour-long plenary lectures per day.
During the fourth day there will be twelve half-hour talks by early-career
researchers.

Mathematical relativity is a vast field, which has experienced major
developments over the past 30 years in both its analytical and geometric
aspects. These developments have had important implications for both the
mathematics and physics communities. Recent PhD recipients and graduate students
are a particularly important part of the audience, and every effort will be made
to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary audience.
