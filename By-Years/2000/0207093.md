This research program addresses the study of carrier transport in advanced
silicon carbide (SiC) devices. The research focuses on the modeling, fabrication
and electrical characterization of advanced SiC devices, including n and
p-channel MOSFETs, and novel surface and buried-channel DIMOS and IGBT devices
with particular emphasis on their utilization for power switching applications.
The research emphasizes the development of a low temperature fabrication
sequence to reduce the detrimental effects of 'step bunching', while
simultaneously achieving the required activation of the implanted species. A
goal of the research is to increase carrier inversion and accumulation-layer
mobility through a combination of low temperature processing with an optimized
gate dielectric. The research focuses on the physical modeling of carrier
mobility where electrons move in localized states at the SiC-SiO2 interface and
are thermally activated into extended states in the conduction band. A
combination of thermal activation, surface roughness and point Coulomb
scattering all play a role in limiting the carrier mobility and hence the
specific ON resistance of SiC power MOSFETs. The study of both electron and hole
transport is important in planar SiC integrated circuit technology, particularly
for 'smart' power applications. The research employs novel test structures,
fabrication techniques and instrumentation to study the influence of surface and
bulk traps on carrier transport in inversion and layers over an extended
temperature range, while contributing to the advancement of SiC devices,
particularly power semiconductor devices.
