Hamline University has purchased a 200Mhz FT-NMR with a variable temperature
option and graphics plotter. Both the theory and practive of FT-NMR analysis
have been incorporates into the introductory organic chemistry course and all
five of the upper division laboratories. The instrument is available for
undergraduate research. Specific course improvements include enhanced proton
analysis and the addition of 13C analysis in organic chemistry laboratories,
computer controlled acquisition and processing of data, application of FT-NMR
analysis to small samples, determination of kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters, characterization of poolymers and polymerization kinetics, and
special pulse sequencing for simplification of complex spectra. The institution
is matching the award with an equal amount of funding.
