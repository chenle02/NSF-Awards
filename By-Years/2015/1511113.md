Ferrofluids are fluids that respond to magnetic fields. This project examines
the fluid dynamics of a ferrofluid composed of magnetic particles in a
suspending liquid. The project focuses on the motion of the fluid near a fluid-
air interface where interesting connections have been observed experimentally
between flow near the interface and flow in the bulk fluid. The velocity of the
ferrofluid near various kinds of interfaces will be measured in well-defined
flows. The results will be used to test the validity of theory that describes
the appropriate dynamical conditions at the interface. The project will provide
research training to graduate and undergraduate students and will develop Web-
based educational videos that explore the fluid dynamics of ferrofluids.

The objective of the project is to validate experimentally appropriate
interfacial boundary conditions on linear and internal angular momentum at
ferrofluid-air, ferrofluid-non-ferrofluid, and ferrofluid-ferrofluid interfaces.
Velocity profiles near the interfaces and in the bulk fluids will be measured
for various prototype flows, and results will be used to develop models that can
be extended to more complicated geometries, including ferrofluid droplets. The
results should help clarify the appropriate interfacial conditions to use for
fluid systems that exhibit antisymmetric stresses, which, in turn, can be
incorporated into engineering design of various applications involving
ferrofluids with interfaces.
