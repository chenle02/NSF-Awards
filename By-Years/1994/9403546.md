With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professors Parson and Kolis of
Clemson University will develop new routes to the synthesis of commercially
important chemicals using supercritical water as a solvent. This environmentally
benign synthesis proposal emphasizes the scope and mechanisms of metal catalyzed
oxidations of small organic molecules in supercritical water. A collaborative
effort with Professor Myrick at the University of South Carolina will involve in
situ Raman spectroscopy monitoring of the reactions taking place in
supercritical water. Eastman Kodak will offer advice by identifying critical
needs for better methods to produce industrially important compounds. This
research will address an area of strategic importance in the chemical industry.
The project will explore the fundamental chemistry that occurs when small carbon
containing compounds are oxidized in a reactor using supercritical water( a
unique form of water at high temperature and pressure) in the presence of metal
ion catalysts. The use of supercritical water to replace organic solvents shows
promise in the reduction of environmental pollution and the generation of
hazardous wastes.
