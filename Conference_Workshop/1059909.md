This award provides support for the 4th Western Conference in Financial
Mathematics (WCFM) and the 6th International Symposium on Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations (ICBSDE), held back-to-back on June 6-10, 2011 in the
vicinity of the University of Southern California campus. The main objectives
are to bring together researchers in the areas of financial mathematics,
insurance, and statistics from the Western U.S. and international researchers in
the field of BSDEs and Stochastic Analysis, among them many are experts in
Mathematical Finance and Stochastic Control Theory. The WCMF conference follows
a sequence started at Stanford in 2007, followed by Austin in 2008 and UC Santa
Barbara in 2009. The ICBSDE Symposium commenced in 1996 at the University of
Paris VI, taking place every 3 years alternately in France and China. This is
the first time it will be held in the United States. The two conferences will
provide platforms for applied mathematicians, probabilists, and statisticians to
present their recent work and initiate new projects. It is also expected to
foster fruitful exchanges of ideas and to encourage new interactions between the
Financial Mathematics and the BSDE communities, since the two fields have had
significant overlaps in recent years.

The proposers have made notable contributions in backward stochastic
differential equations and their applications in finance, and the USC
Mathematical Finance Colloquium has recently hosted many prominent researchers
in both BSDEs and financial mathematics. It is expected that the two conferences
will involve about a hundred researchers and graduate students. It is planned to
include a significant number of participants in the early stages of their
careers. Special effort will be made to give visibility to women and members of
minority groups as invited speakers. All papers presented at the conferences
will be disseminated via a website and made available to a wide international
community. The conferences will also expose advanced undergraduates and
beginning graduate students to cutting-edge research and encourage them to
undertake further studies in the fields of Math Finance and BSDEs.
