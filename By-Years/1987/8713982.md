The ionosphere at high latitudes is disturbed by a variety of energy inputs
from the magnetosphere, including particle precipitation, electric fields, and
the flow of electrical currents, all ultimately originating with the interaction
of the solar wind and the outer boundary of the magnetosphere. Ionospheric
density irregularities and drifts are present over a wide range of scale sizes
and velocities. The deployment of modern radar systems, with sophisticated
computer diagnostics and data compression capabilities, allows these
irregularities and drifts to be measured as part of a thorough study of the high
latitude ionosphere, and provides information for the solution of practical
problems associated with radio communication at high latitudes. This award is
for continued support of the Johns Hopkins University radar at Goose Bay,
Labrador, in conjunction with satellite measurements, other ground based
instruments in the area, and a similar radar in Antarctica. The Antarctic radar
is at Halley Bay, the magnetic conjugate point, i.e., the place where the
magnetic field lines that thread the Goose Bay ionosphere, and extend out many
earth radii into the magnetosphere, return to the southern hemisphere
ionosphere. The currents, electric fields, and particles from the magnetosphere
tend to extend along field lines and be the same at conjugate points, but the
differences give important information on the coupling between the magnetosphere
and the ionosphere.
