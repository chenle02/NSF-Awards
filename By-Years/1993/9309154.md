9309154 Sennott The objective is the characterization and computation of optimal
policies for the minimization of the average cost per unit time. Such policies
enable complex systems to be efficiently controlled. Markov decision chains with
countable state spaces are studied. Know axioms guarantee the existence of
average cost optimal stationary policies. It will be determined whether these
policies are also optimal under additional criteria, and when they may be
computed by value iteration. In addition, the adaptive control case when certain
system parameters are unknown will be treated. An important result of the
research will be the development of an algorithm for the computation of optimal
policies when the state space is denumerably infinite. The existence and
computability of controls will be shown for a new class of stochastic control
problems under a variety of average cost criteria. These extensions will have
direct applicability to queuing systems, multiple-access communications, and
vehicle control ***
