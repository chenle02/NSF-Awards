The 25th Annual Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and
Computing will be held May 10--12, 2012 on the campus of East Tennessee State
University in Johnson City, TN. This annual conference on discrete mathematics
provides a regional forum for the exchange of the latest research results and
new directions of interests to researchers in the field. It also provides a
stimulating and informative venue for new investigators; including undergraduate
students, graduate students and recent PhDs. Over the past twenty-four years,
the Cumberland Conference has developed a reputation for having high quality
speakers and for providing a setting conducive to collaboration among the
participants.

The goal of the 2012 Cumberland Conference is reflected by its theme: Open
Problems and Contemporary Conjectures. This conference plays a unique role as a
regional exchange for researchers of all levels and has always actively promoted
the initiation of new research collaborations. This year the conference topics
include design theory, networks and their applications, hypergraphs, domination
in graphs, graph coloring, extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, and degree
distribution models. Four internationally-renown researchers have accepted
invitations to be principal speakers: Jozsef Balogh (University of Illinois),
Fan Chung (University of California, San Diego), Michael Henning (University of
Johannesburg, South Africa), and Curt Lindner (Auburn University). The invited
speakers and the conference participants are encouraged to give talks within the
theme of the conference by including open problems and recently posed
conjectures. The contemporary nature of the conference also encourages graph-
theoretic models that are applicable in areas such as computer science, data
mining, image capturing, and biological networks.
