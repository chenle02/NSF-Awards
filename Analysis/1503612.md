This mathematics research project deals with the study of so-called integral
formulas in complex and harmonic analysis. Integral formulas are important tools
for recovering information on large data sets that are located in hard-to-reach
places by collecting very small samples that are within easy reach. For
instance, integral formulas can be used to recover the temperature in the
interior of a solid body (say a tree, or even a planet) without having to probe
holes in the body (that is, in the tree example, without having to drill holes
in the trunk). Instead, one measures the temperature at surface level (say on
the tree's bark) and plots these values in the integral formula: the output will
be the value of the temperature inside. One of the novelties of this project is
that it allows to deal with objects whose outer surface is very rough (as
opposed to very smooth).

The PI and her collaborators will bring together techniques and problems from
different parts of the general field of analysis, specifically real harmonic
analysis and complex function theory in one and several complex variables. One
of the main goals is to develop a theory of Cauchy-like singular integrals with
holomorphic kernel and for non-smooth domains in Euclidean complex space that
successfully blends the complex structure of the ambient domain with the
Calderon-Zygmund theory for singular integrals on non-smooth domains in real
space. Doing so requires coming to terms with the additional rigidity imposed by
the underlying complex structure, in particular the geometric properties that
are collectively known as (or linked to) pseudo-convexity. Applications to
several complex variables include the regularity of certain orthogonal
projection operators, such as the Bergman and Szego projections, in the novel
context of non-smooth domains.
