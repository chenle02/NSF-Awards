Human intellectual capacity to manage complex design processes is continually
thwarted by advances in scale and variety of VLSI technologies, increasing
sophistication of synthesis and verification tools, and escalating time-to-
market pressures. This research focuses on reasoning support tools for
decomposing high-level system specifications into synthesizable components. The
underlying format is rigorous enough to support, and in some cases supplant,
formal verification tasks. Human interaction centers on a novel tabular notation
developed by the PI, whose synchronous semantics matches the intended models in
high level synthesis. Resulting software includes a system for animating
behavior tables and mapping them to existing synthesis languages, a graphical
interface for interactively building and manipulating behavior tables, and an
integrated formal system for transforming and reasoning about them. These
components can be used individually or in combination. The software is widely
and freely distributed and is part of a repository of Scheme-based modeling
tools.
