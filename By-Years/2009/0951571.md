This research project applies contrasting motives to understand the complexities
of relationship initiation and development. Specifically, the research examines
when and why people attempt to initiate a relationship, who pursues the
initiation, how rapidly the relationship develops, and the trajectory it takes
as it becomes more established. Given the importance of relationships and
lasting connections to well-being, research in this area has sought to develop a
better understanding of how people establish meaningful social connections and
transition from initial attraction, to affiliation, to stable and interdependent
relationships. Although much is known about the qualities and circumstances that
produce attraction as well as the regulation of closeness and intimacy in
already established relationships, very little is known about the thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors involved in the transition from attraction to intimacy.
The investigators of this project make predictions for people's behaviors in
relationships that are associated with either promotion or prevention-oriented
goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These predictions will be tested across seven
studies that either measure or manipulate people's motivations for promotion or
prevention and then assess their (a) perceptions of interest and the potential
for social support from others, (b) intentions to initiate and pursue
relationships, and (c) behaviors associated with such pursuit (e.g., conveyed
attraction to and self-disclosure toward others). The studies will also analyze
both short-term interactions between strangers and the more extended development
of friendships or romantic partnerships. By studying these types of relationship
processes, findings from this research could help to attenuate the problem of
loneliness as well as facilitate social transitions following relocation, change
of employment and divorce.
