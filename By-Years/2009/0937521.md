This project is exploring a web-based approach for delivering an interactive
proposal writing workshop. Highly interactive, on-site workshops, although
effective in improving grant writing skills, are costly, time consuming and
generally only reach a limited audience. The project is testing whether this
type of presentation can be converted to a web-based format. The plans call for
a pilot involving at least ten remote sites with ten or more local participants
at each. The web-based model includes a local workshop facilitator to coordinate
the activities at each site and to serve as an interface between the
participants at that site and the workshop leader. Survey data is being used to
determine the effectiveness of the approach and to identify improvements. If the
interactive web-based proposal writing workshops proves to be effective, the
potential for reaching a broader audience of faculty members at diverse and
sometimes remote campuses will be greatly enhanced.
