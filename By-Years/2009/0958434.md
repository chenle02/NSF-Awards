The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Mary Wirth of the University of
Arizona. Prof. Wirth and her students will investigate how the binding of a
peptide ligand to a G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) translates to receptor
conformational change. Prof. Wirth and her students will develop and employ
single molecule fluorescence microscopy to realize this ambitious goal. Success
of the project would lead to adaptation and acceptance of single molecule
microscopy and spectroscopy as complementary tools to NMR and X-Ray
crystallography in studying biological systems. In the long term increased
understanding of the interactions between peptide ligands and GPCRs may lead to
the development of new drugs that would target this important group of
receptors. The research of Prof. Wirth will provide excellent training
opportunities for students and postdoctoral research associates in a highly
multidisciplinary area at the forefront of scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;
