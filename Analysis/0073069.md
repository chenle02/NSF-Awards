The project is a continuation of DMS-9704867 which was entitled Renormalization
and Global Bifurcation. Tresser and co-worker P.Coullet introduced the notion of
renormalization in the theory of dynamical systems and conjectured universality
of the transition to chaos in a variety of natural systems. The corresponding
renormalization theory deals with the small scale geometrical structure of one-
dimensional dynamical systems. Tresser used renormalization concepts to describe
the bifurcation diagram of a large class of families of dynamical systems. The
renormalization phenomena are observed in a wide range of applications. One
would like to have a renormalization theory which is widely applicable. For This
reason Martens initiated a real one-dimensional renormalization theory for
unimodal maps. This work uses as less as possible underlying structure. The aim
of this project is to locate more examples of renormalization, explore the
corresponding bifurcation phenomena and continue the development of the above
mentioned real one-dimensional renormalization theory.
