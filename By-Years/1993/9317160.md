9317160 Weldon This is a project whose goal is to characterize in detail the
faulting along a portion of the Mojave segment of the San Andreas Fault, using
geological means. The project hopes to better characterize rates and styles of
faulting along the fault zone, relate seismicity to surficial faults, and
provide data to test hypotheses for the physical behavior of the San Andreas
Fault. The project is designed to provide data for preliminary site selection
for a proposed deep hole drilled into the San Andreas Fault Zone. However, the
project will generate data that is critical to understanding the state of stress
along the fault and the role that geometry and secondary faults play in fault
segmentation and earthquake recurrence, regardless of whether the site is
eventually chosen for drilling. ***
