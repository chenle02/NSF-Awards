The major objective of this project is to develop a modern electrical energy
systems laboratory for undergraduate electrical engineering students. The
laboratory provides students with both hands-on experience and a deeper
understanding of theoretical concepts in the state-of-the-art power engineering
technology. The experience should prepare them to meet the challenges of the
industry by creating in them an awareness of various practical issues
confronting an engineer. The innovative aspect of this project is the
integration of the principles of modern power conversion devices (e.g.,
d.c./d.c. converters, solar generation) and practical applications (e.g.,
electric vehicles) in a laboratory environment. A single laboratory facility can
provide the students with practical knowledge in areas significant to electrical
power systems, such as power quality, power electronic conversion, associated
electromagnetic fields, control and dynamics of motors, solar power conversion,
and operation of electric vehicles at high efficiencies. The opportunity to work
with recent high-technology equipment in these allied areas will attract more
students to work in the laboratory. The laboratory experiments progress from
fundamental concepts to basic applications and lead to advanced applications.
The facility also provides opportunities for senior students to undertake
purposeful capstone design projects in power engineering that are relevant in
today's workplace. This project sets a new trend in educating the 21st century
electrical power engineer and forms a model for other engineering schools in
this context.
