This request is in support of international travel for a group of U.S.
scientists to attend a Symposium on the Origins and Evolution of Antarctic Biota
and a workshop on The Role of Antarctica in the Earth's Biosphere. The meetings
will be held in London, England and will be sponsored by the Geological Society
of London and the British Antarctic Survey. This effort is compatible with
recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences (Antarctic Solid-Earth
Sciences Research; 1987) for establishing broad reconnaissance studies as
framework for Antarctic geology. This is a key meeting of the Antarctic
paleobiology community and will focus on the current status of knowledge and
directions for future research.
