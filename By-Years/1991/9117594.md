The Borborema tectonic province in northern Brazil formed during the 600 Ma
convergence of the West African, Amazonian and San Francisco-Congo cratons to
form the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland. Because of the strong tectonic
overprint at 600 Ma it has been difficult to identify pre-Gondwana tectonic
boundaries within Borborema province. This study will provide U/Pb age
determinations for key lithologic suites and magmatic events and, together with
ongoing geologic mapping by Brazilian colleagues, will allow the tectonic
boundaries to be delineated. The results will provide much improved
understanding of the pre-600 Ma tectonic history and assembly of Gondwanaland,
and will contribute to key concepts of continental growth during the
Precambrian.//
