"Rural PTRA" is a five-year national Teacher Enhancement project to accommodate
physics and physical science teachers in a rural environment. Rural PTRA has a
faculty member at a university as a Rural PTRA Coordinator to facilitate
arranging and hosting PTRA instructional sessions. PTRAs from the previous PTRA
and PTRA Plus projects will conduct the workshops as per the PTRA model.
Following a phased plan for implementation, there will be 3 rural sites in year
one, 10 in year two, 20 in year three, 33 in year four and 26 in year five.
Rural physics and physical science teachers will be able to enroll in 36
workshop hours per year. During the course of the project 655 participants will
receive a minimum of 108 hours and another 375 a minimum of 72 hours. Following
the PTRA model the project will identify rural participants with leadership
capability and content knowledge and will encourage them to apply for PTRA
leader training to establish a cohort of Rural PTRA teacher leaders that can
continue to serve science teachers from rural communities. In the pattern of
previous PTRA projects this has led to long term sustainability.
