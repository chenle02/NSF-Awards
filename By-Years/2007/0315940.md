Prof. Don Pfister at Harvard University with his associate Dr. Karen Hansen will
be studying taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among a group of so-called
cup fungi mostly of the northern hemisphere, many suspected to form root-
connections with surrounding vegetation, particularly in disturbed habitats
following fires. The operculate cup-fungi (order Pezizales of the Ascomycota)
are a relatively small group with slightly more than 1000 described species.
Several family-level taxonomic studies have been published, and the order is
reasonably well known except for the largest group, that which includes the
family Pyronemataceae (78 genera and approximately 500 species). The
Pyronemataceae will be the focus of this study. It is diverse family; species
show a wide range of morphological and ecological traits. Using DNA sequence
data from three nuclear gene regions and a full analysis of morphological
characters, a solid backbone of phylogenetic relationships in the family will be
established, which in turn will provide grounds for an improved natural
classification of the group. Study of two generic complexes within the family
will focus at the species level. &lt;br/&gt;This project is significant because
it will provide a thoroughly documented sample of all the recognized genera
within a major family of the Pezizales. The order then can be used as a model
group for evolutionary, ecological and biogeographical studies. Although in many
cases the biological activities of these fungi are not known, some of these
fungi are saprobes, others are mycorrhizal and a few are parasitic on plants. In
the broad ecosystem context these fungi play a part in establishing plants in
disturbed habitats and extreme environments. In this project graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained and mentored. The research offers a
particularly potent combination of training opportunities in traditional and
molecular methodologies. The project also encourages cooperative activities
involving scientists from the US, Norway, Denmark and other countries. As well,
public audiences will be engaged through activities in the Harvard Museum of
Natural History and local natural history organizations.&lt;br/&gt;
