The PIs propose to apply a recently introduced plasma-assisted non-equilibrium
high pressure processing technique to the formation and deposition of diamond
films. This innovative technique makes use of an additional biasing electric
field which could preferentially heat electrons in the plasma and hopefully
perturb the gas-phase chemistry in the boundary layer in such a fashion as to
affect the production of the resulting diamond films. The idea is that hot
electrons produced by the discharge will dissociate molecular hydrogen near the
diamond forming substrate, thereby increasing the concentration of atomic
hydrogen near the surface and enhancing both the growth rate and quality of the
diamond film. Sophisticated laser diagnostics, including degenerate four-wave
mixing, will be used to ascertain and monitor the important species in the
diamond formation process. A three year effort is proposed which will involve a
coordinated effort with the discharge experiments, deposition experiments,
diagnostics, and theoretical modeling, thus creating a "closed loop" system.
