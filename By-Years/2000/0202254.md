This award will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research
vessel Ewing operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia
University and dedicated to use in support of marine research. The Shipboard
Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed
essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program
provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment
such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the
location of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers
and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and
other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and
from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully
qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project
will allow the institution to acquire a Tasman P-Code GPS Receiver, seismic air
compressor oil coolers and valves, a fire detection system, and refurbishment of
an inflatable workboat. ***
