Ice flow is resisted by frictional forces that keep a glacier from immediately
sliding into the ocean. Friction comes in two varieties: internal friction
within the ice column which resists ice deformation and basal friction which
resists ice sliding over its bedrock substrate. Partitioning between internal
and basal friction is difficult since both have similar expressions at the most
common target for data collectionâ€”the ice-sheet surface. However, understanding
this partitioning is important because the physical processes that control
internal and basal friction act and evolve at different timescales. This project
combines spaceborne remote sensing observations from the ice-sheet surface with
ice-penetrating radar data that images the internal structure of the ice sheet
in order to partition the contribution of each source of friction. Results will
advance the fundamental understanding of ice flow and will strengthen
projections of future sea-level rise. Broader Impacts of the project include
facilitating data reuse for the ice-sheet research community; the strategy for
distributing the software toolkit includes student mentorship and hackathon
teaching.

The researcher will expand the impact of existing ice-penetrating datasets by 1)
developing new open-source algorithms for extraction of englacial stratigraphy;
2) creating stratigraphy data products that can be assimilated into future
studies of ice motion; and 3) using statistical analyses to integrate radar
datasets into larger-scale interpretations with remote sensing datasets of ice-
surface velocity, altimetry, climate variables, and model-derived basal
friction. The computational tools developed as part of this effort will be
integrated and released as a reusable software toolkit for ice-penetrating radar
data analysis. The toolkit will be validated and tested by deployment to cloud-
hosted JupyterHub instances, which will serve as a singular interface to access
radar and remote sensing data, load them into a unified framework, step through
a predefined processing flow, and carry out statistical analyses. In some areas,
the imaged englacial stratigraphy will deviate from the ice-dynamic setting
expected based on surface measurements alone. There, the internal dynamics (or
ice-dynamic history) are inconsistent with the surface dynamics, likely because
internal friction is poorly constrained and misattributed to basal friction
instead. This work will develop the data and statistical tools for constraining
internal friction from ice-penetrating radar, making those data products and
tools available for future work.
