This project will: (1) develop new methods for studying the acceleration and
transport of solar energetic particles based upon detailed analysis of particle
angular distributions; (2) characterize and understand transient anisotropies
accompanying cosmic ray transient variations; (3) develop new methods to
determine the geometry of interplanetary magnetic turbulence based upon
measurements of magnetic field and charged particle fluctuations; (4) improve
understanding of particle scattering by turbulence, ultimately aimed to achieve
a useful predictive capability where particle mean free paths can be deduced
from measurable properties of the turbulence; (5) evaluate the usefulness of
cosmic rays as a space weather tool for remote sensing the properties of
approaching solar wind disturbances; and (6) improve knowledge of geomagnetic
cutoffs and charged particle motion in Earth's magnetosphere through detailed
testing of model predictions against ground-based observations.
