The relationship between krill and its consumers is considered crucial to the
dynamics of the Antarctic ecosystem. To date, most studies of this relationship
have concentrated on simply describing patterns of association. This research
will go beyond a descriptive approach, and probe the mechanisms that generate
patterns of association between selected seabirds and patches of krill. The
focus is on seabird species that are abundant at South Georgia in winter and
that are known to feed heavily on krill: Gentoo Penguins, Common Diving-Petrels,
Kerguelen Petrels and Blue Petrels. The study includes several components. These
include the quantification of seabird distribution relative to the location and
size of krill patches and the quantification of individual behavior of seabirds
as a function of krill density, krill patch size, distance from krill patches
and abundance of other consumers. Data on individual behavior will be used to
construct partial differential equation models of seabird distribution. Patterns
of association predicted by these models will be compared to observed patterns
of association. Finally, an assessment of how birds actually capture prey such
as krill, and how the potential cost of foraging increases as weather conditions
become severe, will be made. This research will unite several lines of
investigation into a synthesized portrait of how birds respond to spatial and
temporal variability in resources within the Antarctic environment.
