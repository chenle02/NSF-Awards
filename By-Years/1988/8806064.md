The National Research Council's Committee on Natural Disasters was established
to maintain readiness for conducting postdisaster reconnaissance studies and
documenting perishable information valuable to researchers, planners, designer,
practitioners, and building officials, as well as to emergency preparedness
officials, for their use in mitigating future natural disasters. The committee
will continue this work as well as encourage future planning, including the
conduct of meetings, seminars, or symposia in the interests of (a) implementing
recommendations of the quick-response teams, and (b) improving our ability to
cope with future natural disasters.
