9458405 Bercovici Unifying the theories of plate tectonics and mantle dynamics
is a major goal in geodynamics. This goal is impeded by the fact that plate
tectonics treats plate margins as discontinuous, while mantle-flow models employ
continuum mechanics. This research project proposes to develop a continuum model
of plate tectonics that incorporates finite plate-margin widths and intraplate
deformation. Significant undergraduate and graduate teaching will be
incorporated in the career development plan.
