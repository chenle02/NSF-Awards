This project will relieve the overcrowded conditions at the herbarium of the
University of Nebraska Museum. The collection of plants has regional and
national importance and is particularly strong in recording the plants from the
Great Plains. The collection is used by students and researchers at the
university and elsewhere for teaching and research on Great Plains and botanical
biodiversity. This project will ensure adequate housing and conservation of this
important collection.
