This dissertation project involves an anthropology student from Washington
University-St. Louis. The study will be conducted among rural African women
involved in cooperative saving and loan associations in Hausa territory, Niger,
West Africa. Using a combination of ethnographic participant observation, open-
ended interviews and formal questionnaires, the student will test several
hypotheses about the conditions necessary for successful cooperation in these
circumstances (of economic poverty and inadequate social and economic
infrastructure). The hypotheses involve the role of information, group size,
excludability of non-contributors, and the presence of leadership on the success
of cooperatives. This project is important because it advances our understanding
of the general principles explaining success or failure in collective action.
Increases in our theoretical sophistication in this area that will come from
theoretically-informed intensive case studies such as this project will allow
policy makers to facilitate more effective economic development. In addition
training new professional social scientists adds to the nation's store of
expertise about this important area of the world.
