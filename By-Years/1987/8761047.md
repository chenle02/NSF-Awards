This project will perform research on a technique of three.dimensional fourier
mapping of microwave scattering by frequency sweeping. The research could lead
to development of an imaging system for dielectric evaluation and for medical
diagnosis. While there exist many imaging techniques, direct imaging of
dielectric profiles is currently unavailable. The microwave dose for imaging of
the human body is expected to be on the order of microwatts per gram to tens of
microwatts per gram, which is two to three orders of magnitude below the
recommended safety level. The image will provide a dielectric profile of the
target with a resolution of about 3 mm in each of the three dimensions. As a
result of the sensitivity of dielectric permittivity with respect to various
biological tissues, this method of imaging should provide greater contrast
between tumor and normal tissues than other imaging techniques. The technique
might also be useful for non.invasive evaluation of other materials where
dielectric profile is needed, or in the mapping of other physical parameters
such as temperature or pressure.
