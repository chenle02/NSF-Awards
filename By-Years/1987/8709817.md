A number of architectures have been proposed to implement the basic principles
of dataflow computation. The main problem common to all these architectures is a
large overhead associated with the execution of each individual instruction. In
particular, each operand that passes from one instruction to another may have to
travel considerable distances through a communication network and various
hardware components (special memories and queues) before it reaches its
destination. Furthermore, operands destined for the same instruction must be
recognized and segregated in a special token matching store. Only when all
operands have arrived for an instruction, can it be scheduled for execution on a
processor. In comparison, passing an operand from one instruction to another in
a von Neumann computer requires only a simple memory store operation. In this
research, a different approach is used to executing dataflow program, which
significantly reduces the overhead of operand routing and matching. The approach
is based on the idea of breaking a given dataflow program into segments of code
which, due to their operand dependencies, must be executed sequentially. Each
such sequence may be loaded into memory for execution whenever its first
instruction is enabled. Once loaded,it can be viewed as a very simple sequential
process, which is ready when its current instruction is enabled, running when
there is a free processor, and blocked when its current instruction is waiting
for operands to arrive. Hence, the dataflow program may be viewed as a
collection of very simple communicating processes. In this research, they will
investigate the process-oriented approach by formulating the model and the
architecture in more detail and by performing extensive simulation experiments
to compare its performance to von Neumann computers and to other dataflow
systems.
