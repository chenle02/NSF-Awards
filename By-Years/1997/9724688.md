9724688 Hanley Under this collaborative research award, Dr. Luke Hanley of the
Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois-Chicago, will cooperate with Dr.
Besim Ben-Nissan of the Department of Materials Science, University of
Technology, Sydney, Australia to develop, analyze, and test new bioceramic
orthopedic implant materials through the application of advanced methods of
surface analysis and biomaterials engineering. Two types of implant materials
will be studied: 1) coralline implants made from coral samples from the Great
Barrier Reef and 2) hydroxyapatite coated implants which have been treated with
bone cell growth factors.
