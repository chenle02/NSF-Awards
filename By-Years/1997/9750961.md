There is an increasing pressure for industry to minimize the time and cost of
developing parts from design through production. This is certainly true when a
designer would like to get the low-piece-part cost of plastic but does not have
the time, money, or volume to justify the process. Since the bulk of this time
and cost is generated in the design and fabrication of tooling, that is where
industry is looking for higher efficiency. Whereas with traditional fabrication
techniques, it is as easy to cut a tool as it is to cut a part, a part
fabricated using rapid prototyping technology can be used as a pattern for
making epoxy tooling for injection molding. The objective of this project is to
improve mechanical engineering technology education by complementing plastic
injection molding technology with three-dimensional solid modeling and rapid
prototyping techniques. This project provides state-of-the-art rapid prototyping
and plastic injection molding systems, complementing them with our current
three-dimensional solid modeling capabilities, developing laboratory exercises
that fully take advantage of the equipment capabilities, and incorporating rapid
prototyping and injection molding in design projects. The new equipment is of
sufficient quality so that it can also be used to support local industry needs
through student projects that are incorporated directly into the laboratory
component of manufacturing methods and mechanical design courses. The potential
impact of this project is very widespread and includes all companies involved in
mechanical design and manufacturing considering plastic injection molding for
their part requirements or rapid prototyping for design verification. *
