&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic transformation of plants by Agrobacterium
tumefaciens is the only documented case of gene transfer to eukaryotes in
nature. As such, this system has attracted a great deal of attention from a
broad scientific audience concerned with its biology, its use in unraveling
complex problems in plant genetics and its biotechnological applications in
creating transgenic plants. Recent findings have broadened the possible
applications of Agrobacterium as a vector for the transfer of DNA to fungi,
oomycetes and animals. Using cDNA-AFLP analysis, our laboratory demonstrated
that Agrobacterium and E.coli alter the expression of plant defense and stress
response genes of Ageratum conyzoides cells in culture. However, Agrobacterium
also induced a gene encoding a nodulin-like protein which was not altered by
E.coli suggesting that Agrobacterium can induce specific host genes. The project
expands on these observations and will study global expression in cell cultures
of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using high density microarray
technology. Cell cultures of Arabidopsis will be cocultivated for 24 hours with
E.coli as well as transfer proficient Agrobacterium and mutants blocked at
different major steps in the infection process. Comparing the genes expressed
using microarrays will reveal these genes that are specifically altered by
Agrobacterium. Comparing the alterations in gene expression induced by the
transfer proficient strain with the mutants will begin to identify genetic
factors responsible for these alterations. The effects observed using the first
set of mutants will be further refined by using additional mutants blocked at
single steps in the infection process. The results of these experiments should
provide insight into the unique genetic factors of the near symbiont
Agrobacterium which provides its ability to overcome host defenses and
ultimately lead to the transfer of DNA to a remarkably wide range of plants and
other eukaryotic cells.&lt;br/&gt;
