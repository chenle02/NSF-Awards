This conference is an interdisciplinary and foundationally oriented meeting on
the development, study, and use of axiomatic systems. The conference will be
held December 15-18, 1988 at Ohio State University and is under the direction of
Professor Harvey Friedman. Invited speakers are from mathematics, philosophy,
psychology, and computer science. The mix of invited speakers is expected to be
approximately three each from the areas of proof theory, nonstandard logics,
axiomatic algebra and geometry, measurement theory, decision theory and
probability theory, software verification, database systems, and proof checking
and theorem proving. Axiomatic systems are developed, studied, and used by
researchers from many academic disciplines such as mathematics, computer
science, psychology, and philosophy. This conference will bring together
representatives of each of these fields with the aim of laying new lines of
interdisciplinary research and establishing new and useful contacts among
colleagues from related areas.
