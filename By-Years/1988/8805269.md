This is the fourth in a series of conferences at Telluride on information about
the nucleus derived from high quality measurements of spin observables. Spin
observables are one of the highest priority areas of study at CEBAF and with the
new faculty at the Bates Laboratory at M.I.T. High energy experiments are also
going on at CERN. This conference is devoted to a review of new data on explicit
spin measurements in a variety of reactions, coincidence electron scattering,
and charge exchange in (p,n) and (n,p) reactions. Results will be presented on
theoretical studies of spin observables in weak interactions and on the
relativistic descriptions of the nucleus, which have resulted from experimental
data on spin observables in nucleon-nucleus scattering.
