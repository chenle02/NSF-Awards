9414355 Nash This research is focused on the development of algorithms for
nonlinear programming, particularly, problems that involve many variables. The
emphasis is on algorithms suitable for parallel computer implementation. The aim
is at methods suitable for coarse-grained parallel computers where each
processor is itself moderately powerful. The domain of target processors of
interest include computers such as the Intel Paragon and Cray supercomputers.
The algorithms developed are aimed to be general- purpose, easy to use, and
ultimately implemented as a computer software. Nonlinear programming problems
exist in several sectors of the economy, including both the industrial and
military systems. However, nonlinear programming models can be difficult to
solve. The general-purpose nature of the algorithms to be developed will make
available the power of computers to users of nonlinear models, and hence extend
the range of nonlinear programming as an everyday modeling tools.
