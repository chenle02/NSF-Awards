The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a
low-cost organic light emitting diode (OLED). The improved economics of this
OLED could bring this lighting closer to the price point required to be
competitive in high-efficiency commercial lighting or in low-cost displays, such
as monitors and calculators. Reduced cost in existing OLED products (phones,
TVs) will also prove a significant boon for users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the premise that inefficient interfaces between
materials within the OLED stack are a significant source of performance loss. As
a result, excess materials must be used (or expensive work arounds must be
applied) to maintain an acceptable performance, but at a higher cost. The
suitability of alternative technologies to improve interfacial issues in an
industrial relevant manner is evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
