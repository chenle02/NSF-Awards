Professor George Rosensteel is a major contributor to the area of the
application of symmetries and group theoretical techniques to nuclear structure
physics. He proposes to investigate the microscopic origin of nuclear collective
modes by utilizing the symplectic, microscopic collective model, based upon the
Sp(3,R) Lie algebra, and the theory of Riemann ellipsoids as theoretical tools.
The goal of this project is to discover the fundamental microscopic physics
underlying geometrical collective modes in nuclei. This investigation will
provide a better understanding of how shell considerations and nucleon pairing
influence and modify the hydrodynamic behavior of nuclei, as assumed by Bohr and
Mottelson in their collective model.
