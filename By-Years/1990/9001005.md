The University of New Hampshire will connect their campus network to the New
England Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), a regional network which is
part of the NSFNET. Direct connection to NEARnet will provide researchers with
improved access to the Internet and other national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet
and USENET. The proposed 56,000 bit per second, dedicated, communication link
will improve reliability, speed, turn.around, and flexibility for data
communication functions such as file transfer, remote login, and
teleconferencing. NEARnet will provide for equipment, maintenance, and
information services. The University of New Hampshire will be able to integrate
supercomputing and collaborative research into graduate and udergraduate
curricula. In addition to the main campus at Durham, Keene State College,
Plymouth State College, and the State Department of Education will be offered
connectivity through already existing local networks. This project thus provides
sharing of resources among the state institutions, greatly facilitates research
by students and faculty, and provides a valuable resource to supplement course
work.
