This Workshop is to define the future research directions for computer graphics
and visualization. Over the past two decades, computing environments have
radically changed in terms of processing power, parallelization, bandwidth,
storage, and computer architectures. More recently, with the introduction of
touch panel displays and the availability of large area screens, new user
interfaces are now possible. Yet there does not appear to be any long-term
research strategy which is compatible for future computing environments.
According the workshop is bringing together computer graphics leaders and
visionaries, as well as innovators from closely related fields, to define
broader, more fundamental, longer term research areas. The workshop will
establish an appropriate set of research challenges to help guide the National
Science Foundation in their mission. A broad range of topics and unsolved
problems will be identified, each with a set of specific goals.

The workshop is being organized by:

? Professor James Foley ? Stephen Fleming Chair in Telecommunications, Georgia
Institute of Technology ? Professor Donald P. Greenberg ? Jacob Schurman
Professor of Computer Graphics, Director, Program of Computer Graphics, Cornell
University ? Professor Pat Hanrahan ? Canon USA Professor, Computer Graphics
Laboratory, CSEE Dept., School of Engineering, Stanford University ? Professor
Jessica Hodgins ? Computer Science and Robotics, Associate Director for the
Faculty in the Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University, part-time Director
of the new Disney Research, Pittsburgh Laboratory

During the two-day workshop, each participant will be assigned the
responsibility of making a brief presentation during the first day. For each
sub-area one participant will be selected and will have the responsibility for
the documentation of the summary findings. At the conclusion of the workshop,
the four primary investigators will edit and compile the results.
