Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is 1) developing discovery-based
interactive audio-visual instructional modules designed to improve student
learning of post-calculus probability and statistics concepts, and 2) evaluating
the effectiveness of the learning approach and learning objects. Intellectual
Merit: The intellectual merit of this project includes developing educational
materials that meet auditory, visual and kinesthetic learning styles of
students. By enhancing existing open-source materials, such as Internet applets,
and by combining audio-visual instruction with interactive inquiry-based
lessons, students are guided to discover and visualize important concepts in
post-calculus probability and statistics. The audio-visual component of the
learning modules includes an animation of the learning object highlighting
important and sometimes complex features and showing the results of selecting
certain components. This component is designed to resemble the teacher
demonstrating the material to the student. This approach for combining
interactive learning objects with audio-visual instructions and guided discovery
is new in post-calculus probability and statistics and can be a powerful method
for future instruction given the audio-visual nature of today's students.
Broader Impact: The impact is wide reaching beyond just post-calculus
probability and statistics. The method of combining visualizations with audio
instructions and inquiry learning is a valuable experience for future
mathematics teachers taking the probability and statistics classes. Furthermore,
promoting independent work is crucial as departments strive to help students
become life-long learners.
