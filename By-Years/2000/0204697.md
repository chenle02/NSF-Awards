This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by James Mayer, Department of Chemistry, University of
Washington, in the fundamental processes of transition metal-promoted
oxidations. The properties and reactivity of a new osmium compound,
tris(pyrazolyl)borate osmium dioxo nitride will be studied. This compound has
shown olefin dihydroxylation activity. Novel electrophilic reactions of
coordinated ligands will be explored, starting from the unique attack of an
anilido ligand bound to osmium. Mayer will also extend his work into high
oxidation state ruthenium and iridium complexes. In these strongly oxidizing
complexes, ligands that are usually electrophiles act as nucleophiles and show
unusual reactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The selective oxidation of organic
compounds by transition metal reagents and catalysts is of fundamental and
technological importance. Selective oxidation is a key part of the production of
many commodity chemicals, specialty organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and
there is much room for improvement in these processes. Undergraduate and
graduate students will also be trained in this important research area that
combines synthetic and mechanistic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
