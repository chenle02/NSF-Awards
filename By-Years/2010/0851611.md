The Texas A&M University Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics REU Site will
provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2013.
Twelve students will be selected to participate in a 10-week research experience
in biochemistry. The major goals of this program are to prepare students to
pursue graduate training and careers in research, and to instill in those
students an appreciation of the effort and satisfaction involved in this
pursuit. Students will be trained in a diverse array of modern biochemical
methods in a vibrant department, and will develop effective oral and written
communication skills to describe their scientific projects. Recruiting efforts
are focused on students who have completed their junior or sophomore year at
colleges and universities in Texas and mid-Southern states, particularly those
from institutions that do not offer doctoral degrees. Applications from students
in underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged. Undergraduate
participants will perform cutting-edge research in biochemistry while integrated
into pre-existing laboratory groups of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,
undergraduate students and technicians. At the conclusion of the program the
students will present their research accomplishments in both written and oral
reports. More information is available at http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/?ch=reu,
