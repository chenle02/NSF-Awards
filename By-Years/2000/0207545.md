&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to investigate State-to-State
differences in National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) test items to
determine how state policies have affected changes in NAEP scores. The study
addresses the problem of assessing the contributions of State policies on
student achievement. The purpose of the project is to develop empirical measures
for the effects on student achievement of reform practices. It would analyze the
content of individual items to better measure specific aspects of student
learning that might have been affected by the policies of that State. Also, they
would build a mathematical model of the value-added of state policies.
