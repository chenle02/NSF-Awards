Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are incredibly helpful for physically disabled
users, allowing them to provide input through controlling their brain activity,
which is sensed through specialized hardware. Such hardware is rapidly becoming
less expensive and obtrusive, paving the way for developing BCIs for a wider
audience. This project is about developing an infrastructure for BCI-based
sensing of a person's cognitive workload, then using this information to
structure how the computer interacts with the person. The infrastructure will
enable research around several kinds of adaptive interface, including
educational tools that use brain activity to make lessons harder or easier and
ways to evaluate the comprehensibility and difficulty of data visualizations.
The research has the potential to impact society by improving education, data
analysis, and interfaces for both people in general and people with
disabilities. Further, the lead researcher will use the infrastructure and
enabled research to attract students from groups traditionally underrepresented
in computer science, as well as to support courses on affective computing and
data visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding supports the infrastructure
necessary to build and test adaptive user interfaces that respond intelligently
to user cognitive state in real-time. In particular, the PIs will acquire a
multichannel frequency domain fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy)
device and develop the algorithms required to process fNIRS signals to extract
workload information. Signals will be pre-processed to account for motion
artifacts and to derive meaningful features (notably, mean and linear regression
slope based no the literature) for each of the 16 channels provided by the fNIRS
device. The team plans to use personalized support vector machine-based models
to distinguish between high and low workload states, based on prior work by the
PIs that shows the effectiveness of this approach.
