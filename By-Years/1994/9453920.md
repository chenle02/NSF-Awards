9453920 Hazen SEEDS is a project intended to spearhead a revolution in the way
that elementary science is being taught in Stark County schools. A local school-
business alliance (TEEP), the Stark County School District (an educational
service agency) and 17 school districts have joined forces to initiate the
project. The goal for the project is to develop hands-on, minds-on elementary
curriculum that is integrated with language arts and mathematics. This will be
accomplished via the mechanism of preparing Lead Teachers/Leadership Teams of
200 teachers who will receive training in leadership skills, science content,
pedagogy and authentic assessment. These teams will subsequently work with all
1150 elementary science teachers in the county. The process for the typical
teacher will begin with a unique 'immersion' experience in 1995 to be followed
over the course of the next five years with further enhancement, that will be
designed with the use of personal development plans so that each teacher
continues to grow professionally to meet their own personal needs. These plans
will incorporate a total of 150 hours of enhancement. The request is for
$4,489,226 with cost share estimated at $3,049,683 (59%).
