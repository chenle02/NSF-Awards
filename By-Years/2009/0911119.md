This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weito Yang of Duke University is
supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program
to develop next generation density functionals for accurate and efficient
determination of electronic structure in large physical, chemical and biological
systems. The strategy of the PI and his research group is to look deeply into
the errors embedded in currently-used functionals to determine the pathologies
at the most basic level. They are exploring functional forms needed to
approximate exact conditions with fractional charges and spins along three
directions: 1) functionals with minimal delocalization error, (2) functionals
with minimal static correlation error and (3) functionals with minimal combined
errors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the
applications of these new, more accurate functionals to computational modeling
in a wide range of disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics,
engineering, nanoscience and nanotechnology.
