The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
California at San Diego (UCSD) will purchase a 2200/1s turbomolecular pump and
its backing pump for the gas-source molecular-beam-epitaxy (GSMBE) system which
is dedicated to support research in engineering. The expected increase in wafer
throughput of the GSMBE system, with addition of a turbomolecular pump, will
benefit many research projects, some of which are listed. 1) Physics and
technologies of pseudomorphic heterostructures containing phosphorus. 2)
Optoelectronic devices based on (In,Ga)(As,P)/InP heterostructures. 3) Multiple
quantum well light modulators for optical computing (GaAs on Si with
GaP/GaAsP/GaAs intermediate layers). 4) Advanced heterojunction bipolar
transistors with phosphorus-containing materials. 5) Growth and characterization
of InGaP/GaAs heterostructures for field-effect transistors. 6) High-temperature
(A1,Ga)P/Gap heterojunction bipolar transistors.
