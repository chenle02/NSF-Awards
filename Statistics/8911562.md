This research will extend the foundational, theoretical, computational and
diagnostic methods of parametric empirical Bayesian and hierarchical Bayesian
techniques in statistics. The work will include estimators for exponential
families, using generalized linear models for the parameters and developing
interval estimates in a variety of settings, including complicated cases with
unequal sample sizes. To facilitate better fitting of real data, diagnostic
methods will be developed to investigate modeling assumptions for the family of
distributions governing the parameter and likelihoood graphics for the
hyperparameters. Construction will be aided by use of an empirical Bayes
bootstrap and an approximation technique using Pearson families ("adjusted
likelihood"). Empirical Bayesian and hierarchical Bayesian techniques will be
extended to model and solve problems concerning censored data, spatial modeling,
meta- analysis and ranking.
