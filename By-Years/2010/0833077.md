ARI:MA- Novel neutron detectors made of conjugated polymers and inorganic
nanoparticles: New Science and Technology

The objective of this research is the development of two novel neutron detection
systems, polymer quantum rods and inorganic semiconductor nanoparticle
composites, and elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying the operation
of these systems. An understanding of the device physics and the creation of new
material systems could create new science and transform neutron detection
technology. The proposed approaches employ non-vacuum techniques of
semiconductor film deposition, reducing device fabrication cost, enabling large-
area detector films, and facilitating dispersion of the neutron sensitizing
materials throughout the detector active layer. The intellectual merit of the
proposed research is a deeper understanding of high performance novel composites
for neutron detection device applications. The proposed investigations will
generate information about the interplay between the structural order, charge
transfer, and carrier transport in composites made of both organic polymer
quantum rod and inorganic semiconductor nanoparticle neutron-sensitizing
materials. The broader impacts of the research could lead to the development of
large area, and low cost "printable" neutron detectors for guarding against
dangerous radioactive materials and weapons entering the United States. Also,
the proposed research is involved with developing novel semiconductor systems
that are compatible with large-area semiconductor films that are of interest to
other applications, such as low cost solar cells, another important and urgent
societal need. Finally, the research experience gained by the students and post
docs engaged with this project will benefit society at large and them in
particular by exposing them to state of the art experimental techniques in a
cutting edge research area.
