Storage systems are an essential component of modern computers. The enormous
data generated every day (e.g., financial transactions, scientific computations)
make the robustness of all hardware and software layers in storage systems
increasingly important. When facing unexpected crash events (e.g., power outage,
operating system panic), a robust system must handle the crashes gracefully and
maintain crash consistency, which is extremely difficult to achieve in practice
due to the system complexity. This project takes a holistic view to analyze the
crash consistency of diverse storage systems. It takes into account the hardware
characteristics, the interactions between software layers (e.g., device drivers,
file systems, key-value stores), and the lifecycle of system execution (e.g.,
normal execution paths and recovery code paths) to ensure the completeness, and
leverages virtualization to minimize the disturbance for high
fidelity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project hopes to advance the robustness of
storage systems that serve as a fundamental building block of modern society.
For financial institutions where one minute downtime may lead to millions of
dollars lost, such improved robustness is valuable; for scientific exploration
where any piece of data may advance human knowledge, the benefit is
immeasurable. The full-stack approach is expected to stimulate synergistic
research in computer architecture, operating systems, databases, software
engineering, disaster response, etc., and will benefit a wide range of
practitioners including hardware manufacturers, software developers, and system
administrators. Moreover, by collaborating with multiple experts in education
and entrepreneurship, the project will spur curriculum development and industry
collaboration, promote open source and reproducibility, and broaden
participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
