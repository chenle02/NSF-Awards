This award to the Department of Education extends a partnership between the two
agencies in cooperation with the European Commission. The US partnership will
support two US consortia that will work with two corresponding European
consortia to foster student exchanges. Support of this proposal will allow 30
students from six US institutions to work at eight participating European
universities supported by the European Commission. One consortium, the
International Operations Consortium, is headed by Mark McKnew, Clemson
University, and Joao Lisboa, at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. It is
designed to integrate traditional business and industrial engineering
disciplines through new educational programs and multi-lingual materials for
global distribution on the World-Wide Web. The second consortium, for
Distributed Geographic Information Education, is headed by John Wilson,
University of Southern California, and Josef Strobl at the University of
Salzburg in Austria. The participating institutions will cooperate in developing
a multi-disciplinary geographic information science curriculum, teaching units,
and laboratory exercises as part of an on-line media resource.
