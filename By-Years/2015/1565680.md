In this project funded by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jeffrey A. Cina of the University
of Oregon is developing theoretical methods for simulating and interpreting
time-dependent laser-based measurements of low-temperature materials that absorb
light. The molecular-based approach, that approximates the quantum mechanical
behavior, makes it possible to carry out efficient calculations despite the
complexity of these systems. This method also allows the interpretation of these
processes in terms of motion, easily visualized, of the participating molecules
and atoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical framework under development is
termed a fixed vibrational basis/Gaussian bath description. For the purpose of
simulating spectroscopy signals, it is being developed in perturbative form with
respect to the electric field strengths of several external laser pulses. The
theory describes the microscopic dynamics of many-body chemical systems in terms
of a physically motivated set of time-dependent parameters that are small in
number compared with the collection of linear coefficients that are required in
a direct basis-set expansion. Initial applications are being made to resonantly
driven small-molecule targets embedded in rare-gas host crystals. Systems of
this kind display many generic features of condensed-phase chemical dynamics,
while being both challenging, due to the prominence of quantum mechanical
effects at cryogenic temperatures, and amenable to a mixed quantum/semi-
classical treatment. The quality of the calculated signals is being assessed by
comparison with extensive experimental data and more computationally intensive
theoretical results, including multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree
calculations.
