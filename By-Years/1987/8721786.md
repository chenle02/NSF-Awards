This action is to support the travel of U.S. participants who are to attend the
International Primatological Society Meetings. The general subject matter of
these meetings is important in that the conservation of endangered species and
the use of primates as biomedical models are important scientific and ethical
issues. The list of topics to be covered includes a wide variety of fields of
interests to systematists, ecologists, physiologists, behaviorists, and
evolutionary biologists. Because this is a critical time for understanding how
primate populations are being affected by habitat degradation and by increasing
scientific experimentation these types of meetings are extremely important.
