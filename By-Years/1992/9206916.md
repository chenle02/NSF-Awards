Although parasites are ubiquitous and play an important role in most natural
communities, they have generally been overlooked by population biologist. The
almost complete lack of knowledge of the genetic structure of natural
populations of parasites is particularly noteworthy. Genetic variation among
parasites in their ability to infect various species of hosts is relevant to
questions concerning (1) the effects of parasites on species diversity within
communities, (2) the maintenance of genetic variation and sexual reproduction
within host species, (3) host- parasite coevolution, and (4) modes of speciation
in parasites. Such genetic variation may also be important in the evolution and
ecology of zoonoses (parasites of animals that can infect humans) and pathogenic
fungi that infect agricultural plants. The research proposed here focuses on a
species of nematode, Howardula aoronymphium, that in nature parasitizes
mushroom-feeding species of Drosophila. Previous studies have indicated that
this nematode can have major effects on individuals, populations, and
communities of flies. The proposed research includes: (1) a survey of natural
populations of H. aoronymphium for genetic variation in infectivity,
pathogenicity, and individual growth rate as a function of host species; and (2)
selection experiments to determine how patterns of host availability affect the
evolution of host specialization.
