0207247&lt;br/&gt;Meinert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will renovate and
upgrade the fluid inclusion laboratory at Washington State University, which
serves as a regional research facility with the University of Idaho. This
facility is heavily used by students and researchers at the two cooperating
universities, including more than 45 M.S. and Ph.D. theses in the past 20 years.
Fluid inclusions provide direct evidence of the hydrothermal characteristics of
many past and present geological systems. Fluid inclusions have been
instrumental in the study of many geologic processes and are a standard part of
most studies of ore deposits. Use of the fluid inclusion laboratory at
Washington State University ranges from studies of pollen spores, to geothermal
systems, to structural geology, to economic geology, although the majority of
studies have been of ore deposits. Meinert et al. (1997) is an example of a
recently published fluid inclusion study that demonstrates the capabilities and
use of the lab. The new equipment includes a Linkham heating/freezing stage and
supporting IR microscope/video equipment. This equipment allows the routine
measurement of heating and freezing temperatures of fluid inclusions in both
transparent and semi-opaque materials.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
