This project is to excavate the most productive hominoid- bearing locality in
the Miocene Siwalik sequence of Pakistan. This locality, in the uppermost Nagri
Formation (ca. 9 million years old), has produced almost half of all the
postcranial remains of Sivapithecus recovered from the Siwaliks. Unlike the
cranial remains, these show few if any of the derived features of the extant
orang-utan, Pongo. The most recently recovered specimen, a humeral diaphysis, is
most similar to what can be presumed to be the primitive condition for
catarrhines. It may well be that Sivapithecus lacked a feature that is
universally considered to be a shared derived feature of the extant great apes
and humans, a medially torsioned humeral head. As Sivapithecus is the only
fossil hominoid that can plausibly be placed on the lineage of one of the extant
apes, knowledge of its postcranial morphology is critical for testing
assumptions about the morphology and inferred positional behaviors of the last
common ancestor of the hominoid clade. Previous recoveries from this locality
indicate that the probability of excavating further, relatively complete
postcranial elements of Sivapithecus is good.
