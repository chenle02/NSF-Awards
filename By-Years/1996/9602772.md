The National Science Foundation and Manhattan College will establish a
partnership to revitalize the institution's research infrastructure by
renovating the Plant Morphogenesis Laboratory (PML). Constructed in 1963, the
PML reflects the importance of student participation in faculty research
programs, an integral role of the undergraduate curriculum in biology since the
early fifties. The facility has served the needs of both faculty and students,
but signs of age, obsolescence, and an increased difficulty to support
scientific investigations are evident. Lighting is poor, plumbing is
problematic, laboratory benches have deteriorated, and fume hoods have reached
the end of their effectiveness. Funding from the Academic Research
Infrastructure Program will correct deficiencies needed to create a
comprehensive undergraduate research facility capable of supporting
investigations on a wide array of topics including: cell biology, molecular
biology, microbiology, virology, plant physiology and environmental biology.
Having been recognized as one of the nation's leading research colleges
educating US scientists, this project will facilitate Manhattan College in its
endeavor to maintain excellence in undergraduate biological research programs,
respond to changing priorities of faculty research, and provide research
opportunities to a growing number of students interested in pursing science as a
career. Since the institution is located in an urban environment, completion of
this project will enable the institution to attract a significant number of
under-represented minority students in science, thus aiding to create a diverse
scientific enterprise for the 21st century.
