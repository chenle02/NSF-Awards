The focus of the project will be the thermal modeling of several heat treatment
operations. These modeling programs will be designed for operators on the shop
floor to provide a quick, yet reliable, understanding of the actual heat
treatment. These models will provide a better knowledge of the operations, which
will result in the production of better quality products, better cost estimating
for bids and more efficient uses of natural gas for heat treatments. This
project also will allow the Principal Investigator (PI) to become better
acquainted with the day-to-day operations of a forging company. This knowledge
will be incorporated into the courses that the PI teaches and in the subsequent
development of several additional projects with the students.
