This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to conduct a research
study to understand the impact of informal engineering learning environments on
students' creativity and engagement. The study engages both engineering faculty
and experts in informal education in looking at the long term benefits of
engaging in these environments.

The broader significance and importance of this project will be to help explore
ways to develop innovative and creative engineers that can have potentially
large impact on the future engineering workforce. The model proposed, if
successful, may be broadly exportable to other institutions and engage a wide
spectrum of engineering students. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic
goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering
workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of
innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are
useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
