This project creates a virtual laboratory in information assurance that is
shared by a consortium of institutions. This laboratory can be configured
remotely, allowing the consortium partners to set up the laboratory for their
projects, and used remotely so that students from the consortium partners can
use the lab without physical travel. The project also includes work that
strengthens or adds to the information assurance work at each of the consortium
partners, which include several minority-serving institutions.
