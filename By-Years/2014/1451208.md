Park&lt;br/&gt;Title: Symposium: Summer Research School on Fluid Dynamics -
Topics in Turbulence (College Park Campus of the University of Maryland, June 1
- 5, 2015)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost no universities in the United
States, or even abroad, can afford to offer graduate instruction to train
aspiring researchers in aspects of turbulence beyond introductory courses of one
or two semesters. The Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics at the University of
Maryland, in collaboration with the Center for Environmental and Applied Fluid
Dynamics at Johns Hopkins University, will address this lack by proposing to
offer a Summer Research School on Turbulence. This Summer Research School is
designed primarily for advanced Ph. D. students, i.e. students who have had an
introductory course and who would find it beneficial to go deeper into the
subject. It will also be beneficial to beginning post-doctoral researchers. The
Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics and the Center for Scientific Computation and
Mathematical Modeling at the University of Maryland and the Center for
Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics at Johns Hopkins University jointly
offer a School on Fluid Dynamics: Topics in Turbulence designed primarily for
advanced graduate students, i.e. students who have had an introductory course
and who would find it beneficial to go deeper into the subject. It will also be
beneficial to beginning post-doctoral researchers who have the need for further
instruction. Sixteen US graduate students or postdocs will be able to
participate in this event from U. S. universities other than Maryland and Johns
Hopkins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School will focus on recent developments in
the understanding of turbulence, its prediction and control using modern
experimental and analytical techniques and powerful numerical simulation
capabilities. Tutorials on turbulence theory, experimental and simulation
methods, turbulent transport in single and two phase flows and applications of
turbulence will be given by lecturers from the University of Maryland, Johns
Hopkins University and elsewhere. Discussions will provide opportunities for
student and faculty participants to have a rich exchange of ideas and the
participants will also have the opportunity to present their own work in a
poster session.
