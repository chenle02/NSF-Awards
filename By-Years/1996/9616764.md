9616764 Sussman, Gerald J. The goal of this research is to create the
architectural and algorithmic foundations for intelligent analysis and
interpretation of massive numerical datasets. The aim is to provide the
technology to reduce the complexity in the analysis of specific engineering
problems, and at the same time use these specific problems as a focus to develop
general principles that advance the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence. Smart
data interpretation programs must exploit visual recognition and symbolic
abstraction capabilities. Tracking a multiplicity of interacting, deforming
objects might well be too taxing for the human visual system. It is both
necessary and exciting to endow our computers with the capability to draw
pictures for themselves to see and use what they saw to guide their own future
actions. AI programs that integrate 'reasoning with images" with symbolic
computations have been implemented to solve problems in several applications
areas, such as dynamical system analysis, controller design, mechanism
kinematics. This paradigm can be expected to be integral part of future
engineering analysis and design environments. A computational environment will
be provided for fluid dynamicists to efficiently extract structures and isolate
interaction patterns form simulated or experimental turbulence data, and to
perform control experiments on structure interactions. The objectives are : (1)
to cut post-processing time of CFD data by one to two order of magnitude, (2) to
provide symbolic descriptions of data for summarization and comparison, and (3)
to develop symbolic and geometric techniques to encode coherent structures,
their evolution, and interactions rules. ***
