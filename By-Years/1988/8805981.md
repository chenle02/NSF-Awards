Nearly all ionomers (ion-containing polymers) are exposed to solvents either
during synthesis, processing, or in their applications. Plasticizers are often
added in commercial formulations. Interactions that can occur between solvents
and the ionic salt species influence the local arrangement of the ionic groups,
which has a profound influence on the properties of the ionomer both in solution
and in the solid state. This research program is directed at a phenomenological
understanding of the plasticization of ionomers. Spectroscopic methods (electron
spin resonance, infrared, and fluorescence) will be used to characterize the
specific interactions that occur in ionomers containing low concentrations of
organic diluents. This, combined with small angle x-ray scattering and dynamic
mechanical analyses, will provide the relationship between these interactions
and the structure and properties of these materials. A second aspect of this
research is to exploit the variations in the ionomer microstructures obtained by
exposure of the material to different solvents to study the mechanism and
kinetics of phase separation in ionomers. These studies will also provide a
means to unambiguously determine the effects of ionic aggregation on the glass-
transition temperature, the radius of gyration, and the viscoelastic behavior of
an ionomer.
