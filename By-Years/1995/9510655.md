This award supports the research of Professor Helene Barcelo in the field of
algebraic combinatorics. The algebraic shifting method introduced by Kalai in
1984 has proven to be an extremely successful tool for characterizing the
f-vectors of a wide range of classes of simplicial complexes. The goal of this
research is to investigate possible generalizations of this method to algebraic
structures other than simplicial complexes. The algebraic structures to be
studied share the common property that they have a class of combinatorial
objects associated with them. This research is in the general area of
Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of lapge networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design
of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
