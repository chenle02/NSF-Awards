OISE-0748465 (Zhang, Yunfeng Lehigh University)&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-Korea Workshop
and International Student Forum on Bio-inspired Sensor Technology and
Infrastructure Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a U.S. Korea
workshop on the integration of bio-inspired sensors and information processing
into civil infrastructure structural health monitoring. Topics will include (1)
bio-inspired sensor technologies; (2) structural health monitoring and
nondestructive testing methods; (3) bioinspired information processing
technology such as sensor data fusion, data mining, and knowledge discovery; (4)
bio-inspired sensing materials and biomimetics sensors; and (5) infrastructure
monitoring and field implementation. The workshop will bring together
approximately 40 U.S. and Korean researchers, postdocs, and graduate students
with an emphasis on the inclusion of early career, women and underrepresented
minority scientists and engineers. The key Korean collaborator is Professor
Chung-Bang Yun of the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
(KAIST) and Director of the Smart Infra-Structure Technology Center (SISTeC).
The Korean participants come from the KAIST and observers from China, Japan and
Singapore will also participate. &lt;br/&gt;
