The objective of this research is to develop general tools for reducing the
effective size of massive datasets and to demonstrate the capabilities of these
tools by applying them to the efficiently represent images and streaming video.
The approach is based on a new class of randomized algorithms that have proven
capable of accelerating key scientific computations, while simultaneously making
the algorithms easier to implement on multi-core
computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, this project
addresses the fundamental scientific question of how to extract information from
large and noisy datasets. These datasets are created by many branches of society
in quantities and at a rate that make the analysis of the data extremely
difficult with state-of-the-art methods. This research is based on the belief
that the scale of the problem can be reduced with new algorithms that discover
the underlying structure of a dataset by randomly examining chunks of data.
Formally, mathematical results on random projections in high-dimensional spaces
will be turned into fast algorithms that build low-dimensional representations
amenable to knowledge discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader
impacts, this project has the potential to create a new generation of algorithms
for organizing and searching huge databases of images and videos. It could pave
the way for novel algorithms to manage the massive datasets created by web
searches, biomedical research, cyber security, and other domains. The
investigators are mentoring students from the existing "SMART" program, which
attracts outstanding students from underrepresented groups into graduate school.
Undergraduate students are involved via the existing "Mentoring Through Critical
Transition Points" program.
