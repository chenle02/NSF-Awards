For optical inspection of automotive components, research has been developed
for computing the minimum number of re- orientations of the workpiece so as to
allow for total exposure. This work has been called set-up minimization. The
objective of this internship is to transfer this technology to the automotive
industry by developing a procedure that maintains the number of setups constant
thereby avoiding the high cost of calibration and the danger of error
propagation. Two problems are formulated: Inspection with a single set-up and
inspection with no set-up. For each, the difficulties, solution approaches and
tasks are detailed. The solution to these problems is expected to significantly
enhance throughput for quality control operations in the automotive industry.
