The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Vicki Grassian of the University of
Iowa. Prof. Grassian and her students will carry out detailed mechanistic
studies using different spectroscopic tools, isotope labels, microscopy and
calculations to provide a clearer understanding of chemical reactions that are
of atmospheric significance. Prof. Grassian and her students will study the
surface photochemistry of adsorbed chromophores, in particular the nitrate ion,
on different surfaces and in different chemical environments. They will also
study the surface chemistry, photochemistry and redox chemistry of anthropogenic
metal oxide dusts. The study is potentially transformative since it could change
the way we think about the chemistry of mineral dust aerosol in the atmosphere
and its impact on our climate. The project will provide excellent educational
opportunities for students, including some from under represented groups,
desiring to work at the forefront of environmental science.
