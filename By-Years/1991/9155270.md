This leadership project from California State University, San Bernadino, is
designed to address the science education needs of a local district with 59%
minority (largely Hispanic) students. Eighty teachers and twenty bilingual aides
of grades 3-6 will participate in three academic quarters of weekly meetings
(approximately 132 hours) during which time they will receive training from
scientists and science educators in science content and pedagogy. Inservices
will focus on FOSS materials, which will form the basis of the school science
curriculum, and on strategies designed to develop language skills (in science)
of bilingual and non- English speaking children. The project will also include a
partnership with several scientists and engineers from a local industry. This
proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it plans a leadership
project designed to enhance the science knowledge and teaching of participants,
and because it targets teachers and bilingual aids from schools having large
numbers of minority (mostly Hispanic) students. The cost-sharing amount is
approximately 15% of the amount requested from NSF.
