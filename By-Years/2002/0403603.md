The objective of this research is to develop a novel and
versatile&lt;br/&gt;nano-manufacturing technology for fabricating defined
numbers of nanowire rings on polymer microsphere surfaces. The approach combines
compression-induced cracking of polymer-supported thin films, surface chemistry
manipulation, and electroless deposition of metals. Detailed relationships
between microsphere size, surface film property, degree of compression,
electroless deposition procedure, and the type of nanofeatures generated will be
determined to enable a cost-effective and well-controlled nanomanufacturing
scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is motivated by the general need for
novel nano-manufacturing technologies and concepts. The ability to manufacture
micro- and nanospheres with defined sizes, compositions, surface charges, and
surface patterns has been critical for advances in many fields such as in the
generation of opals, preparation of photonic band gap materials, development of
novel electronic devices, manipulation and analysis of biological cells, and
production of inks, paints, cosmetics, and other rheological fluids. Most
microspheres prepared to date, however, have relatively simple surface
structures such as uniform coatings or the "capping" of one half of a sphere.
The more elaborate nanopatterned microspheres that will be manufactured through
this project will open new possibilities in advanced materials, electronics, and
biology. Another important feature of the program is the integration of research
and education through the training of students in a technologically significant
area. This project is visually striking, experimentally straightforward, and
theoretically stimulating. It will provide valuable hands-on laboratory
experiences in nanomanufacturing research to graduate and undergraduate students
and inspire the next generation of nanotechnology scientists and
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;
