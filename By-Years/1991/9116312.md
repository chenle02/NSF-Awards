Description: This project provides for field research by Dr. Fred Rickson of
Oregon State University and Prof. C.V.S. Gunatilleke of the University of
Paradeniya in Sri Lanka. The work will comprise anatomical/morphological,
cladistic, and molecular (cpDNA) investigation of Humboldtia laurifolia and its
resident ants, in Sri Lanka. The study will analyze the evolutionary tightness
between the ants and the plant, and will quantify any protectionist function
provided by the ants. These data will be used in a comparative biogeographic
analysis with various Leonardoxa taxa from Cameroon, west Africa and Saraca
thaipingensis from West Malaysia, in an attempt to further substantiate a
Tertiary flora migration from the Malaysia region to Africa with a side branch
into southern India and sri Lanka. Scope: This project will involve scientists
from the U.S. and Sri Lanka, as well as graduate students from the host country.
The field work will be done while Dr. Rickson is in Sri Lanka on a ten month
Fullbright fellowship. The project meets the objectives of the Science in
Developing Countries program.
