A broad program of research in elementary particle physics and an associated
education and outreach program is proposed by a research group of the University
of Chicago Physics Department. Their program includes: the ATLAS detector
construction project, which will be at the energy frontier at CERN's Large
Hadron Collider; the CDF collaboration that shared in the discovery of the top
quark at the Fermilab proton-antiproton collider and is operating at the current
energy frontier; the OPAL collaboration, which was operating at LEP, the highest
energy electron-positron collider, which is performing stringent tests of
theoretical models; and the KTeV experiment, investigating the asymmetry of
matter and antimatter in the universe. &lt;br/&gt;Education and Outreach
activities include TAMS (Teacher's Academy for Mathematics and Science) which is
becoming internationally known for its positive impact on under-achieving
schools, and Quarknet, which is making high- school teachers a respected part of
the particle physics research community. &lt;br/&gt;
