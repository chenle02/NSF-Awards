"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund the acquisition
of a 5 meter Armfield Laboratory Research and Teaching Flume with sediment
recirculation and wave making features. The flume will be used to estimate the
critical shear stresses of sediment in the variety of biomediated benthic
habitats in the Caloosahatchee R. and surrounding waterways. The flume will also
be used to measure macroalgal attachment forces and their drag force in a
current. This information will help develop a numerical model of transport and
dispersal of macroalgae. The dynamics of macroalgae are currently of great
interest because of the need to understand the mechanisms and processes that are
creating large macroalgal blooms on the beaches in Florida. Further applications
will be to investigate the effects of freshwater inflows and sediment flow over
and around oyster reefs, coral reefs and seagrass canopies, biomechanics of
marine organisms and taphonomic (study of decaying organisms over time)
experiments.
