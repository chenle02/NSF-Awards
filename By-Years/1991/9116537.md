Hydrothermal alteration of organic matter in sediments overlying oceanic
spreading centers such as the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California), Escanaba
Trough (Gorda Ridge), and Middle Valley (northern Juan de Fuca ridge) results in
the generation of significant organically derived alteration products.
Hydothermal experiments will be conducted in the laboratory at 200-400oC and 300
bars to constrain better factors that regulate the generation and stability of
organic compounds and the extent and nature of organic-inorganic interactions.
Experiments containing natural sediments and seawater type fluids or varying
composition will allow detailed quantitative characterization of organic
alteration products as a function of time, temperature, and sediment and fluid
composition, and identity sources and sinks for these species in natural
hydrothermal systems. The sediment alteration experiments will be used to
calibrate paleogeothermometers based on the relative abundance and distribution
of thermally altered organic species for use in ridge crest hydrothermal
systems. The results of this study will be applied to natural environments to
evaluate geochemical conditions during hydrothermal sediment alteration and to
constrain the time-temperature history of sediment-covered spreading centers.
