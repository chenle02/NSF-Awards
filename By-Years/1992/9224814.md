This International Symposium on Nondestructive Characterization of Materials
has been held in three different countries at intervals varying 3 to 1 years.
This 6th symposium will be held in Oahu, Hawaii on June 7-11, 1993. It has an
International Organizing Committee of 13 members from 5 countries. The complete
program includes sessions on Electronic Component Nondestructive
Characterization & Evaluation; Biomimetic and Biotic Materials; Interfaces;
Nondestructive Characterization for Process Control; and Verification of
Materials Processing Models. %%% This International Symposium on Nondestructive
Characterization of Materials will be the sixth symposium, held in three
different countries at time intervals varying from one to three years. It
provides a forum for active scientists and engineers to exchange the recent
advances in their respective fields. It is also a forum for the materials
researchers and the nondestructive testing researchers to exchange information
and to promote understandings.
