The recent advances in bandgap engineering by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) have
produced a strained superlattice (SSL) of InSb/InAs Sb capable of being made
into photodiode detectors suitable for the long wavelength infrared (LWIR, 8-14
micron) spectral range. This project will attempt to develop a suitable
multilayered buffer for near-perfect lattice matching between Si and epitaxial
processes and trial epitaxy will be investigated, in the Phase I effort.
