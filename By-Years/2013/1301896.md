A stationary inertial Alfvén wave (StAIW) is a nonfluctuating, nontravelling,
spatially periodic pattern in the electromagnetic field and fluid quantities,
predicted analytically and now being documented in the lab, that explains with a
model certain observed morphology and dynamics of long-lived auroral arcs, the
source mechanism causing these features, and the evolution from the background
state of the magnetosphere for cases of arc duration longer than 10 seconds. A
lab experiment will be performed to validate the space-relevant predictions of
the StIAW model. The StIA-wave parallel dc electric field accelerates electrons
along magnetic field (z direction) to speeds in excess of the Alfvén speed and
the ultimate electron velocity gain parallel to the magnetic field will be
measured in the lab at various z positions, with a double-sided Mach probe, and
compared to a model. Lab documentation of the existence of the StIAW dc parallel
electric field in spite of the rapid charge-imbalance compensation ability of
electrons along magnetic field lines would be a significant milestone in the
space physics field because source, dynamics, and morphology, all three, of
stable, long-lived auroral arcs would be explained in a single model.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The planned research will support student mentoring
having an international perspective at WVU and UCLA. The planned research
strengthens the interrelationship between plasma experiments in the lab and in
space that is aimed at targeted validation of geoscience phenomena. Space plasma
dynamics, instability, and particle energization represent the broader
application of the proposed basic plasma research. The planned research
contributes to international cooperation through scientific collaboration within
the realm of university research.
