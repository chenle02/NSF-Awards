9709351 Ibers This project aims at the synthesis, characterization, and study of
physical properties of solid-state metal chalcogenides, which are a class of
materials that contain sulfur, selenium or tellurium. Among areas to be
investigated are (a) ternary and quaternary chalcogenides of the Group IV
metals; (b) quaternary rare-earth chalcogenides; (c) structural distortions
exhibited by these materials, and the corresponding band-structure calculations;
(d) chalcogenides of rhenium. Characterization of the new materials will include
structure determinations by single- crystal X-ray methods and the measurement of
transport properties, especially electrical conductivity and magnetic
susceptibility. %%% Since it is felt that the chalcogenides may provide a rich
source of novel materials, it is important to expand the synthesis of these
compounds as a possible source of technologically relevant new materials with
predictable chemistry, structure and property/structure relationships. The
ultimate goal is to provide through the integration of research and education
students as future scientists and engineers able to provide novel classes of
solid-state materials that exhibit semiconductor, insulator, or magnetic
properties. ***
