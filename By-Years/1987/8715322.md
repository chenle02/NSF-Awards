The focus of this research is the use of polyoxometalates and other inorganic
oxometal species, which are themselves resistant to oxidation, to catalyze redox
transformations of organic compounds of low reactivity, such as alkanes. The
immediate goals are to establish the origins of the stability of these catalytic
hydrocarbon functionalization systems and to determine the mechanistic and
structure-reactivity features of these processes by kinetics, spectroscopic and
structural studies. These new polyoxometalate-based catalytic photochemical
processes are of potential utility with respect to not only alkane
functionalization but also the conversion and storage of radiant energy. The
work should lead to improvements in the existing processes, delineation of new
spectroscopic phenomena, and development of new catalytic processes. There have
been two types of homogeneous catalytic hydrocarbon functionalization processes
based on polyoxometalates. The first involves the photochemical
functionalization of alkanes, and coupling potentially useful synthetic
transformations with the simultaneous conversion of light into chemical energy.
The second involves the thermal transfer of oxo and related groups into
hydrocarbons. The physical, photochemical and photophysical attributes of
several recently documented interactions between various classes of organic
substrates and polyoxometalates will be probed by picosecond and other
spectroscopic studies, X-ray crystallography and photochemical experiments.These
experiments are expected to yield further information on the potential
applications of soluble oxometal species to redox transformations of organic and
inorganic molecules.
