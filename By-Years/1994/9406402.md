This award is a continuation of a program of research in elementary particle
physics at the University of Chicago which consists of three teams, each of
which is playing a leading role in one of the premier experiments in particle
physics on a world- wide scale: (1) the CDF experiment at the 1.8 Tev proton-
antiproton collider at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois; (2) the OPAL experiment
that is one of the four detectors at LEP, a large electron-positron collider at
CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and (3) the KTEV experiment, which is being
constructed for the new K meson beam in the fixed target program at Fermilab.
The major goal of CDF is to find the top quark, the last and heaviest of the six
components of hadronic matter in the Standard Model. Opal is investigating the Z
, the neutral intermediate vector boson that, along with the photon, is central
to the unification of the electromagnetic forces and the force governing nuclear
beta decay. KTEV is the next step in a program that is attempting to understand
the origin of CP symmetry violation which in turn is thought to be the key to
understanding the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe - a
necessary prerequisite to our existence. The grant will support, including the
Principal Investigator, Professor Frank Merritt, 9 faculty members, 3 senior
researchers, 9 postdoctoral research associates, 17 graduate students and a
majority of the technical staff at the Enrico Fermi Institute.
