This project funds a series of research sessions and summary workshop to
consider new paradigms in hierarchy theory for complex ecological systems. The
work focuses on questions of changes in scale and observational criteria in
communities, ecosystems, population and landscapes. The work generate new
categories for ecological systems. Theorizing revolves around scaling issues and
the use of hierarchical concepts to order ecological systems. One of the foci
will be the issues of mapping across changes in scale and type in ecology and
will be linked to the development of theory for the management of ecological
systems.
