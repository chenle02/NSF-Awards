This proposal contributes to ISTCS'92-the Israel Symposium on the Theory of
Computing and Systems to be held in Haifa, Israel, May 27 to 28, 1992.
Interaction between Israeli and American computer scientists has always been
very fruitful. At the same time, it has always been quite imbalanced-quite a few
Israeli researchers travel to the US, but only a small number of American
researchers visit Israel. As a result, many of the Israeli universities faculty
members, students, and researchers in industrial research organizations have
only limited opportunities to interact with their American colleagues, leaving
room for improvement. A major inhibitor for closer interaction is the travel
expenses. It is the objective of this proposal to provide partial support for
American researchers who are interested in attending.
