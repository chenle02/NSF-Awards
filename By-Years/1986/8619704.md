This project is an analysis of the distribution of two species of
chlorofluoromethanes (freons) in the southern Weddell Sea. The samples were
obtained by the principal investigator as part of the Filchner III Expedition of
the West German research vessel POLARSTERN. The analysis of freons, a time-
dependent, anthropogenic tracer in the water column, is part of a collaborative
chemical and hydrographical study of the circulation of Ice Shelf Water (a
particular water type formed under the Filchner Ice Shelf). The outlow of this
water type through the Filchner Depression, its subsequent evolution on the
continental slope, and its penetration into the deep Weddell Sea will be
followed, and the derived data used to study formation rates and transport paths
of deep and bottom water masses in the Weddell Sea. Air samples that were
collected on the cruise will be analyzed for freon concentrations in order to
determine the extent of equilibrium between the surface sea water and the
overlying atmosphere.
