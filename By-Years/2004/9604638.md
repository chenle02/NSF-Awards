9604638 Fryxell Complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors through a
process that included gene duplication and divergence. After duplication, the
additional genes may have been relatively free to vary and take on new
functions. This genetic flexibility has helped many organisms adapt to new
environments. The DNA sequences in humans and other organisms provide a rich
record from which a detailed evolutionary history of gene duplication and
divergence may be deduced. This record will be mathematically analyzed in
multicellular animals. The primary goal of this project is to help illuminate
the history and genetic mechanisms of evolution, as well as the fundamental
question of how complex organisms arose from simpler ancestors. Evolutionary
relationships among genes, such as the descent of several modern genes from a
single ancestral gene, provide a powerful basis for predicting molecular
function and three-dimensional conformation. Thus, the basic knowledge gained
from these evolutionary studies will be used in many other fields, including
biochemistry, pharmacology, biomedical sciences, and biotechnology.
