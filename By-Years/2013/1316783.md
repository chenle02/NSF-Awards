This award funds the research activities of Professors Lawrence Hall and Hitoshi
Murayama at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
two faculty members are pursuing a multi-faceted program of research in
theoretical high-energy physics. With the deep experience of PI Murayama on
exploiting data and building theoretical frameworks, and the inventiveness of
co-PI Hall in opening up new landscapes of physics models beyond the standard
model, they aim at uncovering deep secrets that span from the smallest scales of
particles and strings to the largest scales of the Universe. The proposed scope
includes collider physics, dark matter, neutrinos, quark flavor, phenomenology
and theory of supersymmetry, observational cosmology, field theory, string
theory, and the multiverse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is also envisioned to
have significant broader impacts. Collectively, this research group provides
training to students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists.
They also promote diversity by seeking and encouraging participation by women
students and scientists. Because the general public is deeply interested in
fundamental questions, the Berkeley theory group will also work with QuarkNet
teachers to bring the excitement of forefront research to high-school students.
Strong ties to the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the
Universe in Tokyo through Murayama's directorship will also bring international
connections to students and postdocs.
