Financial intermediation is crucial to the growth of any economy. Without some
mechanism to match savers to investors, an economy lacks the ability to channel
surplus resources to productive ends. In historical and modern economies alike,
however, information and other problems have sometimes limited the ability of
financial institutions to play their role in the allocation of capital. The
purpose of this research is to analyze a type of financial intermediary that was
extremely successful in an environment inhospitable to the methods of
conventional banks; the German agricultural credit cooperatives formed during
the nineteenth century. The project is designed to exploit historical sources
and draw on modern economic theory to understand why these credit cooperatives
were able to perform financial intermediation services for those too poor to be
desirable customers for banks. This research is important because the
understanding of the evolution of capital market institutions is critical to any
understanding of long term economic growth and development. Also, a better
understanding of the efficiency of agricultural credit co-ops may have useful
implications for current policy regarding developing countries.
