This project seeks to update the teaching of digital design by having students
face the challenges of complex systems from their first exposure to the subject.
The greatest challenge of modern computer design is trying to manage complexity
in a quick and reliable fashion. Modern hardware design is dominated by tools
that extend the designer's capabilities in synthesis, simulation, and test.
Teaching digital design, even its basics, without exploring both classical
principles and contemporary methods is anachronistic. This project will add
proper test instrumentation for system analysis to an undergraduate digital
laboratory that already includes computer design and simulation tools. The
proposal requests funds to help purchase six low-end logic analyzers, and one
more capable analyzer, all with printers. Such instruments are the only proper
tool for analyzing and debugging anything beyond trivial circuits running a slow
speeds. The logic analyzers will not only be used to support project design, but
will for the basis for a series of lecture demonstrations and lab assignments
that will be documented and available to other institutions.
