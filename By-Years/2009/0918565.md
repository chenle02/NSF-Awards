The subalpine forest ecosystem is a critical natural resource to urban and
suburban centers in the western United States. This ecosystem is dominant in
mountain regions and provides goods and services such as water, recreation and
timber. It is also a critical component of the continental sink for atmospheric
carbon dioxide. These forests have become increasingly stressed in recent
decades due to regional climate warming, outbreaks of insect epidemics such as
the mountain pine beetle, and exposure to pollutants such as ozone and nitrogen
oxides from nearby population centers. The research proposed would continue a
ten year program of monitoring a subalpine forest west of the Denver
metropolitan corridor to assess growth, water budgets, and the potential for
continued carbon absorption. It has become apparent that this forest is
susceptible to absorbing less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over time and
that it is growing at slower rates due to warming and associated reduced
snowpacks. Furthermore, there have been signs of incipient outbreak of the
mountain pine beetle. Thus, the forest is at the cusp of exhibiting important
and major responses to environmental change. This research includes measurements
of carbon dioxide, water and energy exchange between the forest located near
Nederland, Colorado, and the atmosphere over the next five years to assess its
response to these stresses. In addition to conducting research, this proposal
will have broader impacts to the scientific community through its continuation
as a training facility for individual graduate student and post-doctoral student
projects, continuation of a summer course for graduate students from across the
world at the University of Colorado Mountain Research Station, and continuation
as a primary data resource for global carbon budget modeling.
