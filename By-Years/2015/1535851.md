The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a powerful tool used in many big data
domains, including multimedia processing, medical imaging, genomics research,
astronomy, seismology for oil and gas reserve discovery, and malicious traffic
detection in cybersecurity domains. Building upon a recent breakthrough by the
researchers behind this project, this award will develop the algorithmic and
system foundations for practical high-spped DFT over sparse data sets.
Addressing this goal involves highly interdisciplinary research encompassing
ideas and techniques from mathematics, theoretical computer science, software
design, and specific application areas such as wireless
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be multi-pronged, focusing on
three main themes: (a) Algorithms: The PIs will develop a family of algorithms
that are faster, simpler and more accurate than the current state of the art in
sparse DFT. The new algorithms will be capable of incorporating priors on the
structure of the data and apply to multi-dimensional data sets. (b) Software
implementations: The PIs will develop software implementations of sparse FFT
algorithms and explore algorithm parallelization for further reduction in power
and processing time. (c) Applications: The PIs will apply these algorithms and
empirically demonstrate them in the context of cost-effective networked system
for delivering smart services for intelligent transportation systems using
existing e-toll transponders.
