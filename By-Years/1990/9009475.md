This project is a study of microscopic models of incommensurate phases and phase
transitions of various types, along with development of new mathematical and
computational procedures for problems of this sort. Specific systems of interest
are: models of entropically stabilized quasicrystal phases including "realistic"
atomic models in two and three dimensions, antiferromagnetic Potts models which
are studied using new Monte Carlo simulation methods, properties of lattice
models of dimers using replica Monte Carlo techniques, development of high-
efficiency algorithms for computer simulation of large molecules (polymers,
proteins, etc.).
