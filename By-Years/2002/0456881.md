This experimental research program explores new territories in nonlinear optics
and low temperature physics. The apparatus has been specifically developed to
implement a double light roadblock, an extension of ultra-slow light techniques,
to generate collisions between nonlinear excitations in the quantum fluids. The
plan is to apply the double light roadblock setup, and implement a high-
resolution imaging system to image the dynamics of condensates in-situ in order
to maintain better control of their density, with the option of imaging their
dynamical sequences non-destructively. The PI will study collisions between
these nonlinear excitations and hopes to map out a whole hierarchy of
increasingly complex collisional products. The broader impact of the program
involves creating an interactive, chat-room-type website to more effectively
reach a larger audience.
