9514617 Brodfuehrer It is commonly observed that an animal when presented with
the same stimulus on successive trials will often perform different behaviors.
This means that an animal decides, often very rapidly, which behavior is
appropriate for the circumstances at that moment. The concept of `motivation' is
often used to explain this type of short-term behavioral variability observed
under conditions where sensory input is constant. The underlying neuronal
mechanism of motivation, however, has yet to be defined. Since an animal's
survival depends upon it continually making the appropriate behavioral response
to ever changing environmental conditions, understanding how an animal decides
upon an appropriate motor response is integral to our understanding of animal
behavior. In the medicinal leech, research on the neuronal basis of swimming has
progressed to the point where the initiation of swimming following body wall
stimulation can be traced from the sensory neurons that perceive the stimulus to
the motor neurons that produce the swimming movements. However, stimulation of
this pathway does not always elicit swimming. The probability that swimming
occurs following a given stimulus trial is quite variable. The role that a pair
of identified interneurons in the leech head ganglion plays in biasing the
behavioral response of a leech toward swimming following a given sensory input
will be addressed in this proposal. The results generated from this study will
provide additional insights into the principles governing behavioral variability
in the leech with respect to the initiation of swimming, and further enhance our
understanding of the types of neuronal networks and mechanisms that can
influence the motivational state of animals.
