This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Michael Fagen, will work with Dr. Robert
Cartwright on problems involving compilers for parallel languages. The research
involves using type information to aid the programmer and to allow efficient
compilation. The original research was done with functional sequential
languages. The proposed research will be to extend these results to imperative
parallel programming languages. In particular, the Program Composition Notation
(PCN) language will be used as a testbed for the postdoctoral associate's ideas
of migrating soft typing from the sequential functional domain to the parallel
domain.
