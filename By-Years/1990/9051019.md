Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy has become a vital tool for the analysis
of environmental samples and of drugs of abuse. The demand for chemists with
experience in GC/MS is growing rapidly and will continue to grow as the
technique is incorporated into more technology laboratories. The GC/MS in this
project is being introduced at the freshman level through observation of
demonstrations. In the sophomore year, the students in organic chemistry have
hands-on experience through interpretation of spectra and the identification of
unknowns. In the analytical chemistry course students get their first
introduction to the design of the instrumentation and its quantitative
applications. As an experimental tool, the GC/MS will be used in the realm of
advanced preparation. The school has contributed to this project an amount 11%
greater than the NSF funds.
