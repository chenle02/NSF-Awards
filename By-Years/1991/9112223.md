The equipment grant will provide an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope
(ESEM) for conducting in-situ dynamic studies on a range of manufacturing
processes, materials engineering and tribological problems. This revolutionary
equipment allows samples to be examined, or in-situ phenomenon recorded, under
dynamic conditions in different environments (gaseous or liquid at chamber
pressures from 0.1 to 50 torr and at different temperatures up to 1000C. The
large specimen chamber (12" x 12" x 12") can accommodate a wide range of samples
allowing the simulation of manufacturing processes (eg., cutting metal forming,
plastics injection molding, etc.), tribological phenomena, and materials testing
(tension, compression torsion, fatigue, stress corrosion cracking, combined
loading). Some of the in situ studies include hot corrosion; failure of glass
fibers in an epoxy-glass composite or silicon carbide fibers in an aluminum
matrix under a range of loading conditions; effect of various cutting fluids in
machining of different materials; machining of glass, ceramics, polymers, and
composites; metal forming; effect of lubricants in friction and wear;
solidification of metals; and the mechanism of nucleation and growth of
polycrystalline diamond films made by low pressure chemical vapor deposition
techniques.
