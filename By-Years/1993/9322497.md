9322497 POMERANZ This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates Site in Psychology at SUNY at Stony Brook. The program will
immerse 10 undergraduate students in an active research environment spanning the
areas of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology and the
experimental study of decision, choice and self-control. The goal is to
introduce students who are not currently involved in a laboratory research
program to state-of-the art psychological research in some of the most
interesting areas of experimental psychology. Recruitment of students will focus
on schools with large minority populations and institutions which do not have
the resources to provide their students with research experiences. Students will
conduct independent research projects in one of eleven active research
laboratories. To supplement the laboratory experience, a variety of group
activities such as visits to other labs, laboratory meetings, seminars, and
symposia are planned. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences. ***
