Dr. Phillips will examine the dynamics of myoglobin by a newly developed
experimental method. Analysis of the diffuse X-ray scattering will reveal the
range and distribution of conformational states of the molecule. The methods
developed in this project for analyzing the diffuse X-ray scatter from myoglobin
crystals will also have broad application to other macromolecules. Protein
structure and dynamics are intimately related. X-ray crystallography has been a
powerful tool for determining the average conformation of macromolecules.
Techniques such as NMR and fluorecence spectroscopy have provided detailed
knowledge of the dynamics of targeted "parts" of protein molecules, but not a
good overall description of the motions of the entire protein. Theoretical
calculations can predict dynamic behavior of proteins, but as yet are limited to
simulations in very short periods of time. Their connection to reality is still
somewhat tenuous. This project will help bridge the gap between theoretical
studies of protein dynamics and experimental determinations of the real behavior
of the protein.
