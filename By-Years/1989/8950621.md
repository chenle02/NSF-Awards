This project seeks to establish a parallel-programming laboratory at the
Department of Computer Science of Utah State University. The laboratory will be
utilized to strengthen the undergraduate program by directly supporting hands-on
experience in a new parallel-programming course. In addition, the laboratory
will strengthen existing courses in operating systems, graphics, digital signal
processing, and artificial intelligence by allowing enhanced coverage of a
parallel- processing topics in these disciplines. The laboratory equipment
requested consists of four (4) economical yet versatile parallel-processing
workstations; each consisting of an AT- class microcomputer host and a subsystem
of six (6) Transputer-based parallel processors running Logical Systems C. Each
workstation allows students to program parallel routines in a high-level
language, load and control network node execution, provide network I/O, and
reconfigure network topology from the AT host console.
