The Bucknell University `Summer Research Program in Physics` will be continued,
giving eight undergraduate students per summer the opportunity to collaborate
with a member of the Bucknell physics faculty for ten weeks on his or her
research. Students will be recruited from around the country, with a focus on
colleges in the eastern seaboard and Appalachian region. Six Bucknell faculty
will offer projects each summer, so the level of student-faculty interaction
will be high. This immersion in a research environment is intended to complement
traditional classroom experiences of the students. Participation will help
students make career choices, and will provide specific preparation for those
that continue on the graduate studies in physics. All of the students will live
together on the Bucknell campus, conduct most of their research in on-campus
facilities, and participate in weekly departmental seminars and colloquia.
Projects offered cover many areas of physics. They include experimental
investigations of phase transitions in biological cell membranes, use of laser
diodes and magnetic resonance to study atomic interactions, experimental studies
of pattern formation and chaos in complex systems, observation based studies of
star formation, analysis of data from an experiment performed at Fermilab
National Accelerator, theoretical studies in quantum optics, and theoretical
studies in general relativity.
