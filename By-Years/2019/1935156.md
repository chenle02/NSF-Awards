This award supports development of the program for a two-and-a-half-day workshop
to be held on Oct 27-29, 2019 in Alexandria, Virginia. This meeting brings
together principal investigators from across the Secure and Trustworthy
Cyberspace (SaTC) program. The investigators identify topics and establish a
workshop agenda, including speakers and panelists. Specific objectives of the PI
meeting include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- to stimulate coordination and
collaboration amongst SaTC researchers working on the projects in the portfolio;
&lt;br/&gt;- to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and
researchers in other disciplines; &lt;br/&gt;- to share experiences and learn
from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice; &lt;br/&gt;-
to support undergraduate research in SaTC researchers; and &lt;br/&gt;- to
develop ideas and share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career
development in cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a strong community
among SaTC researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of
existing research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
