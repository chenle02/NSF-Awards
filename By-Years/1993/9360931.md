9360931 Henderson The potential to achieve high insulating value by the use of
evacuated glass microspheres has been know for some time. The purpose of the
research is to solve the principal obstacle to their use, which has been the
development of a commercially viable technique to produce evacuated
microspheres. If hollow glass microspheres can be evacuated and coated cost
effectively their utility as insulation will extend to the consumer, engineering
and industrial markets with attendant large cost savings to these users and
major energy savings to the nation. For example, using vacuum microspheres
having highly reflective metal coatings, systems can be designed with R values
greater than 800 have been achieved. The objective of the research is to
demonstrate a unique manufacturing concept which does not require the use of
vacuum equipment or evacuated chambers. A new, cost effective, environmentally
benign insulation has enormous commercial potential by virtue of the improvement
in a wide variety of products: e.g., dewars, refrigerated trucks and rail cars,
home appliances such as ovens and refrigerators, foam insulation, pipe
insulation, vehicles, cryogenic fuel containers and packaging.
