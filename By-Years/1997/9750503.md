This project is modernizing the biology curriculum by introducing inquiry-based
instructional methods into the laboratories. By purchasing scientific and
computing equipment, the department is integrating computer-interfaced equipment
into its biology laboratories. This process enables the department to (1)
provide students with current technology by introducing inquiry-based labs that
include practical experience in computational data acquisition and analysis, (2)
provide students with similar laboratory experiences to those conducted at
4-year colleges and universities, (3) improve the technical literacy of students
entering the workforce, and (4) provide students with opportunities to design
experiments that illustrate theory. As a result of curriculum changes in general
biology, anatomy and physiology, and microbiology, about 740 undergraduate
students a year are able to design experiments and manipulate variables,
creating an opportunity to observe the relationships between theory and
practice. In addition, they are studying biology as practiced by professional
biologists. This process is helping students to make the transition more
successfully when they transfer to 4-year institutions or enter the workforce. *
