The magnetic field induced metal insulator transition in doped semiconductors
will be investigated by combined transport and far infrared spectroscopic
measurements. The transport measurements will be used to determine the critical
field for the metal insulator transition and to investigate interaction and weak
localization effects in the metallic state and the activated conductance in the
insulating state. The spectroscopic measurements will be used to investigate the
electronic structure of the systems away from the Fermi energy. The
transformation of the cyclotron resonance and spin resonance signals on the
metallic state to the impurity transitions in the insulating state will be
investigated. These studies are on materials of importance to high speed opto-
electronics. This program is a collaborative effort between Professor Shayegan
at Princeton Professor Drew at Maryland. These studies are on materials of high
technological importance and related to high speed opto-electronics.
