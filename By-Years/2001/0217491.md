The objective of this project is to develop a new normative design decision
making methodology especially tailored to overcome cognitive biases associated
with environmentally conscious design. Specifically, decision analytic
procedures will be developed to direct a cost-effective product development
process. A new technology being developed at the University of Illinois to
capture and recover hazardous air pollutants from gas streams will be used as
the test-bed. It captures dilute hazardous air pollutants from air and converts
them to a pure liquid for reuse in the manufacturing process that generated the
pollutant. Activated carbon fiber cloth is employed.

The primary benefit of this research will be a shortened development time
resulting in a product that will be more successful in the marketplace. The
decision-based design methodology will be integrated into an industrially
sponsored senior design course. The research and educational infrastructure will
be improved by establishing this interdisciplinary collaboration, and also by
development of new interdisciplinary course materials for both undergraduate and
graduate courses in two different departments (General Engineering, and Civil
and Environmental Engineering). In addition, two Ph.D. students will be trained
in this new research area. The results of this interdisciplinary research will
be broadly disseminated across both civil and mechanical engineering research
communities. Societal benefits also include a new technology that not only
removes hazardous air pollutants, but also cost-effectively recovers them for
reuse.
