The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer and Research (STTR) project is a method to control invasive or
otherwise unwanted trees and shrubs in an ecologically friendly manner with a
biodegradable product. This will reduce the quantity of synthetic herbicides
and/or synthetic herbicide adjuvants currently applied to control woody plants.
This is especially needed near waterways where vegetation managers must choose
between expensive mechanical removal or potential harm to sensitive ecosystems.
Homeowners, landscapers, farmers, conservationists, utilities, and other
customers will have a new product to control invasive trees and shrubs
consistent with a mission to be good stewards of the environment.

This STTR Phase II project proposes to follow initial successful Phase I
demonstrations of an enzymatic bio-herbicide or herbicide adjuvant following the
principles of termite biomimicry. The objectives of this Phase II project are to
identify the mode-of-action, develop high- and medium-throughput bioassays in
vitro and in planta, optimize the product formulation, and demonstrate efficacy
on various invasive species in the field such as bush honeysuckle (Lonicera
maackii), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), glossy buckthorn (Frangula
alnus), bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea), and potentially others.
