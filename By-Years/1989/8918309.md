This project will allow the American Anthropological Association to conduct a
competition for stipends to allow anthropologists to attend the Sixth
International Conference on Hunting and Gathering Societies, to be held in
Fairbanks, Alaska on May 28- June 1, 1990. This is the major research conference
for this area of studies, and scholars from all over the world attend and share
ideas. This activity is important because our species lived in hunting and
gathering societies for 99.9% of our history. What can be learned from study of
contemporary hunter-gatherer group gives important theoretical insights into our
evolutionary history, and also answers key questions about our biological
origins and sociocultural nature.
