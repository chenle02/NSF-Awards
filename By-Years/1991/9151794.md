An existing microprocessor-based system design course is being developed into an
application-specific architecture course. This course will have a new laboratory
which is being developed so that students can implement their hardware
prototypes using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). FPGAs allow students to
quickly build, test, and modify their designs; thus architectural changes can be
implemented within minutes reinforcing lessons in architectural optimization. A
sequence of experiments is being developed build around audio processing systems
designed to provide hardware/software tradeoffs for high-performance
architectures tuned to specific algorithms.
