The Cys-loop receptor family includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR) and the serotonin type 3 receptor (5-HT3R). Cys-loop receptors are
neurotransmitter-activated ion channels participating in neurotransmission in
the nervous system. They are targets of drugs for treating disorders from nausea
to anxiety. Mutations in Cys-loop receptors can lead to diseases including
epilepsy. Neurotransmitter binding opens the ion channel by initiating the
movement of the second transmembrane (TM2) domain of each of the channel's five
subunits. In the conventional view of the channel an outer vestibule narrows to
the rate-limiting region within the membrane where the gate is located; the pore
then opens into the cytoplasm. Thus, in this scheme, determinants of ion
conduction reside exclusively in TM2. However, recent evidence renders this
textbook view of Cys-loop receptors obsolete: First, cryoelectron microscopy
revealed that the nAChR has narrow "portals" at the cytoplasmic interfaces of
each subunit; Second, mutagenesis of these regions in the 5-HT3R influences ion
conduction. These findings necessitate revision of the model for the ion
permeation pathway. Thus this project addresses a fundamental question in
neuroscience: does conduction through ion channels involve cytoplasmic elements?
Data from this laboratory demonstrate that intracellular regions of 5-HTÂ¬3Rs
affect all aspects of ion conduction: conductance, voltage-dependence and ionic
selectivity. This study will identify the mechanisms involved, creating a new
model for Cys-loop receptor function. A key objective of the study is to
continue to develop a Cys-loop receptor database accessible to physicians,
researchers and educators. Thus this project will enhance the infrastructure for
research and education at The George Washington University and beyond.
Undergraduate students spearhead the development of the Cys-loop receptor
database.
