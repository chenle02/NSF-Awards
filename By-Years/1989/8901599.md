8901599 Hoppensteadt Problems from physiological control mechanisms, microbial
ecology and population genetics will be investigated. The emphasis of these
projects is on collaboration between experiments and analysis of them through
mathematical modeling, analysis, numerical simulation and computation. Some of
these involve novel problems in nonlinear oscillations, perturbation theory,
integrated circuit design and analysis, and transport and chemical kinetics
describing biological phenomena, and others pertain to continuing projects
currently supported by an NSF grant that have been yielding quite promising
results.
