The nuclear structure research program at the University of Kentucky is focussed
on timely, related topics in nuclear spectroscopy, neutron-induced reactions,
and neutron scattering. Experimental work is designed to take advantage of the
neutron production capabilities at the University's accelerator facility and the
unique detection systems that have been developed in this laboratory; however,
complementary, collaborative research with colleagues at other institutions is
also pursued. Nuclear structure studies are primarily oriented toward exploring
multiphonon vibrational excitations in nearly spherical nuclei, examining
magnetic and electric dipole transitions in collective excitations, defining the
roles of protons and neutrons in collective modes, and understanding nuclear
shell structure and the nature of nuclear shape transitions. The
characterization of mixed-symmetry states, new types of collective modes, in
weakly deformed nuclei and phonon-coupled excitations of these states is a high
priority. Neutron scattering studies, which aid in elucidating the differences
between neutron excitation and other probes, will complement studies of the
microscopic basis of collective excitations. The study of isospin symmetry in
medium-mass nuclei is a new research direction. Nuclear level lifetime
measurements with the Doppler-shift attenuation method and gamma-gamma
coincidence measurements, for which the methodologies have been developed in our
laboratory, will play crucial roles in many of these studies. Carefully selected
experiments in other areas which are particularly appropriate to the
capabilities and facilities at the University of Kentucky accelerator laboratory
will be pursued. The education of nuclear science students at the undergraduate,
graduate, and post-graduate levels is emphasized, and efforts to provide a
diverse working environment at the University of Kentucky are an ongoing, vital
component of the program
