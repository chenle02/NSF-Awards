This research work is developing a new experimental reactor for the kinetic
study of gas-liquid reactions. Called the gradientless spinning film reactor
(GSFR), it comprises a film which flows along the walls of the reactor, which in
turn is a horizontal cylinder rotated about its axis. The research will
investigate spinning film flow, gas mixing, liquid mixing, gas-side mass
transfer, liquid-side mass transfer, and gas-liquid reaction rates utilizing the
unique properties of the GSFR. These results are needed in the design and scale-
up of multi-phase reactors. A further extension to three-phase (gas-liquid-
solid) systems is anticipated.
