This research addresses singularity issues in robotics. It analyses new types of
manipulation systems with the goal of eliminating all singularities. The class
of actuator considered is the symmetrically actuated double pointing system
(SADPS). A configuration using SADPS joints both for shoulder and wrist motion
is analyzed. The resulting manipulation system is expected to be singularity
free. The research comprises four steps, including (1) derivation of kinematic
equations of motion for this manipulation system, (2) determination of the
Jacobian matrix of the system, (3) determination of singularity configurations,
and (4) development of preliminary mechanical designs. The expected improvement
in dexterity would imply greater manufacturing flexibility in industrial robotic
systems.
