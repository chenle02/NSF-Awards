9361368 Klemp This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is
in the general area of analytical chemical instrumentation. The objective of the
research is to demonstrate the feasibility of a high speed gas chromatography
system. The approach involves the development of an instrument which will use a
cryofocusing inlet system capable of preconcentrating a vapor sample and
introducing it to the separation column as a very narrow plug. To compensate for
the loss of resolution, the instrument will use tandem ensembles of capillary
columns having different stationary phases. Computer controlled differential
adjustment of gas flow rates or temperatures of the individual columns will
control selectivity for specific applications. If successful, analysis times of
a few seconds should be achieved. %%% Gas chromatography is widely used for the
analysis of chemical process streams, environmental samples and laboratory
samples. Significant reductions in analysis time will dramatically increase
process monitoring reliability and sample throughput. The proposed high-speed
gas chromatography instrument should have broad-based commercial potential. ***
