The development of new oceanographic sensor platforms such as seafloor cabled
observatories and autonomous vehicle networks, and with the miniaturization of
oceanographic sensors ranging from mass spectrometers to 4K video systems, the
prospects for doing science in the deep ocean have never been brighter. The
difficulty of powering systems in the ocean for long time periods or with high
power requirements has limited the ability of deep-ocean scientists to
capitalize on recent sensor and sensor system advances. To resolve this problem
the PI proses to design, build, and test a small thermoelectric power device
that will use geothermal heat from hydrothermal vents to generate electricity,
charge batteries, and power small seafloor instruments indefinitely. The
availability of such a system could enable the development of seafloor ?power
stations? where autonomous vehicles charge their
batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a hydrothermal thermoelectric
power module could enable the development of an entirely new kind of seafloor
observing network that could revolutionize the ocean sciences by providing a
"platform of presence" anywhere in the deep ocean where strong thermal gradients
can be found or created.
