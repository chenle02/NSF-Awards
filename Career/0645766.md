The performance of nanometer-sized devices can be greatly affected by the
formation and propagation of defects, such as cracks. Given that this process
involves breaking the chemical bonds in the solid lattice, a quantum-mechanical
description is necessary. However, a fully atomistic description of the problem
is not viable. The PI proposes to develop analysis-based numerical methodologies
that couple an atomistic description near the location of the defect with a
coarse-grained description far from it. Quantum-mechanical effects are studied
in the context of Density-Functional Theory. This approach can effectively
remove the limitation in the size of the system considered, and could gear the
development of nanometer-sized devices in new directions.

This proposal also includes the development of special courses in multiscale
modeling, and an undergraduate research component in a vertical environment that
involves undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows.
In addition, the proposal includes outreach to local high schools. By exposing
students to mathematics at such an early stage, the investigator hopes to awaken
in them the desire to pursue a career in mathematics.
