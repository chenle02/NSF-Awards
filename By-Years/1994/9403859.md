Neuroimmunology is a rapidly emerging and expanding field of research,
propelled by recent findings that have provided evidence that a number of
molecules affect the growth and differentiation of cells in both the immune
system and the nervous system. It is now recognized that molecules once thought
to have actions restricted to the immune system directly affect the
proliferation, growth, and differentiation of nerve cells. Similarly, molecules
originally identified because they function in the development of the nervous
system reciprocate by having effects in the immune system. A major goal of this
conference, held under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology, is to bring together scientists from diverse fields (such
as immunology, neuroscience, pharmacology, and psychology) to explore new ideas,
exchange information, and foster collaboration in the study of the interactions
between the nervous system and the immune system.
