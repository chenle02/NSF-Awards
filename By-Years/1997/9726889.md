This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support for photochemical research by Dr. Peter C. Ford,
Chemistry Department, University of California, Santa Barbara. Work will focus
on two classes of compounds: metal nitrosyl and nitrito complexes, and
polynuclear copper(I) complexes. The goal of the first project is to elucidate
the photochemical mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO) generation as well as the
dynamics of NO reactions with metal centers of bioinorganic interest. Flash and
continuous photolysis of various mononuclear metal nitrosyl and metal nitrito
complexes will be conducted, placing particular emphasis on compounds that may
serve as precursors for the photochemical delivery of NO to desired targets on
demand. In addition, the synthesis and photochemical-photophysical
characterization of dual chromophore systems that might serve as luminactive
sensors for detection of NO will be studied. The second project will investigate
the photoluminescent behavior of mononuclear and cluster compounds containing
d-10 metal centers, primarily copper(I), including how the excited state
properties respond to perturbations in the properties of the media. When light
is absorbed by a molecule, the energy that the molecule acquires is sometimes
used to initiate a chemical reaction and sometimes is re-emitted as light of a
different wavelength (luminescence). The methods used in this study enable
changes of both types to be determined. Nitric oxide(NO) affects bioregulatory
and immune response and medical benefits could be derived from controlled
release of NO at specific targets. This study will contribute to the
understanding of the interaction of NO with biomolecules and the ability to
monitor its effects. Studies of the changes of excited state properties of metal
clusters are relevant to the design, optimization, and application of
photooptical devices and photocatalysts.
