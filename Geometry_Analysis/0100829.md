Abstract for DMS - 0100829

The principal investigator will study the spectral geometry of non-compact
domains and Riemannian manifolds in order to elucidate the geometric content of
scattering poles. First, the PI will continue his study of the spectral geometry
of hyperbolic manifolds and their perturbations. He will study resonances as
functions on the deformation space of the underlying discrete group, and define
and analyze a determinant of the Laplacian. Secondly, the PI will study
scattering theory for the wave equation on two-step nilpotent Lie groups and
their quotients by discrete subgroups. New parametrices or the wave equation on
the Heisenberg and Heisenberg-type groups will be derived, and trace formula for
certain quotients obtained. Riemannian submersion techniques of Gordon, Wilson,
and others will be used to obtain pairs and families of `isoscattering'
manifolds which will help determine the limits of geometric information which
may be deduced from a knowledge of the scattering poles. Thirdly, the PI will
study the isoscattering problem for exterior domains in Euclidean space.

The fundamental problem of spectral geometry is to elucidate the geometric
content of the Laplace spectrum on a Riemannian manifold. For so-called
scattering manifolds, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian together with scattering
resonances constitute the spectral data for the manifold. Elucidating the
geometric content of such spectral data advances our understanding of
quantization, produces new analytic tools for the study of geometric objects,
and provides insight into inverse problems of a more `applied' nature where the
eigenvalues and scattering poles are measurable quantities. The present work
aims to begin with geometrically natural examples where techniques of Lie
theory, automorphic functions, and harmonic analysis may be used, and progress
to harder problems such as target identification by radar where such techniques
are not available but the underlying mathematical problems are very similar.
