Cameron (Kamin) D. Whitehouse, University of Virginia Proposal for Participant
Support in the IPSN Extreme Sensing Competition 2009

Intellectual Merit: This project provides travel and conference support for
U.S. students to participate in the Extreme Sensing Competition (XSC), being
held as part of the 8th ACM/IEEE Conference on Information Processing in Sensor
Networks (IPSN 2009). In the XSC, students, researchers, or industry
participants build a sensor system that is used to perform a pre-specified task.
The event requires students to address a number of open challenges involving
sensing, control, signal processing, wireless networking, and the interactions
between these areas. The 2009 competition considers body area networks (BANs)
and dead reckoning.

Broader Impact: Most participants in the Extreme Sensing Competition are junior
graduate students and the event allows them to engage with the CPS research
community early in their graduate program. Unfunded students who would otherwise
be unable to attend ISPN and participate in the XSC are given special
consideration for support. Students from underrepresented groups are also given
special consideration for support. Advertising emphasized outreach to these
groups. The event also showcases the student participants and projects to the
large cyber-physical systems research community, as ISPN 2009 is a component of
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Week and the competition is open to all CPS Week
attendees.
