The project will pursue new research directions in computational geometry. It
will address numerical issues by 1) creating robust algorithms that have
provably reliable rounded arithmetic implementations and 2) developing
techniques for reducing the amount of precision required when exact arithmetic
is used. It will also address applications in manufacturing, for example, by
developing algorithms for automated layout of patterns on cloth.
