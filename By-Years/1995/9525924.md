9525924 Painter There are three major thrust areas that will be pursued during
the next three years. (1) Chain Connectivity Affects. This is an important topic
and we propose to perform a systematic study of chain connectivity affects which
can be measured experimentally by methodical studies of low molecular analogues,
polymer solutions, random copolymers and polymer blends that hydrogen bond. (2)
Design of Miscible Polymeric Additives. Following our successful design of a
polymeric antioxidant for polytetrahydrofuran we propose to extend our
theoretical concepts and experimental studies to the design, synthesis and study
of macromolecular additives. (3) Multiple Interacting Sites. We can control the
balance of favorable and unfavorable interactions by incoporating different
types of hydrogen bonding functional groups in the same chain (i.e. multiple
interacting sites). We propose to systematically explore these factors. %%% This
study will provide new knowledge in the broad area of compatibility and
interactions between dissimilar polymeric materials, which has implications on
processing, recycling, and environmental issues. ***
