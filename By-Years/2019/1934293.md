The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) proposes to host a
second convening of key stakeholders engaged in and committed to improving
Computer Science education for Native students. The first convening, held in
March of 2019, focused primarily on understanding challenges and identifying
areas for improvement by convening a small group of stakeholders. Based on the
responses of those participants, AISES proposes to advance the effort by
engaging an expanded set of stakeholders to not only identify barriers but to
begin developing solutions, building networks, and realizing resources both by
connecting those with limited access and by creating new, more appropriate
resources to meet the needs of Native students and Native-serving teachers and
schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This second convening will take place October
13-14, 2019, immediately following the 2019 AISES National Conference in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. AISES will recruit convening attendees, targeting key
stakeholders, previous attendees, and conducting outreach to its networks and
extending invitations to partner networks. The objectives of the proposed
convening are to: (1) expand the set of engaged participants to include
additional teachers and administrators, representatives of CS education non-
profit organizations, and other members of the tribal education community and
(2) develop detailed plans of action and create a road map for
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
