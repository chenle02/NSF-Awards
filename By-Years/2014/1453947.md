The DEEPWAVE (DEEP propagating gravity WAVE) experiment will observe one of the
most dynamically active regions on Earth in terms of gravity wave (GW) forcing,
deep upward GW propagation, and overall effects throughout the lower atmosphere,
stratosphere and MLT. The program will use the NSF/NCAR GV, HAIS instruments,
dropsondes and ISS to attempt to follow deeply propagating GWs from their
tropospheric source to their mesospheric breakdown, and to pursue the scientific
objectives of understanding deep GW propagation and testing new GW observing
systems. Other NRL Activities will be support under this Cooperative Support
Agreement.
