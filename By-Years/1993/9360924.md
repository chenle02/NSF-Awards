9360924 Yadav This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the
general area of synthetic organic chemistry. The objective of the research is
the demonstration of a new process for the low cost synthesis of fullerenes.
Fullerenes are currently made by separation and purification of soot produced in
a carbon arc. The inherent high cost of this process has made fullerenes
inaccessible to commercial production and application. The Phase I SBIR research
will demonstrate advanced concepts for generation, either by arcjet or flame, of
carbon vapor and supersonic expansion quenching of carbon atoms derived from low
cost precursors such as natural gas, petroleum byproducts and/or biomass to
produce fullerene structures of controlled molecular weight. %%% Demonstration
of feasibility of producing low cost fullerenes by unique quenching of carbon
vapors will create commercialization opportunities for their application diverse
areas such as diamond nucleation, optics, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. ***
