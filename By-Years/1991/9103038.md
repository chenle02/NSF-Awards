The purpose of this proposal is to ssek funds for the support of an
International Symposium which is entitled "Physics and Chemistry of Finite
Systems - From Clusters to Crystals" to be held in Richmond, Virginia October
8-12, 1991. The conference will focus on structural and electronic properties of
clusters, nano-scale particles, and quasicrystals with the emphasis on particles
composed of metallic elements. Contributions from the physics, chemistry, and
materials science communities will stress the interdisciplinary aspects of these
emerging fields. Applications of these fields in designing atomically engineered
materials will be included.
