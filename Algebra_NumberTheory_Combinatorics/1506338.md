This award supports participation in the 17th International Conference on Random
Structures and Algorithms held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, July
27 - 31, 2015. Random Structures and Algorithms is a biennial meeting, initiated
in 1983 at Adam Mickiewicz University, in Poznan, Poland. The aims of these
conferences are to present recent research results and to identify and explore
directions for further research in random discrete structures, randomized
algorithms, and broad areas of applications of probabilistic methods in discrete
mathematics, computer science, and related fields. For more information see the
conference website: http://rsa2015.amu.edu.pl/

Randomness continues to play a fundamental role in demonstrating the existence
of combinatorial structures with desired (optimal) properties as well as in the
design of practical and efficient algorithms for problems in combinatorial
optimization and computing. The Random Structures and Algorithms conference is
established as a key locus for the exposition of trends and breakthroughs in the
development of probabilistic methods and their application in discrete
mathematics and computer science. The choice of the plenary speakers at the
conference highlights important themes ranging from classical topics such as
Ramsey theory, cryptography, phase transitions in random graphs, and
combinatorial designs, which have seen recent exciting progress, to modern
topics including hypergraph container theorems, cloud computing, hardness of
approximation for optimization problems, and algorithms in high dimensional
computing and social networks.
