0414388 Hondzo This planning grant will address seven critical issues that need
further definition and resolution for the full-scale development of a proposed
NSF program called CLEANER (Collaborative Large-scale Engineering Analysis
Network for Environmental Research). Special attention in this project will be
paid to design and analysis of two alternative types of environmental field
facilities (EFFs), which are viewed as the fundamental units of the CLEANER
network. A type 1 EFF would be a regional environmental system that studies a
range of interconnected environmental problems; a type 2 EFF would be focused on
a single cross-cutting issue of national concern.
