The mycological collections at the Field Museum are an important national and
international systematic resource, totalling 186,780 specimens. In the past ten
years these collections have grown by nearly 55,000 specimens. Almost 40% of the
new specimens were added through the activities of Field Museum staff and
associates, with the rest added through the acquisition of scientifically
important donated and orphan collections. Due to this rapid increase in size,
the mycological collections are currently severely overcrowded and poorly
accessible to the scientific community. Growth is expected to accelerate because
of active field programs and an increase in the size of the mycology group
(currently there are six researchers and curators plus six graduate and
undergraduate students). In addition to research on the ecology, biodiversity,
and distribution of fungi, Field Museum's mycological collections are actively
used in teaching and internship programs for high school and undergraduate
students. Completion of the planned collection improvement projects will prevent
damage to collections threatened by existing overcrowded conditions, allow for
anticipated growth, provide improved access and facilities for study by the
scientific community including students, and contribute to more efficient
collection management. The Field Museum's total cost share for this proposal is
over 88% of the total request. -- aÝª ▀ ; áªªá = ÓaOÀ h¢µ +'ª`0 )   ª 0 T x Þ ¹
