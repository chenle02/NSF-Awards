The research objective of this project is to develop mixed integer linear
programming (MILP)approaches for mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
problems involving nonlinear functions of binary variables by exploiting
submodularity of the nonlinear functions. Existing MINLP approaches for these
problems ignore the discreteness of the binary variables when dealing with the
nonlinearity of the underlying functions. On the other hand, combinatorial
algorithms designed specifically for dealing with submodular functions are
inapplicable because of the various additional problem-specific side constraints
present in these problems. Our approach will address the nonlinearity directly
in the space of the binary variables by developing strong MILP reformulations of
the nonlinear functions by exploiting submodularity along with other problem
specific structure. The developed MILP schemes will be enhanced by integrating
specialized combinatorial algorithms for submodular optimization. The proposed
approaches will be specialized and tested on various classes of stochastic
combinatorial optimization problems involving risk averse objectives where
submodularity arises naturally from the concavity of risk aversion.

If successful, the results from this research will advance the general area of
MINLP by providing tools for effective linearization of nonlinear functions of
binary variables. These tools can be embedded in modeling and solution software
and hence impact various application areas including capital budgeting,
combinatorial auctions, revenue management, and machine learning, that give rise
to problems with submodular substructures. The project will require close
integration of integer programming, submodular optimization, stochastic
programming, and convex optimization methods; and new developments at the
interface of these areas are anticipated. Specifically, new algorithmic
techniques for various classes of stochastic programming models in combinatorial
settings will be developed. More generally, results from this project can
establish a novel framework for integrating specialized algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems within MILP approaches for general problems
where the specific combinatorial problems arise as substructures.
