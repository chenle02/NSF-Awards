This research deals with the computational, and underlying mathematical,
properties of curves and surfaces that exhibit geometrical rather than
parametric continuity. Geometrically continuous entites are controllable through
various heuristic "shape functions" and may prove to be more suitable for
computer-aided design than parametrically continuous entities. Knowledge about
computational techniques for establishing and preserving geometric continuity is
sparse, and is confined mainly to cubic Beta-spline curves. This research will
focus on Beta-spline curves and triangular Beta-spline surfaces of arbitrary
polynomial order, and will seek to (1) develop evaluation algorithms, and (2)
catalog and classify shape functions for use in CAD.
