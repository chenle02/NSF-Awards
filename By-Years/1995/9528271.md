Arons, Jonathan 95-28271 Dr. Arons plans to investigate the mechanisms of
emission and transfer of radio radiation from rotation powered pulsars, carried
out in such a manner as to yield results which can be tested by past, current
and forthcoming observations, then subsequently used to probe the physical
characteristics of these sources of low entropy power to the surrounding medium.
The first investigation will be a study of the "core" radio emission, with
attention primarily focused on the hypothesis that this component comes from
maser emission formed within the pair creation zone just above a pulsar's polar
cap. The second area of study will be into the physics of the "conal" component
of pulsar radio emission, to be studied as a manifestation of the shearing,
counterstreaming flow in the boundary layer between the closed and open field
lines. The final area of study will be an investigation of the transfer of
polarized radio radiation through the cyclotron resonant regions in the outer
magnetosphere, in an attempt to account for the origin of elliptically polarized
radio emission from pulsar magnetospheres and to use these data to probe the
plasma and field configuration in the region where the rotational energy loss is
developed. ***
