The Brooklyn Museum holds a significant body of anthropological materials. One
of the most important for anthropological research are those objects collected
between 1903 and 1911 by Stewart Culin, first Curator of Ethnology. Coming from
the Southwest, California, and the Northwest Coast, these 9,000 objects
represent one of the most well documented systematic collections in
anthropology. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is infestation
with asbestos, this collection has been unavailable for researchers. This grant
will remedy this situation by properly storing, cataloguing, photographing and
cross.indexing with the original documentation over 2,000 of the most important
objects in the collection. The collection will be reinventoried and thus made
available to researchers. Much information has been scattered throughout museum
collections and hence essentially lost to us. With the reorganization of
collections and their accompanying documentation, museums such as the Brooklyn
Museum are discovering vasts amount of information about Native Americans and
teaching us much about life at the turn of the century.
