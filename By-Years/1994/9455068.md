This is a proposal for multi-year funding in support of an integrated and
expanded instructional program for community college faculty. The proposal will
introduce molecular biology and molecular diagnostics as continuing education.
The proposed program will continue to offer the week-long summer institute in
molecular biology and add to that a new summer institute in molecular
diagnostics in which the principles of molecular biology find applications in
several areas of biotechnology. In addition, it will expand follow-up program
services and other participant contacts with university faculty and industry
researchers. Internships for community college faculty will continue as a part
of the program.
