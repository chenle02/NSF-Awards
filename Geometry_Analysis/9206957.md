The principal investigators will continue their research in dynamical systems.
They will study relations as dynamical systems, an alternate approach to chain
recurrence for vector fields, numerical methods for computing periodic and
homoclinic orbits, and central configurations in the classical N-body problem.
This award will support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A
process which is very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely
complicated, nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is
the study of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best
be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence,
complex biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
