Symposium on Multidisciplinary Sensors and Systems for Autonomous Observations
of the Global Ocean (OceanSensors08). The OceanSensors08 Symposium is planned as
a follow-on to the successful OceanObs99 Symposium. Because sensor technology
has been rapidly advancing in recent years, it is difficult for any individual
to keep abreast of changes in technology in many diverse disciplines. In
addition, ocean observatories will play an increasingly important role in
understanding ocean processes, especially for episodic phenomena and variables
that subtly change over decades (e.g., sea surface temperature). The success of
ocean observatories will depend on having reliable and durable sensors to
measure physical, chemical, biological, and geological parameters. The
OceanSensors08 Symposium will be held between 31 March - 4. April 2008 in
Warnem√ºnde, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a need to bring together the international
community of ocean scientists, engineers, and commercial manufacturers to share
information and to encourage the development and validation of ocean sensors.
