The National Academy of Sciences, through its Ocean Studies Board (OSB), will
provide guidance to the National Science Foundation/Division of Ocean Sciences
and other Federal agencies on major ocean science and policy issues. This
request is for continued Core Support for the OSB, and a small amount of support
to start a project on "Oceanography for the 1990's".The OSB plans to consider
scientific issues related to continental margins, coastal oceanography, the
carbon dioxide cycle, fisheries oceanography, marine biotechnology and
"Oceanography in the 1990's"-- over the next few years, with some of these
efforts scheduled to begin in the present fiscal year. The OSB will also support
U.S. ocean scientists to provide leadership in these areas internationally,
through support of and participation in the Scientific Committee of Oceanic
Research (SCOR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The
OSB will, thus, continue to contribute to maintaining the health of ocean
sciences in the United States.
