The goal of this project is to build the scientific foundation for archiving the
history and evolution of the Web: tracking changes of the Web, compactly storing
multiple versions of Web pages, and providing the stored pages to users through
an easy-to-access interface. This project comprises both experimental prototype
construction and careful study of technical challenges. The experimental effort
focuses on building a system that tracks and archives a large number of Web
pages over a long period of time. The fundamental technical challenges that are
investigated by this project include: (1) a novel mechanism to download pages
from Web search interfaces; (2) an efficient way of predicting and detecting
changed pages on the Web; (3) a compact representation for storing multiple
versions of Web pages; and (4) a novel index structure to support keyword
queries on multiple versions of Web pages. Success of this research will have
broader impacts on the scientific community and the general public. It will
provide a valuable testbed of Web history data that many humanity and
engineering researchers can explore and analyze, enabling them to study the
"digital trace" of human activity. The project Web site
http://webarchive.cs.ucla.edu/CAREER/ will be used for broad results
dissemination.

In addition, both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in this
project, gaining invaluable research experience. The new findings and the
software infrastructure from the project are incorporated into new graduate-
level courses that are offered by the PI that will help students prepare for a
successful career in the general field of computer science that increasingly
requires solid understanding of large-scale data collection and management
issues.
