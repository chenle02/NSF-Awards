Though many physicists are engaged in outreach, the variety of activities in
which they are engaged is surprisingly small. For those venturing beyond the
standard public lectures and science cafes there is currently nowhere to
disseminate the knowledge they gain from both the successful and failed public
outreach attempts. This project will fund highly innovative outreach activities
and their successes and failures will add significantly to the body of outreach
knowledge. The associated Outreach Guide will disseminate these best practices
to others interested in beginning their own programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the American Physical Society Outreach Program is to enable innovative
outreach projects that aim to bring physics to the public outside of the
classroom. These projects will not only directly affect the target audience of
such projects, but will also affect the climate surrounding public outreach and
engagement. Despite the benefits of public outreach there are many obstacles in
the way of those interested in starting such programs. The program will help
scientists surmount these barriers.
