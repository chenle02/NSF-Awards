Dr. Goss' research goals are understanding the regulation of protein synthesis
and protein-nucleic acid interactions. She will likely use her FAW award to
measure rates and interactions of prokaryotic translocation in order to answer
several questions about the mechanism of this process. Since these experiments
require characterization of several components and a number of difficult kinetic
measurements, it is likely to take several years to yield significant answers to
these mechanistic questions. This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are
1) to recognize outstanding and promising women scientists and engineers in
academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate the further
development of their careers.
