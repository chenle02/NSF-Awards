9505736 Block This proposal by a young investigator of unusual breadth of
expertise spans several levels of biological organization. The basic interest of
the PI is in the biology of muscle and, more particularly , how the membrane
system within the muscle cells controls the contraction/relaxation cycle of
muscles. In ordinary striated muscle, i.e., those that contract to produce
movement, these membranes serve as storage depots for calcium ions. The
release/sequestration of calcium ions in the membranous system of such muscle
cells regulates their contraction. The PI is examining the coupling of these
calcium mechanisms to the impulse generated by nerves which initiates the
contractile event. To do so she employs a unique muscle cell found in the eye
muscles of deep-diving fish such as the marlin, that is, a muscle cell that does
not contract but rather produces heat. This "heater tissue" is used to warm
blood on its way to the fish's brain, thus keeping the brain warm even while the
fish dives in deep and cold water. The PI is currently studying the elaborate
counter-current heat exchange system at the base of this heater organ, using
biochemical and morphological methodologies to study how these cells regulate
the movement of calcium and thereby generate heat. Using a unique, non-
contracting muscle system the PI will also be addressing questions of interest
to all contractile physiologists.
