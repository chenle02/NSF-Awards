One of the most important factors in quality of life for the elderly is their
ability to move about independently. Mobility impairments due to age, injury or
disease cause a downward trend in their quality of life. Lack of independence
and exercise can have dramatic results. Although various types of mobility aids
exist in research labs and on the market, walkers are used more than any
mobility aid except the cane. Our work is concerned with developing an
intelligent walker to assist the elderly and increase the ease and safety of
their daily travels. The benefits to the user include assistance avoiding
dangerous situations (obstacles, drops, etc.) and help with navigation through
cluttered environments. It is hoped that this assistance will provide the user
with a feeling of safety and autonomy that will encourage them to move about
more, incurring the benefits of walking and helping them to carry out the
activities of daily living (ADLs). Our walker employs a shared control strategy
in which both the user and the walker can provide control of the walker"s
heading. By dynamically shifting the balance between the degree of control
provided by the walker and that provided by the user, our prototype can extend
the time that a user can move independently on both a long term (as user
abilities changes with age) and a short term (as user abilities change due to
fatigue or medicinal cycles) basis. This point is critical because our work
seeks to augment the abilities that people possess instead of replacing them.
While wheelchairs and other self-powered mobility aids are viable solutions for
some people, they are not a panacea. Our work seeks to help people who can and
want to walk.
