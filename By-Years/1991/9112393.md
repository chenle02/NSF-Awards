This award provides equipment to support research on noise and vibration at
Purdue University. Specifically, the equipment comprises a hydraulic vibration
test system, a multi-channel data acquisition system, a laser vibrometer and a
portable digital tape recording system. The research topics include (1) non-
linear modelling of transportation vehicle components, (2) new models of
vibration and low frequency structure borne noise in complex built up
structures, (3) novel noise and vibration control techniques using active
control and intelligent structures, and (4) novel vibration and acoustic
measurement techniques which utilize the capabilities of modern data acquisition
systems (i.e., acoustic holography, multiple coherence and principal component
analysis.
