This study examines the factors that drive individual differences in foraging
behavior within fish populations (bluegill and bass) and measures the
consequences of these behaviors to juvenile growth and survival. Using novel
techniques that allow individual fish to be monitored within a semi-natural
pond, researchers will be able to determine the activity, habitat use, growth,
diet, and survival of individually marked bluegill in the field and compare
these responses to measures of shy-bold foraging behavior assessed in the
laboratory. There is growing evidence that many species of animals exhibit
individual differences in behaviors as a result of a tradeoff between growth and
survival: for example, bold individuals may have higher feeding rates and growth
rates, but also suffer higher mortality. This study will be among the first to
test for this tradeoff in a natural habitat, as well as measure the ecological
relevance of laboratory-based behavioral measures by determining whether shy-
bold behaviors measured in the laboratory are correlated and consistent through
time in a field context. This study has significant broader impacts, as the
focal species (bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass) are two of the most
important sport fish in the U.S. and the results of this research will help
inform the better management of these species with regard to how variation in
foraging behaviors impact juvenile growth, survival and vulnerability to
recreational angling. The work enhances research training opportunities for
undergraduates working on the project as well as the Ph.D. student directing
this research. Participation by the Ph.D. student in two ongoing, NSF-funded
K-12 projects will more broadly disseminate the results of this research through
the development and use of inquiry-based science modules in local school
classrooms.
