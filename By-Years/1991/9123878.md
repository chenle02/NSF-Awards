Professor Glenn Evans is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study structure and dynamics of simple model
systems for liquid crystalline fluids. For simplicity, the liquid crystalline
forming molecules are envisioned as hard nonspherical bodies encircled with a
spherical (square well) potential. The proposed analysis of equilibrium
phenomena are concerned with the derivation of phase diagrams for nematic and
smectic phases, fluid mixtures and chiral nematics. Elements of density
functional theory, Onsager theory and scaled particle theory are combined to
analyze the origin of these phases at high liquid densities. The dynamical
properties to be addressed include: the self diffusion coefficient, the
dielectric permittivity and the NMR spectral density for a single component
nematic fluid. %%% Liquid crystals were discovered roughly one hundred years
ago. They are materials with flow properties of a liquid and the optical
properties of a solid. Since that time, these optical and fluid properties of
LCs have been harnessed into display technology. The molecular physics
underpinning the development of LCs is nontrivial. Liquid crystal displays are
typically made from mixtures of chiral nematic phases with unusual optical and
viscoelastic properties. The richness of the technological applications of these
phases is in turn directly linked to the diversity of their thermodynamic and
transport properties which are the subject of Professor Evans studies.
