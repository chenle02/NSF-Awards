In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Stefan Franzen of the North Carolina State University
will conduct a research program to develop and use a set of molecules as probes
of the environment of nanoparticles in solution and in ordered structures using
DNA oligonucleotides as the structural scaffold. The electrostatic environment
of nanoparticles causes shifts of the optical bands of the probe molecules.
These shifts in turn serve as indicators of the surface electric field of the
nanoparticles. The method based on this phenomenon is called colloidochromism.
The proposed work entails the creation of nanoparticles suitably prepared to
modulate the surface potential, as well as the development of new molecules to
serve as probes. The colloidochromism of these systems will be investigated. In
addition, purified DNA-nanoparticle dimers will be prepared and similarly
studied.

The results of this work has applications to the self-assembly of nanoparticles
using DNA. This research will be conducted with a collaborating colleague in
Poland. Students will participate in this research.
