Failure mechanisms of rubber composites are extremely complex and three
dimensional in nature. This project focuses on the development of a 3-D finite
element model which includes geometrical and material nonlinearities,
anisotropic, and bimodular material behavior for characterizing the
interface/interlaminar failures in rubber composites. Formulations for 3-D
tearing energy computations, failure criterion for characterizing different
interface failures and prediction of crack propagation path will be developed.
Emphasis will be placed on the simplicity of the model and accuracy, and the use
of computer graphics to represent the interface failure mechanisms for better
understanding of rubber composite structures. The finite element results
obtained will be validated using benchmark problems and available experimental
data.
