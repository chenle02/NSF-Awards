Texas A &amp; M University will operate the R/V GYRE during 1990 as a general
oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The GYRE is a
182' general research vessel constructed by the U.S. Navy in 1973 and modified
in 1980 and 1984. Texas A&amp;M operates the GYRE under a charter agreement
effective for five years from 1 March 1989. The ship operates primarily in the
Gulf of Mexico and northeastern Atlantic. This vessel is part of a fleet used by
the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country.
