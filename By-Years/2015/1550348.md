IEEE Cluster conference series is a premier international event for presenting
the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in high
performance computing in general and cluster computing in particular. Cluster
2015 will be held September 8-11, 2015 in Chicago; Cluster 2016 will be held the
same month in 2016 in Taipei, Taiwan. IEEE Cluster seeks to increase student
participation in the conference and the field. Both Cluster 2015 and Cluster
2016 will run specific student-centric sessions during the conference, mainly
scheduled during the lunch breaks and after the end of the regular sessions:
Research presentation training; Research experience and career guidance;
Industry interaction; and, Lunch sessions with best paper candidates.The
proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students. Travel grants
will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the
field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their
participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort
will be made to reach out to women and under-represented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 10 NSF-sponsored student
travel grants in 2015 and up to 8 in 2016.
