Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrumentation is being used to
enhance laboratory experiences both for science majors and for non-science
majors. This is being achieved in the first case by utilizing GC-MS in an
integrated instrumental qualitative analysis protocol for the second-semester
freshman Organic I laboratory. Subsequently, GC-MS is being employed in
semimicroscale-oriented sophomore Organic II laboratory and for establishing a
foundation in analytical principles in sophomore Analytical I lecture and
laboratory. Seniors carrying out undergraduate research are applying GC-MS to
problems in organic, analytical, inorganic, and biochemical projects. In the
laboratory component of Physical Science and the Environment, non-science majors
are using GC-MS, with purge- and-trap sample introduction, to address analyses
of environmental water samples.
