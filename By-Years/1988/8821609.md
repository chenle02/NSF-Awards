Established in May 1986, the present JvNCnet provides high bandwidth
communications and network services to 23 institutions using an approximate star
topology. This proposal requests continuing support for the JvNCnet in order to
take advantage of recent advances in networking technology which provide a
unique opportunity for a redesign of both the topolgy and equipment. This
support will help the JvNCnet achieve higher overall performance, improved
management, additional growth, and substantially lower cost per network
connection. This new technolgy will allow the JvNCnet to consist of a "backbone"
and "local links." The backbone will operate at 1.5 million bits per second (T-1
speed), and will extend from Pennsylvania to Rhode Island through a series of
links extending through telephone company offices in Altoona, PA; Philadelphia,
PA; Trenton, NJ; Newark, NJ; New York, NY, Stamford, CT; Boston, MA; and
Providence, RI. A unique feature of the proposal is the colocation of routers
and communications equipment in the central offices of the long distance
carrier. The backbone and local link topolgy permits organized growth of this
regional network in the area of eastern Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey,
and the New England States. New and old institutions may be connected to the
network at the nearest local office of the carrier. Overall service to users is
a function of the bandwidth of the local link and the backbone which may be
upgraded as required.***//
