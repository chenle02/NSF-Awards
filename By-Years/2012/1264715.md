This engineering education research project investigates students' ability to
generate ideas (ideation) as they learn engineering design. Ideation is a
critical skill for all engineers as they explore problem spaces and develop both
short-term and long-term solutions to societal problems. The project
investigates three key factors hypothesized to contribute to students' idea
generation capability, and explores the interrelation between the factors.

The broader significance and importance of this project arise from the potential
to support ideation flexibility among engineering practitioners, giving greater
capabilities for engineering educators to support and direct ideation in
engineering degree programs. The investigators have proposed an ambitious plan
to ensure that the research results are broadly disseminated to engineering
faculty members. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with
new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
