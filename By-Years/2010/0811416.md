Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are hardware devices on which a circuit
can be mapped under software control. The recent growth in both size and speed
of FPGAs have made them attractive platforms for hardware-based code
acceleration. In this novel paradigm, frequently executed code fragments are
expressed as a circuit that is mapped onto one or more FPGAs. This paradigm
benefits from a very large degree of parallelism as well as increased efficiency
of execution. It has been shown to result in speedups ranging from the 10s to
the 1,000s over traditional processors for frequently executed code segments in
applications such as bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, image and video
processing, and intrusion detection systems. The main obstacle to a wider
acceptance of this paradigm is its programmability. Although several projects
have proposed tools that translate high-level languages (HLLs) to hardware, none
has proven to be suitable for hardware acceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this proposal is to develop hardware support for FPGA-based code
acceleration with specific emphasis on component-based data path construction
and efficient memory interfaces and allocation. This component-based programming
of FPGAs supports code reuse and modularity and as such can greatly facilitate
the development of application codes for FPGA-based accelerators, thereby
providing a great boost to a wide array of high-performance computing
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
