Abstract

Award: DMS-0806037 Principal Investigator: Michael L. Hutchings

The main part of the project is to develop "embedded contact homology" (ECH), a
new invariant of a contact three-manifold, which is defined in terms of periodic
orbits of the Reeb flow and embedded pseudoholomorphic curves in the
symplectization. ECH is conjecturally isomorphic to versions of the Seiberg-
Witten and Ozsvath-Szabo Floer homologies. Some specific goals of the project
are to further develop the analytical foundations of ECH; to create tools for
computing ECH, particularly in terms of open book decompositions; to use ECH to
obtain lower bounds on numbers of Reeb orbits; and to work towards extending ECH
to a more general theory which would unify it with the Ozsvath-Szabo Floer
homology. Some broader goals are to use ECH machinery to help compute symplectic
field theory in three dimensions, and to explore Floer-theoretic invariants of
families.

The embedded contact homology developed in this project lies on the interface
between dynamics and low-dimensional topology. Dynamics is concerned with the
behavior of physical systems over time, while low-dimensional topology studies
the possible shapes of curved spaces in three and four dimensions. Embedded
contact homology allows one to obtain deep topological information from an
understanding of dynamics; and conversely to obtain important dynamical
information, such as the existence of stable configurations, from topological
conditions.
