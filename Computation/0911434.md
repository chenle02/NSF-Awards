This proposal concerns the development and analysis of new numerical methods for
Navier-Stokes equations involving discontinuities, free boundaries, moving
interfaces, and problems on irregular domains. The new methods will be applied
to several important applications in multi-phase flows, fluid structure
interactions with interfaces, fluids, or solids. In the proposal, augmented
immersed interface methods are proposed to tackle those difficulty problems. The
new methods are based on sharp interface models (no smearing), second order and
implicit discretization. The new methods are proposed to be implemented to
simulate several important applications such as the moving contact line problem
using one and two phase flow models; non-extensible interfaces in incompressible
flows, open-ended interfaces, and moving interfaces with masses.

The projects described in the proposal have wide applications in mathematical
biology, material science, aerodynamic and mechanical engineering. The non-
extensible interfaces have been used to model the motion of red blood cells in
the life science. Efficient numerical simulations will have positive impact on
early detection of illness related to the red-blood cells. The moving contact
line problem has direct applications in the material science. Efficient
numerical simulations using computers may avoid expensive experiments. This is
true for other projects in the proposal as well. This proposal will also have
positive effect on education by attracting under and graduate students to
conduct research in this area. Some components of the projects will be designed
as undergraduate projects. Furthermore, the research results can lead to a
computer software package that would be useful to the computational science
involving free boundary and moving interface, and problems defined on
complicated domain.
