The Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project addresses a gap in
technology between the lithography of periodic nanostructures, and the
manufacturing of low cost nanostructured product with high volume replication.
The project will bridge this technology void by extending the current capability
of the scanning beam interference lithography tool, the "Nanoruler", through the
novel technique of Double Patterning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
potential of this capability will be realized in a large area wire-grid
polarizer, a specific LCD component that will have significant technical and
social impact. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) manufacturers have specifically
targeted Nanomanufacturing as a critical need for next generation light
management designs. Currently, over 90% of light generated by the display light
source is absorbed before it reaches the viewing screen and is wasted as
undesirable component heating. LCD researchers have identified wire grid
polarizers (WGP) with a 50nm feature size as a low cost way to minimize
absorption and recycle this light.
