The NSF-funded research project led by Javier Movellan at the University of
California, San Diego will develop a social network (?RubiNet?) for early
childhood education. The network will help integrate the activities of children,
teachers, parents, and researchers with the goal of improving early childhood
education at a national and international level. RubiNet will use low-cost
sociable robots to connect children and teachers in different classrooms, from
different socioeconomic backgrounds, cultures, and ethnicities. Some of the
classrooms will be in different countries. Movellan and his colleagues will
investigate the potential of RubiNet as a tool for rapid design and evaluation
of low cost early intervention programs. The potential for RubiNet to improve
academic skills in young children will be assessed. The researchers will also
investigate whether this form of interaction engenders more familiarity and
positivity in children's views of those who are different from
themselves.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An unprecedented number of children in the US
start public school with major deficits in basic skills, including social
skills, language, and mathematics. Children that experience early failure in
school are more likely to later become inattentive, disruptive, or disengaged.
These students tend to drop out of school early, and are more likely to depend
on public assistance programs for survival. Empirical research suggests that the
key to avoiding this vicious cycle is to intervene during the pre-kindergarten
years instead of waiting until failures occur in kindergarten or later.
Unfortunately, early intervention programs are typically very costly. Thus,
another key goal of RubiNet is to significantly lower the cost of intervention
in early education. In addition, RubiNet will be of great potential benefit to
researchers who study social interaction in young children.
