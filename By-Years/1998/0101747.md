This project provides for training and faculty professional development to
students and faculty at a group of community colleges with large native American
populations. It has goals that include increasing the numbers of American
Indians in the technological workforce and enhancing the educational
opportunities for students on the reservation. Students participate in a
recently implemented information technology program at one of the community
colleges. They have the opportunity to select courses to achieve different IT
hardware certifications and to do internships in the community. The IT courses
are offered by distance education, allowing place-bound reservation students the
opportunity for a degree. Professional development opportunities for preservice
teachers, teachers and college instructors in technological applications are
also included, with integration of the technologies into the associated
curricula. Summer workshops provide training for teachers who then serve as
trainers and mentors for peers. This model of community collaboration and
involvement addresses workforce needs in the geographic area and a unique way to
increase the participation in IT careers by under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
