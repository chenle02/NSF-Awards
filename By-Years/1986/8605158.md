A microscope is purchased for use in the conduct of research on microbiological
techniques for direct enumeration of bacteria in water. Initial projects for
which this equipment is planned include work on the rate of substrate
utilization by biofilms on solid surfaces and on the activity and abundance of
nitrifying bacteria in biosystems for removal of nitrogenous and carbonaceous
substances from wastewater.
