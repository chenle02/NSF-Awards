This planning project is designed to improve mathematics science and learning
&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for Sitting Bull College students, "to each according
to his/her needs". &lt;br/&gt;The planning process will identify the needs of
four distinct groups of students. &lt;br/&gt;Group one: students whose career
fields do not require extensive mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;science preparation.
Group two: students entering science and engineering fields. &lt;br/&gt;Group
three: students entering fields such as human services and business where
&lt;br/&gt;mathematic curriculum can be taught to make use of quantitative
methods in &lt;br/&gt;decision making. Group four: students entering the
elementary and middle school&lt;br/&gt;teaching, and must be aware of North and
South Dakota performance standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
