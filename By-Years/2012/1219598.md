Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is
conducted in science and engineering. However, even in domains that seem closely
liked, such as biology, medicine, and drug discovery, computing science research
advances are not broadly disseminated and do not become widely known. This
conference would bring together computational scientists and domain experts to
explore current results and to foster collaborations. A set of outstanding
researchers from around the world have agreed to structure this new effort. The
three day meeting meeting, in Las Vegas Nevada, would have participation by
students through travel grants. This building of the next generation of
computing science in different application areas is one of the key outcomes of
this meeting. In addition, the selected papers will be made available online. In
addition, some of the papers will be published through BioMed Central, which has
reduced the costs for this meeting. Bringing together academic and industry
researchers to consider the latest advances in computational methods will
promote the rapid transfer of results from research to products and
technologies.
