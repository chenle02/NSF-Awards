RUI: Combinatorial Fixed Point Theorems, Polytopes, and Preference Sets

The investigator's prior work has introduced methods from combinatorial
topology and discrete geometry to the study of certain "fair division" questions
in mathematical economics. The current proposal will support the development of
the mathematics behind these methods and the solution of several combinatorial
questions that have been motivated by his prior work, including: (1) the study
of minimal triangulations and minimal simplicial covers of polytopes, (2) the
further development of combinatorial fixed point theorems and associated
simplicial algorithms, and (3) the development of convexity theorems that have
bearing on social choice problems. Broader impacts of the proposed work include
its interdisciplinary applications to group decision making, fair division, and
voting problems, and the active participation and training of undergraduates in
the proposed research.

Informally speaking, a "fair division" problem is concerned with finding methods
for dividing a set of goods among players in such a way that everyone can be
satisfied according to some notion of fairness. This topic is of interest to
economists, political scientists, and game theorists, and it often motivates
interesting mathematical questions. The set of possible solutions in such
problems is often a polyhedron of high dimension (a polytope), and one can
usually find a solution by breaking the polytope into many pieces (tetrahedra),
and walking around the polytope in a way that is guided by player preferences.
Thus the mathematics of how polytopes can be built up from its tetrahedral
building blocks using ideas from three areas (combinatorics, topology, and
discrete geometry) as well as related classical convexity theorems will have
direct application to important problems in the social sciences involving human
strategy and decision making.
