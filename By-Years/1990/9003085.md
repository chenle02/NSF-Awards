With this postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Hay will be working with Professor
Michael Radnor and Professor Wallace J. Hopp of Northwestern University in order
to examine the origins, development and diffusion of operations research (OR)
from 1940- 1960. OR is a mathematical approach to complex problem solving
created during World War II. A study of Allied scientific-military cooperation
in developing and employing OR reveals its military importance. The postwar era
(to 1960) shows how OR methods were extended to create mathematical programming,
game theory, and other cornerstones of decision science. Dr. Hay will examine
this postwar technology transfer from solely military use to private and public
enterprize. He will employ American and British government archives, memoirs,
official histories, other relevant monographs and articles. He will also
interview key surviving OR practitioners.
