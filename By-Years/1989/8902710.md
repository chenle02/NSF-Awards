This award will assist Dr. Wilson in carrying out his program of research in
computational physics. His program will cover three important problems: 1.)
stellar collapse and the formation of supernovae 2.) coalescence of neutron
stars and emission of gravitational radiation 3.) nuclear heavy ion collisions.
These will all require extensive computation simulating the behavior of
relativistic fluids at nuclear densities.
