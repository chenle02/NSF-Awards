Support is provided for the 1992 Gordon Conference, June 15-June 19, 1992. The
subject, processing and its effect on microstructure and fracture is critical to
the development of advanced materials for structures. State-of-the-art
developments in fracture processes, micromechanisms of fracture, atomistics of
interfaces, nanoscale mechanics, the role of structure in fracture, toughening
mechanisms, intermetallic and composite fracture, and smart materials are
included. Issues of mechanics, materials science, and metallurgy are addressed.
%%% This study of microstructural development through processing control is the
fundamental building block of materials science. This conference examines the
effects of processing on structure and mechanical properties, and has direct
relationship to the future use of advanced materials.
