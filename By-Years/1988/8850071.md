The proposed seven-week summer program for 30 high ability secondary school
students consists of two parts. In Part I students will spend 90-minutes per day
attending lectures, discussions and experiements on topics outside of the high
school or college curriculum. Three mini- courses will be offered: 1. Phenomena
of Light and Color in the Open Air; 2. Frontiers in Astrophysics; and 3. Lasers
and Holography. In Part II of the program participants will work in ongoing
research programs as junior members of research teams consisting of professors,
graduate, undergraduate and high school students. During the last week of the
program, all participants will have the opportunity to discuss their work before
the group.
