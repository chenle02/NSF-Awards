This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program concerns the
development of several improved methods for carrying out electronic structure
calculations on molecules. Analytic energy gradient methods will be implemented
in the Local Correlation Method to facilitate geometry determinations of the
ground states of large molecules. A new method for unbiased selection of active
MCSCF orbitals, based on preliminary calculation of UHF natural orbitals, will
be generalized to excited states. A new perturbation theory for determination of
correlation energies in open shell and multi-reference states will be
implemented and tested. The analogous perturbation theory based on UHF states
will also be improved by a new method of eliminating spin contamination. Taken
together, these developments will greatly extend the range of chemical problems
that can be addressed by accurate computational methods.
