This research will be focused on the enzyme acetohydroxy acid synthetase--a key
regulatory enzyme involved in synthesis of branched chain amino acids--in the
archaebacterium Methanococcus. Purification of the enzyme, determination of its
physical and chemical properties, and its cloning and its sequence will be the
major foci of the study, which will also then address the homology of this
enzyme with that of eubacteria and eukaryotes. A nutritional phenomenon termed
pseudoauxotrophy, relating to the amino acids leucine and isoleucine will also
be investigated. //
