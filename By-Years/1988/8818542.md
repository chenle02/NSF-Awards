This project will examine heterojunction bipolar transistors at high
frequencies. There is a predicted resonance above about 60 GHz which the PI will
attempt to find experimentally. The transistor will be designed to move the
resonance to the experimentally accessible range below 40 GHz. The next stage of
the project is to optimize the device design to the maximum possible frequency
performance.
