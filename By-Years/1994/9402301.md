9402301 Ellis A group of six science and technology centers across the country
proposes to form a pilot collaborative effort to establish connections to
NSFNET. These institutions share the vision that access to the resources
provided via NSFNET will significantly enhance their ability to achieve their
common missions and goals in providing informal science education for students,
teachers, and the general public. Further, it is expected that this group of
institutions will serve as a model for other museums and represents the vanguard
in what will become a general movement for science and technology centers to
become full participants in this national communication network. The partner
institutions of this collaboration are: The Franklin Institute (PA), Liberty
Science Center (NJ), Museum of Science (MA), Center of Science and Industry
(OH), Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OR), St. Louis Science Center (MO),
The Science Place (TX). Connection to NSFNET will bring a wide range of remote
information resources within immediate reach of museum researchers, educators,
and visitors. Specifically, access to the NSFNET will help the partners of this
pilot group to improve operations in the areas of teaching, research, and
service.
