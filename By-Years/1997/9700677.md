9700677 Superfine This project will synthesize, characterize and model nanotubes
to understand their mechanical properties as they relate to nanometer scale
mechanical devices and as components of composite materials. The elastic moduli
will be measured using Atomic Force Microscopy to determine stress/strain
relationships. Particular attention will be paid to the failure modes of the
tubes through the correlation of structural features and discontinuities in the
determined moduli. These studies will be performed on carbon and substituted
nanotubes, filled tubes, and will be compared with molecular dynamics
calculations. The atomistic molecular dynamics simulations will be used to
provide atomic scale insight into the forces which drive nanotube mechanical
performance. The project will begin the incorporation of nanotubes into
mechanical device structures beginning with the simplest MEMS structure, a
cantilever switch. This will serve as a test bed for the interfacial effects
which will play a critical role in the operation of a nanometer scale structure.
Both the characterization of the nanotubes and the production of prototype
devices will be made possible by a unique, advanced interface for AFM, the
nanoManipulator, which permits facile manipulation while measuring the normal
and lateral forces exerted on the object. ***
