The PI proposes four research projects, the first three of which are related to
the study of rational points of bounded height on certain classes of algebraic
varieties in the context of Manin's conjecture for Fano varieties. In
continuation of his joint work with Shalika and Tschinkel, the PI plans to study
the distribution of rational points of bounded height on spherical varieties,
and also compactifications of certain non-reductive algebraic groups. The fourth
project, joint with a student, will be concerned with the distribution of orders
in number fields. The proposed research, especially in the first three projects,
is part of a broader program of bringing recent advances in the theory of
automorphic forms to bear on the questions of arithmetic interest. The research
theme applies methods from the theory of automorphic forms and ideas from
arithmetic geometry to the study of rational points on homogeneous varieties.
The PI believes that this research will advance knowledge and understanding of
the arithmetic of higher dimensional varieties.

Diophantine equations have been of interest since the antiquities. Often times a
fundamental question of interest is whether a given Diophantine equation has
solutions, or, if does, how many. In this research we propose to study certain
classes of Diophantine equations with large groups of symmetries. The type of
Diophantine equations we consider in this research a priori have an infinite
number of solutions, so one desires a better understanding of the distribution
of solutions. We propose to give approximate formulae for the number of
solutions with bounded "height" - where here, "height" is a convenient measure
of arithmetic complexity. We have also included an educational program in the
proposal. Our previous work on the subject has produced a large number of
concrete research problems accessible to undergraduate and graduate students. It
has also led to the writing of a textbook joint with Steven J. Miller. We plan
to develop these pedagogical programs further in the form of writing an advanced
graduate textbook. .
