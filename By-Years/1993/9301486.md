Dr. Phillip W. Kash has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kash's doctoral degree was from the University of Chicago under
the supervision of Professor Laurie Butler. Dr. Kash will continue research at
Columbia University under the sponsorship of Professors Brian Bent and George
Flynn. Dr. Kash's postdoctoral training will provide him with surface science
skills as he studies the dissociation and reaction dynamics of alkyl halides
adsorbed on copper surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy. Longer term,
Dr. Kash plans to investigate how intramolecular nonadiabatic electron
excitation transfer influences the branching between competing bond fission
channels in the photodissociation of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. %%% The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
