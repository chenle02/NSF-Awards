The Third Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference
(WHOA-PSI) will be held on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis from
September 8-10, 2018. Post-selection inference refers to the question of valid
statistical inference performed after a model selection procedure has been
utilized. Higher-order asymptotics provide the tools and insights needed to
refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures and
make them more accurate and powerful, even when the scientist only has access to
small to moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster
collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference
research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy and more powerful
inference procedures. NSF funding will support junior researchers attending this
conference.

This workshop attempts to address the needs of applied statisticians utilizing
model selection procedures who also need extremely accurate and powerful
inference procedures with theoretical guarantees. Topics from post-selection
inference include selective inference after variable selection, high-dimensional
and post-regularized inference, inference after change-point estimation, and
simultaneous inference. Some talks will focus on methods from higher-order
asymptotics, which can yield insights and improvements to post-selection
inference procedures, including series expansions, saddlepoint approximations,
and bootstrap-based refinements. Additional talks will present important applied
problems for which new post-selection methods are needed. Examples include
statistical genetics, neuroscience, and finance. (See
