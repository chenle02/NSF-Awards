This project is investigating factors that affect the formation of cloud
condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. Factors such as particle size and
composition can influence the ability of a particle to uptake water and become a
cloud droplet. This research will improve understanding of the interactions
between aerosols and clouds, that are the most uncertain aspect of the climate
system.

This collaborative effort focuses on quantifying the contribution of phase,
morphology, and mixing state to CCN activation and droplet formation at
subsaturated and supersaturated conditions. The project has the following
objectives: (1) Compare hygroscopicity measurements with traditional
hygroscopicity predictions for particles with different phase states; (2) Define
the role of particle morphology (specifically changes in phase-separating
systems) for particle water-uptake; (3) Determine the effect of particle mixing
state of varying two-component phase systems for hygroscopicity; and (4) Develop
models and software to interpret mixed phase state and morphology CCN activation
curves. The collaboration includes a diverse group of early career scientists
and will support the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students.
