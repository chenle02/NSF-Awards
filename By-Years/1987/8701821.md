This project will bring together a selected group of users of knowledge and
information generated by research on natural and man-made hazards. Participants
will present their views on the needs and priorities for future research
activities. They will address, among others, the following questions: (a) What
research have they found useful and why? (b) How did they learn about the
results of the useful research? (c) Did they share this information and, if so,
how and with whom? (d) What future research would be most useful for their
professional work? (e) In what form should the results of such research be
presented and disseminated? The working group will consist of Federal, State and
local managers, administrators, planners and other persons responsible for
disaster preparedness and mitigation in the U.S. The workshop will take place at
the George Washington University, organized and conducted by staff of the
Graduate Program of Science, Technology and Public Policy. The P.I. is well
respected in the field of disaster preparedness, mitigation and response and is
qualified to carry out this project. An award is recommended.
