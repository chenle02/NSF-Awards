The principal investigator will pursue research in commutative algebra on
graded rings and local rings and their singularities. Topics include Hilbert
functions, Hilbert polynomials, birational extensions and formal fibers. The
work has specific applications to algebraic geometry, particularly to the
problem of resolution of singularities. This is reasearch in the field of
algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins,
it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from
algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application
in those fields as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
