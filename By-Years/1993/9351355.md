9351355 Shamma The University of West Florida is establishing a computer
laboratory for enhancement of learning undergraduate mathematics. Students in
calculus and other undergraduate courses are concentrating on problem solving,
mathematical modeling, and the understanding of concepts through hands on
computers. A mathematical programming language is being used to allow students
to make standard mathematical constructions using standard relations, and
computer graphics are utilized to explore mathematical modeling of realistic and
interesting real world problems. Materials used are based on the Purdue
University Calculus Project. Their experiences are being disseminated to
community colleges in the West Florida region. ***
