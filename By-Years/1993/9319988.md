9319988 Peckham This proposal from Case Western Reserve University requests
partial support to conduct a symposium entitled Neural Prostheses: Motor Systems
IV Conference. The symposium focuses on integration of engineering and clinical
expertise in developing devices that restore function for individuals with motor
impairments; to expedite the transference of neural prostheses from the
engineering laboratory to the clinic and manufacturing industry; and to educate
young researchers. The international scientific meeting is the fourth in a
series of conferences held every three years. Sessions to be held include neural
prostheses for lower extremity, upper extremity, bladder, and respiratory;
electrodes, leads, and connectors; muscle and muscle properties; feedback
control strategies; command control; and technology transfer. Presenter
participants in the symposium are world leaders in neural prostheses for motor
control. Funding requested from the NSF would provide partial support for
invited participants. Four papers will be submitted for peer reviewed journal
publication by symposium participants, thereby making symposium results
available to a large audience. ***
