This project concentrates on algorithmic aspects of problems in combinatorics,
emphasizing the interplay between combinatorics and qualitative matrix theory.
Qualitative matrix problems arise in situations where data is imprecise, for
example, where knowledge is limited to qualitative information. One problem is
to derive more qualitative information from qualitative data, such as
determining the sign pattern of the solution to a linear system of equations
from that of its coefficients. Graph theoretic problems relating to such
signsolvability will be studied. In many real life situations, the data
available is not in the form of numbers, but rather the information may be only
that each number of interest is positive or negative. Mathematical methods to
extract further information from such data are being developed, and have bearing
on such areas as ecology, chemistry, mechanics, and energy planning.
