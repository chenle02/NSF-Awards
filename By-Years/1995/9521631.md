9521631 Platnick Ground spiders are among the most abundant and important
predators in both forest and drier habitats throughout Australia, Tasmania, New
Caledonia, and New Zealand. This project will involve a comprehensive survey of
the Australasian ground spider fauna, resulting in detailed information of the
characteristics, distributions, and interrelationships of an estimated 650
species. %%% Because these spiders tend to have relatively small distribution
ranges, the research should enable us to determine the areas within Australasia
that house the largest numbers of endemic ground spider species, and that may
therefore be of primary importance for conservation. The research will also
enable a detailed analysis of the interrelationships among those areas of
endemism (thereby providing clues to the phylogenetic history of both forest and
semi-arid ecosystems within Australia), and will also provide a thorough test of
the existing higher classification of these spiders, which has been based
primarily on northern hemisphere species and may require significant alteration
to accommodate the Australasian faunas. In addition to the taxonomic
significance of the project an important aspect will be the training of graduate
students and postdocs in the field of spider taxonomy. Also, specimen data
obtained by the research will be made available electronically to the scientific
community. The host institution is providing as a cost share commitment an
artist and a technician to assist with the project. ***
