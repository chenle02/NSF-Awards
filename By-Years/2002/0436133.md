This project will identify social and technical areas (and questions) where the
&lt;br/&gt;state of today.s technical knowledge is inadequate to provide
reasonable &lt;br/&gt;answers. A better understanding of these areas will be
useful both to policy &lt;br/&gt;makers, including elections officials, whose
decision making should take note of &lt;br/&gt;the limits of today.s technical
understanding and where further research could &lt;br/&gt;improve the voting
process, and to researchers who would seek to remove those &lt;br/&gt;limits in
the future. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results will be useful in their own
right, but this project is conceptually the first &lt;br/&gt;phase of a more
comprehensive project on electronic voting that would assess &lt;br/&gt;evidence
about a broader set of issues in the use of information technology in
&lt;br/&gt;the electoral process. That is, that larger project.should support be
obtained.&lt;br/&gt;would use the results of this project as a point of
departure for an effort that &lt;br/&gt;would enable a much deeper and more
thorough exploration of the issues &lt;br/&gt;raised in the report from this
project.
