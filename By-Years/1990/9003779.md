This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. The goal of this project is to improve the
seismic design of structures through a better understanding of seismic input and
the inelastic structural response. The database of the recorded building
response will be used to: (1) evaluate the damage potential of recorded ground
motion, (2) collect building and freeway structure details and recorded
response, (3) develop analytical models and perform time-history analysis, (4)
estimate damage potential, and (5) generate inelastic design response spectrum.
The study will produce recommendations on the values for design ductility and
the yield resistant seismic coefficient to be used in design practice.
