A new laboratory component is proposed for the introductory computer science
sequence. A computer science facility will be established that will provide for
an effective "closed" laboratory component to these courses. The project will
affect all the courses taught by the computer science department. New computer-
servers will be added to the existing network and will function as a computer
science facility. Students taking computer science classes will be able to
access this facility from on and off campus. Since it will be a department
facility the students will be given as much access as possible. Material
developed by previously and currently funded NSF projects will be used as much
as possible in the development of the laboratories in this project. This will
provide the best laboratory software as quickly and as expensively as is
possible. Every student taking computer science courses, both majors and non
majors will have the opportunity to learn as much as they can and will be better
prepared for transfer to other colleges and universities.
