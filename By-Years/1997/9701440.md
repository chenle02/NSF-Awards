9701440 Jaffe Biomedical ultrasonic imaging is an important nonivasive method
which permits the diagnosis of many types of cardiovascular disease.
Unfortunately, the method fails when viewing blood vessels that are either too
small or too deep inside the body because these features reflect very little of
the incident sound. A method that we have invented to circumvent these
conventional limitations consists of measuring the special characteristics of
the reflectivity from these structures and then crowing custom made sonar
waveforms which have been specifically tailored to their reflections. This grant
will fund both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments which will allow us to both
refine and verify the utility of the method in the lab and also in clinical
studies. ***
