This individual investigator award will support a project with the goal of
providing insight into the intimate coupling of electron spin, electron
transport and atomic structure in the manganite system, possibly leading to the
development of more accurate models of systems with strong electron-lattice
correlations. The long-range, nanoscale and local atomic structure will be
determined in films ranging from the nanoscale to bulk-like to explore how
magnetic and transport properties are influenced by substrate strain and film
thickness. The structure will be determined via a variety of techniques
including, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy. Direct comparisons will be made with corresponding bulk materials
and correlations of the structure with resistivity and magnetization
measurements will be performed. These materials may be of use in future magnetic
read-head technologies. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in
all levels of this work. To develop scientific literacy in students, a seven
week summer research and teaching program on transition metal oxide preparation
and characterization designed for Newark area high school students and teachers
will be conducted during each year of this grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
manganite system is a class of materials that exhibit large changes in
resistivity with applied magnetic field. These changes are an order of magnitude
larger than those in sensors currently used in computer hard drives and may
enable significantly higher storage capacity. However, the sensitivity at low
magnetic fields required for use in hard drives must be improved. From the basic
scientific perspective, these materials provide an important testing ground for
systems with large correlations between atomic structure and electron transport.
This individual investigator award will support a study of a broad range of
films relevant to both technological applications and basic science
understanding. The goal is to understand how magnetic properties are influenced
by substrate strain and film thickness. Graduate and undergraduate students will
be involved in all levels of this work. A seven-week summer research and
teaching program on transition metal oxide preparation and characterization,
designed for Newark area high school students and teachers will be conducted
during each year of this grant. This will serve to develop scientific literacy
and may influence students to pursue careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;
