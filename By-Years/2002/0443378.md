AST-0206329&lt;br/&gt;Stubbs&lt;br/&gt;A recent convergence of observational
results has led cosmologists to the surprising conclusion that not only is the
Universe expanding, but that the rate of expansion is increasing. This can be
thought of as anti-gravity between regions of the vacuum. It appears that the
Universe at present is dominated by the gravitational effect of this mysterious
Dark Energy. Distant supernovae (exploding stars) provide a means to map out the
history of the expansion of the Universe, and can be used to distinguish between
different scenarios for the physics that drives an accelerating expansion. This
project will detect and monitor over 200 supernovae in order to test different
hypotheses for the nature of the Dark Energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
