We propose a broad-based program of research into the acceleration, transport,
and solar modulation of cosmic rays, the nature of large-scale and turbulent
magnetic fields in the solar wind, and the interactions among these subsystems
of the interplanetary plasma. Support is requested to continue the collection
and analysis of data from neutron monitor stations in Thule, Greenland and
Newark, Delaware. Specific scientific objectives include: o detailed analysis
and modeling of the ground level enhancements caused by relativistic solar
particles during Solar Cycle 22; o comprehensive analysis of the higher order
harmonics of the cosmic ray diurnal variation, and the extraction of new
information on local interplanetary transport parameters (including magnetic
helicity) from the data; o detailed observational testing of new ideas as to the
factors governing cosmic ray mean free paths, including the influence of
turbulence dissipation, dynamics, and geometry; and o development and
implementation of new observational methods to determine turbulence geometry,
placing special emphasis on the identification and measurement of a possible
two-dimensional component.
