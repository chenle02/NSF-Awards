This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will
develop compact, high-speed, low-voltage waveguide modulator devices, with
capabilities well beyond those presently available. The enabling technology for
these devices is a patented process for deposition and patterning of single-
crystal lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin films. This technology will be refined
with particular emphasis on improving manufacturability and reducing production
costs, by working closely with manufacturers of commercial telecommunications
components. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Fiber optic networks are being implemented in
industry, defense and domestic and international telecommunications. Traveling
wave modulators are a key component in these networks. This project will enable
new products that will add increased speed, capacity and flexibility to growing
optical communications networks. In the longer term, this technology could also
be applied to a variety of other devices based on single crystal films of a non-
linear electro-optical material such as LiNbO3. &lt;br/&gt;
