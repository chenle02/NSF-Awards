Center (I/UCRC) has an evaluator associated with the Center to study the
industry/university interaction occurring within the Center. This information is
of interest to both the I/UCRC Program and the Center Director as well as
providing a data base to be used by researchers studying Centers. This award
provides funding to study the industry/university interaction occurring in Case
Western Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Applied Polymers. The evaluator will conduct investigations of Center
activities, participate in annual meetings, attend the NSF evaluator activities,
and interview departing companies.
