This award provides funds for students, postdocs, and junior researchers to
participate in a "Workshop on Interdisciplinary Mathematics" to be held on May
8-10, 2015, at the Department of Mathematics, Penn State University. Applied
mathematics in the modern world faces the challenges of developing new
mathematical techniques and approaches to help advance research in other
disciplines. A goal of this workshop is to help prepare the future generation of
applied mathematicians to face these challenges. It will also help to establish
new contacts and create long-term relationships between research groups at
different institutions in the US and in Europe. All the plenary speakers invited
at the workshop are internationally well established researchers and leaders in
their fields. The talks are expected to be of an expository nature, not
technical, but of a high scientific level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
audience of the workshop will consist of graduate students and young
researchers. During the three days of the conference, nine plenary speakers will
deliver widely accessible survey talks. These talks will cover a broad spectrum
of applications: materials science, biology and medicine, complex fluids, and
finance. In addition, there will be a round table discussion on new directions,
where analytical and computational techniques could provide novel insights.
Together with local graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, 12-15 young
researchers will be invited from other institutions, covering their travel and
local expenses. All participants will have an opportunity to present their work
in poster sessions. Some of them, selected by the organizers, will also give
short talks. The web site for the Workshop is
