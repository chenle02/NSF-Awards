Both experimental and theoretical investigations of nonlinear dispersive wave
effects and of acousto-optic effects are performed. As regards nonlinear waves,
the researchers are continuing a physics-oriented, partially heuristic approach
toward two- and three-dimensional solutions. As regards acousto-optic effects,
they are continuing the plane wave multiple scattering approach using Feyman
diagrams. In addition to continuing these efforts, two new investigations,
closely related to the subjects mentioned, are being started. The first one is
to broaden the solition investigations to include related aspects (such as
bistability, chaos, parametric interactions, etc.) where such aspects are
relevant in providing deeper understanding and physical insight. The second new
investigation is to make a thorough comparison of the physics-oriented and the
mathematics-oriented approaches toward acousto-optics. The final goal of the
program is to acquire physical insight into esoteric concepts to assess their
applicability to the field of electrical engineering, both in terms of analytic
tools and devices.
