The Intellectual Merit of this project is the CrossCloud design for a practical,
open, federated data base system, based on existing web technologies including
Linked Data. CrossCloud's design solves longstanding database federation
challenges in a simple and effective way using the Linked Data vision of RDF
data sources which use URLs as object identifiers. CrossCloud includes a "data
registration" mechanism to create a distributed search service for data and a
vocabulary mapping system to connect applications developed independently with
these components. CrossCloud is decentralized, capable of managing queries and
updates from across the internet with no central bottleneck. The Broader Impact
of this work begins with making it easier for developers to share users across
an industry and then be able to reach a critical mass. Nearly any situation
calling for coordinated work among people can benefit from multi-user software
and with CrossCloud changing the software market, the needed solutions can
finally be put into widespread use. This EAGER grant proposal is being made at a
critical time, as the underlying technologies fall into place and enterprising
developers begin to settle into working with mobile devices and cloud
infrastructure.
