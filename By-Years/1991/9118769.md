Composite materials are being developed for applications in the design of
bridges and buildings. This project will investigate, analytically and
experimentally, the behavior of cable supported bridges using composite cables.
The bridges will be investigated for static and dynamic load conditions for the
linear and non-linear range of the material. The result of this research will be
used to install cable hangers in a suspension bridge.//
