This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of a
Genome Analyzer IIx sequencer to enable deep sequencing, a new technology in
biological and medical fields, at Dartmouth College. Deep sequencing technology
enables experiments that were, until now, virtually impossible to perform, and
provides a way for the researcher to determine the exact sequence of all the DNA
and RNAs in a cell at a given time. Understanding how cells function and
interact with their environment in normal and disease states is the major goal
of all biological and medical researchers. The Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx at
Dartmouth would enable researchers to (i) pinpoint genetic mutations and
variations associated with enzymatic reactions, microbial biofilms, plant
physiology, and many other biological phenomena; (ii) determine the genomic
locations bound by specific DNA binding proteins involved in gene regulation;
and (iii) identify and quantify differences in mRNA expression as a function of
environmental, toxicological, and physiological responses. The results from
these studies would be published in peer-reviewed journals and deposited in
public databases for the benefit of the biological fields. Furthermore, through
their research activities, their sponsorship of the Dartmouth REU-
SITE(www.dartmouth.edu/~surf), and their mentorship of individual students, the
PIs and the co-PIs are deeply committed to training. Additionally, all of the
PIs and co-PIs disseminate scientific knowledge via outreach programs in K-12
schools and/or the Montshire Science Museum in Norwich, Vermont. These
activities encourage broader participation in science and promote the training
and development of the next generation of research scientists.
