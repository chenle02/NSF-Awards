Pattern formation requires that cells have a unique positional value relative
to their neighbors but positional value alone is not sufficient to account for
the fine tuning of the patterns observed. The exquisitely precise organization
of many cellular arrays demonstrates that cells are also oriented relative to
their neighbors to form parallel arrays of structures and that this cellular
orientation is linked to the overall organization of the body plan. This is most
easily appreciated by considering the organization of parallel arrays of
cellular structures seen in many tissues such as the parallel orientation of
hairs and bristles, the repeated orientation of the rhabdomeres of the eye, and
the polar organization of the cells of sensilla and the polarized induction of
bracts by machrochate forming cells. In all these cases the microorganization of
the cells of each structure is linked to the global orientation of the general
body plan. The mere existence of this level of organization implies a mechanism
of signals and receptors. In some way cells must receive not only positional
cues but orienting cues that serve to link their orientation to that of the
general body plan. Dr. Marsh has been investigating the mechanisms whereby
orienting information is transmitted to cells. He has surveyed a number of
mutants for affects on tissue organization and cell polarity. The dishevelled
gene appears to affect cell orientation in a global manner. He had found that
dishevelled mutants affect orientation of bract induction by bristle cells,
orientation of hairs and bristles and organization of the rhabdomeres of the
eye. He is proposing to clone and analyze the dishevelled locus.
