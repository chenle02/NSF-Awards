Dr. Clouse is requesting funds to conduct a one year pilotprogram on the effects
of a novel plant growth steroid,brassinolide (BR), on gene expression during
development. He hason hand the chemically pure compound, a set of molecular
probesand transgenic plants and three assay systems with which toobtain, within
one year, definitive answers about thefeasibility of establishing a long.term
program on the action ofthis steroid compound on the transcription of plant
genesinvolved in growth and differentiation. No work on the action ofthis
compound on gene transcription has been reported and thelack of preliminary
molecular data make this unsuitable for afull scale proposal. BR has pronounced
effects on plant growthand development, interacts with other plant growth
regulators andshares structural similarities with animal steroid hormones. Ithas
immense potential as a tool for probing gene expressionduring development and as
an agricultural growth promoter. %%% Nothing is known about the mechanism of
action of brassinolide. This pilot study will determine if it has a proximal
effect ongene expression. If so then a larger research effort would bewarranted.
