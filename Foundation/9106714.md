The investigator will continue research in several areas of recursive function
theory, including: automorphisms and definable properties of the recursively
enumerable (r.e.) sets; algebraic, model-theoretic, and definability questions
concerning the r.e. Turing degrees; recursion-theoretic properties of various
algebraic structures; and computational complexity questions for polynomially-
time-bounded Turing degrees. Soare recently developed with Harrington and
Lachlan a very powerful method for generating new automorphisms of the r.e.
sets, and they simultaneously found several new definable properties which
together with the automorphisms answered many fundamental questions going back
to Post's program (1944) on the relationship between the algebraic structure of
an r.e. set and its Turing degree. These two new methods will be developed
further and applied to answer other open questions on r.e. sets. Soare will
continue his study of questions of continuity, definability, embeddability, and
partial decidability for the structure of the r.e. Turing degrees. He will
complete research on computability aspects of various algebraic structures,
specially Boolean algebras, investigating, for example, which information can be
coded into their classical isomorphism types. Finally, he will continue research
with several collaborators on computational complexity questions for the many-
one and Turing degrees under polynomially-time-bounded Turing computations. The
motivation for studying such notions lies in their origins. For example, Turing
machines idealize actual computing devices, and Turing degrees simply order
their relative computational power. The elaborate techniques required to prove
theorems in this area sometimes tend to obscure these fundamental facts, despite
an effort to use suggestive terminology, e.g., "computability" and
"computational complexity."
