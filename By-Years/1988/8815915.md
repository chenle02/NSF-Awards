The three major research activities of this group are all centered at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). The activities are: 1) The CDF
experiment which is currently the major experiment at the proton-antiproton
collider at Fermilab. This collider produces the highest (by a factor of three)
energy collisions available in the world. The CDF detector system is one of the
most important instruments for elementary particle physics research at present.
It is being used to measure the properties of the "weak bosons", carriers of the
weak nuclear force; study the properties of the strong nuclear force (quantum
chromodynamics); and search for phenomena not observable at the previously
accessible lower energies. 2) A study of the violation of the fundamental
symmetry, CP, in the decay of the short lived neutral K meson. 3) A measurement
of the magnetic moment of the omega minus baryon (made up of three strange
quarks). The field of research is that of experimental elementary particle
physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of matter (e.g.,
electrons, positrons, quarks and weak bosons) at very high energies. The
experiments use accelerators (and colliders) which provide the highest energy
particles made in the laboratory. The data is collected and analyzed using
highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.
