This Science in Developing Countries award will support the research
collaboration of T. Kent Kirk of the University of Wisconsin and Rafael Vicuna
of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. The project aims to introduce
fungal research into the Chilean investigator's laboratory, and to characterize
the lignin-degrading enzyme system of unusual lignin- degrading fungi from Chile
and the U.S. Through this project, the Chilean scientist will learn techniques
for physiological, biochemical, and genetic studies with filamentous fungi. His
will become the first laboratory in Chile with expertise in the molecular
genetics of higher filamentous fungi, and one of the few working with these
fungi in any capacity. One U.S. and two Chilean strains of lignin- degrading
fungi will be studied. Enzymes they produce will be identified and
characterized. Conditions for optimal enzyme production and efficient lignin
mineralization will be determined. The investigators' past collaboration has
shown that bacteria exert only minor action on polymeric lignin. Thus, the
Chilean researcher now aims to focus on fungi. The ligninolytic fungi have
substantial potential for practical applications in Chile and U.S., particularly
for the paper pulping industry. Both the U.S. and Chilean sides will benefit
from the basic information generated by their research.
