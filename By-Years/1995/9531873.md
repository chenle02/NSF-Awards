9531873 Rothstein This project is a contribution to the modeling component to be
carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE)
under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The focus will be on
upgrading existing isopycnal models, data assimilation, and integrating
different types of regional models. Comparisons will be made among different
modeling approaches in order to assess the strngths and weaknesses of each, and
to determine the best overall approach for including ocean variability in
climate modeling. Particular attention will be paid to assimilating, into the
models, data from the field phase of ACCE, as well as from historical data
bases. In this particular project, the PIs will provide a numerical ocean
circulation context for the dynamical analyses of the subpolar field
observations, using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), recently re-designed to
properly represent all of the important subpolar physical process. It will be
further augmented with an atmospheric boundary layer model to more accurately
represent surface heat fluxes, and an ice model to properly simulate regional
fresh water fluxes.
