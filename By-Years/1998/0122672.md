&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to award scholarship assistance to full-time
students in the Computer Science degree program who are academically talented,
but who may be at high risk due to financial need. The goal of this program is
for each of the students participating to succeed in the associate degree
program in computer science. These skilled graduates are then becoming employed
in the Information Technology (IT) industry or transferring to a bachelor degree
program at a four-year university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program objectives
are to: &lt;br/&gt;1) Recruit 10 full-time students in the Computer Science
degree program each year to receive scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;2) Assess the
academic skills and weaknesses of all selected program participants and prepare
an Individual Educational Plan for each scholarship student. &lt;br/&gt;3)
Provide all participants with access to all available computer software and
hardware as well as the technical and instructional guidance in order to help
them succeed academically; &lt;br/&gt;4) Provide instruction, learning community
experiences, tutoring, mentoring and other support services to all program
participants. &lt;br/&gt;5) Provide participants with intensive career advising
and job placement services designed to ensure that they either enter the job
market or continue to pursue a bachelor's degree program upon graduation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student support structure of the project is providing
a wide range of specific mentoring and advising services, special academic
intervention, peer and professional tutoring, learning community experiences,
and increased involvement with faculty and IT representatives. In addition,
work-based learning opportunities provide students with hands-on experience and
an increased understanding of the workplace and learning
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
