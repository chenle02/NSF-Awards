This project is an attempt to apply new cohomological and representation-
theoretic ideas to problems in transformation groups and homotopy theory. The
particular aspects which it involves can be described as follows: (1)
Incorporate the study of certain discrete groups, such as arithmetic groups and
mapping class groups, to an existing program based on applying methods from
modular representation theory to group actions. (2) Determine general properties
of the cohomology of finite groups, and how, using equivariant cohomology, this
influences the role they play as transformation groups. (3) Obtain necessary and
sufficient conditions for a finite group to act freely on a product of spheres,
and analyze the restrictions this imposes on the homology representations when
they are of the same dimension. This work is aimed at approaching a global
conjecture on the free rank of symmetry of a finite complex. (4) Use theory of
infinite loop spaces and invariant theory to obtain precise cohomological
information on the symmetric groups, with several applications in mind. They
include describing the cohomology of certain double covers of the symmetric
groups which serve as finite models for a space which detects important
characteristic classes. Other applications to stable homotopy and group
cohomology are also planned. The invariant theory used is seen as an interesting
and important algebraic problem in its own right, encoding most of the
cohomological structure of the symmetric groups. In other words, the various
parts of this project all concern the symmetry of geometric objects. Algebraic
tools for making calculations about symmetry will be perfected, and these tools
will then be applied to answer natural questions.
