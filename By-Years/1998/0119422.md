Land-use continues to change throughout the world as economies and populations
grow. Land-use change often has large adverse impacts on natural capital and the
ecosystem services that this capital provides. The long-term goals of this
project are 1) to improve understanding and prediction of land-use change and
its effects on biocomplexity in watersheds, and 2) to improve the capacity of
decision makers to use this information in their efforts to foster both economic
well being and preservation of natural capital. In this incubation activity, the
investigators will work at the watershed scale toward integrated
biophysical/economic systems models that respond to thresholds and episodic
events. This is a significant departure from the approach taken by much
preceding work, in which information has been analyzed using regression
relationships based on continuous functions that cannot handle threshold and
episodic events. The investigators plan to hold three workshops for team
development, assessment of the state of knowledge, and the articulation of the
conceptual framework and methods for a larger and more in-depth study.
