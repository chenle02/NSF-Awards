The goal of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for students to
present their research results, learn the cutting edge research, and interact
with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry at
the ACM SIGMOD 2012 (International Conference on Data Management). As one of the
most prestigious conferences in data management research, ACM SIGMOD has
contributed significantly to the advance of all aspects of data management
technologies and applications since 1975. Today ACM SIGMOD is a dynamic and
comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction; and it is a
leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers,
and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results and to exchange techniques,
tools, and experiences. This project provides partial support for students
matriculated at U.S. institutions, especially female and minority students, to
attend and present their research work at ACM SIGMOD 2012 in Scottsdale,
Arizona. Besides meeting with researchers from academia and industry during
regular program sessions, in SIGMOD 2012 students are able to participate in the
following interactive activities as partially supported by this project: a new
researcher symposium, an undergraduate research poster competition, vis-a-vis
meetings with leading researchers, and a female student mentoring workshop.
These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the
participants. The broader impact is to train the future generation of leaders
and workforce in the critical field of data management. The project details are
