The goal of the project is the improvement of the undergraduate environmental
engineering education through an increased emphasis on the theory, design and
modeling of environmental treatment systems. This results in an increase of
required course work and laboratory exercises in the environmental engineering
area. Major pieces of equipment purchased include total organic carbon analyzer,
spectrophotometer, electrophoresis unit, and several physical and chemical unit
processes (activated carbon column, sand filtration apparatus, settling
tank/column) The analytical and process equipment are used in a laboratory
setting to teach students the importance of water/wastewater characterization,
reinforce the theory behind each unit process, and introduce the role of
laboratory treatment studies in design and operation of full-scale physical,
chemical, and biological water/wastewater treatment systems.
