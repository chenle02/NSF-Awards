This three-year award supports ongoing U.S.-U.K. research collaboration in
neutron scattering studies of quantum liquids between Paul Sokol of Pennsylvania
State University and W. G. Stirling of the University of Keele. The objective of
their research is to conduct neutron scattering studies of microscopic statics
and dynamics of quantum liquids and solids in a variety of different
environments. Energy inelastic, quasi-elastic and elastic neutron scattering
techniques will be applied to quantum liquids and solids, particularly liquid
helium. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in high
energy neutron scattering, spallation sources, and numerical simulations of
instrumental resolution. This is complemented by the British investigator's
experience in the measurement of collective excitations and with instruments at
reactor sources. Measurements will be carried out at neutron scattering
facilities in the U.S. and Europe, including the ISIS Spallation Source at
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom and the Institut Laue
Langevin in France.
