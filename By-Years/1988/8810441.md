This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of heterogeneous catalysis. This research program will investigate
the ensemble (site-size) requirements for surface-catalyzed reactions using
adsorbed bismuth atoms as inert, site-blocking agents. The studies will focus on
determining quantitatively the ensemble effects for a number of hydrocarbon
conversion reactions on platinum single-crystal surfaces at system pressures
near one atmosphere and in characterizing the carbonaceous residue. Correlation
of the results of these studies with those from similar studies in ultrahigh
vacuum will assist in developing a fundamental undestanding of the reaction
mechanisms of hydrocarbon conversion reactions that are of importance in the
chemical and petroleum industries and in the development of improved catalysts.
