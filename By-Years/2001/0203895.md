TITLE: Supporting Compiler/Simulator Co-Evolution for Architectural Exploration
and Evaluation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address these issues by
building a system that constructs key optimizer and simulator components from a
common architectural description. Prior work in generating compilers or
simulators using only formal architecture descriptions had not succeeded in
producing systems capable enough for real work. That difficulty will over-come
by not insisting on fully automatic construction. Rather, the project focuses on
making it easier for researcher and engineers to extend and modify key
components using more specific model descriptions and a flexible, extensible
framework. Rather than building components from scratch, makes it easier to
evolve components: incremental architectural changes should require incremental
effort to support. This is a co-evolution approach since one must evolve both
simulators and compilers optimizers simultaneously and consistently.&lt;br/&gt;
