The focus of this research is on the design and synthesis of new N-donor ligands
and metal complexes of varying structure and symmetry to develop new
stereoselective reactions and to study the scope and mechanism of selected
enantioselective processes. Specific reactions to be studied include the
catalytic oxidation of alkenes to allylic benzoates by perbenzoate esters using
copper promoters, catalytic aziridination of alkenes by copper complexes, C-C
bond forming reactions promoted by lanthanide complexes and C-H and C-C bond
activations promoted by rhodium compounds. With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. William B. Tolman of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota. Professor Tolman will
focus his work on testing the efficacy of C3-symmetry in metal promoted
enantioselective chemistry. Successful methodology will have an impact on
synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
