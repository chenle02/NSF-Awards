9416326 Hager This project will assess the application of the fault propagation
fold (FPF) model to understanding potential earthquake hazards. The kinematics
of the FPF model are commonly used to explain the occurrence of earthquakes in
connection with blind thrusts, but the mechanics of the FPF model have received
relatively little study. This study will first determine the geometry and co-
seismic slip of the rupture plane of the Northridge event, then determine
whether slower anelastic deformation is either permitted or required. These
finding will be incorporated into a finite element model to produce an
alternative mechanical model to the FPF. It will be determined if a basal
detachment fault, a prerequisite of the FPF model, is necessary or even capable
of generating large earthquakes. The results of this study will aid
understanding of earthquake mechanics, the geometry of the structures beneath
the Los Angeles basin and San Fernando Valley, and the potential for earthquake
hazards in regions of blind thrusts.
