This project is integrating mechatronics experiments in mechanical engineering
(ME) laboratories and courses. The essence of mechatronics is the application of
complex decisionmaking to the operation of physical systems. Although
mechatronics provides many exciting challenges, it is extremely difficult to
establish as a major or as an option in undergraduate education. This project is
developing an integrated approach for the dissemination of mechatronics
principles across the existing undergraduate curriculum using experiments. The
operation of machines, processes, and systems is being covered with a focused
perspective in specific courses such as freshman design, programming, computer-
aided design (CAD), fluid mechanics, heat transfer, measurements, material
science, and manufacturing. The existing ME laboratories are being enhanced with
new equipment, including a thermal system, fluid control systems, robots, DC
motors, stepper motors, model building kits, and toy trains. All these physical
systems are being controlled by computers through suitable electronic interface,
and are being tested by using general instruments such as an oscilloscope,
function generator, amplifier, power supply, and multimeter. Using this
equipment, several mechatronics experiments are being implemented for fluid,
heat transfer, measurements, CAD, freshman design, control, and mechatronics
laboratories. This project is generating the necessary thrust to modernize ME
courses. *
