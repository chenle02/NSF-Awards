This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in neurobiology
between Marjorie H. Woollacott of the University of Oregon and Christine
Assainte at the Laboratory for Neurobiology and Movement, French National Center
for Scientific Research, Marseilles, France. The investigators propose a study
on the neural mechanisms underlying locomotion in children. In particular they
will focus on the development of balance control mechanisms and its role in the
emergence and refinement of independent walking abilities. The project takes
advantage of separate techniques developed in the U.S. and French laboratories.
