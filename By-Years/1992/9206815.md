This research is to analyze a wealth of data from a successful seismic
expedition to one of the largest, but least understood features of the earth,
the Tibetan Plateau. This large, high and actively seismic area is a result of
the collision of the Indian continent with Eurasia. Eleven broad-band PASSCAL
stations were deployed in the Summer of 1991 for 12 months along a north-south
road across the Tibetan Plateau from Llasa to Golmud. In spite of daunting
logistical and physical difficulties, the PIs', in cooperation with Chinese
scientists, are successfully operating the array and have in the first few
months, begun the production of an historical data set. Several new analysis
techniques including receiver function analysis, surface-wave analysis, and
refraction analysis will be applied to the data which will be available to all
scientists through the IRIS Data Center. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
