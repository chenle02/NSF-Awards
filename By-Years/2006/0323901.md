The P.I. is requesting support to hold a workshop on the astrophysics of
gravitational wave sources at the University of Maryland Conference Center
during the period April 24, 2003 to April 26, 2003. The meeting will focus on
the astrophysics of anticipated gravitational wave sources and the scenarios
that surround them. Invited papers and poster sessions will address theoretical
studies of these sources. The workshop will play an essential role in
stimulating and facilitating the interactions among those in the community doing
gravitational wave research and pushing forward the boundaries of that
science.&lt;br/&gt;
