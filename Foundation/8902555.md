Martin and Steel will work in set theory, and more specifically on inner model
theory and on strong forms of determinacy. Moschovakis will work in the theory
of algorithms and its applications to the foundations of mathematical computer
science. The former is basic to our understanding of the axioms of set theory
underlying all mathematics. The latter has obvious relevance to less
philosophical concerns.
