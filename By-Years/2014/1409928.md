The University of Houston (UH), a large urban Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI)
establishes the Center to ADVANCE UH Faculty. A core strategy will be to "engage
the majority" through an ADVANCE Advocates program that engages senior Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) faculty (both male and female) to
implement collaboratively UH ADVANCE activities aimed at achieving gender equity
in faculty recruitment, retention and advancement. A key innovation is the
formation of an ADVANCE Regional Network (ARN), comprising UH and four other
ADVANCE institutions in Texas (including one Historically Black College and
University and one other HSI). ARN will disseminate information about its
programs and will reach out to other institutions in the region to enhance the
impact of the National Science Foundation funded projects. Results are expected
to be especially helpful to other urban universities, which increasingly serve
as engines of innovation and economic development in urban centers and are at
the forefront of efforts to increase diversity and gender equity in STEM. ARN
will provide a platform through which current ADVANCE Centers in Texas will help
other universities (especially predominantly undergraduate institutions and
minority serving institutions) in their efforts to promote the success of women
STEM faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ADVANCE Center activities will be designed
and implemented through four Strategic Initiatives: 1) Recruitment &amp;
Retention; 2) Professional Engagement, Development &amp; Advancement; 3)
Diversity &amp; Inclusion; and 4) Work-life &amp; Infrastructure. The
theoretical framework for this project is based on the Job Demands-Resources
model. The social science research team will explore the effects of a faculty-
supportive climate at both the individual level and the group level in the
context of the Jobs Demands-Resources Model. The results of this research will
inform future investments at UH and are expected to be useful for other
institutions facing similar challenges related to workforce gender equity.
Through ARN, a partnership for mutual learning and dissemination, members will
hold joint events, develop an ARN postdoctoral researcher network to enable
recruiting among ARN institutions, promote sharing of ADVANCE-related best
practices, provide cross institutional mentoring, and address isolation of solo
and near-solo women faculty via an e-mentoring network. ARN will disseminate
information about its programs and provide a unique platform to reach out to
other institutions in the region. ARN will eventually expand to include
institutions without ADVANCE funding.&lt;br/&gt;
