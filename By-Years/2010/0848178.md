Rudolph Marcus of the California Institute of Technology is supported by an
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop
kinetic models to explain puzzling and unexplained experimental observations
that challenge our understanding of nature. The phenomena under study
include&lt;br/&gt;1) infrared laser-selective chemistry in a large heterogeneous
system; 2) "on-water" reactions in organic/water emulsions; 3) oscillations in
denaturing green fluorescent protein; 4) rapid electron transfer in the deep-
inverted region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has broad relevance to many
important issues facing society such as green chemistry, atmospheric chemistry,
and solar energy conversion. As a Nobel Laureate, Professor Marcus gives
lectures on his research and on other scientific subjects to a wide variety of
audiences.&lt;br/&gt;
