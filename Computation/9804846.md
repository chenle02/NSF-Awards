9804846 Li Sparse polynomial systems occur frequently in a wide variety of
applications in sciences and engineering where the knowledge of all their
isolated solutions is essential. Practical evidence has shown that homotopy
continuation algorithms are efficient, reliable and accurate in finding all the
isolated zeros of polynomial systems. Moreover, the method is inherently
parallel and is therefore a natural candidate for distributed processing
architectures. The proposed research is to be directed along several avenues in
solving polynomial systems by the newly emerged polyhedral homotopies. The
essence of the project is to develop efficient computational algorithms, which
involves a theoretical study of the method, investigation of the stability and
efficiency of the algorithm, and benchmark testing for a wide range of problems.
The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a high-quality software package
that can be used to solve large-scale real world applications on a wide variety
of advanced architectures.
