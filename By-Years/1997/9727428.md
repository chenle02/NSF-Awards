Abstract Proposal #9727428 RUI: Learning and Development Experiences early in
life can have profound effects on both normal and abnormal behavior later in
life. The aim of the project is to develop a model system for studies of the
roles of experience in behavioral development. The system in which these
processes are analyzed is the transition from dependent to independent feeding
in ring doves. The specific ways in which experience with different foods,
parental interaction, and observing other birds influence the development of
this response are studied. Additionally, we are able to investigate the neural
changes that underlie the behavioral development. These studies are leading to
the development of a framework in which the roles of experience in the
development of any behavior can be analyzed. How to get new responses to occur
is an important aspect of many human activities. Parents want to provide
experiences for their children that help them to develop adaptively. Teachers
want their pupils to acquire new repertoires. Therapists try to induce new and
more adaptive behaviors in their clients and businesses may wish to promote
creative problem solving in their employees. Because there are some general
principles about how new behaviors emerge, the results obtained by analyzing
this model system can be applied in a wide range of practical settings.
