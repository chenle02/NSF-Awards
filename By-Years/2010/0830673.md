Computing approximate solutions to NP-hard optimization problems is an idea that
is attractive both in theory and practice. Semidefinite programming (SDP) has
become an indispensable tool in this area. It has led to new and better
algorithms, and recently, thanks in part to the PI's prior work, more
combinatorial algorithms that actually avoid SDP. The connections of SDP to
high-dimensional geometry, metric embeddings, fourier transforms, and
probabilistically checkable proofs are also at the center of some of the
exciting work in theoretical computer science in recent
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will work on ideas to (a) apply SDP to
design new approximation algorithms for a host of problems, such as graph
coloring, metric traveling salesman, graph partitioning, vertex cover; (b) use
insights from SDP to design efficient combinatorial algorithms; (c) apply SDP
insights (and a ``constructive'' version of SDP duality discovered recently by
the PI and his student) to new settings such as decoding error-correcting codes,
compressed sensing, and analysing network algorithms and swarm algorithms; (d)
explore connections between SDPs, high-dimensional geometry, fourier transforms,
and probabilistically checkable proofs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SDP-inspired
primal-dual approaches are an important new extension of traditional approaches
based upon linear-programming duality, and developing their uses promises to
have transformative impact. Development of new approximation algorithms for
central problems like graph partitioning and metric TSP may also transform the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this project new courses will be designed at
the undergraduate and graduate level to teach these new ideas in an accessible
way.&lt;br/&gt;
