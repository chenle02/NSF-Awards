This award will provide partial support for the International Symposium on
Equatorial Aeronomy (ISEA) which will provide opportunities for the
establishment of new international scientific collaborations and for
facilitating coordinated long term data collection in the African sector. The
travel support will provide opportunities for young scientists and graduate
students from the US to interact with established and emerging scientists on the
international stage. The ISEA conference is held approximately every three to
four years and brings together international researchers to advance the
understanding of the ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) coupling which
impacts space weather, navigation, and communication systems. The location at
Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, will facilitate future efforts in data collection in the
African sector by engaging local scientists. This will address the longitudinal
and hemispheric dependence of equatorial ionospheric effects and space weather.
This award will be jointly funded by the NSF Aeronomy Program and the Office of
International Science and Engineering.
