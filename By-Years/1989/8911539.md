In this research, Dr. Coleman is analyzing the social organization of research
in a Japanese laboratory in the life sciences. In addition to yielding a
detailed description of everyday laboratory life, this study will devote
particular attention to the reward structure and patterns of authority,
cooperation and conflict among laboratory researchers, administration, and
support staff. Japanese researchers appear to work in a context of lower
interorganizational competition and mobility than do their American
counterparts; specific features of Japanese culture and society, among them the
country's educational system, funding sources, and managerial styles, may all
have an effect on these differences, which in turn influence creativity and the
capacity for interdisciplinary cooperation. The results of this research should
shed light on sociocultural influences on research approaches, and identify
those aspects of collaborative research between Japanese and Americans that
require special attention in order to maximize the benefits of the joint
research experience.
