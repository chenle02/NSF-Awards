The proposed research will extend the program initiated by the PI in recent
work, namely (a) to study topological and enumerative properties of CW
subcomplexes of highly symmetric polytopes, (b) to understand the relationships
between these polytopal subcomplexes and other objects with similar topological
and enumerative properties, and (c) to understand the induced actions of the
symmetry groups of the whole polytope on the homology groups of the subcomplex.
The methods used to solve these problems include techniques from combinatorial
topology, enumerative combinatorics and representation theory of finite groups.
The software packages GAP and Kenzo will be used to assist in the formulation of
conjectures and the checking of results.

It has been known since antiquity that there are five regular convex polyhedra:
the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.
Each polyhedron has the property that all of its faces are of the same type:
squares in the case of the cube, pentagons in the case of the dodecahedron and
triangles in the other cases. There are other examples of highly symmetric
polyhedra in which there are two or more types of faces. A familiar example is a
soccer ball, which has 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces. The proposed
research considers higher dimensional symmetric polyhedra (called ``polytopes'')
with more than one type of face, and studies how the topology of these objects
changes when faces of a certain type are removed (to form a ``polytopal
subcomplex''). In the soccer ball example, one obtains 12 disconnected patches
if the hexagonal faces are removed, and a two-dimensional surface with 12 two-
dimensional holes if the pentagonal faces are removed. After the faces are
removed, the object retains all its original symmetry. The proposed research
will also consider homology representations, which describe the relationship
between the symmetries of the object and the resulting holes.
