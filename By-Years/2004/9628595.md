*** 9628595 Andrew G. Bruce This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project has the ultimate objective of developing an object-oriented software
toolkit for wavelet based nonparametric prediction. The current theory and
practice of nonparametric estimation with wavelets is limited to a small set of
prediction problems. Statistical prediction or function estimation is of
fundamental importance, with applications to a broad range of problems. In the
overwhelming majority of situations, non-parametric prediction methods are the
most appropriate. Based on the wavelet transform, Donoho and Johnstone have
developed a powerful methodology, called "WaveShrink", for nonparametric
function estimation. WaveShrink has a very broad asymptotic near-optimality
property and has proven valuable in practice. The project will address itself to
fundamental advancements that are needed to develop new wavelet methodology
encompassing a much broader set of prediction problems. The new and existing
methodology will be collected into a coherent object-oriented software toolkit.
This toolkit will be of use to a broad range of statisticians, data analysts,
scientists, and engineers. The research will lead to a completely new version of
the S-Plus software module S+Wavelets. Other commercial opportunities include
consulting and teaching, a Mathcad function pack and electronic book, software
licensing and patenting innovative algorithms. ***
