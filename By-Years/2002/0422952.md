This proposal asks for support for 12 graduate students and recent PhDs in
mathematics to attend the International Workshop in Operator Theory and
Applications in Newcastle, England. The workshop has an impressive list of
principal speakers, representing a broad spectrum of areas within the
discipline. This would be a valuable experience for a new
mathematician.&lt;br/&gt;
