This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will study mechanisms of electrochemically-initiated organic
chemical reactions. A novel portion of the work will seek to adjust the nature
of reaction products by exciting reagents near the electrodes with ultraviolet
light. In addition, some measurements of atomic-scale structure will be made
using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. %%% This research, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study
several topics in organic electrochemistry. Series of compounds will be
investigated so that the transition from SN1 to SN2 mechanisms as structure
varies can be predicted. In turn, this will allow prediction of
stereoselectivity in electrochemically-generated organic species. Photochemical
excitation prior to electrochemistry will be investigated as a means of varying
product makeup. Finally, adsorption on electrodes will be studied with Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy, as a means to independently characterize adsorption on
electrode surfaces.
