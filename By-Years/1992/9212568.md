The fact that the United States has been surprised by the force of nationalism
in destroying countries such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia shows that our
assumptions and theories about nationalism and ethnicism have serious flaws. The
countries of the former Soviet Union remain ethnically very divided and the
conseqences of these divisions are only recently being appreciated. In this
research investigation, a leading comparative politics area specialist and a
leading theorist on nationalism are jointly examining the most complex and least
understood of the ethnic issues - - language use and assimilation - - in six of
the new countries of the former Soviet Union. Using both sociological and
anthropological methods, the investigation not only aims at contributing to our
understanding of this crucial area of the world, but also to the improvement of
our theories of language use and assimilation and the general factors that
determine whether language politics does or does not lead to conflict. Given the
total lack of correspondence between country boundaries and ethnic boundaries in
the Third World, this is a central question for our understanding of politics
and democratization in the former Soviet Union.
