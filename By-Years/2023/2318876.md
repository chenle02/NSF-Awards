This award supports the participation of graduate students and early-career
researchers in the fourth Midwest Machine Learning Symposium (MMLS), to be held
in Chicago, Illinois, from May 16-17, 2023. The main objective of MMLS is to
convene regional machine learning researchers for stimulating discussions and
debates, to foster cross-institutional collaboration, and to showcase the
collective talent of machine learning researchers at all career stages. The
symposium will continue to enhance the visibility of machine learning research
at Midwestern institutions. Furthermore, the focus on junior researchers, both
at the student and junior faculty level, aid in the educational and professional
development of this demographic group.

The format of the conference includes multiple plenary talks, invited sessions,
contributed posters (with student poster awards), and panel discussions. The
organizers strive to maintain a good balance of demographic and geographic
diversity among invited speakers and co-organizers, and will also widely
advertise the symposium to encourage diversity among participants. The website
with details about the symposium is http://midwest-ml.org/2023/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
