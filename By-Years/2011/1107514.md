The joint National Cancer Institute (NCI)/NSF workshop on A Cyberinfrastructure
Platform for Collaborative Research and Application in Public Health and Health
Services: A Seeded Cloud Approach, to be held on January 10-11, 2011 at the San
Diego Supercomputer Center, UC San Diego, is aimed at setting the stage for a
sustained research effort encompassing the theme of public health and health
services, which will cut across technical and socio-behavioral boundaries. The
NIH/NCI component of this effort provides the motivating applications and use
cases, while the NSF component provides the access to the cyberinfrastructure,
computer science, and social and behavioral science research and education
communities. The workshop discussions will be driven by use cases drawn from a
broad set of areas including, Emergency Medical Services; Personal and Mobile
Applications; Behavior and Environment; Cancer; and, Social Networking and
Communication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the symposium are expected
to provide input into technical and socio-behavioral parameters for developing a
collaborative platform for research and application. In addition, an important
goal of the workshop will be to concretize the ideas and concepts into a
regional platform, e.g. for the California region, and to initiate a seeded
cloud to enable research on public health and health services topics in that
region. The workshop will identify a broad set of research needs and
opportunities that must be addressed to advance cyberinfrastructure for
healthcare services; population health; and, computer and information systems.
