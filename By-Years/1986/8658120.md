The Principal Investigator will undertake research under this Presidential Young
Investigator award directed at improving understanding of the general
circulation of the ocean. This research will focus on the role of instabilities
in ocean currents and their impact on production of mesoscale eddies in the
ocean. The approach will be based on numerical calculations to extend stability
analysis to strongly non-linear regimes. The immediate objective is to
understand the effect of radiation from an initially localized source on
evolution of flow to a statistically steady, non-linear state.
