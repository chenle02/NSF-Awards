Plant cell cultures are a potential source of important secondary metabolites
such as medicinals. Currently, low productivities have impeded the
commercialization of a broad range of target compounds. The compound targeted by
this proposal is taxol, an exceptionally promising anti-cancer agent for ovarian
cancer. Taxol is currently extracted from the bark of a threatened plant
species, is too complex for chemical synthesis, and is currently in very short
supply. Taxol is produced in tissue cultures, but a ten to hundred fold
improvement in productivity is required for commercial feasibility. The proposed
research may lead to a commercial process for the production of taxol by plant
tissue culture.
