"This award is funded under the American Recoveryy and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to
study chemically synthesized ZnO nanowires for potential application in high
performance light emitting diode applications. The comprehensive research
proposal combines expertise in material synthesis, advanced optical
characterization of semiconductor materials, and device design and fabrication
capabilities to develop fundamental understanding of the light emission
mechanisms in ZnO nanostructures, which will be applied to the realization of
light emitting diodes with high luminous efficacy and luminous
flux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal stems from
its strong interdisciplinary nature. The research activities will encompass (1)
a cost-effective chemical synthesis approach to ZnO nanostructures with great
control on the doping properties, targeted towards the realization of single
nanowire p-n junction devices, (2) a detailed study of the dynamics and light
emitting characteristics of the carriers in these doped ZnO nanostructures using
spectroscopic and time-resolved optical techniques, and (3) the application of
the knowledge developed in the carrier dynamics and synthesis techniques to
design and fabricate LED structures. A successful completion of this research
program will develop substantial new knowledge in the light emission mechanisms
in ZnO nanostructures, with transformative impact on display and solid-state
lighting applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program
have technical and educational aspect. Thorough understanding of luminescent
properties of nanostructured semiconductors like ZnO will open up new
possibilities for photonic devices based on impurity-assisted carrier dynamics.
Creation of undergraduate course module that combines the chemical synthesis and
photonic device will be a unique attempt at Duke University.
