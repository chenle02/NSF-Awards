This award will support the purchase of a computer workstation for the
investigator, so that he may extend the complexity as well as the length of his
studies. The investigator will study processes of population change and
ecological patterns via computer simulations. The simulations are produced by
machine code algorithms. In the process of these studies, the investigator will
also be investigating means of developing (evolving) software for massively
parallel machines.
