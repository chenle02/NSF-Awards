With the growth in concerns about the potential societal impacts of global
environmental changes such as greenhouse warming, most efforts have concentrated
on climate monitoring and modeling. To date, there have been but limited efforts
to improve our understanding of the economic and social impacts of the
greenhouse effect. This project continues collaborative work designed to improve
understanding of both substantive and methodological developments concerning the
economic and social impacts of global change. It involves a substantive research
program to study the impacts of global climate change and an annual conference
to review ongoing research in the social sciences on the impacts of global
environmental change. The specific research will continue studies of the impacts
in two areas: (1) the collection of a data base for the United States that
combines climatic and economic data, particularly agricultural data, on a county
level; and (2) use of the county climate and economic data base to estimate the
impact of climate and climate change on economic activity.
