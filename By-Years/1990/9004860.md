This laboratory uses an unusual in vivo ultrastructural approach, the "Miller
chromatin spreading technique," to visualize transcriptionally active genes in
the electron microscope and to analyze the co-transcriptional RNA processing
events on nascent pre-mRNA transcripts, including ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
formation, splice site selection, constitutive splicing, and alternative
splicing. In order to extend observations from the level of ultrastructural
phenomenology to biochemical identification of specific proteins, there is a
need to be able to identify the proteins at specific sites on the transcripts
and in specific structures. The technique of immuno-electron microscopy would
allow this analysis, but has not yet been perfected for use on Miller chromatin
spreads. The proposed project will take a systematic and logical approach to the
development of such a technique. Some of the desired monoclonal antibodies are
already in hand, which will be used in conjunction with colloidal gold markers
for EM visualization.Immediate applications of such a technique include
localization on nascent RNA of specific snRNPs, specific hnRNP proteins, general
splicing factors, and proteins implicated in splicing regulation. The technique
would be more generally useful, however, and could be used to localize proteins
involved in chromatin structure, replication, transcription regulation,
attenuation, and polyadenylation to specific sites or structures on the genetic
material. The development of this technique would thus make possible a deeper
understanding of how proteins interact with DNA and RNA to effect and regulate
gene expression.
