This project aims to synthesize new classes of materials with novel
compositions, architectures and properties at pressures readily attainable for
commercial applications. These new classes of materials will include discovering
nanoporous phosphates using hydrothermal techniques, and understanding the
atomic structure of the solvents as well as their effect on structures formed
using synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering techniques. Various stages of the
synthesis will be studied using time resolved techniques. This project bridges
synthetic chemistry and high-pressure research, a burgeoning field in condensed
matter research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new class
of materials could find applications as ion exchangers and catalysts, both areas
of high interest to industry. The graduate students will explore the atomic
structures of novel materials, their properties, and their mechanisms of
formation using state of the art synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering
techniques, including time resolved work to follow the stages of synthesis with
unprecedented precision. Students trained in these areas will be highly
competitive in the job market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
