The study of the diffusion of molecular and atomic species on metal surfaces is
the subject of this research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. A field emission fluctuation technique will be used to study
in detail the diffusion of hydrogen, deuterium, carbon monoxide and oxygen on
various planes of platinum, iridium, and rhodium. Digital data acquisition and
analysis methods will be perfected and utilized in these studies, which build on
previous investigations of diffusion on refractory metal field emission tips.
Simulation studies of these diffusion systems will also be carried out,
providing a more complete mechanistic understanding of the diffusion process.
%%% A detailed understanding of diffusion on solid surfaces is crucial to an
understanding of such important technological processes as catalysis and thin
film growth. Obtaining detailed experimental information about diffusion is very
difficult, however. The goal of this research project is to continue to develop
and apply a unique method for obtaining this information on several very well
characterized solid surface diffusion systems. This work will enhance our
understanding of the basic physical processes of surface diffusion.
