This award provides funds to equip a new shock-wave research facility to be
installed in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of
Chicago. Equipment covered by this award includes high-speed digital counters,
pulse generators, high-speed streak camera, pulsed xenon strobe, and an
oscilloscope. The facility will be used in studies of the physical properties of
crystalline and amorphous silicate materials under the pressure and temperature
range of the Earth's mantle. In particular, the first application will be to
determine the systematic dependence of the equation of state of silicate liquids
on their chemical composition. Such data are crucial to an understanding of the
buoyancy of melts in the deep interior and the differentiation of the Earth via
magmatic processes during its history.
