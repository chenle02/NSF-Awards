The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss the recent
findings and current thinking in various areas of science. Although
participation is limited, the attendees usually consists of established
scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these
research areas and postdoctoral fellows. The meetings are held at schools in
small isolated New England towns away from other distractions, in and atmosphere
conducive to the exchange of ideas. These conferences have a recognized value
for presenting the latest advances in research and also indicating the future
trends which are likely to be most productive.
