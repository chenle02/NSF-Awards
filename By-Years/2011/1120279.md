The relationships among living species can provide valuable information on how
evolution has proceeded, but interpretations must carefully account for
extinction and shared history within the group. This project will develop
mathematical models that incorporate interactions between speciation,
extinction, and changes in the traits of species. These models will be
implemented in software and applied to the evolution of geographic ranges and
plant mating systems, using empirical data from extant species. They will enable
tests of fundamental macroevolutionary questions such as: How is trait evolution
partitioned between changes within single lineages versus changes during
speciation? How are rates of speciation and extinction determined by diversity,
or by the joint effects of many interacting traits?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
theoretical advances from this project are useful not only for its immediate
study systems (including the nightshade family Solanaceae, which contains such
agriculturally important species as potato, tomato, and tobacco), but also for
applications to similar questions in many other plant and animal groups.
Developing these more powerful analyses, and training young researchers in
computational evolution, will help maximize the scientific gains from ongoing
efforts to assemble the tree of life. The software developed will be freely
available and well-supported, facilitating further empirical analyses and
consequent collaborations.
