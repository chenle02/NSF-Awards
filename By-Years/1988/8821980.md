The National Science Foundation has supported the annual Cliometrics Conferences
as well as the First World Congress of Cliometrics in recent years. The meetings
continue to serve as an important means for encouraging research in economic
history and as a forum for disseminating new methods and findings among
historians as well as economists at home and abroad. The Second World Congress
will bring together 75-100 scholars from around the world to discuss and compare
both basic cliometric tools and their current research results. This proposal
asks support for some administrative costs and partial travel of some, but not
all, United States participants at the Second World Congress of Cliometrics, to
be held in Madrid, Spain, in June 1989.
