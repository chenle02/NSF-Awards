*** 9760258 Spitzer This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
investigate properties of giant magnetoresistance,(GMR) at nanoscale feature
sizes. Miniaturization of GMR films is expected to lead to improved
characteristics, such as faster switching times. A number of investigators have
found GMR values to increase with miniaturiztion, but with an attendant increase
in their coercivity, i.e., the required switching field. The proposer has
developed GMR films with ultralow coercivities, an order of magnitude lower than
previously attained. Because of their structure, these films are expected to
exhibit the increase in GMR values reported by others upon miniaturization,
while maintaining low coercivity. A variety of GMR films with different design
parameters will be fabricated and tested at 100 nm feature size. These films wil
be used to design integrated solid -state devices that use no semiconductors,
such as e GMR-based electronic components. The characteristics of these devices
will be stimulated. Their performance-is expected to show improvement with
miniaturization. OMR films form the foundation for various integrated devices
without semiconductors. The potential applications of such devices include
nonvolatile memory and storage, as well as general-purpose all-metal
electronics, with billion-dollar markets. ***
