9602572 Dodds Dr. Walter Dodds, Division of Biology, Kansas State University,
and Dr. Barry Biggs, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research
(NIWA), Christchurch, New Zealand will conduct collaborative research in New
Zealand on the metabolism of stream algae. Mixed assemblages of microorganisms
(biofilms or periphyton) coat surfaces in streams and rivers. These assemblages
are generally the main energy source for higher trophic levels in unshaded
temperate region streams. In stable-flowing, enriched streams periphyton can
proliferate causing water management problems. Dr. Barry Biggs and his co-
workers have characterized extensively the periphyton communities and associated
land use practices in a large number of the highly diverse streams and rivers in
New Zealand and have established the best empirical model of factors controlling
periphyton biomass and composition from any area in the world. New Zealand
provides an outstanding natural laboratory because heterogeneity of geological,
climatic and human use is extreme and occurs over very small spatial scales (a
few 100 km) relative to typical continental areas. Dr. Dodds will link the
unique data of his counterpart to small scale metabolic measurements made with
flow, light and O2 microprobes and use this information to create a predictive
mechanistic model of stream biofilm metabolism for the different community
types. This model will provide a basis for more general models of stream
ecosystem function. Such models are needed to assess responses of stream water
quality and ecosystem function to human disturbance.
