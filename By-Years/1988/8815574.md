This research is aimed at the development of a model of high energy hadronic
collisions which provides a picture of its complete space-time structure. It is
applied to relativistic heavy ion collisions and solved by computer simulations.
A second part of this research program is the development of a new method for
solving the quantum Liouville equation by computer simulation of a generalized
stochastic process. Its most important application will be to the understanding
of non- equilibrium many body systems.
