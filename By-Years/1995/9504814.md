EAR-9504814 Clark, Jordan F. The Fellow proposes to investigate the variability
of vertical mixing and quantify the amount of exchange between the surface and
deep layers of two lakes. The goal is to identify the dominant sources of
vertical mixing and the temporal and spatial time scales of these events.
Vertical mixing is known to influence lake biology and chemistry with a time
scale of minutes to days. The mechanism, spatial distribution of mixing, and the
amount of exchange between the surface and deep layers are more difficult to
quantify, yet are equally important in understanding lake dynamics. These
factors will be assessed by first establishing the physical setting (solar
radiation, wind speed, air and surface water temperatures, humidity, and water
column temperature gradients) and then introducing a gaseous tracer (sulfur
hexafluoride) to quantify exchange between surface and deep water layers.
