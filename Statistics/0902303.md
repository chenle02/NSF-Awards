A conference on the current statistical issues that involve large and complex
data will be held at the Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, on
March 13th and 14th, 2009. The conference will focus on nonparametric and
semiparametric methods, methods to analyze functional data, measurement error
and inverse problems, and statistical application in biology, genetics and
population sciences. The conference will provide statisticians and scientists a
venue for stimulating interdisciplinary interactions. It will address emerging
statistical issues and help shape future directions of methodological research
on complex data. Funds from NSF will be primarily used to defray the travel
costs of young researchers and graduate students.

The purpose of this conference is to bring together top and junior researchers
to define and expand the research frontiers of methodological research on
complex data. The workshop provides a focal venue for top and junior researchers
to gather, interact and present their new research findings, to discuss and
outline emerging problems in their fields, and to lay the groundwork for
fruitful future collaborations. Moreover, it will provide an overview for
graduate students who are interested in seeking for an interesting area to work.
The workshop focuses on several topics crucial in modeling and analyzing complex
data. It will be very helpful for advancing statistical research that addresses
problems of high societal impact.
