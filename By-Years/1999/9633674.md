9633674 Najafi The National Science Foundation in the 1980's made the first
award in the MEMS area to 'seed' the research of this interdisciplinary
technology. The Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Workshop provides
opportunities for students and faculty to meet and explore the frontiers of
research in this exciting field. The size of the Workshop provides and intimate
forum for researchers to discuss the latest advancements in the field and expose
the students to a highly imaginative field. The US currently enjoys a lead in
the MEMS technology development and there is considerable potential for
commercialization of MEMS devices and circuits. For example, the 'airbags' and
'seatbelts' in automotive vehicles use MEMS accelerometers and there are many
applications of piezoresistive pressure sensors. The request for graduate
student funding will clearly help expose students to this exciting field and
benefit in their own research. ***
