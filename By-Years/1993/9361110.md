9361110 Sherman In this Phase I program, Ultramet proposes to investigate an
innovative new class of materials which should provide dramatically increased
strength, modulus, and wear resistance while maintaining mechanical properties
to high temperature. The proposed concept utilizes ceramic foams, fabricated by
chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as high-strength interconnected three-
dimensional continuos reinforcements for metal matrix composites consisting of
interpenetrating, continuous metal and ceramic phases, taking full advantage of
the desirable properties of each phase while eliminating the inherent drawbacks
of each phase, such as low temperature brittleness in ceramics and high
temperature creep and wear in metals. The proposed investigation covers the
modeling, fabrication, characterization, and testing of ceramic foam-reinforced
aluminum-based metal matrices and provides the groundwork for further
investigation and development. The effect of material compositions,
reinforcement structure and volume fraction, and processing (melt infiltration)
conditions on the microstructure and flexure, tensile, and processing (melt
infiltration) conditions on the microstructure and flexure, tensile, and impact
properties of these unique composites will be investigated. Limited design
information, such as physical properties, mechanical properties (strength and
modulus), and thermal fatigue and thermal shock resistance, will be generated as
well.
