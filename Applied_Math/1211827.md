A large conceptual gap separates the theory of low-dimensional chaotic dynamics
from the infinite-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of turbulence. Advances in
experimental imaging, computational methods, and dynamical systems theory
suggest a way to bridge this gap and make a fundamental breakthrough in our
understanding of turbulence. It has recently been discovered that recurrent
coherent structures observed in wall-bounded shear flows (such as pipes and
boundary layers) result from close passes to weakly unstable invariant solutions
of the Navier-Stokes equations. These 3D, fully nonlinear solutions (equilibria,
traveling waves, and periodic orbits) structure the state space of turbulent
flows and provide a skeleton for analyzing their dynamics. The investigator
calculates a hierarchy of invariant solutions for a canonical wall-bounded shear
flow and uses these solutions to develop a geometrical and quantitative
description of the flow's turbulent dynamics. He uses a combination of novel and
proven numerical and analytical techniques, such as periodic orbit theory, group
representation theory, nonlinear search methods, variational solvers, and
computational fluid dynamics. The project is conducted with collaborators in
Japan, Germany, the UK, and the US, and all results and numerical software are
disseminated through the investigator's collaborative e-book www.ChaosBook.org.

Turbulence is not only the great unsolved fundamental problem of classical
physics, but a problem of great practical importance for technology and
engineering, where turbulence is exhibited by cardiac systems, electromagnetic
plasmas, oceans, and the atmosphere. A mathematical description of turbulent
phenomena is of necessity high-dimensional, and accurate prediction requires
solving millions of equations. Modern advances in computation and experimental
data analysis have brought such computations within reach. Even more recent is
the discovery of "recurrent coherent structures," whorls that one observes over
and over in structures such as clouds. Such structures enable us to classify
types of turbulent states in a mathematically precise manner and to predict
their evolution without resorting to further large-scale computations. The
project aims to deploy these "coherent structures" as a platform from which to
chart the extremely high-dimensional world of all possible turbulent states,
create an atlas over the important ones, and give a detailed predictive (as
opposed to statistical) description of turbulent motions. Any progress in
fundamental understanding of turbulence affects applications that range from the
suppression of plasma instabilities in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, to
weather prediction, to the key challenge of reducing turbulent drag. Even an
incremental reduction of, for instance, turbulent drag by insights so achieved
might have a significant economic impact, because drag is responsible for a
significant part of the fuel consumed in transportation.
