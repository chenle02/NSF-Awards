This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will create an
innovation ecosystem between/among public-private partners to provide weather
warning systems, technologies, and processes. Assessing the guidelines for
optimal scale of rainfall-runoff and employing high resolution analyses of the
current state of the atmosphere will enable pinpointing areas where storm
development will occur. Additionally, social science methods will evaluate human
response to flood warnings with recommended warning strategies.

Weather has significant societal impacts. 3.4% or $485 billion of the 2008 U.S.
gross domestic product is sensitive to weather variability, and the extreme
weather of 2011 resulted in at least 922 deaths and more than $70 billion in
total economic losses. This will be one of the first deployments of X-band
radars for flood warning in the U.S. These activities will result in the
creation of new knowledge in the fields of flash flood warning, storm
initiation, and urban-scale decision-making.
