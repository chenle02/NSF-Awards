As commercial and government institutions adopt new technologies and regulatory
instruments, the algorithms for auditing and accounting have become increasingly
complex. This workshop project explores the ways in which these algorithms are
being meaningfully transformed through human interaction with new technologies.
The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of
which will benefit those working to develop more effective auditing and
accounting practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hugh Gusterson of the George
Washington University will organize a workshop to explore "roboprocesses", the
highly scripted social algorithms that mediate Americans' relationships with
commercial and government institutions. Bringing together fifteen
anthropologists from a range of subdisciplinary approaches, the workshop would
explore how different auditing and accounting practices become routinized and
regimented through in a range of contexts: standardized public school testing,
health care software, credit and financial evaluation, national security
algorithms and homeland security, criminal sentencing and deportation protocols,
the promulgation of statistical indices by international aid agencies, and the
automated standardization of the American agricultural system. The project will
advance scientific understandings of accounting, bureaucracy, and audit culture.
