The project addresses an important, and somewhat neglected so far, topic in
robotics - long reach robots. Cable-based robotic devices will be explored,
covering questions of configuration design, trajectory planning, feedback
control, fine motion control, and metrics for intelligent design. Experimental
validation will be performed on an eight degrees-of-freedom cable robot built in
the PI's laboratory. The PI has adequate access to outside resources critical
for the project.
