The faculty of the Computer Science Department of The University of Texas at El
Paso will develop a five-year plan for participation in the NSF CISE
Institutional Infrastructure Program for minority institutions. The Computer
Science Department serves a primarily Hispanic minority undergraduate
population. Although they presently provide a sound, basic education in computer
science, they intend to implement a plan to further improve the quality of the
education provided at UTEP and to encourage students to pursue their education
through the master's degree level. The faculty of the Computer Science
Department are highly active researchers and have received national recognition
for their work. This is particularly true in the area of non-monotonic
reasoning, a topic which is rapidly becoming one of the most important and far-
reaching in computer science. They intend to develop a plan to extend their
theoretical work in this area, to implement the algorithms being developed, and
to apply these results to a wide range of problems in computer science.
