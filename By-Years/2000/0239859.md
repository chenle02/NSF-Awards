This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes to
develop an innovative solution to the the problem of chlorinated solvent
contamination in variably saturated, low permeability soils. Prior Phase I work
has demonstrated that: 1) chitin is an effective electron donor for stimulating
biodegradation of chlorinated solvents, 2) that chitin enhances bioavailability
of the solvents, 3) that chitin can be incorporated into a proprietary hydraulic
fracturing process for low permeability soils, and 4) that the delivery method
for chitin is effective in the field on a small scale. The objectives of the
Phase II Project are to evaluate biodegradation efficiency and longevity of
chitin on a large scale. Current approaches for low permeability soils are very
capital-intensive and are seldom totally effective. The proposed approach, in
contrast, is low-cost and passive, and applicable "in situ". The method is
particularly attractive since chitin is available in abundance as a byproduct
from the shellfish industry.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of soil
bioremediation.
