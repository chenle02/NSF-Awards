This is an observational project devoted to measuring the parallaxes of nearby
low-mass stars in the Upper Sco and Chamaeleon I clusters. Low-mass stars, such
as M0-M3 spectral types, are the focus because of their importance to stellar
evolution and planet formation models, and because very few accurate distances
are known for these spectral types, due to not being included in the Hipparcos
mission and other surveys (due to being too faint for previous studies). The PI
has obtained most of the necessary data and will use the CAPSCam at Las Campanas
Observatory to get the rest of the observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts include training and mentoring a postdoctoral researcher, and
undergraduate students participating in the Carnegie Summer Scholars program.
