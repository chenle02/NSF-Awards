Pato 9727991 The bacterial virus Mu, by virtue of its being both a virus and a
transposon, is unusual among transposons in its large size and its high
frequency of transposition. Amplification of the 37.2 kb Mu DNA during the lytic
cycle occurs by a series of replicative transposition events which take place
within the bacterial nucleoid, despite the constraints imposed by the complex
structure of that body. Concerns about potential problems with synapsing the
ends of prophage DNA within the nucleoid, an early step in the transposition
process, led to studies which uncovered a strong gyrase binding site (SGS) in
the center of the Mu genome that is required for efficient replication. An
extensive search was undertaken to find chromosomal or plasmid sites which could
replace the SGS in Mu replication. No other sites have been found, focusing
attention on what is unusual about the SGS. This project focuses on two
important questions raised by the model: 1) How does the Mu site promote
synapsis of the Mu prophage ends and 2) Why is a novel mechanism required for
promoting the synapsis? The first question will be addressed by determining what
is special or unique about the Mu site. A detailed genetic and biochemical
analysis of the SGS and of other strong gyrase binding sites is being performed
with the goal of defining the elements of the SGS that are responsible for its
ability to function in Mu DNA replication. The second question is being
addressed by exploring the factors, such as the binding of transposase molecules
to the ends of a Mu prophage, that are responsible for the long delay in Mu
replication in the absence of the SGS. These studies are designed to provide
insights into the mechanism of viral DNA replication and the importance of DNA
structure in biological function. Of particular interest is the role of DNA
topology in the modulation of function.
