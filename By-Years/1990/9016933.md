Partial support for travel of domestic and foreign research scientists with
expertise in different aspects of the pyrroles present in photosynthetic
organisms is requested. Attendance of these scientists at an interdisciplinary
meeting dedicated to reporting the latest research accomplishments in this
important area of photosynthesis will lead to enhancement of our understanding
of pyrrole function in the photosynthetic process. The harvesting of radiant
(light) energy and its conversion to chemical forms in the form of plant and
bacterial biomass is the primary and fundamentally important way by which energy
for support of life processes on this planet occurs. Pyrroles are key chemical
components of the biological apparatus that brings about this conversion of
radiant energy to that in chemical bonds. The formation and function of these
important chemicals is the focus of this meeting experts dedicated to such
studies.//
