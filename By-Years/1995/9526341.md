9521609 Chow In the previous project, the Principal Investigator has
demonstrated the potential of artificial neural networks to learn the
complicated motor fault detection mappings for a single-phase induction motor
under constant load conditions. However, there are many uncertainty factors in
the motor operations that can significantly affect the motor incipient fault
detection process and which have not been addressed. In this proposed project,
the Principal Investigators propose to extend the research to cover more
realistic operating environments. The PIs will investigate different factors
such as varying load conditions, saturation effects, temperature effects, noise
effects, and their influences on the process of motor incipient fault detection
for three-phase induction motors. In addition, the PIs will investigate and
establish a general theory and principle for motor incipient fault detection
using a set theoretic formulation. After setting up the problem in set theoretic
formulation, the challenges will lie in the finding of the correct mappings from
the appropriate measurements to the estimation of the actual motor faults and
their severity. The PIs will investigate and demonstrate the advantages and
feasibility of the use of neural network and fuzzy logic technologies to obtain
the motor fault mapping from appropriate information to yield accurate motor
incipient fault detection in an non-invasive, economical, and reliably manner,
along with the ability to provide a qualitative and heuristic explanation of the
fault detection process. ***
