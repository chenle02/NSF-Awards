Drs. Swart and Brass will evaluate the record of discharge fromthe Orinoco
River encoded in certain corals of the SE Caribbean. They will collect coral
heads by SCUBA and with slab samplesanalyze growth bands for fluore scence and
oxygen isotopiccomposition. Records spanning the last 30 to 40 years from
aprofile of corals growing in 1 to &gt;10 m water depth off Tobagowill provide
the "proximal" discharge history nearest the mouthof the Orinoco. Surface-
dwelling corals from other locations asdistant as Puerto Rico will provide
records of the temporal andgeographic extent of any low-salinity cap across the
SE Caribbeanthroughout this same 30-to40-yrs period. Once determined, theOrinoco
discharge record will be compared to the Quelccaya icecore record from the Andes
and to El Nino patterns to assess howthe river record is affected by regional
climatic variations.
