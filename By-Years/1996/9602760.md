Rowan College of New Jersey is one of nine institutions that consist of the
State College system, serving a majority of students from the southern region of
the State. This award from the National Science Foundation will be use for
infrastructure improvements to Bosshart Hall, the science building at Rowan.
Erected in 1961, the facility is home to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry
and Physics. However, existing conditions, including dispersed research and
training space throughout the building, severely impacts research programs by
limiting the time assigned to conduct experiments. Combined with increased usage
due to the growth in scholarship and enrollments, Bosshart Hall cannot support
research activities. This project will improve the environment by consolidating
research and training activities in dedicated laboratories. Renovations will
include: redesigning lab spaces for more flexibility, modifying the plumbing
system to accommodate required equipment, installing new workbenches, cabinets,
and fume hoods, and providing gas and vacuum services. As a result of the
infrastructure modifications, a total of eight laboratories will be established:
three labs for biology (microbiology, tissue cell and histology), three labs for
chemistry (organic and inorganic, synthesis, polymers, and two labs for physics
(lasers, superconductivity and magnetic properties) respectively. The increased
functioning of these areas will permit investigators to concentrate on research
that will enlarge both faculty and student productivity. With renovated
facilities, the science departments which currently have a large representation
of students who traditionally have not participated in the sciences, will be
able to provide additional training opportunities for students.
