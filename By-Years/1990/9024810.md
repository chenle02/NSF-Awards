Five senior researchers will survey the fauna of selected arthropods in two of
the most unique and critically threatened habitats in the midsouth Coastal Plain
- the Black Belt Prairie and the Loess Hills in Mississippi. The survey will
involve intensive collections of arthropods from these habitats during June,
1991- May, 1992. Remaining remnants of the Black Belt Prairie are being lost by
erosion, plant succession, and conversion to pastureland, and some sites have
been proposed for placement of a hazardous waste disposal facility. The Loess
Hills are imminently threatened by harvest of hardwood timber. Mites, spiders,
moths, bees, and selected beetles and flies will be collected with various traps
and specialized methods. Specimens will be processed and studied by senior
researchers and collaborators at institutions throughout the United States.
Specimen data, including taxonomic names, localities, and recorded results will
be entered into a computerized database. Survey results will be used for
documenting the biodiversity of the threatened habitats, describing the
morphology, taxonomy, and distribution of these arthropods, and investigating
biogeographic and evolutionary relationships of the fauna in southeastern United
States.
