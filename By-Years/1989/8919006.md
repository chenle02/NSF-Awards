Under this award professor Martin Guest, Mathematics Department, University of
Rochester will spend eighteen months in Japan in collaboration with Professor
Yoshihiro Ohnita of the Mathematics Department of Tokyo Metropolitan University
working on the application of methods of finite and infinite dimensions Lie
groups to problems in differential geometry. Topics will include the study of
equivariant harmonic maps between compact space, invariant Einstein metrics on
homogenous space, and the action of certain subgroups of the loop group on the
space of harmonic maps from a two-sphere to a Lie group.
