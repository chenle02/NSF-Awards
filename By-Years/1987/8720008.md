Granular superconductors are known to operate as fast, sensitive, low- noise
radiation detectors in the infrared, submillimeter and visible regions, probably
through Josephson-like coupling among the superconducting grains. The new family
of high temperature (Tc&gt;90K) copper oxide superconductors including
Y1Ba2Cu307 and Gd1Ba2Cu307 evince granular behavior and may show similar or
enhanced detector performance, with the enormous added advantage of operation at
and above 77K. This proposal outlines an approach to materials and devices to
rapidly evaluate the feasibility of this application, especially in the middle
infrared spectral region. It represents exploration of new technology emerging
from a major breakthrough in materials science, and a step toward ensuring
American competitiveness in this area.
