Christie Recent advances in statistical physics based on the concept of the
renormalization group are applied to the problem of computer interconnection
optimization. This enables a thermodynamic model of system connectivity to be
developed which is consistent with the hierarchical boundary conditions imposed
by the rack-board-chip method of computer construction. From this theoretical
description a new optimization algorithm, called geometrical annealing, is
proposed. In contrast to other thermodynamically based algorithms, geometrical
annealing acknowledges the spatial relationships that exist between optimal wire
length arrangements by employing minimization routines based on geometrical
principles. It is anticipated that this property may hold the key to matching
the performance of experienced human designers who naturally employ their
spatial awareness in producing efficient wiring layouts. Other benefits of this
research will include a deeper understanding of the relationship between
statistical mechanics and combinatorial optimization, the thermodynamic
justification of the power-law relationship between connectivity and system
size, known as Rent's rule, and the development of new thermodynamic
relationships between the parameters which characterize hierarchically
structured systems.
