This Research Initiation Award is for investigation of object recognition by
means of motion patterns. Objects that typically move are easier to identify
when in motion. Dr. Nelson will study both complex, non-rigid motion fields such
as windblown trees, ripples on water, and chaotic fluid flow, and action
identification for compact objects such as machinery and moving people. His
recognition approach will apply methods of statistical texture identification to
features extracted from optical motion fields. Monitoring and surveillance are
among the possible applications.
