This project will build on prior work to understand the interaction between
Antarctic sea-ice and South Atlantic ocean and atmosphere circulation, and the
impact this may have on the climates of Africa and South America. Emphasis will
be places on interannual and interdecadal timescales of interaction. Sea ice
data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager instrument will be employed will
be used, supplemented by surface and mid-tropospheric observations. A coupled
dynamic ocean atmosphere global climate model will facilitate sensitivity
studies to explore the causality of oceanic and atmospheric processes on sea ice
extent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores a topic of importance in
climate studies. It promotes the role of women in science and fosters an
international collaboration. Two graduate students will be involved in this
project. Results arising from this research will be disseminated to the
community via publications in internationally recognized scientific journals and
at scientific conferences.
