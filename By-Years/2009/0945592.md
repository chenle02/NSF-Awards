This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an
outdoor demonstration of a high intensity algae photo-bioreactor system called
turbulent trickle-screen thin-film photo-bioreactor. The photo-bioreactor uses
thin film culture to achieve a high density of algae culture, trickle-screen to
attenuate light in a suspension of algae, and make-up water to deliver pre-
dissolved CO2. A lab-scale unit has been tested to produce the algae of
Botryococcus brunii at a cell concentration higher than 20 g dry biomass/L and
oil production higher than 5 g/L.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the enhancement of
algal production, and the technology to capture CO2 and treat waste water during
the algal production. The success of this project will provide highly efficient
and compact photo-bioreactors for the production of microalgae at an ultra high
cell density on a large scale.
