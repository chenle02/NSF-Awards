The physiologically-oriented courses in the Departments of Psychology and
Biology are being significantly improved through the purchase of instruments.
Stereotaxic equipment (stereotaxic instrument, drill, lesion making device, and
automated microsyringe) is used to manipulate precise locations in the brains of
rats to determine relationships between neuroanatomy, physiology, and behavior.
The operant- conditioning apparatus is used to demonstrate principles of
learning, drug effects on learned behaviors, and rewarding brain stimulation.
Computerized physiological work stations are used to teach physiological
recording techniques as well as principles of neural and muscular physiology.
This equipment allows for needed support in the basic sciences and will prepare
students for a wider range of career options. The college will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
