Numerical algorithms used in Cyber Physical Systems, decision-making systems,
financial processing, and other HPC applications that use real numbers are prone
to introduce computational errors because of a well-known reason: real numbers
do not exist in computers, and we must use floating-point data types to
approximate such computations. As data movement costs energy, the lowest
precision of floating-point data must be allocated without compromising the
computational integrity. This project implements methods to reduce the amount of
energy consumed by numerical computations running on computing devices at all
scales including supercomputers for scientific research all the way to embedded
and mobile devices finding uses in many walks of real life including medical
devices and robots. A key thrust of the work is to perform energy reduction
through reduced transfers between computing units. The project studies how the
number of bits used to represent data introduce errors in computations, and
whether these errors affect the correctness of results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs propose to develop new formal methods tools to automatically estimate error
bounds, develop auto-tuning compilers to carefully select precision, and build
new superoptimizers to generate more efficient code. These new technologies will
be applied to improve software in the domains of machine learning and high-
performance computing. The PIs shall develop suitable criteria for errors in
high performance computing systems and machine learning systems. They will
develop tools that allocate precision optimally while staying within the bounds
of acceptable answers. Their tools will be released to a community of
researchers interested in working toward exascale computing, and deploying
machine learning applications in safety-critical devices. This work represents a
synergistic combination of PI skills ranging through high performance computing,
machine learning, formal methods, and compiler technologies.
