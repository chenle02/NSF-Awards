This project is involved with the analysis of stochastic and dynamic vehicle
routing problems that arise in transportation, communication, and manufacturing
systems. It is also involved with developing new algorithms for performance
analysis and optimization of queueing networks. Finally, it is involved with
worst case analysis of combinatorial optimization problems. Breakthroughs in any
of these problem areas will prove valuable in the development of advanced
analysis techniques.
