This project supports travel for thirty five US researchers to participate in
the Eighth Congress of the International Federation for the Theory of Machines
and Mechanisms to be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia on August 28-31, 1991. The
thirty five participants receiving support are to be selected from a list of 90
US participants. Professors Seireg and Roth, of the University of Wisconsin and
Stanford University respectively, are distinguished researchers in this area,
and will select the participants based on six criteria including stature in the
field, potential contribution of the research, need for support, and geographic
distribution of US participants. This meeting is a major event in the mechanisms
field, and US involvement is absolutely necessary. It is an excellent forum for
technical exchange at the international level. The selection criteria are
correct, and will insure a broad cross section representation of US research in
mechanisms and associated topics.
