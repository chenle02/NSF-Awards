Han DMS-1106934

This project has three main goals: (i) Develop the theory and algorithms for
optimal dual (and fusion) frames for erasures and for sparse signal
reconstruction. (ii) Develop the theory of the frame spectrum for fractal
measures that can provide much faster reconstruction (for example, compared to
the classical Shannon sampling method) for functions that are concentrated on
fractal-like regions. (iii) Investigate the connections between the Feichtinger
frame conjecture for group representation frames and related problems such as
the Kadison-Singer problem.

In today's digital world efficient data processing has become more demanding in
all kinds of applications. The principal investigator studies fundamental
questions in harmonic and functional analysis that are applicable in areas such
as wireless communications, radar, seismic sensing, image processing, reliable
classification of features in biomedical images, and algorithms for the
compensation of data loss in digital transmission of signals. The optimal dual
frame design problems for erasures and sparsity are directly related to basic
issues in redundant representation and transformation of signals. The
investigation leads to applicable tools for problems in engineering and
information applications, and provides theoretical analysis and algorithmic
construction for computationally efficient frames.
