This project will provide assistance to academic personnel who are engaged in
Microelectromechanical systems research by providing travel funds to attend the
1989 IEEE Micro Electromechanical Systems Workshop, to be held in Salt Lake City
on 20-22 February 1989. An announcement in response to workshop registrations
will be made to notify participants of the availability of support. A committee
of six senior researchers in the field will select the candidates for travel and
subsistence assistance awards. The awards will seek to encourage innovative
research and special consideration will be given to aiding young researchers in
the field. The following set of priorities will be used in making the awards:
First Priority - graduate students who are presenting papers; Second Priority -
researchers less than 5 years beyond their doctorates who are presenting papers;
Third Priority - researchers having a proven record of productivity in the area
and who can justify a genuine need for travel assistance. In order to stretch
the available funds, partial travel grants will be considered. All support will
be used to aid attendees from the U.S.
