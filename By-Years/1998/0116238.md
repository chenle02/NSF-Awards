29208&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major
concern with weldments is to establish and quantify the role played by residual
stress and material inhomogeneity in the fracture process. The researcher will
investigate the mechanics of weldments in both the fabrication process and the
potential fracture events in service. The theoretical work will include (a) the
development of fundamental fracture mechanics parameters or advanced procedures
that can characterize the fracture of solids containing residual stress and
material inhomogeneity and (b) the numerical modeling of the entire process of
welding, fabrication of fracture testing samples, and fracture mechanics
testing. The modeling work will be integrated, refined and validated with
experimental and metallurgical studies at DOE laboratories.
