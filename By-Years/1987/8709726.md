This research extends the principal investigator's work in developing new
formal analyses of the assumptions and benefits of the Entity-Relationship
approach to database modeling. The planned work also develops methods for the
design of the logical structure of the database, which is an important part of
any modern information system. A new goal is to develop translations of the
entity-relationship model onto the better-known Relational Database model. The
resulting (entity-relationship based) design system will enforce the properties
of well-behaved, reliable relational database schema, by interface with a
graphical, entity-relationship representation of the underlying information
system structues. The significance of this project lies in its contribution to
both the theory and practice of the logical design of robust database systems,
which can incorporate knowledge both flexibly and efficiently.
