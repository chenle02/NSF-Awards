This project will develop and apply two seismological methods for improving
estimates of the inner core's rate of rotation with respect to the rest of the
solid Earth. First, the investigators shall search for doublets in pertinent
source regions, to enable very precise measurement of differential travel times
that are indicative of inner core rotation. (A doublet, is a pair of earthquakes
occurring at different times but in almost exactly the same location. A
differential travel time is the time between two signals on the same
seismogram.) Second, they shall search for indications of travel time change in
seismic waves that have traveled almost vertically in the Earth, from a seismic
source (an earthquake, or a nuclear explosion) to its antipode. By working with
examples of seismic waves that have passed very deeply into the inner core, and
are thus more sensitive to effects of anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the inner
core, the investigators will be better able to understand the basic mechanism
causing travel time changes.
