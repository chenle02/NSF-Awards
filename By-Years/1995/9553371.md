9553371 Fischer The research methodology of our proposal rests on a tight
integration of theory, innovative system development, and assessment. To achieve
the focus on theory development, we will focus the innovative system development
on one project, namely the Remote Exploratorium which combines design
environments with networking. Our theory development will be supported through
our strategic alliances-alliances that we have developed over the last few years
ranging from K-12 schools (New Vista High School, Boulder), universities
(Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory, CU Boulder), and corporations
(NYNEX Science and Technology; and Apple Computer). In the context of these
alliances we will study specifically. * teachers as lifelong learners, and * the
integration of learning into working rather than regarding learning as a
separate activity. We will develop a conceptual framework founded on the
objective that learners of all ages should be engaged in authentic, self-
directed learning supported by innovative technologies. This framework, as it
develops, needs to be radically different from most other approaches of using
computers. ***
