The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will provide data to extend and expand
existing data series concerning patenting in the United States. Data will
include numbers of patents granted year by year to Americans and to citizens of
other specified countries, patents owned by individuals as opposed to private
corporate entities, governments, and patents assigned to univer- sities and
colleges. Counts of granted patents will be classified by both the Patent Office
Classification system and the Standard Industrial Classification system. These
data are used in the National Science Board's series of Science and Engineering
Indicators reports as indicators of levels of technical invention in the various
countries, sectors, and fields.
