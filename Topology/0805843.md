The proposer aims to study homotopy theoretical properties of various moduli
spaces. These are moduli spaces of manifolds with a geometric structure, for
example a complex structure. The case of complex dimension one gives the moduli
space of Riemann surfaces, which by now is relatively well understood. In
contrast, much less is understood about moduli spaces of higher dimensional
complex manifolds. This is project will investigate what can be said about this
and related spaces using methods of homotopy theory. Another goal of this
project is to study moduli spaces of manifolds with singularities. Here, the
most basic case is the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Riemann's moduli
space. For many application this space is more important than the uncompactified
moduli space, and a homotopy theoretic understanding should be fruitful. In
particular, the proposer will study applications to Gromov-Witten theory.

A manifold is a general notion of space. Manifolds are fundamental in geometry,
topology, analysis, and other areas of mathematics. In physics, they are the
underlying geometric structure in Einstein's general theory of relativity, and
play fundamental roles in mechanics, quantum field theory, and probably many
other areas. Studying manifolds from a mathematical perspective can be done in
two ways: You can study the geometric properties each manifold, one at a time,
or you can study geometric properties of the collection of all manifolds at
once. The "collection of all manifolds" can itself be thought of as a kind of
space, and each individual manifold is a point in this space. This space is an
example of a moduli space, and the current project aims at understanding
geometric and topological properties of this moduli space and its variations.
