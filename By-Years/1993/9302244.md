9302244 Snodgrass This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. Many emerging applications, including geographical information systems
and scientific databases, such as those associated with global change studies,
require simultaneous support for spatial and temporal data. This project
considers three areas where previously proposed approaches for handling space or
time separately need to be generalized to produce a coherent approach to
spatiotemporal (ST) database. The first issue is the design of ST databases.
Database administrators use a data model to describe the enterprise to be
modeled. A conceptual data model used in temporal databases that employs sets of
time instants is being merged with the point set model used in spatial
databases. The second issue is that of query processing, specifically efficient
execution of ST natural joins and ST aggregates. Extensions of currently
proposed temporal query processing methods are under development. Finally, ST
indeterminacy, or "don't know exactly where or when" information, must be
handled. Again, the merged data model is quite helpful, as it is possible to
model indeterminacy in this model as sets of possible instants and points. The
result will be enhanced methods of designing ST databases and implementing ST
database management systems, in which time and space support is balanced and
coordinated. ***
