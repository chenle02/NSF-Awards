This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will develop
technologies to synthesize nano tin/metal oxide anode materials for lithium
rechargeable batteries. Reducing tin particles to nano size is known to be
critical for a good cycle life of tin-based anode materials. The materials are
expected to show a capacity of >1000 mAh/cm3 which represents a >50% increase
over the practical capacity of carbonaceous materials presently used in lithium
rechargeable batteries. In addition, the materials are expected to have a first
cycle reversibility of >80%, comparable to that of carbon.

The commercial application of this project will be in the materials market for
the next generation of lithium rechargeable batteries. The market for portable
batteries is about $6 billion, with an annual growth rate of 15% in the last 10
years. Of this, the worldwide portable lithium-ion battery market is $2.93
billion, with 530 million cells shipped in 2000. New markets are also emerging
for electric and hybrid vehicle propulsion.
