The objective of this project is the establishment of a United States/Spain
joint study group to discuss and analyze engineering research and education
issues related to manufacturing industries. Activities include tours to leading
manufacturing industries, representative universities and governmental research
laboratories in both the United States and Spain as well as workshops at both of
the lead institutions. Anticipated results include establishment of joint
research activities, development of exchange programs for faculty and students
from one institution to the other, development of programs to improve
interaction between universities and multinational industries, and the
establishment of programs to increase the number of manufacturing engineers in
each country, especially from population segments that do not traditionally
select technologically oriented careers. Workshop proceedings and video
documentation will be made available to interested parties in both countries.
