Measurements of tritium and 3He will opportunely be taken on a previously
funded cruise to study the formation and spreading of Subarctic Intermediate
Water (SAIW). These tracers will allow the processes of formation and sinking of
this water mass to be examined on short time scales (weeks to months) and
provide complementary data to that already proposed.
