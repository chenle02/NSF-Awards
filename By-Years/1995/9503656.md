*** 9503656 Simpson This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
focuses on the development of broad bandwidth sonar methods for identifying, in
real time, fish populations in open ocean environments. The approach uses sonar
technology, developed in defense-related contexts over many years, that hold
promise for application to fishery management. Topics that will be developed in
the research involve broadband acoustics, spectral decomposition of returns, and
nonlinear fuzzy neural network classifiers for characterizing and distinguishing
different fish populations. In Phase I of the research, a successful application
of several concepts was carried out using freshwater fish populations. Phase II
research will extend the work to development of an engineering prototype for
broadband fish identification in a marine environment, with both commercial and
scientific-research implications Fisheries are becoming an increasingly
significant food source. Currently, 30% of the protein consumed by Americans
comes from the sea and this percentage is growing. Over the past decade
fisheries have experienced more regulation because of bycatch,
overcapitalization, and marine mammal endangerment. Because of increased
regulation, the scrutiny on commercial fishing and fisheries management has
become intense. As a result of these changes, techniques that can automatically
and non-intrusively detect, classify, and quantify fish populations are of
commercial interest to all segments of the fisheries. ***
