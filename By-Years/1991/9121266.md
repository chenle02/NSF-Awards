A visual signal, as recorded on the retina of an animal or by a TV camera,
differs from many signals analyzed by engineers in that it is produced by a
world with many overlapping objects and shadows, and, to "decode" the signal,
these must be teased apart so as to reconstruct the world geometry. Most
classical techniques smooth over the discontinuities in the signal produced by
this multiplicity of effects, making it harder to separate them and reconstruct
the world geometry. The PI plans to use new techniques involving variational
problems for discontinuous maps to attack some of these problems. He also seeks
to compare this mathematical approach with the neural techniques by which
animals solve the problem. To do this, he will study "neural net"
implementations and formulate experiments to study how close these nets are to
the true neural activities in animals. The goal is to understand mathematically
one of the most remarkable cognitive abilities of living organisms. Vision is a
focal point of research activity in computational science, as well as HPCC.
