The principal investigator (PI) proposes to explore aspects of non-product-form
networks. His approach assumes a more realistic type of model than the so-called
product form in which the stationary distribution of queues at network nodes
over the entire network can be written as the product of distributions at the
individual nodes as if each of the nodes was operation in isolation. If either
or both of two assumptions, finite buffer size at each node and exogenous
Poisson arrivals and/or exponential service times are eliminated, then the
overall queue distribution is no longer of product form and analysis becomes
intractable. Professor Tsoucas considers the case when neither assumption holds.
He proposes to study the computational problem that results when product form is
absent, emphasize parallel asynchronous relaxation procedures, formulate an
analog of the "folk" theorem for delays, and consider qualitative properties of
the throughput in blocking systems. ***
