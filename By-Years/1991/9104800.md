This award provides half of the funds necessary to acquire a coupled theodolite
(for measuring angles) and an electronic distance measuring device, more
commonly referred to as a Total Station. The PI intends to use the Total Station
to accurately measure the location and elevation of the surfaces and contacts of
Quaternary sediments and rocks that have been displaced by warping or faulting.
These kinds of measurements are a critical part of modern neotectonic research
programs. In addition, the Total Station will be used in the teaching of
undergraduate and graduate courses.
