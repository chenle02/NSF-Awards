This work will develop a computational framework to advance the understanding of
epigenetic gene regulation. One of the most important tasks in modern molecular
biology is to understand the role of epigenome in gene regulation and in
phenotype development. With the current unprecedented availability of genome-
scale epigenetic modification data, this project will develop computational
algorithms and tools to model histone modification and discover patterns that
are of interest to gene regulation. The discovered histone modification patterns
will provide us deep insights into multiple epigenetic modification interaction
and genome-epigenome interaction. The probabilistic model of gene expression
regulation constructed from large-scale genomics and epigenomic data integration
will greatly advance understanding of gene regulation at different levels. The
objectives of this research are to: (1) create novel algorithms to model
epigenetic modifications from high-throughput sequencing data; (2) create
computational and statistical algorithms to mine epigenetic modification
patterns; and (3) model gene regulation through genomic and epigenomic data
integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes
in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes
in the underlying DNA sequence. This work will develop tools for modeling
epigenetic changes. All of the proposed research will be converted into software
tools that will be released as open-source and freely available software tools
to the scientific community. All the associated source code will be freely
available to the public through the project website. The proposed research will
have great impact on education at all levels. The research will be incorporated
into the graduate, undergraduate and K12 education, and will be disseminated to
the research community, informal science education, and the public to enhance
scientific understanding. The education and outreach component also includes
developing outreach activities for women and girls in interdisciplinary science.
