9626287 Posbergh This research project deals with the development of a design
methodology for robust stabilization and control of nonlinear dynamical systems
in uniform rotation. Typical examples of such systems are rotating helicopter
blades, gas turbines, and spin stabilized spacecrafts. In recent years, Lyapunov
methods, coupled with developments in geometric system theory, have provided
powerful new tools for the design of robust nonlinear feedback control systems.
In this research project, this methodology is modified to include a special
energy-momentum functional instead of a Lyapunov function, and the energy-
momentum method of nonlinear stability analysis is employed. By combining
recently developed methods of stability analysis with carefully formulated
structural models, a new class of nonlinear feedback control laws are developed
that fully exploit the nonlinearities in the model. The use of high performance
computing, symbolic manipulation, and the development of numerical design tools
are emphasized in this research.
