This project concerns the application of the theory of variational inequalities
in equilibrium problems arising in operations research and the social sciences.
The goal of the program is to demonstrate that variational inequalities provide
the natural and unifying framework for the qualitative study and computation of
equilibria. Included in this study are questions of existence, uniqueness and
sensitivity of solutions to perturbations.
