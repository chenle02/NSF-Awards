Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT) draws the majority of its students from a
large, sparsely populated, rural region of South Central Oregon. This region has
a significant number of underrepresented, low-income populations who are
currently not in a position to participate in career opportunities in
engineering and information technology. This region also suffers from shortage
of students trained for jobs in engineering and information technology sectors.
The primary goal of this project is to provide scholarships to low-income
computer science, computer technology, engineering and engineering technology,
and mathematics students in the region. The project targets underrepresented
groups, first-generation students, and persons with disabilities. The project
awards thirty students per year scholarships worth $3,100. It contains several
new programs, which help to ensure its success. All CSEMS students are required
to participate in a new Learning Community program in their first quarter in the
project. As part of the Learning Community, they are required to take a newly
developed CSEMS seminar. Furthermore, an intensive September Bridge program
orients new participants to the college and the program.
