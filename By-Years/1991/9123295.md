This award for a long-term visit to the United Kingdom will support cooperative
research in fungal ecology between David M. Sylvia of the University of Florida
and Peter Jeffries of the University of Kent in the United Kingdom. The
objectives of their research are to understand vesicular-arbuscular (VA)
mycorrhizal function in the soil and to evaluate the impact of the external
fungal hyphae on plant competition for soil nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi have an
important role in increasing plant uptake of phosphorous and other poorly-mobile
nutrients from soil. The external mycorrhizal hyphae are filament structures
which enable the update of nutrients through plant roots. By studying the
external hyphae, the researchers will be able to evaluate the survival,
distribution, and competitive ability of VA mycorrhizal fungi in soil systems.
Previous work on the hyphae of VA mycorrhizal fungi have been limited due to the
difficulty of obtaining large quantities of hyphae free from contaminating soil.
The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his technique of culturing
fungi free from soil and plant material. This is complemented by the
immunological approaches of Dr. Jeffries which will enable the investigators to
detect and evaluate the impact of mycorrhizal fungi in situ.
