Dr. Michael Wright of Atom Sciences, Inc. will conduct research to develop a
new approach to radiocarbon dating. He will employ resonance ionization
spectroscopy combined with mass spectroscopy to measure carbon isotopes. In this
first stage of the research the feasibility of the method will be demonstrated.
This approach, if successful, will permit the dating of small samples at
relatively low cost. The technique will be of great value to archaeologists as
well as other scientists who need to date the past.
