This is a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation (NSF)
and the American Mathematical Society for the purpose of providing an evaluation
of the applicants for the NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships. The American Mathematical Society will receive and organize the
applications and convene a panel of distinguished mathematical scientists
representing the American Mathematical Society, the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. This panel
will recommend a list of applicants to the Division of Mathematical Sciences of
NSF for fellowship awards. The American Mathematical Society (AMS) is a
nonprofit organization dedicated to the support of mathematical research and
scholarship. It is critical to the AMS and to NSF that there be a continuing
influx of mathematicians possessing the advanced training and talent needed to
keep the profession vital. The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship Program helps develop this talent and serves to focus attention on
this need throughout the broad mathematical sciences community.
