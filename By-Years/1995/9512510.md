This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University acquire upgrade Bomen
DA3-002 Spectrometer, upgrade and components for Bomen DA8-002, and IBM
RS6000/550 computer. The research activity to be supported includes: (1)
Potential Energy Surfaces of Non-Rigid Molecules; (2) Rovibrationally Resolved
FTIR Supersonic Jet Spectroscopy of Weakly Bound Complexes Transient Species and
Chemical Reactions; (3) Molecular Modeling from Infrared Spectroscopic Data. A
tunable infrared spectrometer can provide important information about chemical
reactivity. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.
