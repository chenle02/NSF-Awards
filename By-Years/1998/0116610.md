0116610 Sayler This is a proposal to acquire the instruments needed to couple a
multi-purpose scanning probe microscope with a photon counting intensified CCD
camera imaging system and a tunable liquid crystal filter to accomplish two
objectives. First, the instrumentation will create a multi-purpose test bed for
the study of luminescence and spectral processes of reporter cells, nucleic
acids, and enzymes at specialized substrata, thereby advancing fundamental
understanding of biomicroelectronics and nanobiotechnology. Second, the
instrument will dramatically improve the infrastructure and expand the research
and training efforts of the scientific and engineering communities at the
University. In addition, the instrumentation will be used in courses in
Microbiology, Biochemistry, Electrical Engineering, and Geology.
