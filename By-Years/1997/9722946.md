Victoria Booth Layman's abstract for proposal titled "A dendritic origin of
bistability of motoneuron firing patterns" (proposal #: IBN- 9722946) In
response to stimuli from the rest of the nervous system, neurons in the spinal
cord, called motoneurons, generate an electrical signal called an action
potential that is transmitted to muscle fibers and induces contraction. In this
way, the pattern of action potential firing by motoneurons regulates muscle
movement. In the presence of the naturally-occuring neurotransmitter serotonin,
experimentalists have observed motoneurons firing complex patterns of action
potentials that are believed to affect muscle activity. The cell mechanisms
within motoneurons responsible for the generation of action potentials are
sufficiently well known to allow the development of mathematical models that
replicate motoneuron behavior. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the
cell mechanisms underlying the generation of the serotonin-induced complex
firing behaviors by studying mathematical models of motoneurons. Of particular
interest is the suggestion that the complex behaviors are a result of the
interaction of mechanisms located in different segments of the neuron, where one
segment was previously thought to be uninvolved in action potential generation.
