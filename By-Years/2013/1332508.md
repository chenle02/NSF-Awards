Hampton University proposes to implement an HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project to
reform three computer science gateway courses and to develop an intensive
computing summer bridge program for computer science, engineering, and
mathematics majors in an effort to enhance student academic performance,
increase retention, and improve graduation rates, particularly for computer
science students. The PIs propose to strengthen the students' problem-solving
and critical thinking skills by integrating computational thinking into lower-
level courses. This strategy will be coupled with a pre-college summer program
that will be designed to inculcate the prerequisite skills among prospective
students for success in the gateway courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project is in response to observable enrollment and course completion data,
results of academic support programs, and student surveys. It will implement a
cyclical model as the framework to integrate computational thinking and
programming concepts in learning modules and to assess learning outcomes.
Faculty also will employ and assess the impact of learning techniques that have
been proven effective for STEM students and develop future concepts relevant for
Hampton and other institutions seeking to address similar problems.
