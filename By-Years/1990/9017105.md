The Principal Investigator will analyze samples from 40 dredge stations
occupied along the kolbeinsey, Mohns, and Knipovich ridges from 65 to 80 N. The
petrology, trace element and Nd-Sr isotope ratios of these samples already have
been studied. Pb isotope ratios and Th-U-Pb concentrations will be measured. The
results will provide a complete date base for modelling crust and mantle
processes associated with the Greenland basin, and the dynamic and thrmal
influence of the Iceland and Jan Mayen plumes on the ridges.
