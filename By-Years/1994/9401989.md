9401989 Jenkins In this project, the PI will obtain, analyze, and interpret
Tritium /Helium-3 samples on seven sections of the Hydrographic Program in the
Indian Ocean for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The PIs will
acquire, process, and analyze 2176 Tritium samples and 2256 He-3 samples. In
addition the PIs will provide logistical support for the shipboard processing
Tr/He-3 samples to be obtained by other groups on the Indian Ocean WHP, as well.
Use of this tracer will focus on upper ocean subduction, ventilation, and
circulation; identication of water mass characteristics, exchange among various
water mass regimes, characteristics, exchange among various water mass regimes,
pathways and flux of the Indonesian Throughflow, and rates of oxygen utilization
and primary production.
