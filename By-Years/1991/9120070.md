The PI has organized a NATO Advanced Research Workshop on the Global Methane
Cycle to be held at Timberline lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, 5 - 11 October 1991.
The workshop goals are (1) to bring together prominent researchers from various
disciplines common to the understanding of the global methane cycle, (2) to put
together and document the current understanding of the atmospheric methane
cycle, (3) to chart out promising directions for future research, (4) to produce
a definitive book that will reflect the present understanding of the methane
cycle and contribute to the planning of future research (Publisher: Springer-
Verlag, Berlin), and (5) to produce a collection of research articles that will
make available to the scientific community the best current research on
specialized subjects related to the global methane cycle (Special Issue
Chemosphere, Pergamon Press, Oxford, England).
