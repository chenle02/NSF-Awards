In recent work with Zoltan Szabo, the principal investigator constructed
invariants for three- and four-dimensional spaces, called Heegaard Floer
homology. In further joint work with Robert Lipshitz and Dylan Thurston, these
invariants are extended down, to define bordered Floer homology. Bordered Floer
homology gives invariants for two-dimensional surfaces and three-dimensional
spaces with two-dimensional boundary. These bordered invariants shed light on
Heegaard Floer homology in its original setting. In particular, they can be used
to give conceptual calculations of certain Heegaard Floer invariants for closed
manifolds. The project aims to understands the invariants better, extending the
"bordered theory" to a broader context.



The introduction of equations with origins in mathematical physics has lead to
great advances in our understanding of the topological properties of three and
four-dimensional spaces over the past twenty-five years. Further progress in
this area is facilitated by an alternative, more geometric understanding of the
data derived from these equations, known as "Heegaard Floer homology", developed
by the investigator in collaboration with Zoltan Szabo. This three and four-
dimensional story can be extended to cover two-dimensional objects, as well, in
a a new theory, "bordered Floer homology", developed by the investigator in
collaboration with Robert Lipshitz and Dylan Thurston. The proposal aims to
further develop both of these tools and apply them to study topological
questions.
