This project focuses on the development of new instrumentation for measuring the
optical properties of atmospheric aerosol. These instruments will provide
measurements of light scattering and absorption by aerosols and enable better
characterization of soot particles and particles containing black and brown
carbon. A better understanding of the optical properties of atmospheric aerosol
is needed for more accurate ground-based and satellite retrievals of data on
atmospheric aerosols and for developing improved global climate
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will: (1) build a portable
3-wavelength polar nephelometer to measure light scattering by particles as a
function of angle and light polarization; (2) expand the capabilities for
measuring ambient aerosol absorption by adding a near-IR channel to a
photoacoustic spectrophotometer (PAS), building a UV PAS instrument, and
constructing a thermodenuder to better measure the black and brown carbon
components of absorption, and (3) more accurately measure the optical properties
of soot (black and black carbon) and especially those properties associated with
aerosol coatings.
