Social entrepreneurship and the development of effective social policy are two
approaches to social innovation and problem-solving. However, surprisingly
little is known either theoretically or practically about social innovation
processes and the practices that support knowledge transfer from the social,
behavioral and economic sciences into social policy and new venture creation.
This workshop will explore the intersection of the SBE sciences, social policy
and entrepreneurship with the goal of developing a research agenda,
collaborative arrangements and curricula to build bridges between knowledge-
creators and practitioners in these areas.
