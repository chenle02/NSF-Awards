The principal investigator will study the behavior of singularities arising in
harmonic maps, minimal surfaces, and certain problems in mechanics. The
questions to be considered include the possibility of prescribing the location
of singularities and their behavior as well as questions on the structure of
spaces of harmonic maps with singularities. Specific investigations will focus
on liquid crystals, ferromagnetics, p-harmonic maps, and geodesics in varieties.
Many functions, mappings, and spaces arising in models of our physical
surroundings involve singularities. Two of the most familiar settings in which
the study of singularities plays an important role are liquid crystal and
minimal surfaces. Liquid crystals are commonly used to display characters in
digital watches and laptop computer screens. Minimal surfaces are those surfaces
which span a closed curve and have smallest area. A physical example is a soap
bubble which spans a wire loop. By introducing twists in the loop, one may
easily produce a soap bubble with singularities. The principal investigator will
study these singularities using techniques from geometric measure theory. A
major aspect of the work is to develop general techniques which can then be
applied to a wide range of problems.
