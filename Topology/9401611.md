9401611 Harer This proposal concerns research on three related topics. The first
is a continuation of the principal investigator's work on the computation of the
homology of the moduli space of curves. New techniques are proposed which
involve the interplay between the known triangulations of moduli spaces and the
Arbarello flag. The second topic is the generalization of the results on moduli
space to its level-n covers and to Torelli space. The third is joint work with
David Epstein and Steve Kerckhoff in which they are looking for automatic
structures for the outer automorphism group of a free group. This research is
part of an ongoing attempt by a number of mathematicians and physicists to
understand the mathematics which underlies certain recent developments in
theoretical physics. In particular, gravity is the only one of the four
fundamental forces of nature for which there is no reasonable quantum theory
(quantum theories describe the behavior of matter in the small, while ordinary
theories describe behavior in the large). An approach to quantum gravity was
suggested by the physicists (primarily Witten), but the mathematics necessary to
understand it involves the moduli space of curves and is not yet understood
sufficiently. ***
