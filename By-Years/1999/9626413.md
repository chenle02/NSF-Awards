Abstract Ladeinde 9626413 The PIs propose a study of supersonic, turbulent,
reactive flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS). The objective of the
proposed work is to extend their previous studies on compressible turbulence (Ma
0.7), scalar advection, reacting flows and parallel processing to chemically
reacting compressible turbulence where all the effects are combined. The
proposed study will involve three dimensional turbulence calculations applied to
a temporal mixing layer at Mach numbers up to 3.0 and including an exothermic,
non -premixed, reversible, one-step, four species reaction. A finite difference
procedure based on ENO scheme on massively parallel architecture will be
utilized in this study. This investigation hopes to yield information about the
interactions of density fluctuations with species transport, chemical
production, and turbulence structure.
