9410269 Srebro The research proposed in this application is concerned with
developing methods for functional brain imaging extrapolated from a series of
experiments on human subjects; cortical dipole moment estimation based on
combined measurements from an array of electrical scalp measurements, MR fast
gradient echo images of blood flow, and regularized least-squares estimation
will be performed. The research has three major objectives: (1) to explore
several strategies for inverting the scalp field in a model of the human head
that mimics the anatomy of the brain, skull and scalp with good fidelity, (2) to
develop the methods required to apply the inversion methods to patients and (3)
to compare the results to MR measurements of evoked blood volume change using
the same subjects and the same stimuli. MR blood volume measurements restrict
the region of cortex that must be search for a solution to the EP scalp field
inversion. It is shown that restricting the search space not only improves the
accuracy of the EP inversion, but also enhances its spatial resolution. Thus
combining MR with EP inversion provides a powerful tool to study human cortical
function. ***
