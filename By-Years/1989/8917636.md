The high latitude auroral zone is one of the most complex and interesting areas
in the Earth's magnetosphere. The existence of parallel electric fields in this
region with a concomitant level of plasma turbulence presents a significant
research challenge. The principal theories on parallel electric field generation
(and the associate currents) involve either (1) particle motion, or (2) Alfven
waves. This project is interested in whether field-aligned currents in the
auroral acceleration region carried by shear Alfven waves can lead to the
formation of quasi-stationary field-aligned electric fields and double layers.
The project will be a detailed test of the Alfven wave model for generating
small scale field-aligned currents and auroral particle acceleration. ***
