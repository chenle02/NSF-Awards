The primary objective of this research is to clarify the ecology of a little
studied species of lemur, Lemur macaco. This species is indigenous to a
threatened habitat, primary lowland rainforest, and has recently spread into
converted forest. The research aims to determine the affects of the varying
habitat on the feeding and ranging behaviors, group size and composition and
activity cycles in the two forms of forest. A number of specific predictions are
made as to the influence of habitat on the group parameters. Data to test the
hypotheses will be gathered by standard observational techniques and by analysis
of ecological variables pertaining to forest composition and structure.
