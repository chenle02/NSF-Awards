This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Rochester Institute of Technology upgrade the
existing NMR facility. Among the areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition are the following: 1. Diffusion in the Water-Gelatin
Matrix 2. Structural Characterization of Bis(quadridentate)zirconium(IV)
Complexes 3. Additions of Arenesulfenyl Halides to Cyclopropanes 4. Antiviral
Research 5. Synthesis of Substituted Imidazolinones from Chiral Amino Acids
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
