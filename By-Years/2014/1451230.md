This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the
opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more
senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet
potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be
demonstrated by vendors. This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting
the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference
on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS). IROS, sponsored by IEEE and the
Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ), is one of the two premier annual conferences,
along with IEEE ICRA, in the robotics field. The location of IROS rotates among
North America, Europe, and Asia. The conference attracts an international crowd
that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency
leaders. The meeting is a unique environment that allows participants to
exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming
engineers, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the
leading edge of robotic technology.
