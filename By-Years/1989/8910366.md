This Research Initiation Award will permit Dr. Johnstone to extend his work in
real algebraic geometry to the domain of robotic motion planning. He will begin
by generalizing common techniques for polyhedral motion planning to handle
robots and manipulators with rounded surfaces operating among curved obstacles
or in contact with curved workpieces. This study may increase our understanding
of solid-modeling representations and techniques.
