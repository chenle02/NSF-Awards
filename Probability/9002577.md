In addition to the mathematical aspects of the work, the project has the
potential for wide impact on the scientific community through the development of
a comprehensive computer environment for the exploration of dynamical systems.
The intention is to provide the user of this environment with interactive,
efficient access to all currently available algorithms for studying the dynamics
of general systems together with the tools for effectively managing the data
produced in these studies. A prototype for such an environment has been
developed in the context of the first problem listed above, but further work is
required to produce a package that meets the needs of a broad spectrum of
applications and users. These further developments will occur in conjunction
with studies of problems of significant theoretical interest.
