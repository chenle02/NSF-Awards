OISE 11-32960&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a planning visit for the US PIs
(Gallagher, Spatari, and Bartoli), three graduate students and one undergraduate
student to meet with UK Professor Soga and his graduate students at the
University of Cambridge. Both groups are pioneering the use of life cycle
assessment (LCA) methods in geotechnical engineering. &lt;br/&gt;During this
visit the PIs will catalyze collaboration and explore the synergies of
developing, adapting, and integrating LCA methods in geotechnical decision
making, particularly as they relate to geotechnical engineering?s role in
designing resilient and sustainable infrastructure. A follow on 2011-2012
workshop is planned.&lt;br/&gt;Because geotechnics involves using relatively
large amounts of materials, at times employs heavy construction equipment that
consumes large amounts of fuel and at times changes the natural landscape,
successful incorporation of LCA into geotechnical engineering could have a
significant impact on the environmental sustainability of major
projects.&lt;br/&gt;This project also integrates research and education by
providing US students with the opportunity to discuss research that is at an
early development state with their peers at a foreign university.
