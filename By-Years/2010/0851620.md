This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site is in the area of Polymer
Science and Engineering and will run for 10 weeks in summer during 2009 to 2011
at Case Western Reserve University. Ten undergraduate students will be recruited
nationally each year. These REU students will join active research groups
engaged in polymer synthesis, studies of structure and properties, novel
processing methodologies and fundamental simulations and contribute to the
research. The goal of the program is to prepare the students with a strong
background in polymer research, supplemented by lectures on basics of polymers,
and exposure to key questions in research ethics and entrepreneurship. The
students will present the results of their research to peers and also at the
Northeast Ohio Undergraduate Polymer Research Conference. Students will have the
opportunity to gain insights into research careers and graduate school.

This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
REU program. Within NSF, this award is jointly funded by the Division of
Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the
Division of Engineering Education Centers in the Engineering Directorate.
