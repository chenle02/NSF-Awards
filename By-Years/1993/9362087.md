9362087 Leaskey There is much currently great demand for a material with
superior mechanical properties that can be maintained to high temperatures.
Silicon nitride has been identified as one of the most promising ceramics to
meet these material requirements. To date, research on Si3N4 ceramics has
resulted in superior room temperature properties but retention of these
properties to high temperatures has not been achieved. This is mainly a result
of liquid phase incorporated for densification and grain growth, but which
remains as a glassy grain boundary phase which softens at high temperatures. A
Novel method is proposed which allows for densification and microstructural
control of Si3N4 without deterimental glassy phases. This technique involves use
of a transient liquid phase which is subsequently converted to refractory oxides
so that no phases with melting points < 1850 C are present. Also, any silica
present on the surface of the Si4N4 particles should be converted to SiC. This
will result in materials with substantially improved creep resistance capable of
operation at higher temperatures. The proposed research involves extensive
characterization of consolidated materials in terms of phase analyses and
examination of microstructures. The mechanical properties of optimized samples
will be measured at RT and 1400 C.
