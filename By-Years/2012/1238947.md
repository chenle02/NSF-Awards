This project will investigate the effects of atmospheric water vapor on the
formation of organic nitrates and secondary organic aerosol. Measurements of the
product branching ratio for the reaction HOCH2CH2O2 (HEP, 2-hydroxyethyl peroxy)
+ NO as a function of temperature and water vapor are predicted to show that
high concentrations of atmospheric water vapor can lead to the increased
formation of organic nitrates. Additionally, this research will investigate the
potential that under certain conditions, hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) in the
presence of water vapor can form complexes that become nucleating seeds for the
formation of secondary aerosols. The results will connect the gas phase
chemistry of peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2) with the formation of secondary
aerosol as a function of water vapor concentration, initial radical
concentration, temperature, and reaction time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High levels
of water vapor in the atmosphere may have an important effect on the formation
of organic nitrates and secondary organic aerosol (from gas-to-particle
transformations). Organic nitrates in the atmosphere are relatively inert and
can provide a mechanism for long-range transport of pollution from one region to
another. Understanding and quantifying the formation of secondary organic
aerosol is critical for predicting their direct and indirect effects on climate
change.
