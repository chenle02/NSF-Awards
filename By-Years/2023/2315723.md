A wide variety of cell lineage transformations has been achieved in biomedicine
by ectopically expressing transcription factors (TFs) – providing insight into
cell differentiation and allowing for the creation of medically-relevant cell
types. A greater ability to reprogram plant cell fate and induce desirable
pathways could have transformative impacts on plant tissue culture and synthetic
biology. This project applies a new framework to systematically assess what can
be accomplished with ectopic TF expression in maize, one of the most important
US crops. Robotics-assisted assays will be used to test the effect of thousands
of TFs on gene expression in parallel. This will be followed with targeted
secondary screens to evaluate the physiological response to selected TFs in
plant tissues. Ultimately, these experiments will contribute a greater
understanding of TF function and a “reprogramming toolbox” to aid in the
engineering of plant traits and development of improved plant breeding
technologies. To connect research and education, a fellowship will be
established to send graduate students and post-docs to speak about their careers
at undergraduate institutions with a high proportion of underrepresented groups.
Student fellows will be provided mentorship on speaking, and during their
seminars will include information about exploring and navigating scientific
careers.

The scientific aims of this project are to: (1) measure the transcriptional
response to a collection of 2000 cloned maize TFs using high-throughput
protoplast assays; (2) establish methods to interpret and analyze these data,
including approaches to connect TFs to target pathways, infer gene regulatory
networks, and better account for technical covariates when analyzing high-
throughput plate-based genomics data; and, (3) prioritize and test TFs for the
ability to induce functional responses ectopically, with an emphasis on tissue
regeneration – a crucial step in plant transformation. Data and code will be
made accessible and free to use, including through data reports and graphical
visualization on the gene landing pages of MaizeGDB. Plasmids will be
distributed through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). Finally,
the PIs will host an online workshop on high-throughput functional screening in
plants, helping to make the technique available to the community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
