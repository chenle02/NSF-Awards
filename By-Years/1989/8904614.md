This study will explore the oxygen binding site in cytochrome c oxidase and
related respiratory proteins by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Three specific
objectives will be: 1) to refine the mathematical analysis of EXAFS spectra of
iron porphyrins: 2) to apply the refined method of analysis to study chemically
defined states of cytochrome c oxidase; and 3) to extend these results to
characterize reactive intermediates in the reduction of dioxygen to water by the
enzyme. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption
fine structure spectroscopy will be directed initially toward the iron and
copper binding centers for dioxygen in cytochrome c oxidase and toward related
simpler iron and copper respiratory proteins. The work will focus on a small
number of metal centers with detailed analyses of data obtained at high
resolution and high signal/noise. Such high quality X-ray spectroscopic data
will permit the evaluation of the mathematical models that have been used
previously and extend them to include curved wave functions and multiple
scattering effects. This is essential in order to relate chemical information to
structural perturbations.
