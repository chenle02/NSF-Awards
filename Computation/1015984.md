The objective of this research program is to develop solution methods for
solving magneto-hydrodynamics flows in three-dimensional domains comprising
conducting and nonconducting regions and variable/discontinuous magnetic
permeability. The method to be developed will be robust enough to handle High
Reynolds flows and high Prandtl numbers. Lagrange finite elements will be used
and novel mathematical formulations will be developed to make Lagrange finite
elements to converge in non-smooth domains and with non-smooth interfaces. The
code to be developed will be fully parallel. The applications targeted are the
geodynamo, sea-water/oil separation and liquid metal flows. The solution
strategy to be developed will be flexible enough so as to be easily modifiable
to simulate plasma flows in Tokamak geometries and thus to contribute to the
ongoing global international effort on magnetic confinement of plasmas.

The focus of the research program is to propose and analyze new numerical
strategies for simulating three-dimensional fluid flows interacting with
electromagnetic fields in heterogeneous media at high speed. One phenomenon of
interest is the so-called fluid dynamo effect. The dynamo phenomenon arises in
astrophysics. It is responsible for the magnetic fields that are observed around
stars and planets with liquid cores. This phenomenon arises also in experimental
setups aiming at reproducing the dynamo effect. The fluid may be plasma in stars
and in tokamaks, molten iron in planets, or liquid gallium or sodium in
experimental setups. The dynamo effect may have undesired consequence on heat
extraction processes from fast breeder reactors. This research will also prepare
the ground for further developments on plasma flows in Tokamak geometries. This
research project will involve large scale parallel computing and will lead to
new numerical strategies to simulate high speed flows interacting with magnetic
fields.
