This project is improving the chemistry, physics, physical science, and
mathematics curriculum at Central Alabama Community College through the
development of an Open Science/Mathematics Computer Laboratory. The Open
Laboratory expands the use of computers in mathematics and science classes and
laboratories using an integrated four level instructional approach. The four
levels of instruction include: (1) computer simulation, (2) data analysis and
graphing,(3) data acquisition, and (4) construction of a computer interface
device. This stepped approach is allowing students to become familiar with one
level of computer use before proceeding to the next, more difficult level of
instruction. Interactive video discs/software and conventional software,
previously used as lecture demonstrations, are being used by individual students
to enhance their laboratory experiences. Students are seeing how computer skills
important in one subject area can be applied to and overlap with other
disciplines. Russell Corporation, a local manufacturer, is matching the NSF
grant in support of the project.
