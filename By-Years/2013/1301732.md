The goal of the Arctic Human Development Report II (AHDR-II) is to provide a
second assessment and synthesis report on the state of
human&lt;br/&gt;development in the Arctic, ten years after the initial report.
This project will enable that the seven U.S. lead authors of AHDR-II
can&lt;br/&gt;participate in critical project meetings, which are typically held
in Denmark. In addition, the project will partially fund
several&lt;br/&gt;"town-hall meetings" in various arctic locations (e.g.,
Alaska, Canada, Russia, Sweden). These meetings are being held in non-
academic&lt;br/&gt;settings and are intended to stimulate feedback to draft
chapters of the report by arctic residents. Finally, the project will support
the&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of results of AHDR-II by contributions to a printed
report and through assistance for establishing and maintaining
an&lt;br/&gt;AHDR-II website, where updates and other products relevant for the
user-community will be posted in regular intervals.
