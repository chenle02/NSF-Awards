D-Q University is developing and testing new strategies, curricula, teaching
modalities, student tutorials, and course review approaches which will use
Native American history and culture to make accessible and heighten interest in
mathematics and computer science. Through the use of culturally-sensitive
content and an inter-disciplinary approach to instruction, D-Q U will develop
instructional materials emphasizing Native American cultural content for two new
classes, develop curriculum and motivational materials suitable for all schools
with Native American enrollment or an interest in the content of historical
Native American science. Project Connection can serve as the bridge connecting
American Indians to mathematics, research methods, and the environmental
sciences. The project may serve as a model for use with other ethnic or racial
groups.
