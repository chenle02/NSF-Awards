Individuals in many occupations and environmental situations can be subjected
to conditions that may have adverse effects on subjective well-being,
productivity, and performance. These conditions include the more traditional
"treatment" conditions, such as job stress, thermal stress, drugs, and sleep
loss, as well as conditions obtaining in more modern systems such as simulators
and virtual reality systems. The purpose of this effort is to provide an
objective indicator of stable baseline behaviors related to the overall status
and functional integrity of the human central nervous system. Such an index
would have obvious relevance for the safe and successful execution of regularly
controlled activities in the work-place and, at the same time, would be capable
of achieving laboratory accuracy. The activity to be monitored is the integrated
behavior of the visual system to image an object of interest on the fovea, a
coordinated behavior in humans that can be disrupted by many things. The premise
of this research is that monitoring this activity (measuring the deviation of
the eye/head from the desired position) can be a global and sensitive index of
the functional status of a person's ability to perform error-free work. To this
end, this project will validate experimentally and then produce a highly
portable device for the measurement of an individual's control of stance.
