This project is a 3D multichannel seismic reflection study of the East Pacific
Rise RIDGR 2000 Integrated Studies Site. The study will provide geometrically
correct images of the magma system using 3D migration processing and will
characterize melt distribution at the ridge axis using 3D amplitude variation
with offset analysis. The 3D data will be used to derive a detailed map of layer
2A and estimates of the crustal velocity field that can be interpreted in terms
of porosity and used to map potential fluid pathways.
