PI: Sylvester DMS-9423849 Sylvester will continue his research on inverse
problems in partial differential and ordinary differential equations, as they
relate to the determination of the properties of inhomogeneous media from
measurements made on or near the outer boundary. Applications include medical
imaging, radar imaging, and acoustical imaging in layered and non-layered media.
The goal is to develop a mathematically rigorous and numerically stable layer
stripping algorithm, first in one, and then in two and three dimensions. Partial
differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical
world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations
as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the
solutions. This may include answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness
and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods for approximation of
solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.
