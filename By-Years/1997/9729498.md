This award supports a three year project to address the problems of scale and
manageability of multicast on the Internet. Multicast shows great promise for
such applications as real-time multiparty conferencing, but is hampered by the
fact that it uses unicast routing technology which is not designed for such
applications, and deployment of the MBone isn't widespread and stable enough for
reliable communication. The PI proposes to develop tools for measurement and
monitoring the MBone to assist in a better understanding of its operation and as
a base for improving its performance, and then to implement solutions.
