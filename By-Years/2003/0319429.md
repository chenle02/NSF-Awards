This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to perform
research to design, fabricate, and test a new type, compact, high resolution,
fiber optic spectrograph combining the Rowland geometry with a single mode
optical channel waveguides and slab waveguide and with a curved, blazed echelle
grating. Original Rowland design needs no intermediate collimating or focusing
optics, has very high resolution, but suffers severe astigmatism in the third
dimension, rendering it inapplicable for fiber optics. New design overcomes this
deficiency by confining the light in the third dimension with a single mode
optical waveguide. Two new blazed echelle gratings will be formed on the
waveguide layer with reactive ion etching. Four fabricated spectrographs will be
critically tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary analysis indicates high
resolution, high wavelength density, cost competitive with any current WDM
devices. This technology's portability and fiber optic capability should permit
many other applications besides WDM, including surveillance of trace explosives,
and other molecules in vehicles, planes, and ships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
