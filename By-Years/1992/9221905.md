ABSTRACT Social attitudes are typically described as being either positive,
neutral, or negative. However, people often express ambivalence on important
social topics -- attitudes that contain a mixture of both positive and negative
sentiments. For example, research over the past 20 years has shown that many
Americans are ambivalent in their attitudes toward racial minorities and toward
physically disabled persons. Ambivalence helps to explain why a person might
sometimes treat members of a stigmatized group in a favorable or helpful way,
and at other times in an unfavorable or hurtful way. The present research
addresses two important but unresolved problems in research on attitude
ambivalence. The problem is that satisfactory methods do not yet exist for
measuring ambivalence. Thus, one part of this research focuses on developing a
valid and reliable measurement procedure. The new procedure will facilitate
research progress and can be applied in ongoing efforts to document and archive
public opinion on important social concerns. The second problem is that
relatively little is known about the structure and function of ambivalent
attitudes. it is currently believed that ambivalence is caused by a conflict in
fundamental values, and that people truly adhere to both positive and negative
sentiments at the same time. However, ambivalence may also reflect poorly
developed social attitudes, or it may reflect deliberate efforts to present
whatever social image is most desired at the time. This research seeks to
distinguish among the alternative explanations by studying cognitive processes
associated with the storage and retrieval of ambivalent attitudes. The studies
will provide a deeper understanding of why people often hold ambivalent
attitudes. Ultimately, the research will provide a theoretical basis for
developing interventions that promote interracial harmony, that encourage
healthful lifestyles, and that mobilize the Nation's efforts to remove the
social and physical barriers that often confront disabled persons.
