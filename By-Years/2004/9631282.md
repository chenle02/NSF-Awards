Abstract ATM-9631282 Overpeck, Jonathan T. University of Colorado Title: Climate
Change of the Last 500 Years: Simulations Versus Data This award will support
the scientific coordination needed to complete a 500-site global database of
annually-dated time paleoclimate time series, and document it sufficiently for
broad usage by the entire global change community. This database will be used to
map the spatio-temporal patterns of climatic variation over the past 500 years,
and thus provide the first comprehensive view of pre-anthropogenic interannual
to interdecadal climate variability. The project will coordinate the use of data
and theory to produce new timwe series of hypothesized volcanic, solar, trace-
gas, tropospheric aerosol, land-use, thermohaline and ENSO climate forcing over
the past 400 years. These time series of forcing will then be used as input to a
suite of transient climate model experiments using state-of-the-art 3-D
atmospheric and coupled atmosphere-ocean models developed at NASA GISS. The
simulated responses to the various hypothesized forcing will be compared to the
spatio-temporal patterns of change mapped out using the database. This will make
significant reductions in the uncertainty regarding the nature and causes
(natural and anthropogenic) of interannual to century-scale climate variability.
