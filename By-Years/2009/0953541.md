The cloud computing model has opened up new possibilities for the realization of
the long-cherished goal of utility computing. Utility computing represents the
desire to have IT acquired, delivered, used, paid for, and managed in a manner
similar to the way we use other commoditized utilities. The principal appeal of
utility computing lies in the systematized framework it could create for the
interaction between providers and consumers of IT resources. In particular,
utility computing should enable consumers to participate in active and informed
ways in making resource procurement decisions in a transparent ``market'' of
competing providers. Consumers of current cloud-based offerings have a limited
view of and control over resource procurement and control, a significant
hindrance in the realization of a utility. This research will develop mechanisms
and techniques that would reduce this gap, thereby helping turn cloud-based
offerings of the near future into mature utilities.

This research will define, formulate, and solve fundamentally novel resource
management problems---consumer-end metering, auditing, and dynamic mapping
between virtual and physical resources---in cloud computing. It will result in
novel utility-enabling facilities that will reduce the burden on application
developers and system administrators wishing to outsource their IT needs to the
cloud by easing and automating currently non-existent or inadequate decision-
making related to resource procurement and modulation. Prototypes and source
code will be shared with other researchers for independent use, experimentation,
and deployment. The plan for integration of teaching and research will consist
of (i) engaging undergraduates in research through REU supplements, (ii) design
of new graduate courses on this topic with projects based on cloud-hosted
teaching testbeds, and (iii) dissemination among researchers and industry via
open-source software and workshops.
