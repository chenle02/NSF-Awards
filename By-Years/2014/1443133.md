The workshop on "Taking Spectral Algorithms from Theory to Practice" is to be
held at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, Berkeley, CA, on
October 27-31, 2014. The workshop will explore the applicability of recent
developments in spectral graph theory to graph partitioning problems that arise
in areas such as image segmentation, machine learning, and scientific computing.

The funds ($30,000) will be used to support the participation of approximately
25 attendees in the workshop. Airfare and lodging will be reimbursed.
Participation by women and members of underrepresented minorities will be a
factor in the selection.
