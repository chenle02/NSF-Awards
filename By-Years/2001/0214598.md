This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
highly proton conductive, water insoluble and thermally stable electrolytes for
proton exchange membrane fuel cells, based on a hybrid membrane of a
functionalized polyoxometalate (POM) cluster in a sol-gel matrix. Phase I will
focus on developing the technology of fabrication of cathode/electrolyte and
anode/electrolyte membranes. The procured cathode/electrolyte and
anode/electrolyte membranes can then be pressed together and thermally cured to
form a cathode/electrolyte/anode membrane assembly.

The development of small fuel cell systems for residential may provide the
householder with electricity and heat at a significant saving over conventional
services. Fuel cells make distributed cogeneration a competitive alternative as
they provide a unique combination of advantages. Being small, clean and quiet,
they can be sited wherever electricity is needed, even in the most congested
urban location. Fuel cell generators can be used in hospitals and computer
centers where there is a need for uninterruptible, high quality power. Micro
fuel cells as portable generators and to replace batteries since they are quick
and easy to refuel, have longer operating times and lower operating costs.
Systems are suitable for a number of applications, including portable computers
and telephones, video cameras and generators for camping, boating and emergency
power.
