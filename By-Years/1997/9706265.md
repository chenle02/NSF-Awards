9706265 Williams The remote sensing of gas emission from volcanoes is an
important tool for understanding processes occurring within volcanoes and for
predicting their eruption. The correlation spectrometer, often referred to as
the COSPEC, has been in use for monitoring sulfur dioxide gas emissions for
almost 25 years, during which time there have been numerous modifications in its
design, in the mode of its application in the field, and in the interpretation
of the data measured. This award will support a five-day workshop that will
bring together COSPEC users from most of the world's volcano observatories (with
their instruments) in order to discuss the theory of the instrument, optimal
methods of application suited to different natural circumstances, and to
calibrate their instruments against a common sulfur dioxide emitter source. ***
