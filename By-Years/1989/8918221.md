The objective of this three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in nuclear physics between Miroslav Furic of Zagreb University and Ed V.
Hungerford of the University of Houston is to continue their examination of the
dynamics of three-nucleon absorption modes of pions, muons and kaons and their
dependence on energy and other variables. The calculational and theoretical work
will be carried out primarily at the University of Zagreb, and joint experiments
are planned at the University of Houston. The Yugoslav team will also play an
important role in the construction of a large acceptance detector. This project
was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The
award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav
institution.
