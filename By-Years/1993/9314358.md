9314358 Snider Capture of supercooled cloud droplets by snow crystals (riming)
and depostion growth (from the vapor are the mechanisms which lead to ice
crystal sizes sufficient for removal as precipitation from mid-latitude
tropospheric clouds. During ricing, cloud-droplet-dissolved pollutant gases are
incorporated into nascent precipitation particles. The efficiency of gas
scavenging during this process has been studied in both laboratory and field
experiments.conducted in natural clouds at a remote continental mountain-top
site (Elk Mountain Observatory in southeastern Wyoming) and involving
hydrophilic chemical species are proposed to provide specific information about
the extent to which trace gases are incorporated into ice crystals growing by
vapor deposition. Our experimental strategy is to grow ice crystals attached to
a ventilated substrate in water-saturated air that is pre- conditioned to remove
supercooled cloud droplets and by addition of known amounts of each study
compound (either methanol, ethanol, or normal butanol). We intend to measur, as
a function of concentrations in the gas-phase, the amount of study compound
incorporated into the sampled ice crystal. The resulting data set will afford an
examination of how both hydrophilic properties and substituent chain length
affect gas scavenging. These studies will be complimented by an examination of
the extent to which ambient amounts of these normal alcohols are retained in ice
formed by ricing. The compounds selected for study are of interest because their
lifetimes with respect to reaction with wintertime concentrations of hydroxyl
radical are generally comparable to estimated lifetimes corresponding to removal
in precipitation. Therefore, it is important to characterize the efficiency of
removal for alcohols, as well as other hydrophilic compounds, by ice-phase
hydrometeors. In addition, the selected compounds that play important roles in
the atmosphere. In addition to these studies, we plan to conduct concurrent gas-
phase measurements of the xxx alcohols and the inorganic species xxxxxxxxxx
Using the inorganic gases as tracers of air contaminated by man-made pollution,
the relative importance of biogenic and anthropogenic source processes
corresponding to the low-molecular weight alcohols will be examined.
