Under the supervision of anthropologist, Yolanda Moses at UC Riverside, Ph.D.
student Holly O Okonkwo will conduct an ethnographic study of participants in
Spellman Colleg'?s robotics program. This study will help identify the ways in
which Spelman College, a historically black women's liberal arts college
designated as an NSF Model Institution, has successfully used federal science
education policy to position itself as a national science producer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help increase our understanding of "how"
to foster inherently inclusive environments for STEM learning utilizing the
strengths of the local institution and its historical mission and thus should
contribute to NSF's mission of increasing the participation on students from
underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
(STEM) fields.
