This research program in parallel algorithms and architecture examines the
design of special purpose VLSI architectures, parallel algorithms for VLSI
architectures, and the design and analysis of reliable interconnection networks.
An innovative architecture with efficient local and global communication
features is designed to support a wide variety of computations: numerical
computations, geometric problems, graph problems, and others. The model provides
substantial speedups for a wide class of problems in these areas. The regular
near-neighbor connections made the architecture suitable for VLSI
implementation. This architecture is also well suited to many image-processing
applications. Current research is directed towards design of efficient parallel
algorithms to run on this architecture, as well as the study of the
implementation of these in VLSI.
