The multitudes of problems to be solved have the common theme of distributions
on the sphere and statistical geometry. The specific problems include the
following. Various estimation methods for distributions on spheres will be
explored. These find many applications in physics and geology. New statistical
methods will be developed for the case of "error in variables" viz. when both
the observed and control variables have error in them. Connections between
traveling salesman and clustering problems will be explored. The zeros of random
complex polynomial will be explored via special sequences of random triangles.
