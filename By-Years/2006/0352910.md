Funds are provided to develop an innovative methodology for spatially integrated
assessment of permafrost conditions at small geographical scales. The project
will use comprehensive permafrost modeling, interpolation and scaling
techniques, and a large body of empirical information to develop a hierarchical,
'telescoping' approach to (1) advance the testing and improvement of spatial
permafrost models, (2) describe the structure of heterogeneity and its
translation through a continuum of geographical scales ranging from local to
regional, continental, and circumpolar, and (3) design an optimum permafrost
observational network. The ultimate goal is to harmonize empirical observations
with spatial permafrost modeling and, as a result, increase the scientific
credibility of spatial geocryological predictions for the needs of the broader
scientific community involved in studying global change in the Arctic. In
particular, the proposed effort will:&lt;br/&gt;1. provide a comprehensive
evaluation and intercomparison of spatially oriented approaches to permafrost
modeling, and synthesize knowledge related to the current status of spatial
permafrost modeling,&lt;br/&gt;2. use results from modeling exercises to discern
weaknesses (structural and spatial) in existing observation networks, and make
recommendations about improvements to relevant observation
programs,&lt;br/&gt;3. provide a detailed small-scale characterization of
permafrost conditions consistent with observed spatial and temporal patterns,
and&lt;br/&gt;4. generate a comprehensive set of permafrost-related products
(data and models) useful to a broad group of scientists and
stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;
