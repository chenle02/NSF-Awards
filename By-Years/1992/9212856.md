This workshop facilitates inquiry of the global forces influencing changes in
property rights related to land today and over the past two centuries. One of
the workshop's key issues is: have there been converging trends in land rights
during recent world history? Another is: do certain property regimes invariably
lead to land degradation and other, negative environmental outcomes related to
the land? A dozen scholars from several different disciplines whose expertise
reaches across a number of world regions are participating in the workshop.
Specifically, they meet for four sequential sessions over a span of two years,
each presenting, critiquing and refining an analysis of these issues for a given
world region. A second stage of the workshop focuses on the development of a
synthesizing essay that looks at trends in property regimes and their influence
on environmental issues from a global perspective. The project is significant in
advancing basic understanding of the evolution of property rights due to its
transnational focus and contributing to global policy debates about how to
govern human use of land in the contemporary world.
