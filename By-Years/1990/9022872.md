This project will provide support for planning activities to launch the
Curriculum Action Project of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). This
project is a comprehensive national effort to stimulate and amplify efforts to
strengthen the mathematical sciences at the undergraduate level. The primary
objective of the planning period is to develop and disseminate an intellectual
agenda for undergraduate mathematics that can guide the National Science
Foundation, the MAA, and the broader mathematical community. A secondary
objective is to initiate a broad-based dialogue about this agenda both within
the mathematics community and with the many external constituencies whose own
efforts are loosely linked to collegiate mathematics. The project's long-term
goals are to promote curriculum reform; to identify and publicize examples of
effective innovation; to reshape faculty attitudes; to improve quantitative
literacy; and to align assessment with appropriate curriculum objectives. The
MAA will convene a series of focus groups to help identify issues and
recommendations, will enlist its twenty- nine regional sections to initiate
grass-root discussions, and will prepare a report for wide distribution. The MAA
plans to extend this project in subsequent years to help promote widespread
implementation of effective approaches to collegiate mathematics.
