This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and
materials chemistry. This project would support a project funded by the NSF
Materials Chemistry Initiative involving collaborative research between
Professors Royce W. Murray and Euguen A. Irene in the Chemistry Department and
Professor Marvin Silver of the Physics Department at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. This research is aimed at understanding the property-
structure relationships in thin molecular films. A kinetic and mechanistic level
understanding of the electrodeposition and electropolymerization chemistry that
forms ultrathin dielectric and electron conductive films is to be conducted.
Spectroscopic methods will be used to characterize the films.
