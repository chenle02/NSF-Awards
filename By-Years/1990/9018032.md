The evolution of red supergiant stars to white dwarfs through the "planetary
nebula nucleus" (PPN) stage occurs very quickly and is therefore one of the most
poorly understood stages of stellar evolution. It is also a very important
stage. It is during this time that a star returns many of the intermediate-
weight elements (such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) into interstellar space,
from which new generations of stars are eventually formed once again. The PI
proposes a program first, to identify new PPN candidates and, second, to
determine their spectral energy distributions. This information will be used
ultimately to infer the distribution of ages and thereby to do a sensitve
"census" of their properties as they evolve through this brief phase. This study
requires a great deal of data analysis and reduction, preferably on a dedicated
computer. This award will support the purchase of a workstation to perform these
tasks.
