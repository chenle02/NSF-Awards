This Small Business Innovation Research Project will develop an innovative
approach for epitaxial deposition of high quality thick (Al)(In)(Ga)N layers
with low dislocation density. Accomplishment of the proposed effort will provide
technology for next generation UV LED structures, which currently require
improvements in growth of thick and doped AlGaN layers with low density of
threading dislocations and point defects.

(Al)(In)(Ga)N based deep UV LEDs represent a new class of compact and
environmentally stable semiconductor UV light sources. Deep UV LEDs penetrate
existing markets that require compact, rugged and environmentally friendly UV
radiation sources. This innovative technology is positioned to create new
applications that were previously unattainable due to the inherent limitations
of existing UV lamps or lasers. Primary markets include water/air disinfection,
bio-medical and analytical instrumentation, fluorescence sensing, ink curing,
and phototherapy.
