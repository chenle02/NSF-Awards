This project deals with the basic study of enhancing the dynamic stability of
cantilever tooling structures such as boring bars, internal grinding mandrels,
and milling cutter used in machining. The damping and stiffness of cantilever
boring bars are increased by using composite structures and by coupling
auxiliary mass with energy dissipative material for the main structure.
Vibration or chatter experienced in machining using a long, slender cantilever
tooling limits the metal removal rates, reduces tool life, and effects the
finish and accuracy of machined parts. Manufacturing costs are increased due to
additional secondary operations required to produce the parts to the desired
finish and accuracy. Advancements in this area will enable reduction in the
manufacturing costs.
