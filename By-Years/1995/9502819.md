This award supports the continued study of certain invariants, known as local
Chern characters, defined for modules over Noetherian rings. While numerous
properties of these invariants have recently been discovered, there are still
many open questions. The main line of study concerns invariants defined by
matrices in a free resolution of a module over a local ring, where relations
between these invariants and classical results in commutative algebra have led
to new interpretations of them, which, although they are still conjectural in
many cases, give much easier methods for their computation. Another line of
research concerns the details of the construction itself, and gives alternative
definitions for intersection multiplicities, leading, among other things, to a
new approach to Serre's positivity conjecture. This research is concerned with a
number of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic
geometry studies solutions of families of polynomial equations. One can either
study the geometry of the solution set or approach problems algebraically by
investigating certain functions on the solution set that form what is called a
commutative ring. This dual perspective creates a close connection between
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
