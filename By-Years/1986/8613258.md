Basically, this is an extension of the theory of Woodward and Hoffmann (for
which they won a Nobel prize) for homogeneous systems to heterogeneous systems,
specifically solid surfaces. The project involves computation of reaction
probabilities, experimental confirmation of predictions, and reduction of
results to a simple physical model which could be applied without extensive
calculations. The conceptual framewrok proposed has potential to revolutionize
thinking on surface reactivity.
