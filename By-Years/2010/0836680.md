This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Development of the NanoEngineering Minor Option (NEMO) at the
University of Houston (UH), under the direction of Dr. Dmitri Litvinov, will
introduce nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through a variety of
interdisciplinary approaches into undergraduate education. The proposed program
will integrate and expand the existing nanotechnology courses into a
comprehensive nanoengineering program. The impact and associated outcomes of
this program is in training engineers who will be prepared for the challenges of
the emerging nannotechnology job sector.
