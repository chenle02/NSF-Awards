The University of California at Irvine Chemistry Outreach Program directed by
Professor James S. Nowick is being supported by the Special Projects Office of
the Chemistry Division for a three-year period of transition from a pilot
program to long-term funding from the private sector. The Chemistry Outreach
Program aims to improve high school students' interest in and knowledge of
chemistry by sending teams of graduate and undergraduate students to local high
schools. The university students inspire the high school students by performing
chemical demonstrations and discussing chemistry, beginning with freshmen
students who are encouraged to enroll in chemistry classes. The program, which
reaches about two thousand high school students per year at dozens of Southern
California high schools, will establish a web site for dissemination of the
instructional materials that it develops and for propagation of this model
program as a grassroots effort in educational outreach. The Chemistry Outreach
Program is a university-based effort to improve scientific literacy and inspire
young people to pursue careers in science through the vehicle of chemistry
demonstrations and discussions in high schools provided by undergraduate and
graduate students from the university.
