9353495 Brennan "How Things Fly" is a major new exhibit gallery being produced
by the National Air and Space Museum and is scheduled to open in 1995. The goal
of this permanent exhibition is to convey, to the broadest possible audience,
the essential principles by which aircraft and spacecraft fly. "How Things Fly"
represents an important departure from other exhibitions at the Museum in both
content and execution. Instead of relying on static displays of historical
artifacts, "How Things Fly" will use interactive devices and live demonstrations
designedto spark curiosity, invite visitor participation, and provide children
and adults with the opportunity to discover for themselves answers to some of
their fundamental questions about flight. "How Things Fly" will be the first
major exhibiton at the Museum devoted entirely to hands-on learning. It will
incorporate some of the best interactive exhibitry ideas from othermuseums,
improve upon them where possible, and include a substantial number of original
exhibits. While intended to help visitors more fully appreciate the Museum's
collection, the cooperative efforts, such as publications, a traveling
exhibition, and educational outreach programs, will extend the exhibition's
impact across the nation. ***
