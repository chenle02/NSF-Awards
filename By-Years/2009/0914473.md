This project is a study of the transport and dispersion of the stable isotopes
of water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The
isotopic species of interest are 18O-CO2, 18O-H2O and 13C-CO2. These isotopes
offer powerful insights into the carbon and water fluxes on land. This study
will explore the extent to which the local atmospheric budgets of these isotopes
are linked to wind circulation on land. The primary method to be deployed is a
large eddy simulation (LES) model that is dynamically coupled with the isotopic
parameterization of land surface processes. LES simulations will be conducted to
quantify the relationships of the surface and the entrainment isotopic fluxes to
turbulent motion in the ABL. The LES calculations and the isotopic
parameterization will be validated against new datasets obtained in a soybean
ecosystem and on a tall tower in the Upper Midwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators plan several tasks to facilitate use of their results. Animation
movies made of the LES results will be integrated into the principal
investigator's graduate course on boundary layer meteorology and made available
to the public on a Yale website and on YouTube. A post-doctoral fellow and a PhD
student will be trained on the state of the art ABL modeling techniques. The
isotope-LES model algorithm and the datasets used for model development will be
made available to the public.
