In this study, Dr. Michael Arnold and his colleagues will analyze natural
hybridization between the Louisiana iris species, I.fulva and I.hexagona. The
genetic interaction between these two species has been used as the classic
example of the process of interspecific gene flow. In order to study the pattern
of transfer of genetic material between these two species, the investigators
have established an experimental hybrid population in southern Louisiana.
Individuals of I. hexagona were introduced into a natural population of I. Fulva
and were allowed to flower during the spring of 1990. Leaf material and seeds
have been collected from each of the flowering individuals of both species.
Genetic markers that are diagnostic for either I. fulva or I. hexagona will be
examined using material isolated form the leaf and seed samples. This will allow
a test to determine whether or not hybrids have been formed and whether
hybridization occurs bi-directionally (ie., with I. fulva and I. hexagona acting
both maternal and paternal parents). These data will allow an estimate of the
effects of natural selection on hybridization between these two species by
comparing the proportion of interspecific versus intraspecific offspring that
are produced.
