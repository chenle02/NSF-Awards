This project is mathematical research in the representation theory of Lie
groups. A suitable example of the latter is the group of rotations of a sphere.
Groups like this are important because they occur in many areas of mathematics (
e.g. geometry, differential equations,algebraic number theory, mathematical
physics ) as groups of symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take
advantage of symmetries in solving problems. More specifically, the three
principal investigators will study algebraic and analytic localizations of
representations, in the context of D-modules and Harish-Chandra modules. The
overall theme is to get back and forth between various accounting schemes for
the representations of a given group. This work involves techniques and ideas
from several areas of mathematics, for instance algebraic geometry and complex
geometry.
