The conference "Representation Theory XV" will be held June 18-25, 2017 at the
Inter-University Center, Dubrovnik, Croatia. This conference will bring together
about sixty junior and senior participants interested in mathematical research
related to representation theory. This award will support the participation of
US-based graduate students, junior faculty, and researchers without other
federal funds in the conference. The conference will provide an excellent
opportunity for these US-based researchers to interact with a large cohort of
international experts. Expository talks by senior researchers will introduce
junior researchers to the frontiers of mathematical research in the topics of
the conference and the conference will provide a focused setting for
dissemination of new results and for new collaborations.

The conference is intended to be an important occasion for deepening and
expanding our understanding of representation theory. The scientific focus of
the conference is representation theory, with particular emphasis on
representations of vertex algebras, W-algebras, Kac-Moody Lie algebras and their
quantum deformations, representations of reductive Lie groups, and Dirac
operators in representation theory. More information about the conference,
including invited speakers and abstracts, can be found at the conference
