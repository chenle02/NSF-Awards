This award will support activities during a planned "Emphasis Year in Dynamical
Systems" at Northwestern University during the 2010-11 academic year. The
emphasis year, funded in part by the Northwestern Department of Mathematics
Department, will feature both long- and short-term visiting scholars,
postdoctoral positions in dynamical systems, and the annual Midwest Dynamical
Systems Conference.

The semester's programs are specifically organized around the research areas of
ergodic theory, discrete group actions, Hamiltonian dynamics, and smooth and
geometric dynamics, with an organizing theme of "Trends in Dynamics for the
Coming Decade." This theme will guide the events of the year and will be the
title and focus of a concluding major conference to be held in Spring 2011. The
funding will be used to support both visitors to the department and participants
in the conference, increasing collaboration within and across disciplines. Much
of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians, particularly
postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and junior faculty, who do not have
their own sources of support.
