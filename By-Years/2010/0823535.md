This award will provide funds to test three hypotheses related to the formation
of intermediate and deep water in the Nordic Seas north of Iceland.
Specifically, was 1) Denmark Straight Overflow Water (DSOW) formation dampened
by freshening of Atlantic Water entering the Nordic Seas through the end of the
deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, ca. 6,700 cal years ago? 2) Does the
middle Holocene interval of greatest DSOW flow correspond to a time of minimal
freshwater forcing from north and south and maximal salinity and inflow of the
Irminger Current? 3) Was diminished DSOW formation in the late Holocene due to
freshwater forcing from the Arctic Ocean by southward advancing Polar Water and
sea ice? These hypotheses will be tested via analyses of sediment geochemistry
and Mg/Ca, d18O and Cd/Ca of foraminifera assemblages from a suite of North
Atlantic deep sea cores, as part of a broader international collaboration
including the IPY project WARMPAST. Broader impacts include graduate and
undergraduate involvement in the research, a strong international collaborative
component and research on a societally-relevant scientific question related to
ocean-climate linkages and mechanisms of climate change during the Holocene
(last 10,000 years).
