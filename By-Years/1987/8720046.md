ANALYSIS OF LASER FLUORESCENCE FOR BIOSENSING ABSTRACT This proposal seeks to
develop a new optical technique for sensing biomolecules. The sensing principle
is based on laser induced fluorescence. A fiber optic laser fluorescence probe
is easily sterilizable for use in fermentors. This type of probe is inherently
safe, has low signal attenuation and high data transfer rates, and can be
multiplexed. Experiments with mixtures of known concentrations of fluorophores
and pulp liquor will be carried out to develop this technique. A focus of the
proposal will be on numerical approaches to deconvolute multicomponent
fluorescence spectra. To overcome the problem of lack of specificity, a
mathematical technique of partial least squares (PLS) analysis will be employed.
Several approaches to improving the PLS method, including neurocomputing, are to
be investigated. The proposed research involves collaboration between
researchers at the University of Maryland and the National Bureau of Standards
(NBS). Experimental data will be taken at the NBS facility in Gaithersburg and
analyzed at the University of Maryland in College Park.
