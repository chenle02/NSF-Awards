The principal investigator will continue his investigation of the G-theory of
group rings and K-theory using Yao's noncommutative localization theorem. He
will also continue his research in spectral geometry. In particular he will
study Riemannian orbifolds and geometric invariants which detect isospectral
deformations. This award will support research in the general area of
differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of
the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined
on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
