Aquatic larvae of the midge, Chironomus, produce silk-like fibers which are
composite polymers of secretory proteins synthesized by the larval salivary
glands. How these proteins assemble into water-insoluble fibers as they exit the
gland through the salivary duct is not known. The special lobe of Chironomus
thummi salivary glands consists of four cells which synthesize a unique
secretory protein, ssp160. The proximity of the special lobe to the salivary
duct implies that ssp160 may somehow be involved in the assembly and processing
of secretory proteins into supramolecular fibers as they exit the gland via the
duct. The objectives of this proposal are to learn: 1) the primary structure of
ssp160 by cloning and sequencing its cDNA, 2) determine the level at which its
cell- specific synthesis is regulated by measuring in vivo rates of
transcription and steady-state levels of mRNA and protein, and 3) begin to
dissect its involvement in Chironomid secretory protein disassembly and
reassembly in vitro. %%% This project will enhance our understanding of the
composition, assembly and processing of a unique biomaterial, Chironomid silk.
Furthermore, the information gained will be applicable to the design of novel
peptide-based biomolecular materials.
