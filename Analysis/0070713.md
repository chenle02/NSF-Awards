This award is for the partial support of a series of conferences in the field of
Dynamical Systems in the Spring of 2001, 2002 and 2003. The goals of the
conferences are "to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems and
related fields ... and to contribute to the training of graduate students and
recent Ph.D. recipients". The strength of the group of organizers at the
University of Maryland and past successes of the conferences held there suggest
that the planned conferences will be successful as well. I strongly recommend
the award.
