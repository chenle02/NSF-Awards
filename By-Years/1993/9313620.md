9313620 Paczynski This research will be devoted to a theoretical search for
signatures of supermassive black holes in active (AGN) and inactive (IGN)
galactic nuclei. In spite of decades of considerable effort no firm proof is
available for the presence of supermassive black holes though very few
astrophysicists doubt their existence. The work on AGNs will concentrate on
various effects of gravitational microlensing of the optical and X-ray emission
from the select group of quadruply macro-lensed quasars, line the "Einstein
cross" and the "clover leaf." Gravitational microlensing offers a possibility to
study the source structure on the smallest scale the structure exists, all the
way down to the Schwarzschield radius of a black hole. The primary goal will be
to find a way to prove or disprove the presence of supermassive black holes in
AGNs by finding what effects the finest space structure present in the source
may have on the observed brightness variability, and how to detect the presence
or absence of thick accretion disks formed from stars disrupted by the
supermassive black holes. The primary goal will be to find if the presence or
absence of evidence for star disruption and accretion can be used as evidence
for or against the presence of supermassive black holes in IGNs. The Principal
Investigator is regarded as an outstanding theoretical astrophysicist. ***
