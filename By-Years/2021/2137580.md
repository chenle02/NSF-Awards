This award is made as part of the FY 2021 Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend). Each fellowship
supports a research and training project at a host institution in the
mathematical and physical sciences, including applications to other disciplines,
under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. This fellowship to Dr. Juan
Chamorro supports his research project entitled “Discovery-Driven Search for
Polar Electronic Phases.” The host institution for the fellowship is the
University of California at Santa Barbara, and the sponsoring scientists are
Drs. Ram Seshardri and Rob Wilson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Chamorro’s project
hypothesis is that polar electronic states, such as polar metals and
superconductors, can potentially arise in carrier-doped ferroelectric and polar
insulators depending on the strength of the doped electron-polar phonon
coupling. If this coupling is weak, a polar metal state may arise. If this
coupling is sufficiently strong, the destabilization of the ferroelectric state
may give rise to superconductivity. The fellow will be co-advised by Seshadri
and Wilson to test this hypothesis at the University of California, Santa
Barbara (UCSB). He will perform theoretical calculations, experiments, and
measurements using the facilities available at UCSB. The work will also include
collaboration with another group to perform optical experiments on polar
electronic material candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
