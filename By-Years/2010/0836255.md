The 17th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and
Networks&lt;br/&gt;(ICCCN?08) will be held in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands,
USA from August 3 to&lt;br/&gt;August 7, 2008. This preeminent technical
conference is the primary venue for presenting&lt;br/&gt;new research results in
the area of computer communications and is widely attended
by&lt;br/&gt;researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences
such as ICCCN is highly&lt;br/&gt;valuable for graduate students? research and
career development. Participants have the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to present their
work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, and interact&lt;br/&gt;with many
others performing state-of-the-art research in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to support
approximately eight graduate students in the&lt;br/&gt;United States to attend
ICCCN?08. The travel awards will target graduate students,
in&lt;br/&gt;particular female and under-represented minority students, since
they often have limited&lt;br/&gt;travel funds to attend conferences, which is
an important part of their
educational&lt;br/&gt;experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
