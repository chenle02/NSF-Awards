Two new mass spectrometers will be purchased and in the Department of Geology
and Geophysics at the University of California- Berkeley. They will be the
primary analytical tools of a new Center for Isotope Geochemistry that is being
jointly supported by the Berkeley campus and the adjacent Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory. One of the machines is a single-collector model configured to
maximize the possibility of obtaining isotope ratio precision at the ppm level
and will be used initially to measure strontium 87/86 isotope ratios in marine
precipitates. The other instrument will be configured as a multi-collector
instrument to increase sample throughput so that certain types of data-intensive
research problems can be undertaken. The Berkeley Center for Isotope
Geochemistry is intended to be a science center which will have as its goals the
improvement of isotopic geochemical tools and the broadening of their
application to earth sciences. The Principal Investigator of this project has
been appointed as the first director of the center.
