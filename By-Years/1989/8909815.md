Liquid crystals which possess orientational ordering but no positional ordering
come in several different forms, most of which have been discovered only in
recent years. These include some rather exotic structures, such as the cubic
lattice blue phases and the amorphous fog phase found in cholesterics of high
optical activity, and the biaxial nematic first discovered in a certain soap
solution. It presents a series of optical experiments designed to probe the
phase transitions of these materials. Their goal is to contribute to a better
understanding of the many varieties of critical phenomena exhibited by systems,
such as these, having tensor order parameters.
