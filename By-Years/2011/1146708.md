A long "cramming" session is a much less effective way of learning than are
multiple training sessions separated by an hour or more (i.e., spaced trials).
Does this basic characteristic of learning reflect limits imposed by an
unrecognized feature of the brain mechanisms that encode memory? If so, is it
possible to circumvent these limits so as to accelerate learning? The present
work builds on recent discoveries from this investigator's laboratory to address
these fundamental questions. Techniques targeted at different neurobehavioral
levels will be used: i) electrical recordings from brain cells to analyze
memory-related changes, ii) locally developed light microscopy techniques to
measure chemical signaling at the junction between two brain cells (i.e.,
synapses), and iii) behavioral procedures for measuring learning by animals in
naturalistic, complex environments. Previous work by this investigator showed
that an unusual class of brain proteins called integrins regulates synapses in a
memory-related brain region and that these proteins have novel properties that
produce a phenomenon at the level of the synapse that resembles the spaced
trials effect seen in learning studies. Because the time frame under study
approximates that of a classroom session, these studies could add an entirely
new dimension to brain-based strategies for improving education. They will also
suggest pharmacological means for manipulating the timing rules that govern the
formation of stable memories. Finally, the program will provide a unique
opportunity for students (undergraduate through post-doctoral), several of whom
are from minority groups, to work together on a problem that is critical to
basic science and as well to society.
