A international conference on the subject of "Sensors and Sensing in Biology and
Engineering" to be jointly supported by NSF, ONR and AFOSR, is organized and
will be held in Calabria Italy in October, 2008.

The proposed conference is to provide a needed forum for natural and physical-
chemical scientists, mathematicians and engineers to share in depth knowledge as
well as new concepts and theories, discoveries, and research technologies
related to both biological and artificial sensors and sensing. A sub set (10
-15) of the written will be published by Springer-Verlag. The conference will
examine the current knowledge base of sensors and sensing in biology and
engineering with a view to defining the "state-of-the-art" and identifying new,
exciting and profitable areas of activity; help establish lasting relationships
among subsets of the conference attendees ; and provide badly needed feedback to
the scientific community and the funding agencies, especially NSF, concerning
what are the main impediments and the grand challenges impacting advances in the
fundamental understanding and practical applications of bio-inspired sensors and
sensing.
