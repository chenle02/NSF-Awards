Professors De Lucia and Herbst are continuing their studies of radiative and
collisional properties involving small fundamental molecular species. This
collaborative experimental and theoretical program, supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, provides important basic scientific
information of potential use in various diverse fields, including molecular
astrophysics, quantum electronics, and atmospheric science. Using the tools of
millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy, De Lucia and Herbst are studying the
collisions of gas phase species at very low temperatures (below 5 K), the
mechanisms and the modeling of intermolecular rotational energy transfer, and
the spectroscopy of internal rotor states in various simple molecules.
