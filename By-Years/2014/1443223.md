The Modeling Hydrologic Systems in Elementary Science (MoHSES) project involves
research and development to investigate 3rd-grade students' model-based
reasoning about hydrologic systems and how teachers scaffold students'
engagement in modeling practices. The research builds upon existing modeling
frameworks to guide the development and integration of a long-term conceptual
modeling task into the Full Option Science System (FOSS) Water module. The
participants in the study include ten 3rd-grade elementary teachers recruited
from diverse settings. The team utilizes an extensive classroom observation
system, in-depth interviews with students and teachers, and student artifacts to
investigate the following research questions: (1) How do 3rd-grade students
construct, use, evaluate, and revise conceptual models of groundwater systems to
reason about geospheric components of the water cycle? (2) Are 3rd-grade
students able to construct more scientifically-accurate models of groundwater
cycling over time? (3) What instructional strategies do 3rd-grade teachers use
to support students' model-based reasoning about groundwater systems?

This research can help build a foundation in model-based reasoning about complex
global environmental and scientific phenomena in early learners. Investigations
of elementary students' model-based reasoning about the water cycle, are largely
absent from the literature. The data collected from this project can help inform
science curriculum materials development and elementary teacher preparation
efforts designed to foster reform-oriented, model-centered elementary science
learning environments. This research also informs the development of learning
progressions that account for elementary students' learning within a core
component of the Earth Sciences.
