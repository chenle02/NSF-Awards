This award will provide support for Juan Redondo, who is a postdoc at the
University of Michigan working with Professor Jeff Rauch. Dr. Redondo plans to
continue his study of the regularity of free boundaries in the solutions of
parabolic variational inequalities like the ones associated with the classical
Stefan problem. He is also going to investigate the regularity of shock wave
solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws by applying his variational techniques
to the parabolic systems that come from adding viscous terms to the original
hyperbolic systems. Nonlinear partial differential equations describe many
dissipative phenomena like the flow of heat. If the amount of dissipation is
small the solutions of such equations often behave as if there is no dissipation
at all. In this grant the postdoc, Juan Redondo, will use techniques from
variational theory that exploit this relationship between dissipative and non-
dissipative systems in order to study things like the shape of a boundary
between different materials and the sharpness of a front between gases of
different densities.
