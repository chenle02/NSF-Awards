The proposed research concerns the role of water and hydroxide in nominally
anhydrous materials. The focus of the study will be on determining the "sites"
of these hydrous components in the host phase, on correlation of species type
and concentration with properties of the host phase, and on elucidating changes
in these species among various geologic environments. This will be accomplished
through a program of spectroscopic investigations and computer simulations of
both natural and laboratory- synthesized silicate and oxide phases. Results of
the research should increase our understanding of the manner in which these
trace "hydrous" components influence properties such as mechanical strength,
optical behavior, dielectric constants, and response to ionizing radiation of
the host phase.
