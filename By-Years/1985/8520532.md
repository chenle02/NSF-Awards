The highway bridges of the United States are fast deteriorating and/or becoming
obsolete due to aging of the material, corrosion, insufficient capacity, or
changes in alignment, thus becoming inadequate. This workshop will perform three
functions: (1)determine state-of-the-art of bridge design and construction
(2)indentify non-seismic research needs for repair, retrofit, etc.; and
(3)indentify priorities of research.
