The Department of Mathematics at Colorado State University will purchase a color
graphics workstation that will be dedicated to support research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: 1. Low-dimensional characterization of large-scale
patterns in dynamic systems (M. Kirby) 2. The Vesalius Project (H.P Miranda).
Each of these projects requires extensive code development, with a heavy
emphasis on graphical output.
