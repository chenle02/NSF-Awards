Professor James L. Skinner is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop theoretical models which will assist
chemists in interpreting experimental spectroscopic data for liquids. Skinner
will develop theories for interpreting relaxation rates for chemical processes
occuring in liquids which may be studied using experimental spectroscopic
techniques such as NMR, ESR, vibrational and optical spectroscopy. Skinner will
perform theoretical research in three general areas of statistical mechanics: 1)
He will develop stochastic models for describing population and phase relaxation
observed in NMR, ESR, vibrational and optical spectroscopy; 2) He will develop a
theory to deal with lineshapes of optical spectroscopically measured impurities
in the liquid phase; and 3) He will use a new approach which he has named
quantum- connectivity- renormalization-theory to study localization in models
with liquid-like order.
