This program of research is aimed at gaining a general understanding of the
design process, developing new forms of computer tools and methods for
designers, and implementing and evaluating these tools in a realistic design
environment. The research will be carried out by an interdisciplinary design
team of faculty associated with the Exploratory Design Laboratory (EDL). The
research will focus on three areas: 1) computer tools for aiding design problem
formulation, 2) adaptation of analysis tools to design tools, and 3) methods and
computer tools for rapid prototyping. The result of this research will be
computer-based aids to designers in each of these three areas as well as a
continuing improvement in understanding and implementation of modern design
methods. These aids and methods will be tested in a structured graduate
educational program. In the EDL, students have proven to be an excellent
resource for trying out new ideas, for getting useful feedback, and for
propagating successful ideas. Through the use of guides, software, and remote
access to implementation servers, the research results will be rapidly
disseminated into research and educational communities.
