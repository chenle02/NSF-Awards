Modern Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) offer more parallelism and higher memory
bandwidth than CPUs. This project aims to take advantage of these properties by
developing a system to efficiently process database queries over GPU-resident
datasets. To achieve this goal this project employs the following approaches:
(a) The development of novel indexing techniques that combine multidimensional
partitioning with block-oriented bitmaps, and whose parameters are sensitive to
the query distribution;(b) The optimization of memory bank contention and value
contention between threads; (c) The efficient implementation of a complete set
of relational database operators, including aggregation, joins, and indexed
selections; and (d) The evaluation of the performance of the system on query-
intensive workloads, using real applications and standard benchmarks.
Improvements in database system performance would have wide-ranging impact on
the efficiency of many enterprises that employ database systems for analytics.
The project supports PhD students working on database system implementation
techniques. The innovations and software created during the project will be used
to enhance the curriculum of the Database Systems Implementation course at
Columbia University. Publications, software, and other project data will be
disseminated via the web at our project web site
(http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/gpuproject.html).
