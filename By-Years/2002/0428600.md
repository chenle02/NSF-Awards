0428600 Papautsky The goal of this research is to develop a culture-based sensor
with microfluidic sample preparation and direct electronic imaging for rapid
tracking of environmental microorganisms and to demonstrate this new sensor
technology as an effective replacement of existing microbial monitoring tools.

The specific aims of the proposed research are three-fold: (1) identify factors
that affect selective adhesion and growth of microorganisms on miniaturized,
culture-based sensors; (2) integrate culture-based sensor technology with a
microfluidic platform and direct electronic imaging to rapidly track
microorganisms; and (3) benchmark culture-based sensor in head-to-head
comparisons with molecular biology-based tools to identify and quantify Gram
positive, mycolic acid containing Actinomycetes (e.g., mycobacteria and
nocardioforms) in environmental samples.
