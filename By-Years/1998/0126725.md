Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing opportunities for
students to design, conduct, analyze, and report on inquiry-based laboratory
projects in developmental biology by adapting from the contemporary research
literature techniques of microsurgery, microinjection, and digital imaging for
use by undergraduates. These research techniques are being implemented within
inquiry-based undergraduate laboratory projects that investigate cell fate, cell
morphology, and organogenesis. Thus, students have valuable opportunities to
incorporate&lt;br/&gt;some of the most important and broadly applicable
techniques of modern developmental biology research within experimental
questions of their own design. By actively engaging students in all phases of
scientific inquiry from experimental design through execution, analysis, and
communication, students learn valuable technical, intellectual, communicative,
and collaborative skills. Further, students are merging both classical
embryology and modern developmental biology to obtain unique first-hand
perspectives on how animal form and function arise.
