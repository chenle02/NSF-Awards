Dr. Weisberg will carry out a research program on pulsars in three areas: (i)
Studies of relativistic gravitation with the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16. The data
will be used to study gravitational wave emission from the binary orbiting
system, the cosmic background of ultra-long period gravitational radiation, time
variation of the Newtonian gravitational constant, and geodetic spin precession.
(ii) Measurements of pulsar distances and the interstellar medium. The data
should yield pulsar distances, interstellar electron densities, and details of
the small-scale structure of cool neutral atomic hydrogen. (iii) A pulsar timing
and polarimetry survey. Approximately one hundred pulsars will be monitored
quarterly to measure pulse arrival times and polarization properties of the
emission. These data will be used to study pulse emission mechanisms, glitches,
timing noise, slow scintillations, and free precession. Pulsars observed at
radio wavelengths are among the best probes of relativistic gravitation and the
diffuse interstellar medium. Analysis of pulsar signals has led to the first
experimental proof of the existence of gravitational radiation, limits on the
energy density of a cosmic background of gravitational radiation, and
measurements of the electron density and magnetic field of the interstellar
medium. Dr. Weisberg will continue his highly regarded investigations of
relativistic gravitation and the interstellar medium, in addition to studying
the intrinsic properties of radio wavelength emissions from pulsars. This award
is made under the auspices of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
program at the National Science Foundation.
