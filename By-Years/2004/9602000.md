The main thesis of our investigation is to understand the dynamics of hadronic
and nuclear systems in relation to underlying dynamics of the fundamental
degrees of freedom, the quarks and gluons. Among the specific topics to be
studied are: (1) the quark structure of hadrons; (2) vector meson propagation in
nuclear matter; (3) proton-antiproton annihilation; (4) consequences of nuclear
chiral perturbation theory; (5) QCD sum rules applied to nuclear systems; and
(6) neutrino-nucleus reactions and their astrophysical applications.
