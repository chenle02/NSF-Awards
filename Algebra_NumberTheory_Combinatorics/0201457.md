Abstract

The investigator and his colleagues are studying problems in analytic number
theory centered mainly on the Riemann-zeta function and L-functions, and
relations between their zeros and the primes. Two projects focus on the
remarkable, recently discovered applications of random matrix theory to the
zeta-function. Keating and Snaith's characteristic polynomial model of the zeta-
function is providing heuristic answers to many previously intractable problems
in analytic number theory. However, a serious drawback of the model is that it
does not contain the primes. Instead, they have to be inserted in an ad hoc
manner with each new application. The investigator and his colleagues have a new
model that explicitly integrates the primes and zeros in a most natural way.
They are applying it to a variety of problems, such as moment and order
estimates for the zeta-function, and they expect it to give them new insights
into the connections between the zeros and the primes. A related project
explores the relations between the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble Conjecture on the
zeros, the distribution of primes and almost-primes, and mean-value theorems
involving the Riemann zeta-function. They also study geometrical aspects of the
zeta-function, such as its curvature near the critical line, and the size of
gaps between zeros. Two final problems lie in an altogether different area of
number theory. These concern additive patterns of elements in the multiplicative
group of a finite field and the related question of the value distribution of
incomplete exponential sums containing multiplicative characters.

This is a project in the area of mathematics known as number theory. The
fundamental questions of interest in number theory have to do with the structure
of numbers, and in particular the prime numbers, as these are the fundamental
building blocks of arithmetic and, therefore, of much of mathematics. Many of
the most important questions in this area are so intractable that it is
impossible even to guess correct answers to them. Recently, a remarkable
partnership has developed between theoretical physicists and analytic number
theorists, which is succeeding in answering some of these questions. At the
center of this collaboration is a model of something called the Riemann zeta-
function, which is a special mathematical function known for over a century to
encode within its properties a great deal of information about prime numbers.
This model is based on the theory of random matrices, objects previously used to
model complicated physical systems such as heavy nuclei. Although the model has
been quite successful, it has the serious drawback of not containing the prime
numbers which, after all, are the principal objects of interest. The
investigator and his colleagues have now developed a model that does integrate
the primes and zeros in a most natural way, and a main goal of this project is
to explore further applications of our new model. A related project concerns
arithmetic and analytic consequences of a widely believed conjecture about the
zeros of the zeta-function. Using recent developments in the field, we also
investigate geometrical aspects of the zeta-function such as its curvature, and
gap sizes between its zeros. Two problems in a different area of number theory
concern the structure of finite fields, objects with important applications to
coding theory and cryptography.
