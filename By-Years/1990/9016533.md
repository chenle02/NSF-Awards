This award supports continuing investigations, at both optical and radio
wavelength, of gravitational lenses. The principle investigator is one of the
worlds leading investigators of these objects. In addition to the study of
individual objects, the completion of a large survey will provide further new
examples of gravitational lenses, which may be used to investigate important
questions of cosmology and the distribution of mass in the universe.
