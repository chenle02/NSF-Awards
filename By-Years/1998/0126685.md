Mathematical Sciences (21) This proof-of-concept (POC) project is developing and
evaluating a set of curriculum modules in knot theory for use in courses that
typically comprise a pre-service teacher program. The PIs aim to graduate
teachers who "learn mathematics in a coherent fashion that emphasizes the
interconnections among theory, procedures and applications," and who "develop
the habits of mind of a mathematical thinker" (CBMS, 2000). Since knot theory
draws on connections with diverse types of mathematics, it has the potential to
integrate well into courses on geometry, topology, combinatorics, discrete
mathematics, or graph theory. Java applications are being developed to
illustrate the Jones polynomial in a dynamic and visual context. Additionally,
the project team is conducting research that addresses the mathematical
knowledge and the beliefs about mathematics of preservice and practicing
secondary mathematics teachers.
