This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008.
The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for
the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The
title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Ludmilla
Aristilde is "Investigating Cellular Regulation in Marine Phytoplankton" The
host institution for this research is Princeton University and the sponsoring
scientist is Dr. Fran√ßois M. M. Morel.

Phytoplankton in the ocean play a major role in global carbon and sulfur cycles
by creating and secreting many different carbon-rich and sulfur-containing
compounds, which affect both the chemistry of the ocean and the dynamics of
microbial and algal foodwebs. Using Emilina huxleyi as a model organism, this
research seeks to understand how and where in the cell one of these sulfur-
containing compounds, dimethylsulfoniopropionate, is synthesized and the
relationship of this synthesis to photosynthetic reactions in the plankton.

The training objectives are to learn a combination of microbiological and
biochemical techniques to address a problem of global importance at the
molecular level and to work at the interface of environmental health and
environmental biology. As atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to
increase and the temperature of the ocean surface also continues to rise,
plankton species may be seen to alter their metabolism including their rates of
photosynthesis. This research promises to have broader impacts by contributing
to the assessment of the impacts of future climate change on the earth's
ecosystems.
