Schlinger 9602139 It is widely recognized that the gonadal steroid hormones have
profound effects on the developing brain and on the function of the adult
central nervous system. Interestingly, in both males and females of many
species, estrogens exert some of the most dramatic effects. However, it is not
always clear how estrogens reach estrogen-sensitive brain regions nor is it
clear how estrogens act to influence neuronal growth or function. In the brain
of some species, there is a remarkable neural circuit that controls the
organism's ability to learn during development and to translate the learned
information into behavior as an adult. Estrogens are implicated in the initial
growth of this circuitry during early development, in the neural mechanisms
underlying learning, and in the activation of adult behavior. All estrogens are
derived from androgens, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase. In males,
circulating androgens are converted to estrogens locally in the brain. It is
these estrogens that act to masculinize the developing brain and then activate
masculine adult brain function. In some species, aromatase is present in the
neural circuitry underlying learning, which may be associated with the effects
of estrogen on learning. Dr. Schlinger is continuing his investigations into the
role of aromatase and estrogen on estrogen-dependent learning and behavior, and
will conduct cross-species experiments to characterize the effects of estrogen
more clearly. By clarifying properties of steroid synthesis and function in
brain, we will gain a better understanding of how activities of the neural and
endocrine systems are coordinated in regulating neural function. In addition,
these investigations provide a mechanism to further foster species survival in
natural environments and gain a better understanding of events crucial to
reproduction in the wild.
