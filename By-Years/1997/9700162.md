This project addresses four themes: waves, electric fields, winds and
temperatures. The Middle and Upper Atmosphere radar's phased-array construction
facilitates the wave work. By observing in multiple directions simultaneously,
the PI can distinguish temporal variations over the radar and spatial variations
caused by features moving over the radar. He will use this capability to detect
gravity-wave propagation over the radar. These waves, almost always present, are
best observed in daytime conditions near the peak of the ionosphere. The PI
plans to observe waves in the drift velocity in addition to density, study the
altitude profile of these waves and their dissipation, and map out their spatial
structure. Measurements of electric fields will contribute to developing global
electric field models. These electric fields (during solar maximum) show
interesting global relationships based on consideration of magnetic conjugacy
and summer-hemisphere control of a magnetic field line based on seasonal
differences in electrical-conductivity. The PI plans to extend his study to
solar minimum, as well as compare data with other radars to test hypotheses made
with solar maximum data. MU measurements of thermospheric neutral winds show
smaller speeds than do winds at other longitudes. The expanded winds database
the PI plans will contribute improvement to current wind models. The PI will
also examine this data set for signatures of global wind circulation systems
originating from different global processes: direct solar heating, auroral
thermal forcing, and equatorial momentum forcing. Finally, he will investigate
neutral and ionospheric temperatures, both to develop models of their behavior
and to aid in the interpretation of radar Doppler and power data.
