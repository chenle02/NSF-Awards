Commercial production of the oak acorn as an animal feed crop offers the
potential to help mitigate global climate change. Oak tree plantations could
remove large quantities of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere
and store it for many decades as part of their biomass where it will not
contribute to climate change. Also, such plantings would provide additional
benefits in the form of windbreaks, watershed protection, and soil conservation.
Little is known, however, about how to successfully cultivate acorns as a modern
commercial crop, and it is therefore important to understand and document the
knowledge in traditional systems of acorn production. Although acorns were once
widely used in cultures throughout the northern hemisphere, the Korean Peninsula
is one of the only remaining regions where acorns are still harvested in large
quantities on a regular basis. In collaboration with Dr. Dowon Lee a noted
expert on traditional Korean village groves at Seoul National University, this
project aims to understand and document the traditional ecological knowledge
associated with acorn production in the Republic of Korea.

Oak groves were traditionally managed in rural villages to provide food in years
when the rice harvest was poor, but now these groves are in danger of
disappearing within the next hundred years due to urbanization and over-use. To
document this traditional knowledge, in-depth field interviews of villagers,
farmers, and others still involved in acorn production/processing will be
conducted in the Republic of Korea. A lengthy questionnaire will be prepared
used to guide the structured field interviews. Groves, techniques, tools, and
materials will also be documented photographically. Sites will be chosen in
conjunction with Dr. Lee to encompass a cross-section of the South Korean
regions historically containing protected groves. This NSF EAPSI award is funded
in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.
