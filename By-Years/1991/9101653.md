Many of the factors that are critical for understanding and predicting weather
that is disruptive to human activity occur on what meteorologists term the
mesoscale. Mesoscale phenomena are not well sampled by the operational weather
network; therefore, progress is made through episodic field experiments
specially designed to study mesoscale processes. The Principal Investigator has
two objectives using data sets from already completed episodic field programs.
The first is to calculate budgets of water, sensible heat, momentum and
potential vorticity and to examine the magnitudes of frontogenetical processes
in the context of mesoscale convective systems. This data set is unique in that
it allows, for the first time, all terms in the budget equations to be
calculated. A numerical model also will be used to help in interpreting the
results. The second thrust is a collection of studies aimed at elucidating the
structure and dynamics of mesoscale convective systems. These studies include
climatologies of radar data over the U.S. and Europe and numerical modeling.
