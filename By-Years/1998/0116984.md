Optimal design, optimal control, and parameter estimation of systems governed by
partial differen-tial&lt;br/&gt;equations give rise to a class of problems known
as PDE-constrained optimization. The size and&lt;br/&gt;complexity of the
discretized PDE constraints often pose significant challenges for
contemporary&lt;br/&gt;optimization methods. Recent advances in algorithms,
software, and high performance computing&lt;br/&gt;systems have resulted in PDE
simulations that can often scale to millions of variables,
thousands&lt;br/&gt;of processors, and multiple physics interactions. As PDE
solvers mature, there is increasing in-dustrial&lt;br/&gt;and scientific
interest in solving optimization problems governed by such large-scale
PDE&lt;br/&gt;simulations.&lt;br/&gt;To address the challenges of these problems
the investigators have organized a workshop on PDE-
constrained&lt;br/&gt;optimization on April 4-6,2001, in Santa Fe, NM. The goals
of the workshop are to identify the needs&lt;br/&gt;and opportunities for PDE-
constrained optimization in industry and the national labs, to assess the state
of the art in PDE-constrained optimization, to identify barriers to PDE-
constrained optimization presented by&lt;br/&gt;modern simulation codes, and to
discuss promising algorithmic and software approaches for overcoming these
barriers.&lt;br/&gt;Sandia National Laboratories will sponsor the workshop
itself. to expose a new generation of researchers to this rapidly growing area
of research, the investigators will use this grant to support students
attending&lt;br/&gt;and participating in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
