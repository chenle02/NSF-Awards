This a Presidential Young Investigator award for Fiscal Year 1988. The objective
of this five year research is to study the liquefaction and the in-situ behavior
of soils and foundations. Specifically probabilistic methods will be used to
analyze nonlinear geotechnical engineering problems in order to account for the
complex and highly variable behavior of soils and foundations. The results will
form the basis for analyzing the geotechnical aspects of piling and pavement
system performance, seismic response of reinforced earth walls, and developing
expert systems for geotechnical engineering problems.
