The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to investigate a difficult field:
Shock acceleration of electrons and ions in supernova remnants (SNRs), with
emphasis on the ions. The problem is at present only poorly understood. The PIs
propose to combine their expertise with shock acceleration of charged solar wind
particles in the Earth's bow shock and a Monte Carlo computer code developed
specifically for the study of shock accelerations in the magnetic fields of
SNRs. The acceleration of charged particles in the Earth's bow shock will allow
them to test the Monte Carlo technique, so that it can be applied with some
confidence to SNRs.
