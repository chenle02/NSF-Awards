A $50,000 Planning Grant will be awarded to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) to develop an environmental science education
program that targets adult learners in literacy programs. The planning grant
will support a survey of literacy agencies, a pilot program and a focus group
evaluation. AAAS will first survey literacy programs across the U.S. to assess
the need for science related programming. Using the results, they will then
modify and pilot previously developed environmental science activities at the
Learning Bank in Baltimore, a community literacy center. Participants will then
take part in focus groups to determine the effectiveness of the materials used.
The overall goal is to develop a program model that can be disseminated at
literacy centers throughout the country.
