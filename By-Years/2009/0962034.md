&lt;br/&gt;University of Pittsburgh &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the
investigators link world polity and social networks to inform the development of
a new over-time measure of country-level connectedness to the world polity,
labeled the "INGO Network Country Score." This measure will score countries by
their centrality in the world country-INGO network. The resulting published
dataset will be useful to a cross-disciplinary audience. In a second part of the
project, an in-depth analysis is carried out on one domain of INGOs-Women's
International Nongovernmental Organizations, or WINGOs. The investigators draw
upon theories of the international women?s movement to provide testable theories
about expected changes in the WINGO network structure over time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will have
broad impact for academic researchers in the fastest growing areas of political
sociology and political science. The dataset generated here will provide a
substantial resource for researchers who study global processes, international
organizations, and cross-national outcomes.
