This award provides funds to support a summer REU program to be held in the
Department of Biomedical Sciences (BMS) of the State University of New York at
Albany's School of Public Health. The participating faculty members in this
department are also Research Scientists within the Wadsworth Center for
Laboratories and Research (WCL&R) of the New York State Health Department. The
WCL&R is a unique laboratory with state-of-the-art facilities, in which basic
research programs have developed alongside mission-oriented public health
laboratories. The research interests of the participating BMS faculty cover a
broad range, with emphasis in molecular genetics and structural biology. Ten
undergraduate students interested in research careers will be recruited from
colleges in the Northeast and from historically Black colleges in the South.
Recruitment of under- represented minority students will be assisted by the
Director of the Office of Minority Affairs, as part of this University's ongoing
initiative in the area of minority graduate education. Laboratory projects in
basic biological research topics will be chosen that are interesting, likely to
yield results within the time-frame of the program, and allow for some degree of
student development and independence. Weekly group meetings will be used to
discuss science- and career-related issues and to monitor student progress. The
students will be asked to make both written and oral presentations to stress the
importance of communication skills within science.
