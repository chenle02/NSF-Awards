9318128 Smith The purpose of this proposal is to generate funds to upgrade our
VAX 6000-410 computer to a DEC 7000-610, to increase our disk space by adding
new SCSI disks, to purchase fiber-optic hub equipment allowing the new computer
to be connected directly to the Medical Center's fiber-optic network, and to add
two new X-terminals and a color printer for public use. The computer currently
functions as a shared central resource within the Medical Center providing data
bank storage and computing power for nearly all research scientists at the
Medical Center whose work involves molecular biology. The current machine is
overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing number of users, and the rapid growth of
the molecular biology databases. Additionally, the resource is required to fill
an expanding role as a file and compute server for a rapidly growing number of
users who are choosing to purchase high power Macintoshes, IBM-PCs and
workstations, in addition to serving a large group of peer reviewed and funded
projects requiring basic computing facilities. The goal of our shared resource
is to enhance current services and to provide new facilities, some of which are
under development in the Medical Center. These resources consist of new
databases, tools for the analysis of molecular structure, and selected image
processing tools and resources. Our goal is to support research on biological
structure at all levels from the molecular to the cellular. The PI and the CoPIs
are currently--and will continue to be- -major users of the computer system.
They share a commitment to a shared computing resource and are involved in
projects that will enhance its value to the Medical Center and the broader
international research community.
