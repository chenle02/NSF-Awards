Proposal NSF 0835854: The LIFE
Center&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew the
LIFE Center, situated at the University of Washington in Seattle, a multi-
university, multi-year, interdisciplinary project devoted to the study of social
factors in learning, an underappreciated element of the science of learning. Now
concluding its 5th year of support, the center proposes to continue its efforts
"to develop and test principles about the social foundations of human learning
in informal and formal environments, including how people learn to innovate in
contemporary society, with the goal of enhancing human learning from infancy to
adulthood."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the research projects to be pursued
during the next phase of investigation are (1) social factors in language
learning--especially in infants, (2) new designs to enhance learning via media
and technology by identifying and utilizing social interaction and "social
belief", the perception that one is interacting with a human being, whether or
not this is true, (3) effects on learning of social identity and stereotyping,
(4) social practices in science learning, including an anthropological study of
informal science learning in social settings, (5) new views of and efforts to
enhance expertise, transfer and assessment, (6) social practices in the
workplace that foster learning, and (7) the importance of informal teaching by
parents, peers and mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to demonstrating
strong effects of social factors on learning, the researchers in LIFE will
pursue answers to the overall theoretical question: "What is it about the social
that powerfully enhances learning?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than just a
research center, LIFE participants are also committed to the education of
undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs; to increasing diversity among
faculty, students and future scientists; and to the transfer of research results
to practice in education and workplaces.
