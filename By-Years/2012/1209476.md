This action funds Anna Herring of Oregon State University to conduct a research
project, entitled "How the chemistry of rock surfaces affects trapping of carbon
dioxide" during the summer of 2012 at Australia National University in Canberra,
Australia. The host scientist is Adrian Sheppard.

This research extends knowledge of multiphase fluid flow and capillary trapping,
specifically in application to geologic sequestration of supercritical carbon
dioxide. It examines and quantifies the effect of modifying wettability on
capillary trapping of various fluids within Bentheimer sandstone cores. The
results will guide efforts to engineer carbon dioxide injection scenarios to
optimize trapping, which is crucial for the success of geologic sequestration
projects. In addition, better understanding of the physics involved in multi-
phase flow in porous media is not only necessary for optimization of geologic
carbon dioxide sequestration but can be applied to many other fields of
research, e.g. groundwater hydraulics, remediation of non-aqueous phase liquids
(NAPLs) in the subsurface, and oil recovery operations.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
