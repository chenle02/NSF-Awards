The increasing integration of novel network applications, in particular, peer-
to-peer (P2P) applications, into the Internet content distribution
infrastructure is posing significant new challenges to achieving efficient and
fair utilization of Internet network resources. In particular, by largely
network oblivious, these network applications can cause substantial problems on
network efficiency, Internet economics, and application
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a
novel, light-weight framework called P4P that provides standard, modular
interfaces to allow Internet network providers and network applications to
jointly optimize their respective performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The P4P
interfaces are designed through rigorous mathematical derivations to achieve
extensibility, scalability and efficiency in large-scale, heterogeneous
networks. The interfaces consider not only network provider privacy but also
end-user privacy. The interfaces take into consideration not only traditional
performance metrics but also increasingly important economic and business
policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the state of the art in
facilitating the interactions across different Internet network layers and
entities, and presents a transformative research that enables others to
effectively integrate network applications into network
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interfaces designed in the project will be
specified in an open, standard language. The reference implementations will be
made available broadly to facilitate integration into the Internet
infrastructure. A P4P research group will be formed to maximize open research
and disseminate results widely among network operators and application
developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
