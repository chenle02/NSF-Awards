Very Long Baseline Interferometric (VLBI) observations at the Hat Creek Radio
Observatory (HCRO) and VLBI research within the Radio Astronomy Laboratory (RAL)
of the University of California at Berkeley have been made since 1967. In 1975
the University of California formed a Consortium along with four other
universities to coordinate VLBI activities of their Network of radio telescope
facilities. Support is provided for the continuing participation of the HCRO
85-ft antenna during regular U.S. and Global Network VLBI observations, and for
VLBI-related research on galactic and extragalactic topics. Support for the VLBI
observations on the telescopes in the ad hoc VLBI network will be phased out as
the Very Long Baseline Array becomes operational. THe technique of VLBI in radio
astronomy allows the observations of the physical structure in radio sources at
scales that cannot be obtained by any other methods.
