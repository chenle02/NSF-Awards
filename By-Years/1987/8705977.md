The existence of chaos in quantum systems is a question of fundamental
importance as well as of practical relevance. So far experiments on quantum
chaos have been conducted by the study of microwave ionization of highly excited
hydrogen atoms. They allowed access only to the regime where the chaotic
behavior looks classical. It is proposed here to study microwave liberation of
electrons bound to the liquid helium surface. This experiment permits the
exploration of regions in parameter space where deviations from classical chaos
are expected to take place. Another project that will be carried out is the
study of the magnetically induced Wigner transition in a 2-D electron system. An
electron solid is expected to melt when, for sufficiently high densities, the
zero point motion becomes larger than the Coulomb interaction. This type of
transition has not yet been observed since in existing 2-D electron systems
where the densities are either too high (in heterojunctions) or too low
(electrons on Helium). In a joint project with F.I.B. Williams and E. Mendez it
is proposed to induce the Wigner transition in the 2-D electron liquid in a
GaAl/GeAlAs heterojunction by means of a strong magnetic field. It will be
detected by measuring the shear modulus of the electron layer.
