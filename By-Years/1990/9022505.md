The acquisition of a 100MHz tester will allow work on testing and validating
VLSI chips and multi-chip configurations in a real environment. Testing chips at
slow speeds does not give the physical characteristics (bounces and echoes along
transmission lines, signal interference etc.) that occur at operating speed.
This tester will enable experimentation to be done on chip designs to aid in the
search for design rules for correct chip operation at high clock rates. The
tester will also enable conventional testing of circuits to be scaled up. New
chip designs run at such a high clock rate that the conventional view of the
chip as a collection of discrete logic elements no longer holds true. Instead,
the chip is viewed as a collection of transmission lines with switching and
signal modulation occurring at active element points. In order to study this
phenomenon and to derive design rules for the correct design of circuits, it is
necessary to test the circuits at a high clock rate. The 100MHz tester will
provide that capability.
