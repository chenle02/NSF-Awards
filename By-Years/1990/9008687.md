This proposal for a Research Planning Grant examines adaptation in the training
and development within organizations. Changes in the demographic composition and
the skill/knowledge base of the labor force suggest that organizaitons will need
to focus more of their management activities on training and development. These
changes also suggest that organizations will need to take an interactionist
approach to training, i.e., adapting the training method or content to meet the
needs and aptitutes of individduals in the workforce. Little research has been
done in organizational training environments on how to adapt training in this
fashion. Research in cognitive psychology and education provides a foundation
for theoretical work in this area. This research suggests that aptitudes
andmethods do interact and can enhance performacne both for individuals and for
organizations. The planned research involves building on the research in
cognitive psychology and education, developing theoretically-based hypotheses,
and proposing a series of studies to test these research hypotheses. In the long
run, this investigation will lead to insights into adaptive approaches to
training and development.
