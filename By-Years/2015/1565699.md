New forms of technology and media have made it easier than ever to disseminate
false information, which can have adverse consequences on businesses, the
financial sector, science, and beyond. Fact-checking is thus critically
important to increase accountability, improve discourse, and minimize
socioeconomic disruptions. A key challenge is that, in light of the new forms of
communications, human fact-checkers have difficulty keeping up with rapidly
emerging false data and information.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team
aims to commercialize ClaimBuster, an automated, live fact-checking system that
finds claims, matches them with claims that have already been checked by
professionals, and, for new claims not yet checked, provides analysis of
relevant data to help check their validity. The team?s technology leverages
novel research advances in databases, data and text mining, machine learning,
etc. By participating in the I-Corps Teams program, the team?s goal is to
clearly identify target customers and their needs, which will enable the team to
prepare a viable commercialization plan and further develop necessary components
for deploying their technology.
