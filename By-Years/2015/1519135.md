Mechanism design aims to make the best decisions when the necessary data is in
the hands of selfish players with different motives and incentives. A mechanism
specifies what each player may report and a way to select the outcome from the
players' reports. Although mechanism design was originally developed to study
auctions in the field of finance, interest in mechanism design arose from its
potential in the design of protocols for large distributed heterogeneous systems
where the preferences of people and organizations influenced the outcome of the
protocol. The proper and computationally efficient working of such systems does
not solely rely on fast algorithms and cryptographically secure protocols but
also on a correct incentive analysis.

This project investigates more general models of mechanism design. The players
are assumed to be uncertain of their own true valuations, knowing only a set of
candidate valuations. The notion of utility by a player may also be broadened. A
player may maximize their utility while using regret minimization to refine
their set of non-dominated strategies if needed. A player may seek to decrease
their uncertainty and sharpen their understanding about their own utility by
investing in the means to increase their knowledge about their own valuations
before acting in a mechanism. These extensions will allow more robust and
realistic mechanism design of cryptographic protocols.
