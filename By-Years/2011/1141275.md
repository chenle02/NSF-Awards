The albedo, or reflection coefficient, is a measure of the diffuse reflectivity
of an irradiated surface. With the sunlit atmosphere as a light source, and sea-
ice as a diffuse reflecting surface, the albedo would be the fraction of
incident light that is returned to the atmosphere. A perfect (white) reflecting
surface would have an albedo of 1; a perfect (black) absorbing surface would
have an albedo of 0. The albedo of sea-ice is needed to assess the solar energy
budget of the marginal ice zone, to compute the partial solar bands in radiation
budgets in general circulation and earth system models, and is also needed to
interpret remote sensing imagery data products.&lt;br/&gt;Applications requiring
albedos further into the near IR, out to 2500nm, are assumed or approximated.
Modern spectral radiometers, such as will be used in this campaign on a Southern
Ocean voyage from Hobart to Antarctica, can extend these measurements of albedo
from 350 to 2500nm, allowing earlier estimates to be verified, or corrected.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surfaces to be encountered on this research cruise are
expected to include open water, grease ice, nila ice, pancake ice, young grey
ice, young grey-white ice, along with first year ice. The presence of variable
amounts of snow on these surfaces is also of interest. Light absorbing
impurities in the snow and ice, including black carbon and organic matter (brown
carbon) are different from those found in Arctic Sea ice, the Antarctic being so
remote from combustion sources. This may allow better understanding of the
seasonal cycles, energy budgets and their recent trends in spatial extent and
thickness. The project will also broaden the educational experiences of both US
and Australian students participating in the measurement campaign
