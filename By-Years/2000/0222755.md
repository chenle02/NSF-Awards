Large pools of soil C have accumulated in high latitude ecosystems since
glaciation as soil organic matter was climatically protected from decomposition
by low temperatures and frozen soil. Air temperatures have been observed to
increase at high latitudes over the last 25 years, and this "old" stored soil C
may be susceptible to decomposition as soils thaw. Sustained and significant
transfers of C to the atmosphere that could cause a positive feedback to climate
change must come from stored soil C, which forms the bulk of the soil pool in
these ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the sources of carbon respiration is
critical to predicting the response of C cycling to climate change. The proposed
research uses radiocarbon and stable isotope measurements of soil organic matter
(SOM) and soil respiration to characterize the sources of soil C released
following soil thaw. Organic and mineral soil cores collected from acidic and
non-acidic tussock tundra sites at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Research
station will be studied to determine the potential of arctic soils to release
old C as permafrost melts. This information is critical for predicting C loss
from high latitude ecosystems to the atmosphere as a result of global change.
