Mobile health (mHealth) technology promises to improve quality of life, improve
individual and public health, and reduce healthcare costs. Although mHealth
devices and applications are proliferating, challenges remain. With a focus on
usability, manageability, interoperability, availability, security, and privacy,
the Amulet project has worked to engineer the tools for, and lay the scientific
foundation of, secure wearable mHealth by developing a general framework for
body-area pervasive computing, centered around health-monitoring and health-
management applications. The Amulet team has built a prototype computational
jewelry platform: an electronic bracelet and a software framework that enables
developers to create (and users to easily use) safe, secure, and efficient
mHealth applications that fit seamlessly into everyday life. This
accomplishment-based renewal extends this work?refining and extending the Amulet
platform?s functionality, evaluating its performance and usability in larger-
scale studies, and transitioning the technology into an open and extensible tool
for the research and healthcare communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators expect Amulet will be a platform for a wide range of mHealth
applications, and this project evaluates this potential in a concrete setting in
cooperation with the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health at Dartmouth
College. This project explores use of the Amulet platform in new applications,
using new wearable sensors and new kinds of user interactions. This exploration
includes fielding Amulet prototypes to study stress and other behavioral health
metrics, and refining the Amulet hardware and software in response to user
feedback, in order to prepare the platform for a successful public release to
the research community. The Amulet will open exciting new opportunities as it
becomes available to both technology and health-science researchers as they
explore the burgeoning field of wearable technology.
