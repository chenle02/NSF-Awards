The proposed research concerns spin glass models and addresses important
questions related to the Sherringon-Kirkpatrick and the generalized Sherrington-
Kirkpatrick models that include characterization of replica symmetric region and
phase transitions, replica symmetry breaking, uniqueness of Parsi measure and
its properties, strong Ghirlanda-Guerra identities, chaos and ultrametricity
conjectures, boundedness of the operator norm of the covariance matrix and the
limit of its eigenvalue distribution function in the high temperature ragion,
and the TAP equations. The proposal also includes a question of computing the
free energy in the diluted spin glass model.

The rigorous theory of spin glasses will have broad scientific impact on a
number of areas and disciplines, including physics, condensed matter theory,
probability and analysis. For example, understanding the ultrametric picture
could eventually lead to understanding of the famous Parsi trick which is widely
used in physics. Success will probably help in making progress in other spin
glass models and more physical systems of great interest such as quantum spin
glasses.
