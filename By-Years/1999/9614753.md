9614753 Cashman It is proposed to quantify the effect of magma ascent rate on
both volatile loss and crystallization through a detailed study of the products
of several eruptions representing a range of eruptive styles, magnitudes, and
magma composition. The central focus will be to re-examine the 1980-1986
explosive and effusive products of Mount St. Helens, with the specific goals of
determining quantitative relations between eruption rate and pyroclast textures,
and examining the conditions that led to the 1980 transition from pulsatory
explosions to purely effusive eruptions. Additional studies of deposits from
other well characterized volcanic eruptions (i.e. Taupo in New Zealand, and
Vesuvius in Italy) will permit generalizations of this work to different magma
compositions and eruptive conditions. With the results of these studies, it will
be possible to evaluate the importance, respectively, of factors such as
interaction with external water and compositional dependence of crystallization
in the generation of variably vesicular and micro-crystalline pyroclasts. The
larger goal of this investigation will be to determine the physical processes
that control eruptive styles in intermediate-to-highly siliceous magmatic
systems.
