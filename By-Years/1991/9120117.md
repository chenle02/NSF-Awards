This project entails the excavation and analysis of material contained in the
Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits of Die Kelders Cave 1, on the southwestern coast
of South Africa. Previous excavations revealed substantial Later Stone Age (LSA)
materials overlaying a thick MSA deposit. Some human teeth were found which are
similar to those of modern southern African indigenes, tentatively date at prior
to 40,000 years before the present. A team of specialists will excavate the
cave, and analyze the MSA and the LSA material. Given the depth and volume of
the MSA deposit in this cave, the demonstrated richness of the deposits, the
excellent quality of boner preservation, and the substantial amount that will be
excavated, the potential is high that the site will yield new fossils that can
help resolve the issue of modern human origins. This research is important
because it can contribute important information to the possibility that modern
humans lived in Africa while more "primitive" Neanderthal contemporaries were
living in Europe and the Levant, and so help us trace the history of modern
humans.
