The objectives of this investigation are to develop inversion principles, data
acquisition strategies, and information processing algorithms for an echo
imaging system that utilizes the motion of a single element transducer (SET) to
synthesize the effect of a phased array with a size equal to the path length
that the SET traverses. A mobile SET, with a dimension much smaller than a
phased array's size, brings flexibility in data acquisition and processing for
echo imaging systems. Synthetic aperture echo imaging also opens ways for
imaging an object that cannot be studies with phased arrays due to constraints
imposed by the object's anatomy. Unlike the dynamic focusing inversion used in
conjunction with stationary phased arrays, the proposed inversion produces an
image scene by integrating the recorded echoed signals at the available
coordinates of the mobile SET that possesses a wide-beam radiation pattern. The
investigation includes modifying an inversion developed for a translational or
rotational SET for practical echo imaging problems that arise in diagnostic
medicine, remote sensing and non-destructive testing. The required sampling and
processing issues associated with the recorded data as well as the resolution
anticipated in a given synthetic aperture echo imaging problem are also studied.
The result will be used to develop efficient data collection strategies for two-
dimensional and three-dimensional echo imaging systems. Sub-band processing of
the available spatial frequency data to reduce the computational time for image
reconstruction is also being pursued.
