This project intends to develop fundamental knowledge and technology for
enabling scientists to engineer plants that can be grown under a variety of
environmental stresses, such as cold, heat, drought, and salt stresses. Results
from this project will help plant breeders develop future crops that will adapt
to environmental and climate changes. This project also seeks to integrate basic
plant science research with the teaching and training of the next-generation of
plant scientists. The training aspect of this project includes graduate students
from underrepresented groups and the teaching component includes the development
and implementation of a plant biotechnology course at Tuskegee, a university
whose student population is composed primarily of underrepresented groups.

Gene expression in plants is regulated by enhancers at different developmental
stages and under different biotic and abiotic stresses. Enhancers act
independently of the distance and orientation with respect to the promoters of
target genes, which make enhancers extremely difficult to identify using
traditional methods. Very few enhancers have been characterized in plant
species, which is largely due to the lack of an efficient methodology for
enhancer identification. This project aims to establish an enhancer
identification system in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana based on chromatin
signatures that are associated with enhancers. This project includes three
specific goals: (1) Developing several genome-wide datasets that will be used
for enhancer prediction; (2) Developing a genome-wide enhancer map in A.
thaliana; (3) Isolating and validating a set of tissue-specific enhancers and
enhancers activated under cold, heat, drought, and salt stresses.
