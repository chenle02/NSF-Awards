An investigation of the effectiveness of pulsation as a mechanism for enhancing
the heat transfer of water and air jets is planned. The study will be primarily
experimental, although numerical models will be used for siting thermocouples
and for data reduction. High speed data acquisition techniques will be used to
obtain transient measurements of surface temperature. Measurements will include
the effects of jet velocity, pulsation frequency, nozzle width, and
thermophysical properties on heat transfer.
