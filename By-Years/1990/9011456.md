This research will study the rupture characteristics of the Loma Prieta
earthquake using three types of seismic waveform data: (1) very-long-period data
from the GEOSCOPE and IDA worldwide networks, (2) intermediate-period
teleseismic data from the WWSSN and GSN networks, and (3) strong-motion data
from local stations. The slip models obtained will be compared with the
distribution of aftershocks and with fault models derived from geodetic data
inversions. Analysis of fault geometry relative to fault rupture offers the
prospect of a better understanding of earthquake faulting and strain
accumulation over the seismic cycle. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
