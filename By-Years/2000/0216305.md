0216305 Paul The objective of this research is to develop a sensor to detect
enteric viruses that will have application to provide real-time monitoring of
problem microorganisms in coastal waters. Solid phase immobilization of target
mRNA, amplification and detection by means of microbial beacons is the plan that
these investigators have. Each of these steps is available technology. Putting
them together to provide real time monitoring of enteric viruses, and modeling
the data to determine predictive patterns of enteroviral release to the
environment as a function of environmental perturbation and climate variability
is to be done with this grant.
