This project will allow the PI to do research in Jamaica on the relation
between social structural and ideological factors affecting parental treatment
of children. The effect of women's roles as primary providers and decision
makers in both domestic and public domains upon any preferential treatment of
male or female children will be studied by conducting a household census of
about 200 households in an urban neighborhood of Kingston and conducting
participant observation and in- depth interviews with fathers and mothers, in
collaboration with local researchers from the Institute for Social and Economic
Research, University of the West Indies. This research is important because a
gender bias in the treatment of children is widespread in the world, usually in
the favor of males. The investigation of bias (favoring either males or females)
in a situation where adult females have relatively higher economic and social
status than males thus provides an important comparison to the more usual male
dominated social situation.
