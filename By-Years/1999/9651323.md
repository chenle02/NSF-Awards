The multidisciplinary nature of most environmental problems necessitates
training in analytical techniques among a variety of students. The acquisition
of a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and growth chamber enhances the
capabilities for environmental sampling and analysis among students of plant
biology, invertebrate zoology, biological research methods, histology/cell
physiology, genetics, and organic chemistry. The majority of students are being
introduced to the GC/MS system in the organic chemistry sequence where they
carry out individually designed experiments. The system allows for the continued
conversion to and increase in the variability of microscale experiments and the
development of the organic laboratory projects that have greatly stimulated
student interest in environmental research. As the students continue their
progress, they use the GC/MS and environmental growth chamber in the upper-
division biology laboratory courses including the research methods course where
students design, execute, and present the results of individual research
projects to peers and faculty. The new equipment also allows for the expansion
of the undergraduate student-faculty research program during both the regular
academic year and the summer session.
