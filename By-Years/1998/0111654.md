The research project submitted by Dr. Peter Williams and Dr. Richard Hervig of
Arizona State University entitled "Analytical, Fundamental and Instrumental
Developments in Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)" is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. The goals for the project are 1) to
develop methods for real-time, quantitative analysis on the influence of oxygen
on sputtered ion yields. 2) Fundamental studies in sputtered neutral analysis.
This will include establishing mechanism of ionization and studying
contamination problems. 3) To explore massive cluster ion source experiments for
gathering information on sputtering yields and behavior. The quantitative, real-
time measurements are innovative and well thought out. The massive cluster
impact source experiments are challenging, and of great interest for the depth
profiling of semiconductors and biological surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
are potential societal impacts from this research because the quantitative
calculation of impurity content and distribution at shallow depths could
significantly improve microelectronics manufacture. The fundamental research is
important to the field of surface mass spectrometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
