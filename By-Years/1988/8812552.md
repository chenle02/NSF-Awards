This project investigates the questions of whether urbanization leads to
linguistic convergence or divergence, whether it affects all social groups in
the same way, and whether it leads to the loss, maintenance, or reanalysis of
rural dialect features. Moreover, it asks whether language change (specifically
grammatical change) requires language contact or whether it can take place in
situations of insularity and isolation, and if so, how such changes can be
spread. The study is based on interview material recorded in four communities in
Texas: a large metropolitan area, a medium-sized city, a small town, and a rural
village; and involves analysis of a number of features that correlated with
rural/urban residence study in a pilot study.
