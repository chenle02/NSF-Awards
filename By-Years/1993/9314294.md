9314294 Newcomb This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
organic dynamics between Martin Newcomb of Wayne State University and S. Z. Zard
of the Ecole Polytechnique. Their research involves kinetic measurements of very
fast free radical reactions. They will study stabilized carbon-and nitrogen-
centered radicals, which are neutral groups of atoms with an odd number of
electrons. The Wayne State group has developed a general method for the kinetic
study of a broad range of radicals. The French group will prepare precursors
specifically designed for the kinetic method developed by Wayne State. They will
isolate and characterize products resulting from the reactions. The Wayne State
group will then measure the rate constants of the reactions and develop a scale
of radical kinetics. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
expertise in physical organic chemistry. This is complemented by the French
investigators' expertise in organic synthesis. Their joint work will advance
understanding of this new method which could be used in studying a wide variety
of organic and biological reactions that involve radical intermediates. ***
