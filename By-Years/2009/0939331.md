This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Enhancing Undergraduate Student Learning and Research Experience
through Hands-on Experiments on Novel Nanohybrid Devices and Systems", at the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,under the direction of Dr. Junhong Chen, aims
to introduce the recent advancement of nanotechnology in hybrid nanomaterials
and devices/systems to undergraduate students through nine well-designed
laboratory modules which will be used to develop a new senior-level laboratory
course as well as to enrich five existing courses of various levels at the UWM.
The availability of the course modules and the new course on hybrid
nanomaterials and devices/systems constitutes a timely update of the existing
nanotechnology teaching materials database to reflect the forefront of
nanotechnology advancement. The nanotechnology-related courses will be used to
develop a nanotechnology certificate program at UWM in the near future and many
of these courses will also be counted toward the existing integrated BS-MS
program which can be used as a mechanism to attract students to pursue graduate
degrees in engineering and science.
