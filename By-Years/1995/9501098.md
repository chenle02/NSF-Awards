DMS-9501098 PI: Schmid Schmid will study representations of reductive groups and
Lie algebras from various points of view. He will employ tools from topology,
differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and analysis. The expected results
and some of the methods developed for the study have applications outside of
representation theory. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent
in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact
upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
