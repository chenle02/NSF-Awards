This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For three summers beginning in 1992, nine undergraduate students
will spend ten weeks engaged in basic research under the direction of the
faculty members in the Chemistry Department. The Department will fund four
additional students, two earmarked for ethnic minorities and two for community
college students. The central goal of the program is to expose students to the
full spectrum of the "scientific enterprise." Accordingly, the program contains
five major components: (1) research projects; (2) a science seminar series; (3)
communication; (4) career mentoring; and (5) weekly meetings of students to
discuss their research. Each of these components is designed to address a
particular aspect of the entire scientific enterprise.
