The Chattanooga Public School System will institute a policy of continuous
improvement and renewal aimed at insuring that every graduate is fully prepared
for his or her selected career path. Particular stress will be placed on careers
in technology, math and science. Key to this project is the training and
implementation of instruction planning teams in each school. Analogous to
quality circles this small group of teachers an students will meet every week to
reflect on the current pattern of curriculum and instruction and design changes
to it. Every teacher, and a selected group of students, will participate in one
planning team. Coordination of efforts among teams and across schools will be
facilitated through a computer bulletin board network. National Science
Foundation funds will be used for initial training of the teams and curriculum
committee; for purchasing equipment, materials and services necessary to
implement innovative instructional strategies; and for other "star-up" costs.
Once instituted the teams will be self- regenerating and schools will be
restructured to make planning team activity a permanent part of regular school
activity.
