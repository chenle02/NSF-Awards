9618633 Ratteray Invigorating Approaches for Elementary School Mathematics: A
Professional Development Model The Institute for Independent Education (IIE)
seeks a planning grant from the National Science Foundation to develop a full-
fledged proposal to strengthen the mathematics curriculum and to enhance
mathematics teaching and learning at urban-based independent schools. The
participating schools are committed to building a strong mathematics curriculum
and are willing to collaborate on acquiring strategies for its effective
teaching through intensive professional development work. With the proposed
planning grant, the Institute will develop a leadership team at a core group of
schools primarily in Philadelphia and New York. The team will examine several
innovative NSF sponsored 5-8 curriculum projects designed to enhance the
teaching and learning of mathematics and will decide upon one curriculum to be
implemented during the culminating project. With the assistance of the
leadership team, the Institute will sponsor a regional conference to be attended
by teachers, administrators, and, possibly, some parents from interested
independent community-based schools in the area. At that conference participants
will have an opportunity to learn about the chosen curriculum by experiencing
representative activities from it. They will also have a chance to strengthen
their commitment to collaborating on its implementation. During the planning
project, the Institute will develop a proposal for a professional development
program that will help the independent community based-schools involved in
implementing the chosen curriculum to strengthen their mathematics program and
in incorporating effective mathematics teaching strategies.
