9731813 COBURN This project will provide support for shipboard scientific
support equipment for the research vessels, KNORR and OCEANUS, operated by the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and dedicated to use in support of ocean
science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of
ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items as deck
equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing similar activities. This project will
allow the institution to obtain 28 anti exposure suits, 4 fire fighting suits, 2
computers, a dewatering pump, a welding machine, electronic charting software
and an INMARSAT B. for the KNORR. It will also outfit the OCEANUS with two
wireless radios and call logging software. ***
