In this project the PI's will complete the analysis and interpretation of
hydrographic, current meter Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and satellite
data acquired during a field experiment near Barbados. The immediate objective
is to quantify the effects of island wakes on the coastal circulation around the
island. Longer term objectives include the relationship between the circulation
and larval reef fish dispersion, retention, and recruitment.
