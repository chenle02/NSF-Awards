This award provides support for participants in an annual two-day workshop for
advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the
Southeastern United States who are interested in pursuing careers in applied
mathematics or related scientific fields. The first three meetings will be held
at the College of Charleston, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
and the National Institute of Aerospace, an independent not-for-profit research
and graduate educational institute that functions as a strategic partner of the
NASA Langley Research Center. The University of Central Florida will provide
further attendance and organizational support, and it will facilitate contact
with research institutes and scientific employers in the central Florida's High-
Tech Corridor.

The meetings will expose students to graduate and postgraduate research
activity. Each year, two keynote speakers will be selected from among faculty,
scientific laboratories, and technical companies in the southeastern region.
Most speakers, however, will be advanced graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows. Poster sessions for undergraduate and graduate research projects are
also planned. The workshops will improve networking of young applied
mathematicians with industry, laboratories, and universities in the Southeastern
United States, helping to create a more inclusive and diverse community of young
scientists and informing them of regional opportunities in scientific research,
both academic and industry based.
