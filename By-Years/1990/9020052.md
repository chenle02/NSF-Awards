This proposal seeks continuing support for research on food- web structure,
species extinctions and ecological interactions. Small islands are used as a
model system, because they are numerous, simple, discrete and have species and
trophic types in various combinations. How top predators affect intermediate
predators, ambient insects and foliage damage is studied in an introduction
experiment of lizards onto small islets. The same phenomena, plus the degree to
which intermediate predators compensate in top-predator absence, is studied in a
lizard/spider removal experiment in large enclosures. A second experiment will
measure spider competition with and without lizards. Natural extinction is
studied using a system of over 100 islands; we focus on the effect of top
predators on spider extinction rate, and on how extinction rate varies with
mean, variability and skewness of population-size values over time and with
life- history characteristics. Spatial patchiness in spider population
distributions will be studied both between islands and within larger islands;
the latter will be related to top predator occurrence and density.
Characteristics of the founder effect (loss of genetic variability; degree of
morphological and behavioral change) will be assessed for colonizing populations
of lizards introduced onto islands during earlier support periods. The results
will provide very valuable information on news relating to global the
interactions leading to extinctions.
