Reserve osmosis, called hyperfiltration, involves separation of a liquid, such
as water, from the dissolved impurities by use of a membrane permeable to the
pure liquid only. A high feed pressure is required to cause the fluid to pass
through the membrane. Many variables affect performance of purification system
using the hyperfiltration phenomenon. These include impurity rejection behavior,
dynamic rates through the membrane surface, membrane strength, and structure.
Research has been in progress at Villanova on both the theoretical and applied
aspects of reverse osmosis since 1981 has established the need for a data base
to allow improved system modeling. There are currently conflicts in the open
literature and among active researchers. A resolution of these conflicts should
do much to lead to innovation using this technique for new applications and a
more productive program of research. This research should lead to improved
prediction models which in turn can do much to guide manufacturers in the
synthesis and production of improved membranes.
