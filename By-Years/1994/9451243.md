9451243 Crittenden Too many of our precalculus and calculus students do not seem
able to learn to think about mathematics, but only to perform rote computations.
Too many do not even make it through the course. A computer laboratory to
accompany calculus courses addresses these problems. The project follows
successful pilot projects that have been run since the Fall of 1990. The first
project used Apple IIe's in 12 of 77 calculus sections over a period of two
years. During the summer of 1993 these machines were replaced by 15 486 PC's
with Maple V, to offer an optional lab in 7 of 40 sections in the 1993-94
academic year. Simple algorithms first, and then the more sophisticated commands
and graphics of Maple were employed successfully to generate data that the
students use to develop intuitions about theoretical relations, to gain a deeper
understanding of the theory, and to make it credible through verifying examples.
The addition of 30 Gateway 4DX2-66's builds upon the successful pilot
experiences by providing a sufficient number of PC's to make these labs a
required part of the calculus sections. The 30 new machines allow the expansion
of the current facility to 20 machines and establishment of a second, dedicated
computer lab of 25 PC's with Maple V, to handle classes of as many as 45. The
project will result in a laboratory manual and the requirement of a laboratory
component for all calculus sections which allows the experiences of the
laboratory to be integrated in the teaching of the calculus. Future plans
include using the laboratory for pre-calculus as well as calculus.
