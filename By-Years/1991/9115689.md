Using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical calculations, a
study will be conducted of particle transport in surface wave induced
oscillatory boundary layers over a sediment bed. An existing theory of
homogenization will be extended and applied to this problem. The theory deals
with physical phenomena involving several widely different scales. In this case,
two very different scales are the flow forcing length and the suspended particle
layer thickness. Dispersion coefficients and dispersion patterns will be
determined, with forcing from both waves and tidal action. The research will
have impact on the more reliable prediction of coastal sediment transport,
relevant to beach protection and bay and harbor silting.
