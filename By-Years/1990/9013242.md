Western Washington University has established the Shannon Point Marine Center
(SPMC) as the focal point for new initiatives in research and education in
marine science. SPMC is strategically located, providing direct access to a wide
variety of marine and estuarine habitats, including protected wetlands,
macrophytes, estuarine marshes, and rocky intertidal zones. The facilities of
SPMC provide opportunities for resident and visiting scientists to implement
research on local estuarine processes, such as productivity of various local
watersheds, nutrient cycling and regeneration, microbial ecology, and benthic
metabolism; on environmental impacts of petroleum refining; and on fish and
invertebrate life histories. This project provides partial funding to renovate
existing presently under-utilized space for use as an analytical laboratory to
provide a critical link between field measurement and real time laboratory
analysis. The project is essential to SPMC's developing focus on process-
oriented research on marine and estuarine systems of the northern Puget Sound
basin and its continuing effort to accommodate the needs of visiting scientists.
The laboratory will also serve as a core facility for undergraduate research and
training.
