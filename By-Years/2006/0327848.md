This award provides support for a Workshop on Repeated Cross-Sectional and
Longitudinal Surveys, to be held in Arlington, VA on 28-29 March 2003. Recurring
surveys are a major data resource for the social sciences. The workshop will
include noted researchers from a variety of disciplines, including demography,
economics, political science, psychology, sociology, and survey research. Short-
term goals of the workshop include the identification of the most important
research questions and cutting-edge issues in this area and enhanced
interdisciplinary collaborations among the participants at the workshop and
their students and colleagues. It also is expected that this workshop will
provide useful information for NSF staff that are involved in planning new
activities for the Human and Social Dynamics priority area in FY 2004 and
beyond. Long-term, research growing out of the workshop should have important
spillover effects for many recurring surveys. All products of the workshop,
including the final report, will be in the public domain.
