9615689 Lumelsky This award funds exploration of a novel sensor-based approach
to disassembly planning for complex assemblies. Knowledge of part and tool
kinematics and available tools, and procedures for disassembling a complex
assembly could aid the designer in producing a more maintainable system or
structure. The planned approach operates with incomplete information, enabling a
computationally efficient answer to the formal question of existence of a path
for removal of a given part from a complex assembly. This exploratory effort
should show the way to the formulation of the more general questions for design
such as how the kinematic constraints as well as tool and system maintenance
procedure availability can be accommodated in design and planning.Incorporation
of such knowledge in the original design process could also facilitate human
performance of disassembly operations in some cases.
