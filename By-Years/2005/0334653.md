0334653 Iacono

This three-year award supports US-Belgium cooperative research in retroactive
data structures involving John Iacono of the Polytechnic University of New York
and Erik Demaine of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stefan
Langerman at the National Fund for Scientific Research in Belgium. The
objectives of the project are to develop retroactive analogs of both fundamental
and application-driven data structures to demonstrate how retroactive data
structures can solve the dynamic planar point location problem, an open problem
in computational geometry. The paradigm of retroactive data structures could be
incorporated into any graduate algorithms class for broader dissemination. The
collaboration will develop the model of retroactive data structures, explore
possible variants on the model, seek to prove general results and
transformations involving retroactive data structures, analyze specific data
structures for which efficient retroactive structures can be developed, and
explore the impact that retroactive data structures can have outsie the data-
structures community.
