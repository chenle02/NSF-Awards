Khoisan languages are interesting to phoneticians and phonologists because of
their large, unique sound inventories. The goal of this project is a detailed
description and analysis of all of the contrastive sounds found in Ju/'hoasi , a
Namibian Khoisan language, as well as a theoretical analysis of the language
which will advance universal linguistic theories. Sounds unique to Khoisan
languages are 47 click consonants, as well as many different types of vowels.
Vowels contrast not only by where they are made in the oral cavity, but also by
the quality of voice used. The language also uses four different pitch levels to
convey meaning contrasts, and to make phrasing more perspicuous and maintain
rhythm in spoken language. While many languages in the world use pitch
contrastively, pitch is used somewhat differently in Ju/'hoasi and other Khoisan
languages. In addition, some of the consonants have a depressing effect on
pitch, and thus cause physical perturbations in the speech which may be
cognitively internalized. These will be investigated to determine how much of
these effects are phonological, or cognitively based, and how many are phonetic,
or due purely to the physical quality of the sounds. Complete investigation of
the sound patterns of Ju/'hoasi will require travel to Namibia to record
individual sounds, words, phrases and sentences which contrast by meaning, how
they are phrased, and which part of the sentence is being focused on. The data
will be processed both in the field using a laptop computer, and upon return to
the United States, where resources at the Ohio State University Linguistics Lab
will be used to investigate the physical acoustic properties of the sounds,
words and phrases studied. Theoretical analysis will be carried out throughout
the project. The final outcome of this work will be a doctoral dissertation by
the student investigator, Amanda Miller-Ockhuizen.
