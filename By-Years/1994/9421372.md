9421372 Zoran How complex patterns of synaptic connections are formed during
nervous system development and regeneration is a fundamental concern of
neuroscience. Developing neurons must make a series of choices, including the
differential recognition of appropriate and inappropriate pathways and targets,
that result in highly stereotyped patterns of connectivity. Once a growth cone
at the tip of a neuronal process arrives at its appropriate target region, it
forms potential synaptic contacts and initiates synapse formation. The idea that
growth cones derive specific recognition signals from targets and that these
signals regulate decisions of synaptic target choice has been considered for
some time; however, the molecular nature of these target-derived cues and the
mechanisms of their presynaptic transduction remain largely undefined. Cell-cell
interactions, between neurons and their synaptic partners, govern critical steps
in the formation of synaptic connections during nervous system development and
regeneration. This project will focus on early inductive events that govern the
acquisition of presynaptic secretory function during the selective synapse
formation of identified motor neurons in cell culture. Motor neurons,gain the
ability to release neurotransmitter only following contact with their
appropriate muscle targets. A major goal of these studies is to determine the
cellular mechanisms governing these inductive events. Neurons make a series of
choices, including pathway and target selections, during development that result
in highly stereotyped patterns of connectivity. These selection processes likely
involve the differential recognition of appropriate pathways and targets. This
work will provide insights into the molecular nature of retrograde synaptic
signals, the cellular basis of synaptic target discrimination, and the role of
cellular processes in the development of synaptic specificity.
