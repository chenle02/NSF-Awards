This project will support the purchase of equipment to improve the delivery of
course content and to enhance student discovery of mathematical concepts in
courses in linear algebra and numerical analysis. It is being funded under the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of
supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate
laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. The Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support for the
instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements
at U.S. colleges and universities. In particular, the main objectives of this
project are (1) to make computer-assisted delivery of course content an integral
part of the teaching mode, (2) to promote the discovery of mathematical concepts
by students through hands-on computer laboratory experiments and to reinforce
basic concepts through courseware, and (3) to assign individualized projects to
each student in the student's major field in order to enhance the symbiotic
relationship between mathematics and its applications. The initial focus of this
effort will be in courses in numerical analysis and linear algebra, with more
advanced courses to be affected later.
