9622770 Milne Professor Milne works in arithmetic geometry specifically on
problems in Diophantine geometry. He will study the conjecture of Langlands and
Rapaport on points on Shimura varieties over finite fields. He also hopes to
study the degeneration of abelian motives with the hope of exploiting the
relation to Shimura varieties in order to obtain information about the
compactifications of Shimura varieties over number fields. This project falls
into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks. ??
