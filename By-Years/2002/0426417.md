EarthTalk, Inc. will develop and air 24 90-second shows per year for three years
on the subject of nanotechnology on the Earth & Sky radio program. They will
partner with Nano Science and Technology Institute (NSTI), Boston; Nanoscale
Science and Technology Facility (CNF), Cornell University; and Center for
Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN), Houston to identify
researchers, advisors and program ideas. Program categories will be Nano 101;
Innovations that Could Change the World; Science or Science Fiction;
Implications and Ideas; Nano and the Environment; and Listener Questions. The
Earth & Sky program currently airs on 685 stations nationwide, making 323
million gross impressions each year; new shows will create some 64 million gross
impressions. They will be supplemented by related material on Earth & Sky
Online, which receives up to one million page views/month, and a composite of
the nano programs onto CD mailed directly to 10,000 teachers yearly.
