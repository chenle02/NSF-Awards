This proposal will focus on the coordinated and integrated use of space-based
(the ISTP constellation of satellites) and ground-based measurements of
ionospheric emissions and electrodynamics to investigate substorm onset and
evolution. The PI will continue to act as the GEM liaison to the NASA GGS
program to foster collaboration and to note times for which the satellite and
ground station locations are most optimum to address particular objectives. The
work here is focused toward the Tail/Substorm Campaign of GEM.
