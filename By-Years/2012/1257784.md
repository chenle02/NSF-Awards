Where species live changes through time -- for example, mountains may rise,
dividing one species into distinct populations, or a small group of individuals
may hitch a ride in ballast water and start spreading within a new geographic
area. To investigate the history of species through time, scientists often
represent possible histories as models and compare the fit of observed data to
these models. This grant will develop new modeling methods and software to allow
scientists to test alternative, complex models that best fit observed data for
various groups of organisms. A test case, using North American bats, will help
ensure that the new software can accommodate various types of data
effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has practical importance because the
new methods can be used to help identify sources of invasive species. It is also
important in conservation because these methods will provide information about
whether a species in different river systems is one or multiple populations,
whether hybridization is occurring between two related species, and what the
effective population size of a species has been through time. Graduate students
and postdoctoral students will be trained in these methods as well.
