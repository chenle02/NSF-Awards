9504275 Warren The goal of this project is the design and implementation of a
robust and efficient integrated optimizing compiler for the XSB system. XSB is a
system that integrates logic programming, deductive databases and nonmonotonic
reasoning. The combination of the three paradigms introduces challenges to the
design of an optimizing compiler for the system. Firstly, the combination give
rise to a number of unique optimization problems that are not germane to any one
of the paradigms alone. Secondly, an efficient compilation system must integrate
a suite of optimizations so as to extensively share ideas, formulations and
implementation efforts. Some of the interesting optimization problems relevant
to XSB will be identified and some preliminary ideas for their solution will be
sketched. A promising and powerful idea to integrate these optimizations through
the use of constraints will be outlined. The potential impact of the techniques
that will be developed in this project to the optimization of functional and
(constraint) logic programs will be shown. These techniques will form the
foundations for an integrated optimizing compilation system that spans multiple
languages and paradigms. ***
