The proposed research represents a collaborative research project entitled
"Embryonic Stem Cell Equivalents in Zebrafish to Study Early Development". The
three principle investigators are Nancy Hopkins (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology), Wilbur Long (Western Maryland College), and Paul Collodi (Purdue).
The long range goal is to understand early developmental processes at the
genetic level in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio. The immediate goal is to
follow up promising new results which suggest that it may be possible to develop
an equivalent to mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells for zebrafish. With this
technology, one can mutate genes by random insertion of promoter or gene trap
constructs or by targeted homologous recombination, select cells with desired
alterations, and then generate mutant organisms from them. The zebrafish would
be a superb organism in which to perform this type of mutagenesis and if
successful, this approach would make it possible to isolate large numbers of
insertional mutants affecting the desired developmental processes as well as
targeted mutations in genes suspected of playing important roles in the
processes.
