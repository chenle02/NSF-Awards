The project is aimed at the study of geometric evolution equations and related
topics, especially the Ricci flow. We study Li-Yau-Hamilton type Harnack
inequalities, their relations with Perelman?s entropy functional, and their
applications to geometric flows. Motivated by Hamilton?s work on singularities
analysis, we study properties of singularities and ancient solutions of the
Ricci flow on 4-manifolds with symmetry. The monotonicity of various geometric
operators under the Ricci flow is considered. We propose to investigate
geometric flows on locally homogeneous manifolds. This will help us to
understand the long time behavior of geometric flows better.

The Ricci flow has been a center of attention of differential geometry and
topology. Recent work of Perelman on Hamilton?s program of the Ricci flow gives
a solution to the long-standing Poincare conjecture and also a possible solution
to the geometrization conjecture. The proposed project will improve our
understanding of the Ricci flow program and as well as other geometric evolution
equations, such as mean curvature flow, Gauss curvature flow, cross curvature
flow and renormalization group flow. The project will also enhance our
understanding of other fields in differential geometry, parabolic PDE and
mathematical physics. The education component will help graduate students or
researchers in other fields to understand the Ricci flow program better.
