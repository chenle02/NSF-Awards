A hierarchical model that integrates database and control is developed for the
dynamic operation of manufacturing cell systems. Within the manufacturing
control hierarchy, the cell control micromodel can function autonomously for the
logic control of machines and robot move sequence in the cell. With a relational
database structure containing required process data, shop production orders are
decomposed through run-time database queries in constructing the corresponding
cell control commands. This research incorporates a novel approach of
integrating data, control, and the cell operating characteristics metamodels and
endows the system with a closed-loop ability in dealing with multiple dynamic
events inherent in manufacturing cell system operations.
