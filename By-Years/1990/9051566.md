The purpose of the project is to establish the groundwork for a working computer
integrated manufacturing (CIM) cell around the currently available CNC machines.
The immediate (not fully automated) cell will consist of a CNC lathe, CNC mill,
a SCARA robot for servicing the lathe, a table top jointed arm robot for
servicing the mill, a programmable logic controller for overall system
coordination, and a personal computer for on/off line programming and system
operation. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution. //
