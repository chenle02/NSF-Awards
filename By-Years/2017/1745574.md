The 2017 IEEE SEC Conference (Symposium on Edge Computing) will be held in San
Jose, CA on Oct. 12-14, 2017. This preeminent technical conference is the
primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of "edge
computing", a new paradigm in which the resources of a small data center are
placed at the edge of the Internet, in close proximity to mobile devices,
sensors, and end users, and the emerging Internet of Things. Participants will
have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions,
and interact with many people conducting leading-edge research in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help build student participation, particularly at
institutions where travel funds may not otherwise be available, the plan is to
support 20 students. Participation in conferences is a valuable and important
part of the graduate school experience providing students' exposure to senior
researchers and leading edge work in the field.
