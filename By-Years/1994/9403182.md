9403182 Siegel This grant provides support for a conference on nanophase
materials held in Davos, Switzerland. There is considerable interest in the
novel properties of nanophase materials. These materials have constituent phase
or grain structure modulated on a length scale less than 100 nanometers. They
are artificially synthesized by a wide variety of means. This conference focuses
on what is presently poorly understood about the synthesis, structure,
properties and potential technological applications of these three-
dimensionally modulated materials. %%% Nanophase materials have been shown to
have unique mechanical and physical properties. The science is relatively new,
and many possibilities exist for their technological applications in industry.
