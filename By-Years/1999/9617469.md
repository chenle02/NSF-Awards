*** 9617469 Traub This research looks at the relation between phenomena and
models of phenomena in scientific theories. It is especially germane to theories
in developing fields, like cognitive science, where the mathematical and
computational models today are tentative and may not connect well in their
theoretical constructs with phenomenological constructs coming out of the
empirical side of the science. The goals are to a) Formulate the issues
regarding empirical reality and scientific models more precisely so that limits
on knowability can be understood; b) Compare and contrast limitative results
across fields like cognitive science, biology, economics, and physics; and c)
Review scholarly work on limits that is scattered across disciplines. ***
