The proposal concerns the study of singularities of algebraic varieties. One
studies these singularities in two settings: in characteristic zero and in
positive characteristic. In each setting one defines invariants that measure the
singularities. Despite the different definitions, the two sets of invariants
exhibit many common features and subtle connections. In characteristic zero, the
invariants to be studied (more precisely, the log canonical threshold, and the
minimal log discrepancies) are defined in terms of divisorial valuations. A
fundamental result, the existence of resolution of singularities, gives a strong
finiteness statement when computing these invariants. The motivation for the
interest in such invariants comes from their applications to birational
geometry: certain conjectural properties of these invariants imply the
termination of flips, one of the outstanding open problems in higher dimensions.
The PI plans to study questions related to the main conjecture on log canonical
thresholds, that asserts that in fixed dimension, there are no increasing
sequences of such invariants. Another part of the proposal concerns invariants
defined in positive characteristic via the Frobenius morphism. They come out of
tight closure theory, but have many subtle connections with the invariants in
characteristic zero. In particular, a basic conjecture in the field connects in
a precise way the invariants in characteristic zero to those in positive
characteristic, via reduction mod p. The PI proposes to use D-module theoretic
ideas in order to study this conjecture.

Singularities are responsible for many phenomena, both in geometry and in
arithmetic. For example, they govern the asymptotic of the number of solutions
of congruences modulo prime powers, or the integrability of powers of
polynomials. It has been realized in the past few years that invariants of
singularities that show up in different contexts have deep connections amongst
them. One can hope that by approaching singularities from these various points
of view, one can get a richer picture, that can be used to attack problems with
applications in other fields.
