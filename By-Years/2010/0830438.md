PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Cutset Sampling and Processing&lt;br/&gt;D.L. Neuhoff
(P.I.)&lt;br/&gt;This research project is focused on the development of
efficient new methods for sampling and&lt;br/&gt;processing multidimensional
data such as images, video, or spatially distributed sensor
data,&lt;br/&gt;especially the first and last. Traditional methods of digital
image processing rely on the taking&lt;br/&gt;and processing of regularly spaced
samples (pixels), typically at the sites of a lattice, for example&lt;br/&gt;a
square grid of points. In contrast, this project is investigating digital image
processing&lt;br/&gt;based on samples taken in a cutset, the simplest example of
which is a square grid of lines that&lt;br/&gt;spans the image. More generally a
cutset is defined in terms of a set of neighborhood relations&lt;br/&gt;among a
discrete set of potential sample sites. Cutset sampling is expected to be
especially&lt;br/&gt;effective when the capturing of image edge information is
important.&lt;br/&gt;The principle motivations for cutset sampling derive from
the facts that two-dimensional data&lt;br/&gt;can often be well modeled by
Markov random fields and that unsampled pixels of Markov&lt;br/&gt;random fields
can be efficiently estimated with belief propagation algorithms. This
research&lt;br/&gt;project is investigating different forms of cutset sampling,
and it is developing reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;algorithms tailored to cutset
sampling, image compression methods based on cutsets,
distributed&lt;br/&gt;sensor network algorithms for scenarios in which sensors
are deployed on cutsets, and analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques to determine the
strengths and weakness of cutset sampling, and to enable
comparisons&lt;br/&gt;with conventional lattice-based sampling.
