This proposal provides partial support for the conference on "Combinatorial
Pattern Matching (CPM)", to be held in Tucson, Arizona April 29- May 1, 1992.
Combinatorial Pattern Matching addresses issues of searching and matching of
strings and more complicated patterns such as trees, regular expressions,
extended expressions, etc. The goal is to derive nontrivial combinatorial
properties for such structures and then to exploit these properties in order to
achieve superior performances for the corresponding computational problems. This
area is expected to grow even further due to the increasing demand for speed and
efficiency that comes especially from molecular biology and the Genome project,
but also from other diverse areas such as information retrieval (e.g.,
supporting complicated search queries), pattern recognition (e.g., using strings
to represent polygons and string matching to identify them), compilers (e.g.,
using tree matching), data compression, and program analysis (e.g., program
integration efforts).Two quite successful CPM Meetings have been held already.
CPM 90 was held in Paris and CPM 91 in London.
