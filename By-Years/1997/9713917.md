P.I.s plan to do research to develop quantitative measures of the environmental
impacts of construction materials used in the engineering designs of pipelines,
and residential and commercial buildings. They will assess the material and
energy inputs (nonrenewable and renewable resources), as well as the emissions
and waste (toxic discharges, hazardous waste generation, criteria pollutant
emissions, greenhouse gas discharges, ozone-depleting chemical releases)
associated with the construction materials' life cycle. The objective is to
provide metrics and analysis tools that can help define environmentally-
conscious construction. A computer spreadsheet tool will be programmed to
provide easy access of construction and environmental professionals to this
research's results and allow for informed decision-making.
