With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Novak will investigate the
design, preparation, and implementation of organometallic catalysts for the
"living" polymerization of monomers known to yield stable, helical polymers.
Specifically, new Ni(I) and Ni(II) catalysts for the polymerization of
isonitriles will be investigated. Detailed mechanistic studies will be performed
in an effort to provide the information necessary to modify these new catalysts
for specific applications. The basic premise of Dr. Novak's study is that
organometallic complexes, which possess versatile coordination spheres and
oxidation states, can be used to alter the reactivity of polymer endgoups in a
predictable manner and with a high degree of precision. Depending upon the
requirements of the particular reaction, the organometallic species may be
called upon to either activate or deactivate the polymer endgroup. Dr. Novak's
study is designed to provide a means by which endgroups can be rendered
unreactive toward all processes other than the desired initiation and
propagation steps that lead to polymer formation. %%% The ultimate
polymerization catalysts for the controlled synthesis of well-defined
macromolecules are "living". Living polymerizations can be used to synthesize
macromolecules with pre-determined molecular weights, narrow chain-length
distributions, and defined endgroups. In addition, living systems allow the
precise synthesis of "block copolymers", which offer a combination of properties
unobtainable from simple polymer blends or random copolymers. Dr. Novak will
utilize this approach for controlled synthesis of polyiso- nitriles, an
important class of soluble polymers. In addition, the living nature of his
approach will be exploited in the preparation of novel di- and tri-block
copolymers, which are of interest as a new class of thermoplastic elastomers.
