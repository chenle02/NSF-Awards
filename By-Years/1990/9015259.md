A group of computational researchers of the University of Colorado-Denver will
be involved in a study of multilevel algorithms, focussing on new technologies
and advanced computational architerutres and environments. The research is
categorized among the following eight topics: 1. Mixed Methods. 2. Iterative
Refinement. 3. Highly Advective Flow. 4. Preconditioned Iterative Methods. 5.
Multilevel Methods for Irregular Regions. 6. Multilevel Monte-Carlo. 7. Small-
Scale Structural Singularities. 8. Quantitative Analysis.
