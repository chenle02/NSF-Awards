ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP-0326805&lt;br/&gt;PI: Helen Aristar-Dry, Veronica
Grondona, Gary Holton&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Eastern Michigan
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cooperative project between the Alaska
Native Language Center at the University of Alaska and the LINGUIST List program
at Eastern Michigan University to preserve Arctic Languages. This proposal
creates the "DATA" (Dena'ina: Archiving, Digitization, and Access) project to
digitize existing collections of Dena'ina documentation using the standards and
software developed by The LINGUIST List as part of the E-Meld project. The
E-Meld project had developed and implemented recommendations of digital best
practice for linguistics data. Through E-Meld the DATA project will create long-
lasting archival formats and standardize linguistic data digitization of
Dena'ina. In addition, the proposal will train both Native and non-Native
students in linguistic research practices, applied computational linguistics,
and linguistic analysis for the future preservation and revitalization of
Dena'ina. This project will not only facilitate the preservation of Dena'ina for
community members, but also standardize the linguistics information so as to
make it accessible and useful for scientific computational
analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anna Kerttula&lt;br/&gt;Program
