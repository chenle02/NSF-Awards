9423702 Phillies Polymer solutions are being studied with light-scattering
spectroscopy (which is a non-invasive technique for determining the movements of
dissolved macromolecules performing Brownian motion), optical probe diffusion
(in which light scattering is used to monitor the diffusion of probe particles
through a polymer solution), and rheological instrumentation. Probes of
different sizes, and scattering experiments at multiple angles, are used to
examine the importance of length scale effects in polymer transport. Careful
determinations of light scattering spectral lineshapes will allow comparison of
phenomena seen in viscous polymer solutions with phenomena seen in simple
solutions near glass transitions. Experiment, supplemented with analytic theory,
computer simulations, and systematic literature review, will be applied in
efforts to refine or refute the hydrodynamic scaling model and other treatments
of polymer dynamics. %%% The objective of this research is to improve scientific
understanding of polymer dynamics (e.g., viscosity, viscoelastic behavior, self-
diffusion, rotational diffusion) in dilute and non-dilute solutions. The
dynamics of polymer solutions are important in a wide variety of scientific,
technical, and practical applications, from the purely scientific (diffusion of
proteins and mRNAs within living cells) to the mundane (thickness of
milkshakes). ***
