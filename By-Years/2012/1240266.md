Bivalve larvae are notoriously difficult and time-consuming to identify to
species level, and a method for rapid and accurate identification would enable
an entire class of new ecological field studies of bivalve recruitment
processes. Raman spectroscopy uses a focused laser beam to measure the calcium
carbonate and organic pigment molecules in bivalve shells and potentially allows
identification of species based on the composition of the valves. Using single
wavelength Raman spectroscopy, the PIs were able to distinguish Eastern oyster
larvae from six other bivalve species with 100% accuracy, while three other
species had identification accuracies greater than 80%. The PIs propose to
purchase a 3-wavelength confocal Raman Microscope to improve discrimination and
test the efficacy of Raman spectroscopy for widespread application in bivalve
larval identification. They will collect and analyze Raman spectra on larvae of
20 bivalve species to determine if reliable species-specific differences exist,
and will explore methods to improve analysis of spectral results. The
investigators plan to create an open database of spectral data from their
studies, will offer a workshop on their methods, and will make the equipment
available to the community under specified conditions for use.
