The project emphasizes undergraduate preparation in magnetics and involves
eleven undergraduate students in ongoing academic research projects under
principal investigators of the faculty in the Magnetics Technology Center of the
university. Various magnetic information technologies and other magnetic
technologies are areas of emphasis. The academic faculty and industrial lectures
participate in the project. The Magnetics Technology Center maintains contact
with students who have successful experiences in this project.
