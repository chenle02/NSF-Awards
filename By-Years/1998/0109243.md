Sherwin Singer of the Ohio State University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study a wide range of aqueous systems, from
small water clusters to bulk water and ice, using both analytical and numerical
theoretical methods. One unifying thread in this research is the analysis of
water structures in terms of the topology of the hydrogen bond network. Working
with the hydrogen bond topology yields analytical results for systems where only
numerical simulations would seem feasible. Moreover, the analytical approach
allows extraction of hydrogen bonding properties from small water clusters or
ice unit cells and, in a very general fashion, application of these parameters
to systems large enough for statistical simulations. In this way, the results of
high level ab initio calculations on small systems can be extended to predict
statistical properties in the thermodynamic limit. Statistical simulations will
also be performed with empirical potentials, including the PI's own dissociating
water model. Other plans include checks on the performance of empirical
potentials with ab initio studies, quantum Monte Carlo studies of vibrational
motion, and development of new ab initio molecular dynamics methods.

Modeling the behavior of biological molecules, systems in atmospheric chemistry,
or pollutants in the ground water requires accurate models for liquid water,
ice, and water clusters. The models for liquid water that exist are in need of
improvements, which will result from the outcomes of this research.
