That galaxies in dense clusters appear markedly different from galaxies outside
these regions (i.e., in the "field") was recognized even before the true nature
of galaxies was recognized. Underlying this observation is the fact that a
galaxyâ€™s gas supply and star formation activity also show a marked dependence on
environment. The objective of this project is to better understand how both are
altered as a galaxy moves through the cosmic web to the cluster centers. The
team will quantify environmental "quenching" of star formation by measuring the
relative extent of the star-forming and stellar disks for 14,000 nearby galaxies
- a factor of 20 increase over previous studies - to disentangle the correlated
effects of environment, galaxy mass, and morphology. This award will also
involve undergraduate students at both institutions in research, and support
outreach efforts to area K-12 students as well as a summer teacher training
program.

This work will (1) constrain the quenching timescale for the densest
environments where gas stripping is known to occur, (2) determine how the
network of cosmic filaments around clusters alters the spatial distribution of
star formation within galaxies, (3) shed light on how these processes act in
different environments to produce the observed changes, and (4) produce a data
set with lasting legacy value for studies of galaxy evolution in the nearby
universe. The team will fit Sersic models to the sample galaxies and determine
the effective radii of the stars (optical grz from the DESI Legacy Surveys and
infrared 3.4um from WISE) and star formation (WISE 12um). Non-parametric
profiles and total fluxes will also be derived for these galaxies through
elliptical aperture photometry using ultraviolet (GALEX), optical grz, and
infrared (WISE) images. These complementary techniques will yield robust
structural parameters for to galaxy sample. Custom software designed by the team
to overcome the challenges associated with measuring photometry of large
galaxies will be used, and self-consistent stellar mass and star-formation rates
(SFR) will be estimated for the entire sample through the analysis of their
ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions. The team will adopt
a more sophisticated characterization of galaxy environment by considering
filaments as well as cluster and field membership. This is an important addition
as recent hydrodynamic simulations suggest that filaments may be important sites
of galaxy transformation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
