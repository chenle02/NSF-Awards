Research will be conducted on a variety of problems in materials science and
condensed matter physics utilizing transfer matrix techniques and numerical
analysis. The common model to these research areas is the lattice gas model of
cooperative systems. The first part of the work will focus on low dimensional
systems. The primary emphasis will be on multicomponent absorption in
electrochemical systems. Structural phase transitions and oxygen ordering in
high temperature superconductors will also be studied. The second, more
speculative, part of the work will concentrate on developing non-equilibrium
transfer matrix techniques for lattice gas models.
