9322349 Sharp The purpose of this proposal is to request funding to continue the
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at SPRL begun in FY87
to attract, motivate and train undergraduates in the geosciences, specifically
within two areas of interest to the Atmospheric Sciences Division of NSF, namely
Solar Terrestrial and Aeronomical research. The proposal decribes the unique
combination of research interests and capabilities within the Space Physics
Research Laboratory. The nature of the proposed student activities are
discussed, together with the supervisory role to be played by the faculty
participants.
