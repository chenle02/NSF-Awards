This research focuses on characterizing the chemistry of singlet oxygen with a
specific emphasis on its reactions with alkenes and dienes. Product yields,
determined as a function of reaction conditions, and correlated with transient
intermediates, will be used to develop a protocol to predict and control the
reactions of this ubiquitous, metastable form of oxygen. Undergraduate, graduate
and postdoctoral students will be introduced to the chemistry of this energetic
form of oxygen and, through the development of the methods needed to
characterize singlet oxygen delayed fluorescence, the fast reaction techniques
used to explore its properties. With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program supports the research of Dr. Christopher S. Foote of the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Los
Angeles. Professor Foote will develop methods to predict and control the
chemistry of an energetic form of oxygen, called singlet oxygen, that is
currently implicated in the aging of sun-exposed skin, cataract induction, and
photocarcinogenesis. Professor Foote's research will introduce undergraduate,
graduate and postdoctoral students to the chemistry of this energetic form of
oxygen, and to the techniques to characterize the properties of transient
intermediates. ?¥??¢ ?> ¥©Á ?/¢¥ ¼©Á ¢¥??Á>¥ ??%% ??>???¥ ?/?¥????/>¥
