This project will study the solvability of nonlinear elliptic boundary value
problems. Main emphasis will be placed in the cases where either the problem is
semilinear but the spectrum of the linear part is not known, or the nonlinear
part interferes with the spectrum. Recent developments on abstractions of the
mountain pass lemma are expected to render information on the issue of existence
and multiplicity of solutions for these problems. The problems to be studied are
basic questions arising in equations that model problems in areas such as
mathematical physics, biomathematics, and chemistry.
