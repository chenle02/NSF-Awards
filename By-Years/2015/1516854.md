The objective of this program is to further our understanding both of supernovae
as astrophysical objects and of their use as a powerful cosmological probe.
Broader impacts of the work include research training of graduate students and a
postdoctoral scholar, and outreach via public talks and popular books and
articles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will advance knowledge of Dark
Energy and other cosmological parameters by employing supernovae as a measure of
the expansion history of the Universe. The study of supernovae in the infrared,
as will be done here, is especially promising given the excellent standard
candle behavior as compared to visible wavelengths. The work will provide new
insights on Dark Energy, the discovery of which was pioneered by this group.
