9400099 Cole This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
materials science between Milton Cole of Pennsylvania State University and Julia
Yeomans of Oxford University. The focus of their research is physical adsorption
on surfaces. Two principal topics will receive attention: capillary condensation
in porous media; and wetting and prewetting phenomena. The U.S. and U.K.
investigators, who are theoretical physicists, have considerable expertise and
overlapping interests. They will collaborate on calculations and new models. The
field of physical adsorption has received much attention in the last few years
because of its technological importance. While this proposal addresses
fundamental questions of interest to surface scientists and chemical engineers,
its topics underpin important technologies for pollution control, catalysis and
chemical segregation. ***
