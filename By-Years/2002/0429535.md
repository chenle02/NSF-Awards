Intellectual Merit:

The project builds on a recently completed NSF project, in which the PI
developed a prototype of a dynamically adaptive compilation system. This system
has demonstrated significant gains in overall program performance in science and
engineering applications. There is tremendous potential in moving compiler
optimization decisions to runtime, where complete information is available. For
example, knowing the input to a code section would allow the compiler to
directly produce this code's output, delivering the program response instantly.
The new concepts and implementations will (i) enable a new generation of
applications that improve as they age and adapt to changes unforeseen by their
developers, (ii) provide solutions to key open issues in the design of current
compilers, such as where and when to apply what optimization techniques, (iii)
address new problems arising in tomorrow's increasingly dynamic, mobile, and
unreliable execution environments.

Broader Impact:

While the narrow view of the project goals is to develop advanced compiler
techniques for high performance computer applications, the successful completion
of the proposed work will have a broader impact. These techniques will be
distributed to publicly available compiler infrastructures using the Polaris and
Cetus compilers. The PI has been distributing the Polaris compiler to other
researchers for many years, and it is one of the most advanced and widely known
HPC compiler research infrastructures. These infrastructures have been used in
courses among Students using the newest compiler technology. Using this basis,
we will make a concerted effort to combine the proposed research with
educational activities at the undergraduate and graduate level. Furthermore, the
proposed effort addresses what is Believed to be the most severe limitation of
the current generation of compilers, which is the compilers' conservative
assumptions, due to the lack of runtime knowledge. Dynamically adaptive
techniques have the potential to increase the power of compiler optimizations
very significantly and hence contribute to improved programmability of high-
performance computing applications in general. Finally, while our goal is to
advance those application areas where performance is the most critical value
-high-performance computing applications -our techniques are generic in nature
and will thus benefit all classes of software.
