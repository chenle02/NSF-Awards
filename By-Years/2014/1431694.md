The critical importance of effective teamwork in engineering is widely
recognized. Surprisingly, however, relatively little is known about how to
develop teamwork skills in higher education classes, including what factors
contribute to effective teamwork, their relative importance in a team's overall
performance, and the underlying individual and interpersonal dynamics.
Increasing numbers of engineering instructors are adopting instructional
practices relying on teamwork, yet many instructors simply form student teams
and hope the members individually and collectively learn on their own how to
work in teams and succeed in their task(s). Instructors do this because they do
not have guidance for a better approach. This research project aims to address
this gap in faculty knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The empirical studies
conducted as part of this project build on research in engineering education,
cognitive psychology, social psychology, and other fields in a coordinated
large-scale research project that will provide faculty with needed knowledge and
tools to ensure that students learn team skills. The research team is conducting
seven separate studies measuring the impact of teamwork training, experience
working in teams, practice rating the teamwork of fictitious team members, and
giving and receiving peer feedback. The research is measuring each of these
effects in real teams on three learning outcomes: improved teamwork knowledge,
improved ability to evaluate teamwork, and improved ability to function
effectively in teams. These studies will result in practical recommendations for
time-pressed faculty to implement.
