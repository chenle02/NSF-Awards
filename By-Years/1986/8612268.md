DNA molecules play a central role in the biological processes of the living
cell. During the life cycle of the cell, they undergo a change in their
conformational states going from the highly organized and condensed form in
chromosomes to a more open state that presumably exists when the DNA is
biologically active, as during replication, transcription, genetic recombination
or in DNA repair. In order to understand how the different steps of these
biological reactions are carried out and regulated, it is necessary to have a
clear picture of the different conformational states that DNA molecules are
capable of adopting. Dr. Wang will carry out high resolution single crystal
neutron diffraction studies on crystals of deoxyoligonucleotide molecules as
well as their complexes with antitumor drugs in order to understand the
structure and dynamics of DNA molecules. From these studies, the solvent
organization around the DNA molecules will be carefully defined and analyzed.
The information obtained from neutron diffraction studies will be compared with
that from X-ray studies and correlated with the solution biophysical properties
of DNA that have been studied extensively by other spectroscopic techniques such
as nuclear magnetic resonance and laser Raman spectroscopy.
