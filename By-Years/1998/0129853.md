The project will be devoted to the growth of III-V diluted magnetic semi-
conductors (III-V DMSs) ternary compounds in which the anions are re- placed
with a member of the 3d-transition group. The motivation and goal of the program
are to explore and establish the conditions for successful growth of single
crystals which will be materials suitable for investigating the ex- traordinary
physical phenomena originating in the large magnetic moments of 3d-transition-
ion (3d-TMI) and their role as acceptors. The simultaneous presence of free
holes and the large magnetic moments provide the ingredi- ents for novel
phenomena associated with spin-polarized charge carriers. The growth will
initially focus on the incorporation of Mn, Co and Fe into GaAs, InP, GaP and
InSb by thermal diffusion and melt growth. Spectroscopic (Fourier Transform
Infrared, Raman and photoluminescence, modulated re- flectivity/transmission and
magneto optic characterization at Purdue and those based on magnetic, electron-
paramagnetic-resonance, and non-linear spectroscopy by international
collaborators will provide invaluable feedback to the crystal grower. Another
collaboration will address the production of ultrapure starting material and
fabrication of substrates suitable for molec- ular beam epitaxy (MBE). Basic
science and device related work will be ini- tiated during this phase. Besides
the crystal growth program implemented by the Co-PI, students will participate
in the characterization activities and will acquire a healthy appreciation of
growth techniques. This exposure and involvement will prepare them for the
scientific/technical workforce of the 21st century.

The aim of the program is to provide a "steady state-" supply of well
characterized III-V diluted magnetic semiconductors to our ongoing research on
collective and localized excitations of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic
character. The access to bulk single crystals as well as material as MBE- grown
epilayers and quantum well structures will give the participants the intense
excitement of basic research significant in device applications.
