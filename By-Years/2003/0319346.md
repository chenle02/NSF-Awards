This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a high
performance optical switch. The optical communication is a fastest growing
technology in modern communication industry meeting the ever-increase in market
demand for bandwidth. Fiberoptic communication is inherently immune to
detection/interception and jam, which is particularly important to missile
defense missions, such as laser radar and other military communication. Optical
switches are the most critical component in optical communication but yet the
weakest part to date. Optical switch technology needs a breakthrough with
technology that proposes an innovative solution to overcome the current
bottleneck and achieve the state-of-the-art optical switch at the lowest cost.
Based on the recent breakthrough of electro-optic material an extremely simple
but innovative device architecture, the proposed optical switch will outperform
any existing solutions and have a great impact to fiber-optic applications as
well as commercial communication and optical computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
low cost and high performance optical switch will have wide application in
defense systems such as laser radar, fiber-optic sensor system, and local area
networks. It will also have great application in commercial communication market
where optical switches play a critical role. The market potential for such
device is huge and is projected to reach $3 billion by year 2006.&lt;br/&gt;
