Rice is a staple food for more than 1/3 of the world's population and the second
most important crop in terms of global production. Given global population
growth, limited resources of fresh water, and global warming, it is very
important to develop stress-tolerant varieties of rice. This research has the
potential to advance both basic and applied knowledge regarding how RNA
structure regulates expression of diverse genes in response to abiotic stresses,
information that may useful for crop improvement. In addition to the training of
students and postdoctoral associates, this project will provide summer training
for underrepresented high school students in math and sciences in collaboration
with the SEECoS program (http://science.psu.edu/outreach/special-
programs/seecos-summer-experience-in-the-eberly-college-of-science) at Penn
State. This project will also contribute to a new training program for ethics at
Penn State and to an ethics module on Genetic Manipulation. All project outcomes
will be made available to the public. Sequence data will be available at
http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/ and through long term repositories such as the
NCBI-SRA, Galaxy, and the Single Nucleotide Resolution Nucleic Acid Structure
Mapping (SNRNASM; http://snrnasm.bio.unc.edu/)website. Biological materials
generated in this project will be available on request or through the Dale
Bumpers National Rice Resource Center.

When plants are subjected to drought, molecular crowding within cells is
enhanced and osmolyte and K+ concentrations increase. Likewise, when plants are
stressed from temperature, RNAs in cells are thermodynamically affected. Taken
together, these observations suggest that drought and temperature regulate RNA
folding, and that RNA structure may play a central role in regulating gene
expression and stress tolerance in rice. To evaluate the contribution of RNA
structural changes to the regulation of gene expression in rice, this project
will leverage, advance and apply recently developed in vivo and computational
tools to reveal, on a genome-wide basis, how RNA folds in vivo in rice during
drought and temperature stress.
