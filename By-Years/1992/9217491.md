Radioanalytic imaging needs of researchers at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center have overwhelmed the limited capabilities of the Betascope blot
analyzer and our scintillation counters. Researchers now require substantially
more capacity for obtaining high resolution, quantitative analyses of
radioanalytic data than is available with existing facilities. The
PhosphorImager facility requested in this proposal includes a laser scanner,
high efficiency, high resolution storage phosphor screens, an image analysis
work station, optical drive back up system, and a grey scale printer. We
anticipate that this facility will expand our capacity for radioanalysis a
minimum of four to six fold to meet current and future needs. In addition to
increasing the speed and efficiency of standard analyses, this unique storage
phosphor system will allow us to convert qualitative assays to quantitative
assays and will also permit us to carry out novel experiments requiring
sensitive, high resolution analyses of large areas that are impossible with
existing facilities.
