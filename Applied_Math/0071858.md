It is proposed to study some nonlinear partial differential equations from fluid
dynamics and liquid crystal physics. These equations are the laws of motion of
their respective physics. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the materials
make the solutions of the equations singular, unstable, and hard to calculate.
It is planned to use advanced analytical tools to study the structures of the
singular solutions. In the case of the liquid crystal wave equation, for
example, the plan is to study it as one of the simplest examples of nonlinear
generalizations of the basic linear wave equation. It can be seen from its
elegant form that there will be many applications of the equation in the future.
Singularities of its solutions have been shown to exist recently by the
principal investigator and his collaborators. It is these singularities that
block the establishment of a general theory of existence, uniqueness, and
stability of solutions. It is planned to do detailed estimates and analysis on
the singularities and improve current compactness arguments to form an existence
theory of solutions. The result of the investigation will be a clear
understanding of the worst possible solutions, and thereby quantify our
knowledge of the physics and offer guidance in numerical computations of general
solutions.

The research will involve the study of some applied mathematical problems in the
fields of fluid dynamics (which includes motion of the air and water) and liquid
crystal physics in material science. Scientists and engineers have used
mathematical equations, called partial differential equations, to model the
motions. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the materials show up in the
form of singularities and instabilities in the solutions of the equations. It is
these singularities and instabilities that often spoil accurate numerical
computations of the solutions. It is planned to use the state of the art
analytical tools to study the structures of the singular solutions. In the case
of a compressible gas such as air, for example, the principal investigator plans
to isolate typical singularities (hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and
investigate their individual structures. The result of the investigation will be
a clear understanding of the worst possible solutions, and thereby quantify our
knowledge of the physics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical
computations of general solutions.
