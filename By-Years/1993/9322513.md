The structure of feasible computations determines whether one can efficiently
solve the optimization problems posed by nature and the modern world. The long-
term goal of this research is to understand which problems have efficient
solutions, via learning why certain problems may lack computationally feasible
algorithms. Of particular interest are the structural relationships between
complexity classes, and the internal structure of complexity classes. Though the
project intends to broadly investigate this area, focus will be given to the
research via two themes: (a) dealing with unpredictable execution order; and (b)
the properties of sparse sets. On the first topic, this project investigates the
class of languages computable via a large number of short subtasks, each of
which is given the (small) result of the subtask that executed before it. This
has been studied by Cai and Furst and others for the case where the scheduling
of the subtasks is trivial and fixed. However, the project studies the case in
which the order in which the subtasks execute is unpredictable. On the second
topic, several issues dealing with sparse sets (which are a classic examples of
`sets of low information content`) are examined.
