Title: Mathematical Sciences: Dyadic Ramification in a Quartic Number Fields
This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant to study the
branching or ramification of the prime number 2 in an arbitrary quartic member
field. Several cases involving polynomials at different powers will be examined.
The proposer will seek invariant from the different cases and possibly obtain a
single solution. The planning period will allow the identification of
appropriate research designs and the implementation of pilot studies. This grant
will provide support for a well-trained minority mathematician to prepare a
competitive proposal to submit to the MRI research initiation component.
