Numerical and theoretical studies of pattern formation in a variety of
nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamical systems will be studied. These studies
include the kinetics of phase separation in binary alloys, polymer blends and
block copolymers. Additional topics include Rayleigh Benard convection in pure
fluids and reaction- diffusion phenomena in chemical and biological systems.
These studies involve application and improvement of algorithms developed in
prior work. As such, algorithm development for massively parallel computers is
included to facilitate the solution of some of these problems. The grant is
funded through the Materials Theory program in the Division of Materials
Research and the New Technologies program in the Division of Advanced Scientific
Computing.
