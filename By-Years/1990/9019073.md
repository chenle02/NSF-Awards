Description: This project supports travel and field expenses for a team of U.S.
scientists headed by Dr. Gregory Possehl from the University Museum, the
University of Pennsylvania, with logistical and technical backing of an Indian
team, to conduct archeological research at the Harappan site of Babar Kot in the
State of Gujarat in India. The research is expected to continue over four
seasons of excavation. The Gujarat State Department of Archeology will provide
the local support. The site is strategically located between Rojdi and the major
Urban Phase Harappan settlements of Rangpur and Lothal. The mound is
approximately three meters high, one of the few stratified Harappan sites in
Saurashtra, and about 2.66 hectares in size. Save for surface plowing, Babar Kot
is undesturbed. The research design at Babar Kot is based on two theoretical
issues: those of relevance to understanding the complex societies generally, and
those relevant to understanding the Harappan civilization. Given the vrtually
total lack of historical record for the Harappan Civilization, the route planned
in this work is to study the spatial patterning, including the distribution of
physical remains (artifacts, architecture, settlements) as well as the way they
went about doing things (subsistence systems, trading relations, cultural
ecology). Scope: This project is a major collaborative undertaking between U.S.
and Indian scientists in archeological research in an area of great scientific
interest. The costs of the research are shared by the two teams. The size of the
undertaking is in this case an indication of the potential for improving our
understanding of the Harappan Civilization, based on the sucess achieved in
earlier excavations by the two teams in the area.
