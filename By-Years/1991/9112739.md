A user mode research program will be carried out in few nucleon physics, in
nuclear structure studies, and in deep inelastic muon scattering. This work will
be carried out largely at TRIUMF, with reduced level of activities at FNAL and
IUCF. Improved understanding of the NN interaction below 1 GeV, nuclear
structure, and effective interactions are sought. Also, new data will be
generated regarding the hadronization of quarks in deep inelastic muon
scattering. Data will be compared to theories including the extended Bonn
potential and relativistic nucleon-nucleus scattering formalisms. Simulations,
detector development, data analysis, interpretation, and other related
activities will be carried out at Ohio University.
