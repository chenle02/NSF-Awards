A class of macromolecules known as arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), that are
present both at the outside surface of the plasma membrane and in the cell wall
space of plant cells, will be investigated. Because AGPs have the ability to
bind carbohydrates and are localized on the surface of the plasma membrane, they
may play an important role at the membrane- cell wall interface in terms of
cellular responses. The main objectives of the investigation are to compare the
structure of AGPs on the cell wall with that of AGPs in plasma membrane, to
study AGP interaction with some antigens, to characterize an enzyme that
destroys the carbohydrate binding properties of plasma membrane AGPs, and to
characterize the interaction between the AGPs and the plasma membrane with those
in the cell wall. The project will increase our knowledge about the structural
components of plasma membrane in plant cells and interaction of those components
with the cell wall. Knowledge gained from this could eventually lead to a better
understanding of cell adhesion, water retention, disease resistance and cell-
cell recognition in plant cells.
