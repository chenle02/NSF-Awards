Mechanics of Sandwich Nanostructures Hanchen Huang and George Dvorak, Rensselaer

This project aims to determine the strain-structure relationship of a novel
sandwich nanostructure. Based on self-organization, the Principal Investigator
and his team have deposited Cu on SiO2 substrate. The Cu self-organizes into
three layers: uniform <111> texture to porous <110> texture and back to uniform
<111> texture, forming a novel sandwich structure with each layer being hundreds
nanometers in thickness. Taking this sandwich structure as a prototype, the
investigators will establish the strain-structure relationship by using a
combination of atomistic simulations and multiscale micromechanics modeling. The
scientific contribution of this project will be in the establishment of strain-
structure relationship of nanoscale sandwich structures. The strain-structure
relationship will enable one to design the sandwich structures (in terms of its
layers thicknesses) and to apply it in various nanotechnologies. The broader
impacts of this project include the education of graduate students, particularly
those underrepresented, and the enrichment of graduate course Nanomechanics of
Materials at RPI.
