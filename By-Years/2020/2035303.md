The project advances our understanding of the way sand moves over the surface of
the earth. Sand gets carried by winds and currents, and then piles up into dunes
and shoals. These dunes and shoals encroach on farmland and pose shipping
hazards, but also protect coastal ecosystems and trap nutrients and moisture.
The difficulty is to predict the conditions under which sand will move, rather
than stay put. The way steady flows cause sand to move are relatively well
understood, but in practice flows are unsteady and turbulent. The distinguishing
feature of turbulence is that it pushes and pulls on the surface of sand beds
and so helps the sand to come loose. This project introduces a new laboratory
experiment that encapsulates the particular pushing and pulling action of
turbulence in order understand precisely how it contributes to the motions of
sand, so that we can predict when sand will move. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goals of the project are to determine the conditions under which oscillating
pressure gradients in fluid flow over porous granular beds cause bed failure,
and to model the subsequent evolution of the beds once failure has occurred. A
laboratory experiment, which is notably compact relative to the majority of
those that investigate sediment transport by fluid flows, generates failure in a
bed of fluid-saturated glass beads by the oscillations of a metal plate immersed
in the fluid above the bed. Variation of the frequency and amplitude of the
oscillations permit characterization of the bed response over a wide range of
conditions. Through large variation in the density ratio between the sediment
and fluid by means of a variable pressure gaseous atmosphere above and within
the bed, the project has the potential to reveal how the mechanisms of bed
failure differ over the full range observed on earth in the atmosphere and
oceans, as well as on other planets or moons with both thicker and thinner
atmospheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
