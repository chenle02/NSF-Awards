This research project focuses on the study of the nature and extent of the
strong field excitation of molecules. Recent theoretical work shows that
diatomic molecules possess an electronic structure in which the AC Stark shift
is greatly reduced and the multi-photon coupling is greatly enhanced to such an
extent that high-order (n&gt;10) multi-photon pi pulses can be produced through
a resonant process. The behavior of molecules in strong laser fields as a
function of laser wavelength will be studied using an optical parametric
amplifier, and ultraviolet fluorescence spectroscopy will be used as a highly
specific indicator of the excited states formed. This work is expected to have a
major impact in the vast field of laser/matter interactions. Moreover, these
experiments require state-of-the-art laser systems, giving students hands-on
experience with the latest laser and optical technologies and, thus, will
prepare them for a variety of research-based or high-tech career paths.
