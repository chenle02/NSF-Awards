The Disaster Research Center (DRC) is undertaking a study of the preparedness
and response patterns of lifeline organizations in community disasters. Under
"lifeline" DRC is looking at groups usually known as public utilities (e.g.,
electric, gas, water, telephone companies), public works (e.g., streets and
roads, sanitation and garbage, sewerage) and public transportation organizations
(e.g., bus, subway, railway, taxicab companies). Their planning for and their
emergency time actions in community wide crises emanating from disaster agents
is being examined in on-site field studies. Data from intensive open ended
interviewing, participant observing and document collecting are being gathered
on the characteristics (structure and function) of lifeline organizations, their
interorganizational relationships with other disaster relevant groups, the
social factors or conditions which result in these features, and the
consequences for both group and community preparedness and disaster management.
Besides filling in a lacuna about disaster relevant groups, the research will
allow an analysis of how the activities of lifeline organizations affect the
planning and response of other local emergency oriented groups, and provide the
complementary social science side to the work being done on the engineering and
technical aspects of lifeline systems. Special attention will be given to
earthquakes especially since lifeline systems are usually heavily impacted in
such disasters.
