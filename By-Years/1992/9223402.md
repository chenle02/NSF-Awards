Intense specialization in all fields of knowledge often precludes contact by
scientists with common interests in environmental problems. A traditional
vehicle for promoting cross-disciplinary research on important topics is
conferences organized around a specific scientific research theme. This award
continues NSF support for a project that has brought together a group of
recognized experts on all aspects of social and ecological research in order to
write a comprehensive history of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin. The project
focuses on long-term ecological change leading to present day problems facing
the ecosystem, including both human and natural causes of change. One conference
already has been held to bring together recognized authorities to exchange ideas
and research findings. A second conference will reconvene this group and allow
them to make arrangements for revisions in individually written chapter texts,
which should result in a more coherent and synthetic volume that documents and
explains how human and natural forces have shaped the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.
Through this innovative project, biological scientists from several specialties
are assessing problems of natural change in concert with historians and
anthropologists, who are focusing on the impacts of human activity. The result
will be a comprehensive study of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, which in
addition to providing valuable new information and insights about that region,
will also provide a benchmark for integrative analyses of other regions.
