9321910 Biscaye This award is for support for a one year project to apply a
variety of natural tracer techniques to the varying concentrations of dust in
the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core, during the period from the
Older Dryas to the Pre-Boreal, and to the varying dust concentrations deposited
during the stadials and interstadials which correspond to Heinrich Events H4 and
H3. Several natural tracers including mineralogical analysis, isotopic analysis
of aluminosilicates (Strontium, and Neodymium) and of soluble minerals such as
calcite and gypsum (Oxygen, Sulfur and Carbon), and pollen analysis are proposed
to help determine the origins of this material. Preliminary work on ice core
samples from the last glacial maximum (LGM) have demonstrated significant
mineralogical variation, indicating a southward shift in dust source area
between samples from a lower-dust, interstadial period and a higher-dust,
stadial period about 700 years apart. With this information, net airmass
transport pathways can be used to aid in the modeling of atmospheric
paleocirculation patterns. ***
