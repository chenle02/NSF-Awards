9632680 McMillan This project is designed to capitalize on (i) the existence of
an unusually large number of productive neuroscientists at a public university
in a rural state as well as faculty in the Departments of Mathematical Sciences
and Computer Science whose work relates to neuroscience and (ii) the desire of a
group of well-known computational neuroscientists at prestigious institutions
throughout the country, as well as in Europe, to establish a literal and virtual
collaboratory that will facilitate their ability to exchange ideas as well as to
share facilities. The primary goal (1-5 years) of the project is to establish an
Institute of Computational Neuroscience at Montana State University-Bozeman
(MSU). In addition to the neuroscientists already at MSU, the institute will, at
least for the first few years, consist of two new on-site faculty members and
five affiliate members. The affiliates will spend significant time at MSU each
year and will develop a network to enhance their collaborative interactions when
they are at their home institutions. A long term goal will include efforts to
recruit as many affiliates as possible to become resident members of the
institute.
