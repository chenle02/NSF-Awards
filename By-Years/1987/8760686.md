The chemical composition of the troposphere is determined by the sources and
sinks of biogenic and anthropogenic trace gases and the intervening
photochemical transformations and mass transport processes linking them. The
recent recognition that a thorough understanding of these processes in the
natural atmosphere is necessary before the effects of man-made perturbations may
be assessed has prompted a concerted effort to study the natural troposphere.
The insight gained from this research will allow more accurate predictions of
the impact of man's activities on the environment. The objective of this Phase I
SBIR research project is the development of instrumentation to measure fluxes of
atmospheric trace gases to or from the earth's surface. The method to be
investigated is based on the well established eddy correlation technique and
would use a tunable diode laser light source combined with a multiple pass
absorption cell to detect trace species at sub-part-per-billion levels. The
instrument would be designed specifically to be interfaced with a sonic
anemometer to provide fast time response and minimal flowfield interference as
required for the eddy correlation method. In the Phase I study, designs for a
reduced pressure trace gas sampling system are to be evaluated and tested, and a
multiple pass absorption cell which maximizes the path length and minimizes
interference fringes will be designed and evaluated. The results of the Phase I
effort are expected to resolve critical design issues and permit the development
of field instrumentation in succeeding phases. The final instrument will be
applicable to flux measurements of trace gases including sulfur dioxide, nitric
oxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide.
