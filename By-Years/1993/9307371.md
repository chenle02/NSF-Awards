This award supports the visit by Xiao Wanru, Nanjing University, to collaborate
with Professor Shivaram, University of Virginia, on research on heavy electron
superconductors. Dr. Shivaram currently holds a grant from the NSF Division of
Materials Research for a three year project on ultralow temperature tunneling
studies of heavy electron superconductors. Through collaboration with Xiao Wanru
on this project, the principal investigator anticipates contributions to
improved superconductivity theory. Xiao Wanru will be responsible for design and
construction of some of the experimental equipment and will participate with the
other members of the research team in applying her expertise in tunneling
phenomena to investigate heavy electron superconductors.
