Abstract CTS-9525783 Taylor This proposal focuses on understanding the mechanism
of formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) from chlorinated
acetylenes and the formation of chloacetylene from chlorinated hydrocarbons. The
claim of this proposal is that a better understanding of the formation kinetics
of these precursors will lead to technology for their prevention.
