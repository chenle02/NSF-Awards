This project will bring together an interdisciplinary group of thirty college
teachers in ecology, biological resource management, mathematics, and
statistics. In the Summer 1993 workshop at the University of Montana
participants will learn about the uses of mathematical and computer modeling as
tools for the science of conservation biology through lectures, colloquia,
hands-on computer projects and twice-weekly field trips designed to examine
major conservation issues. During the 1993-94 academic year at their home
institutions, participants will explore applying the concepts and methods of the
workshop in collaborative classroom projects and scholarly activities. In a six-
day follow-up session at the University of Wyoming Research Center in Summer
1994 participants will report to workshop colleagues and evaluate their
experiences.
