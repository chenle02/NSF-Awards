This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, Efficient
Software Implementation of NPP Communications Processor, tests and analyses a
prototype of a software implementation of a New Peer-to-Peer (NPP) asynchronous
communication processor, which performs communications coordination in parallel
with computations.

Three areas of commercial applications for NPP are; Massively parallel High
Performance Cluster Computing for real-time and non-real-time computations,
Self-scheduling Parallel Programming with data distribution based on data
availability, and Network-Oriented applications in finance, health, education,
business and manufacturing. Efficient software implementation of NPP
communications processor can dramatically decrease asynchronous communication
latencies by several orders of magnitude, provide tools to dynamically debug and
schedule portable parallel software systems, and provide infrastructure to
produce robust software systems that can evolve dynamically. The size of this
market opportunity is at least 1.2 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. NPP
communications processor deployed through an API will dramatically impact this
market.
