Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of this project are to
explore magnetically-driven transitions in molecule-based materials and to
invest in the education of a diverse group of young people at the University of
Tennessee. Both initiatives advance the fundamental understanding of new
electronic and magnetic states of matter while contributing to important
societal values and outcomes. The scientific impacts of this research derive
from our across-the-board interest in the fundamental interactions between light
and matter, the emergent behaviors that are unveiled when materials are driven
away from ambient conditions, and the new states of matter that emerge when
phases compete. This work builds on prior experience with low temperature, high
magnetic field, and high pressure spectroscopy, and it leverages the facilities
at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the National Synchrotron
Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. At the same time, planned
activities support the interdisciplinary education of a diverse group of young
researchers for future employment in academics, government laboratories, and
industry in the area of advanced materials. A broad range of outreach and
service activities are planned, especially in the area of conference and
workshop organization and service to various national laboratories.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the
spectroscopic properties of molecule-based materials and how external stimuli
like magnetic field and pressure impact functionality. Building on key advances
of the previous award period, current efforts concentrate on phase transitions
in model quantum magnets and hybrid multiferroics and the structure-property
relationships that can be unraveled in these systems. Within this broad
scientific area, several materials have been selected that are expected to show
large or widely applicable effects and where the analysis of the spectroscopic
response can reveal the microscopic aspects of coupling between charge,
structure, and magnetism. What brings these efforts together is an overarching
interest in the behavior of materials under extreme conditions and the
spectroscopic techniques with which these phenomena are investigated. Findings
from this comprehensive experimental program will advance both theoretical
understanding and the design of new materials.
