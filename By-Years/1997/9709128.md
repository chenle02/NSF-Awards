The project consists of two completely separate parts: a largely analytical
study of a particular nonlinear wave problem and a computational and modelling
study of orientation tuning in the mammalian visual cortex. The first part
considers a particular coupled system of nonlinear PDEs which the PI and M.
Shelley have already computationally shown to have finite time singularities of
"pinching type". The system is a model for the flow of a pair of immiscible
irrotational inviscid fluids in two dimensions. The singularity, in which one of
the two evolving functions goes from being strictly positive to positive except
for vanishing at a point, corresponds to a strand of fluid being broken in two.
Questions of existence and regularity of strictly positive solutions will be
considered, as will energy-methods to prove a finite-time singularity. In the
second part, the PI will work with experimentalists B. Shapley and D. Ringach on
various aspects of orientation tuning. Providing experience in modelling and
computation, various models will be compared to experimental results, with the
added possibility of the computational results being used to suggest further
experiments.
