ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCF- 0347683&lt;br/&gt;Cameron,
Kirk&lt;br/&gt;University South Carolina Research
Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit: Computer models
of complex phenomena deepen our understanding of the universe and indirectly
improve our quality of life. Large-scale parallel and distributed systems will
be used to meet the computational demands of distributed simulations. If
application performance efficiencies do not improve, the performance using
thousands of power hungry components will lead to intolerable operating costs
and failure rates. Fundamental technologies will be difficult. Years of intense
research aimed at improving the performance of applications in parallel and
distributed systems have led to average efficiencies of 5-10%. The continued
exponential increase in complexity makes maintaining these efficiencies through
tuning challenging. Improving efficiency dramatically will require
innovation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Completion of our research plan
will create technologies that improve the performance of distributed simulations
generally. This impacts a broad range of disciplines that perform simulation-
based experimentation including computational physics, biology and chemistry.
Reducing power consumption of large-scale applications will reduce operational
costs for computational center, increase system reliability through decreased
heat emissions, and impact the environment indirectly through energy
conservation. Completion of our educational plan will elevate the profile of
power-performance considerations in high performance computing. Recruitment and
mentoring of students will produce graduates with marketable skill sets. The
integration of developed technologies including research discoveries and tools
into educational curriculum at the University of South Carolina (USC) will
capture the interest of next generation computer scientist. Completion of this
project will allow the PI to lay a solid foundation for continued contributions
to the field of Computer Science. The objectives of this CAREER proposal are
also in line with the institutional goals of USC, an EPSCORE designated State
University, to promote research and education through
&lt;br/&gt;scholarship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
