PROJECT ABSTRACT Modern economic theory is built on the assumption that all
economic agents are completely rational, meaning that they always know what is
best for them and never make mistakes. Observed behavior however, is noisy and
cannot be predicted precisely. Small amounts of randomness at the individual
level may have a large effect on economic outcomes when people interact. This
project develops a realistic model of error-prone decision making that is used
to explain a number of discrepancies between observed human behavior and the
predictions of standard economic analysis. This approach is used to evaluate
alternative types of auctions and other mechanisms for coordinating the
activities of buyers and sellers. Other applications include charitable
contributions to public causes, strategic bargaining, and intra-industry
competition. In each case, data from laboratory experiments with human subjects
are used to refine our approach.
