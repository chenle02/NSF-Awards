This is a project to complete a dictionary of Chickasaw, a language spoken in
south central Oklahoma. Together with Choctaw, which is spoken in Oklahoma and
Mississippi, Chickasaw constitutes one of the four divisions of the Muskogean
language family, which is one of the major families of North American Indian
languages. A dictionary of the language is important both for the remaining
speakers of Chickasaw and for linguists attempting to piece together from
surviving fragments of American Indian languages an understanding of how these
languages were related to each other and their geographical distribution in the
New World prior to the disruptions and relocations attendant on non-Indian
population expansion into the areas inhabited by indigenous peoples.
