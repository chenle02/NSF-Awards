The atmospheric sulfur cycle is controlled to a large extent by natural
processes involving the release of biogenic sulfur gases into the troposphere.
An understanding of these processes is of importance to a number of global
problems in atmospheric chemistry, including: the origin of sulfur dioxide and
sulfate aerosol in remote regions; the impact of sulfur gases on tropospheric
oxidant cycles; the contribution of biogenic sources to acid precipitation in pH
sensitive ecosystems; and possible long-term climate controlling feedbacks
between greenhouse gases and cloud condensation nuclei. This project will
provide for a workshop to bring together many of the principal researchers who
are making sulfur gas measurements in the atmosphere. The purpose of the
workshop is to discuss the present analytical and field scientific problems so
that a successful intercalibration and validation of techniques and methods can
be planned and developed in the next three years. A successful intercalibration
on the measurement of sulfur gases will be an important mechanism of determining
the reliability of available research data on atmospheric sulfur chemistry to
develop future strategies for studying the biogeochemical cycling of this
environmentally important element.
