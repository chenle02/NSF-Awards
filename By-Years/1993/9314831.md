9314831 Wright This Phase II SBIR project will performm research related to the
production of fullerenes by the combustion synthesis method involving benzene
fueled flames burning under rich conditions and reduced pressures. Initial
experiments have demonstrated the potential ability to produce commercial
quantities of fullerenes by the flame synthesis process and have shown that the
method can be more economical than the carbon arc process. These tests, with an
un-optimized apparatus produced fullerenes for 10 to 20 per cent of the current
cost of the arc process. The Phase II objective will be to develop an
understanding of the synthesis process so that the rate of production and yield
can be improved. The parameters to be optimized include temperature, pressure
and equivalence ratio, using benzene as a fuel. The effects of fuel structure
and scale-up will also be investigated. Concurrent with this applied study, a
collaborative effort with the Colorado School of Mines, to develop a more
fundamental understanding of the synthesis process will be undertaken.
