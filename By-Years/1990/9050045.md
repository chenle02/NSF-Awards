The purpose of this project is to develop a Center for Reform in Science
Education based on the NSTA model for Scope, Sequence, and Coordination, and to
implement the model in grades 6-8 in seven schools spanning six counties in
North Carolina. Anticipated outcomes of this project, which focuses on the
spacing of science instruction and the teaching of ideas from concrete to
abstract, will include higher student performance on standardized science tests,
improvement of student and teacher attitudes toward science, and greater parent
involvement in the science program. The University of North Carolina at
Wilmington and East Carolina University , in cooperation with six Centers of the
North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education Network, will work with lead
teachers, university scientists, and science educators to pilot test the revised
middle school science curriculum. Cost sharing in the amount of $215,143 is 15%
of the NSF contribution.
