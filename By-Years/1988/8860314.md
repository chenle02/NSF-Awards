A new technique for mobile robot navigation and control has recently been
investigated. The technique uses a wide angle lens to image specified targets
and uses image detection and recognition to determine the position of the robot
with respect to the targets thus providing a basis for navigation control. This
sensor may also be used alone or with other sensors to provide obstacle
avoidance for stationary or moving objects. The higher level problems of path
following and region filling are also included in this research in a
hierarchical control structure. For unstructured and changing environments, the
navigation control problem is crucial. This research is directed toward the
vision control problem. In particular, a high speed vision tracking method is
proposed for this research. A hardware architecture using binary image
processing with multiple data and processing paths will be investigated. In this
manner, we hope to achieve vision tracking rates which will permit a vision
based controller to be used for a wide variety of mobile robots.
