This grant in Experimental Physical Chemistry supports research of Professor
Paul N. Schatz in both experimental and theoretical spectroscopy. His current
research program is designed to meet the need for basic electronic structural
information about the ground and excited states of molecular, ionic, mixed-
valent and radical species. This information is needed to test theoretical
models of these systems and to help interpret their chemical properties and
reactivities. The PI has also pioneered in the use of the Synchrotron light
source in basic chemical research. In forthcoming research Dr. Schatz will use
magnetic circular dichroism, absorption and emission spectroscopy to study
matrix isolated species over a wide spectral range from about 1500nm in the near
infrared through the visible and ultraviolet to about 120nm in the vacuum
ultraviolet. Synchrotron based vacuum ultraviolet measurements will be conducted
using a self-contained matrix isolation superconducting magnetic system. Mixed-
valence species will be studied theoretically and mixed-valent precursors of the
"organic metals" will be studied spectroscopically.
