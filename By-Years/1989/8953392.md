This project will introduce and study the effects of new instructional
methodologies using computer based electronic message networks. These
methodologies, called "Teleapprenticeships" will involve students, teachers, and
local area private sector partners in the study of particular issues involving
science and mathematics. Students may be in various cities throughout the world
all studying a problem such as the shortage of drinking water in their regions.
While they share data by electronic means, each may be developing and analyzing
the data locally with the help of local experts - for example university or
corporate researchers. The process of student interaction with each other and
with their mentors as well as other outcomes of the program will be studied in a
systematic and carefully designed research study. Results will be disseminated
through a variety of activities. Cost sharing by the partners will total 102% of
the National Science Foundation Funding.
