Drs. Mechoso and Arakawa will continue their two primary research thrusts on
fronts. First, they are investigating processes which lead to frontal formation
and the generation of unstable secondary waves on fronts, particularly in the
middle and upper troposphere. Second, they are developing new numerical methods
suitable for the study of frontal phenomena. Previous work by the investigators
now leads to the specific consideration of several topics: (1) the comparative
advantages and disadvantages of models which use relative pressure (.) as the
vertical coordinate and those which use potential temperature (>); (2) the
origin and evolution of small-scale disturbances on fronts; (3) the role of
diabatic processes in frontogenesis; and (4) the development of primitive-
equation models with a vertical coordinate that gradually changes from . at the
surface to > at upper levels. Under their previous grant, the principal
investigators made considerable progress in their work on the development of
large scale models capable of resolving frontogenetic processes. They have also
succeeded in addressing some of the fundamental questions about these processes.
Their research ultimately will contribute to the improvement of operational
weather forecast models.
