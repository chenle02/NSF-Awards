9526506 Umhoefer The eastern margin of Baja California is an example of a
continental margin that has experienced young (Plio-Quaternary) oblique rifting
which appears to have overprinted, slightly order orthogonal rifting. This style
of deformation may lead to formation of detached continental blocks that then
travel parallel to the margin, eventually becoming allochthonous terranes
attached or reattached to continental margins far from their point of origin.
The goals of this collaborative project to test the hypothesis that orthogonal
rifting was overprinted by oblique rifting, to document fault interactions, to
investigate segmentation of structures along the margin and to study the
associated land forms produced by these tectonic events. Results should help
understand the origin of the Gulf of California and, by analogy, may help
understand allochthonous terranes. Oh +' 0 $ H l D h R:\WWUSER\TE
