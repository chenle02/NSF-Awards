Commutative algebra and representation theory are two flourishing areas of
research in algebra. For commutative algebra, early on, its roots in algebraic
geometry and number theory provided the major influences, while representation
theory was partly motivated early on by problems in physics. More recently there
has been significant interaction between these two areas. Some of this
interaction goes back to the work of Auslander, his students and collaborators
in the 1970s, but the last decade or so has seen a striking resurgence of new
ideas and research in the overlap, as exemplified by recent work of Avramov,
Buchweitz, Burban, Huneke, Iyama, Reiten and Yoshino, to name only a
few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have been relatively few joint
meetings in the U.S. allowing researchers in commutative algebra and
representation theory and their students to interact. It is vital to support the
continued interactions between the areas by bringing together top researchers to
report on their findings and to establish new cross disciplinary collaborations.
Equally important is a gathering where recent doctorates, graduate students, and
faculty from primarily teaching institutions can learn about recent developments
and establish research connections with other workers across the two fields. To
address these issues, the investigators plan a three-day conference at Syracuse
University. The conference will take place on April 13-15, 2012. Leading
researchers from both commutative algebra and representation theory will speak
on their findings. Ample time for discussions will also be available to provide
an opportunity for the participants, including the speakers, to establish new
cross-collaborations. We intend to recruit an audience in which graduate
students and recent doctorates are significantly represented. The URL for the
