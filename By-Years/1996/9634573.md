9634573 Tsai Based on the recognition that crystal defects are very detrimental
to the service life of semiconductor single crystals, the objective of the
proposed research is to develop a nonlinear micromechanical finite element model
to calculate the multiplication and motion of dislocations in advanced III-V
compound semiconductor single crystals. Thermal stress during crystal growth is
identified as the chief factor in causing dislocations to form from the melt and
the proposed model addresses this and other related issues. The study will be
coupled with fluid, heat and mass transport models from NASA Lewis and this
represents a very good approach to the overall problem. This research should
provide a useful numeric tool for optimizing the growth of low density
semiconductor single crystals which is very important to the electronics
industry. ***
