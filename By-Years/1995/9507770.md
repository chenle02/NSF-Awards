Over the last two decades, Elwyn Simons' excavations at the Fayum Depression in
Egypt have provided the major discoveries and documentation of early monkey
evolution. It is a remarkable site, and Dr. Simons has been extremely diligent
and industrious. The period for which this site has almost come to be synonymous
with is the Oligocene, roughly 30 million years ago, near the time when the
first monkeys began to appear. Recently, Simons and his colleagues have found a
new locality at the Fayum which dates from an earlier period, the Eocene,
extending back the time depth of fossil monkeys to the time of their
origination. They have just begun to investigate this deposit, known as Locality
41. Already, the finds have demonstrated the following: 1. a surprisingly high
number of different monkeys (anthropoids) and a `bushiness` of early monkey
evolution - lots of experimentation. 2. broad adaptive diversity of early
monkeys. 3. the structurally primitive qualityof these animals. This new award
for three years will undoubtedly lead to a whole host of new fossil primate and
other vertebrate finds. All the Eocene primates collected thusfar at L-41
represent new taa and many are more complete than those found elsewhere. This is
a very exciting excavation with extremely good prospects for new discoveries.
