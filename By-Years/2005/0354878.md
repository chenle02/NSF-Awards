The proposed research seeks to answer fundamental questions about the structure
of the nucleon and of the nuclear few-body systems. Experiments are carried out
at electron accelerators of intermediate energies. Developments in the last two
decades in terms of producing polarized, continuous electron beams and the
advent of polarized internal gas targets have introduced a new technique of
measurements that fully exploit the spin degrees of freedom. This new technique
opens the window to perform definite measurements of fundamental quantities like
the charge distribution of the neutron. Precise knowledge of the structure of
the neutron at intermediate energies is essential to constrain models of nucleon
structure based on the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, quantum
chromodynamics. It is also a key ingredient in understanding the nuclear physics
of the few-body systems as well as the results derived from other fundamental
electron scattering experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities
will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will train young scientists at
the postdoctoral level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to
undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state
university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of
women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore,
the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the University's technical
workforce and that of the society at large.&lt;br/&gt;
