New firm creation is a vital element of technological innovation, job creation,
and economic growth. While research has shown that new firms have grown to
dominate industries like biotechnology, computers, communications, and many
others, relatively little is known about how these firms are financed in their
earliest stages. The optimal source of financing is likely to vary depending
upon the industry, the firm's stage of development, and the time period
observed. The purpose of this project is to collect data from 1553 firms that
issued equity in an initial public offering (IPO) between January 1, 1978 and
December 31, 1987. Registration documents filed with the SEC contain information
on the sources of financing, pre-IPO performance, and pre-IPO investment
patterns for companies that are planning to go public in the near future.
Creating a database with this information would be indispensable for future
research on factors affecting new firm financing and growth. The collection of a
large database on the financing history and pre-public operating performance of
private firms will create numerous research opportunities. Some of these topics
include: How do industry and firm specific characteristics interact to determine
the optimal source of capital? How does firm performance affect who gives firms
their financing to grow? How do the sources of financing affect the speed at
which the firm can grow? Have there been secular changes in the sources of
financing over the time period? Does the presence of a professional investor,
such as a venture capitalist, improve the pre-public performance of a company
compared to a firm that has not received venture capital financing? These are
only a few of the questions that the data can address.
