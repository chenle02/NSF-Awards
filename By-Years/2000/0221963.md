The University of Missouri-Columbia, the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA), the University of Illinois, and the Missouri Botanical
Garden are collaborating on this pilot project to build a prototype core
integration system for a national digital library for SMET Education. The
technical infrastructure for the system builds on the NCSA distributed
information retrieval system, EMERGE. This system is being extended to an
adaptive and flexible distributed search engine for a wide variety of learning
environments and resources, and is being tested on the rich plant contents of
the Missouri Botanical Garden, and the NSF Plant Genome projects at the
University of Illinois (Soybean) and the University of Missouri-Columbia (Corn).
Seamless coordination with services is being offered on several learning
environments, including NCSA's Biology Workbench 3.2. A digital repository, BLOE
(Biological Learning Object Exchange), serves to collect and organize
experiments, simulations, and projects from learners and teachers for
collaborative learning. Additional project activities include studies of
requirements of user services, management procedures, evaluation methods, and
technical standards using various undergraduate and graduate programs of the two
universities and the K-12 educational activities of the Missouri Botanical
Garden.
