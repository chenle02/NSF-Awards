The proposal has three parts. The first examines real exchange rate behavior in
sticky-price DSGE open-economy models. In particular, the research proposes to
uncover the general attributes of models in which exchange rates react strongly
to news about future fundamentals. In these models, the real exchange rate can
be solved as a present value of current and expected future disturbances, real
and monetary. In some standard models, however, when policy stabilizes
inflation, the weight on future expected fundamentals is low. Models in which
the real exchange rate is not the sole determinant of relative inflation rates
across countries appear to allow scope for expected future fundamentals to
influence exchange rates in a way that is consistent with empirical findings.
The second part of the research will analyze optimal monetary policy when the
exchange rate is forward looking. In particular, it will ask whether standard
inflation-targeting prescriptions are optimal, or nearly so, in an environment
in which real exchange rates react strongly to news. The third part of the
proposal is to examine tariffs and trade policy under sticky nominal prices. It
will address the positive effects of tariffs under different assumptions of how
nominal prices are set. The proposed research will address the sense in which
exchange-rate policy is analogous to protectionist trade policies. It will also
examine optimal tariff policy under sticky prices.&lt;br/&gt;The three major
areas of proposed work all involve applied general equilibrium modeling of open
economies and are motivated by empirical work. Any work such as this will
ultimately have broader impact in terms of promoting better understanding of the
workings of the macroeconomy, and hence better policy making. The second and
third parts of the proposal are directly related to policy questions, examining
monetary policy and trade policy in economies with sticky nominal prices.
