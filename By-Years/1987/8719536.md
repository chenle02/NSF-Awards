The emission of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) from natural sources has been
known for over two decades. The major source is thought to be vegetation. Other
significant natural sources are marine algae, microbial activity in soils,
natural gas seeps, the biomass burning. Natural hydrocarbon emissions from
plants play an important role in the generation of photochemical oxidants in the
troposphere, but there are a number of uncertainties in regional and global
inventories of these biogenic compounds. Much of the uncertainty arises because
there is a lack of precise data relating hydrocarbon emissions to key
environmental variables that regulate such emissions from vegetation. In
addition, there is uncertainty about the chemical identification of a large
fraction of biogenic hydrocarbons, and very little is known of the physiology or
biochemistry of plant hydrocarbon production. This project will conduct
laboratory studies to a) measure accurately the environmental variables
controlling the biogenesis of isoprene and related NMHC in plants, b) provide
new, chemical identification of emitted NMHC, and c) explore the role of micro
organisms on leaf surfaces as sinks or sources of NMHC. NMHC emissions form
plants in environmentally controlled gas exchange chambers will be characterized
by gas chromatography measurements, with identification of hydrocarbons by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry. By using plants representing major plant
groups and ecosystems, NMHC emissions will be related to air temperature, light
intensity, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration, and algorithms relating
emissions to these parameters will be developed. A model will be developed to
explain how and why plants emit isoprene and related NMHC, and to suggest the
environmental regulation of such emissions.
