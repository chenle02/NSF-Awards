Support is requested for a campus-wide computing facility which will be used to
provide access to sequence analysis programs and sequence databases. This
facility will support more than 20 funded, on-going, basic science research
projects in the Colleges of Science, Medicine and Agriculture. A large variety
of these projects require storage of sequences on the computer, analysis of
sequences by sequence alignment and pattern finding methods, retrieval of
sequences from databases, and prediction of secondary structure of proteins or
RNA from their sequence. Although simple types of sequences analysis are
routinely performed on laboratory microcomputers, laboratories at the University
of Arizona do not have ready access to more complex types of programs or
sequences databases. The most feasible solution to this problem is to provide a
shared computing facility equipped with a set of software packages such as the
Wisconsin DNA sequence analysis programs, which will provide most of the
required programs and databases. The proposed facility will provide computer
access by direct cable or a telephone modem, and will be net worked to an
existing computing system.
