This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Evolution of genome processing in
Ciliates, eukaryotic microorganisms with dimorphic nuclei." Ciliates are
eukaryotic microorganisms that possess two types of nuclei, a germline
micronucleus and a somatic macronucleus. Development of the macronucleus
involves processing of the genome, including chromosome fragmentation, sequence
excision, and amplification. This study examines diverse lineages of ciliates,
which vary in extent of processing, in order to elucidate the evolution of
genome processing.
