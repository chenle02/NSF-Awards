The goals are to develop methods for testing hypotheses depending on infinitely
many parameters, and to study tests of fit for time series data. This part of
the research is linked to the first part in that model selection methods play a
crucial role in the lack-of-fit tests investigated.

Mathematical and statistical models are an essential part of the process of
scientific discovery. Such models are intellectual constructs that help
scientists describe the essence of what they study, from people and animals to
physical and mechanical systems process of scientific discovery. Such models are
intellectual constructs that help scientists describe the essence of what they
study, from people and animals to physical and mechanical systems. Some models
are better than others, and the proof is in the pudding. Upon collecting data,
scientists can apply different models to see which ones "fit" their data best.
As data become more and more plentiful, models of increasing complexity become
more feasible. New and more sophisticated statistical methodology is required to
analyze such complex models. This study addresses two important issues in the
analysis of statistical models: the selection of a "good" model from a large
collection of models and testing the suitability of a single model having
special scientific significance. An important area of application for this work
is EGCH, and in particular global warming. The methodology developed in this
study can be used to decide, for various statistical models, if the recent
increase in global temperatures is better explained as a chance occurrence or a
fundamental change in climate.
