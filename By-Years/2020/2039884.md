This project will contribute data and an analytical synthesis to the Arctic
Councilâ€™s (AC) Pan-Arctic Report on Gender and Diversity in the Arctic.
Advancing gender equality through empowerment is a key component of sustainable
global development. Empowerment is the capacity of individuals and groups to
exercise control over their social, economic, and political circumstances.
Empowerment enables people to achieve objectives and maximize the quality of
their lives and those of their families and communities. This project will
collect, analyze, and synthesize data on the current state and emerging trends
in gender equality and empowerment across the Arctic. The full Arctic Council
report will include policy-relevant conclusions and be broadly disseminated
among Arctic stakeholders, policy makers, and the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ an inclusive,
collaborative approach to collect and analyze datasets, documents, and case
studies to understand to what extent political, economic, and civic empowerment
is distributed by gender. Activities include the integration of data from
diverse sources, including existing demographic, income, and employment
statistics, legal and government documents, and Indigenous scholars and
stakeholders. Broader impacts of the work include recommendations for the
promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, raising public
awareness of gender issues in the Arctic, and the development of a publicly
available data compendium on gender empowerment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
