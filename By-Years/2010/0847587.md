Margetis&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0847587&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator focuses on
research and education goals at&lt;br/&gt;the crossroads of mathematics with
materials science and physics. &lt;br/&gt;This research links macroscopic
principles for crystal&lt;br/&gt;interfacial phenomena to microscale processes.
The physical&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms are described by discrete "particle" schemes
for&lt;br/&gt;atomic line defects. However, mesoscopic and
macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;consequences are best understood via continuous models.
Linkages&lt;br/&gt;between models are sought by kinetic theory, partial
differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, and stochastic analysis. The education part
includes&lt;br/&gt;the training of a graduate student, development of
innovative&lt;br/&gt;courses in applied mathematics, activities for
mathematics&lt;br/&gt;awareness and outreach, authorship of a book on
integral&lt;br/&gt;equations, and organization of working group seminars.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project addresses fundamental issues in
nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;and materials modeling. The investigator uses tools of
applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics to study systematically how nano-structures decay
on&lt;br/&gt;surfaces of technologically important materials. This work
is&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the pressing need to design increasingly smaller
and&lt;br/&gt;faster, yet more reliable, devices. The proposed work
advances&lt;br/&gt;the ability to model and predict by theoretical methods
the&lt;br/&gt;reliability of devices for the next generation of applications
in&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics and information technology. The
project&lt;br/&gt;integrates research and education: Interdisciplinary concepts
of&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics are shaped into instruction tools that
reach&lt;br/&gt;out to students and science experts in diverse areas. This
Career&lt;br/&gt;award is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;and by the MPS Division of Materials Research. &lt;br/&gt;
