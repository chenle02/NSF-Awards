With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at the College of William and Mary will acquire an X-ray diffractometer with
dual single crystal and powder diffraction capabilities. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including studies on a) the study of
transition metal network catalysts formed from bridging ligands; b)
toxicologically relevant complexes of Hg, Cd, and Pb; c) hypervalent iodine and
bismuth compounds for use in synthetic organic chemistry; d) magnetism of
insulating systems; e) metallized and metal-oxide-containing polyimide
nanocomposite materials; f) synthesis of polymer-clay nanocomposites; and g)
preparation of metal oxide materials and clays as polymer fire retardant/smoke
suppressants. Faculty members at fifteen primarily undergraduate partner
institutions will also carry out research using this instrumentation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These
studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially synthesis of
important inorganic chemicals and environmental chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
