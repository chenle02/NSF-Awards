Abstract Proposal: DMS 9803403 Principal Investigator: Paul Bressler The purpose
of the project is apply homological and sheaf theoretic techniques as well as
methods of deformation theory to symplectic geometry and index theory. More
specifically, the project will address index theory in presence of singularities
(boundary, corners), in the equivariant setting, ``secondary'' (as in secondary
characteristic classes) phenomena, calculation of the asymptotic density of Bohr
--Sommerfeld orbits, symplectic reduction of quantized Hamiltonian actions and
other applications of deformation quantization to microlocal analysis and
symplectic geometry. Many important quantities which arise in mathematics and
physics can be naturally interpreted as numbers of (independent) solutions of
systems of partial differential equations. The object of the project is to find
new formulas for such quantities as well as investigate various relationships
among them. Differential equations are mathematical models of physical phenomena
which is why it is important to be able to ``count'' their solutions.
