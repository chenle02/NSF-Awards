Historically the understanding of biological processes has progressed from
observation of phenomena at the cellular level to structure determination of
biopolymers (i.e. DNA/RNA, proteins and polysaccharides) to elucidation of
specific interactions and reactions that govern life processes. As these
processes are understood at the molecular and sub-molecular (i.e., functional
group) levels, the dependence upon interactions of organic molecules and groups
becomes evident. Consequently, information obtained through study of organic
reactions and non-covalent interactions among small organic molecules has become
directly applicable to the understanding of biological processes. To facilitate
students' understanding of how chemical events dictate live processes, three-
dimensional interactive animations of reaction pathways for multiple enzymatic
processes are being developed based upon enzyme crystal structure and semi-
empirical calculations. The software allows students to visualize the chemical
events that play a role in these enzyme systems. The goal of this Proof-of-
Concept project is to correlate the chemical events in biological processes with
those learned in organic chemistry courses.&lt;br/&gt;
