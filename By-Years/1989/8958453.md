The nature of the ground state of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES)
subjected to an intense magnetic field has attracted a great deal of research,
both experimental and theoretical. As a result of a systematic effort to
optimize the design and the growth process they have developed GaAs/GaAlAs
heterostructures containing very high-mobility, low-density 2DES with extremely
low disorder. The realization of high-quality 2DES with low electron
concentration is of particular interest because they provide the means to
achieve and study fundamental properties of 2DES in a new regime of extreme
magnetic quantum limit in available magnetic fields. Magnetotransport, activated
transport and nonlinear transport measurements will be used to investigate
collective states of 2DES - the Fractional Quantum Hall states and quantum
Wigner crystal - and the magnetic-field- induced localization in 2DES.
Radiofrequency magnetospectroscopy will be used to study collective excitations
in these states. Electron beam microlitography will be used to fabricate
nanostructures from the same state-of-the-art materials. The above described
experimental techniques will be employed to study collective states of 2DES in
restricted geometry (down to 200A).
