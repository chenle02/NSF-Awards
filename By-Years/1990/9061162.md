Numerical Grid-generation Algorithms are becoming more critical due to the need
for detailed modeling of the geometry of the physical domain and as part of
solution-adaptive algorithms. Current planar grid generation algorithms are not
robust because they frequently produce skewed or folded grids. These problems
can be corrected by trial and error modifications (e.g., to the source term of a
Poisson equation), but the procedure is far from automatic. Mathematical
analysis will be used to clarify the limitations of current algorithms and to
suggest new algorithms. The best algorithms will be incorporated into user-
friendly automatic grid-generation codes which will have: a common interface;
namelist input; interactive graphics; a library of geometries; and test
problems. The codes will be designed to run on parallel and vector computers.
