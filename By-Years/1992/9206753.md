This award provides partial travel support to 10 U.S. academic researchers to
the International Freight Pipeline Symposium scheduled for July 6-8 in
Wollongong, Australia. Support is limited to those authors presenting a paper at
the meeting. This Symposium is organized each three years, last time being held
in U.S. in 1989. Topics to be covered include capsule transport by pipelines,
liquid-solid and gas-solid mixture flow, materials, turbomachinery,
instrumentation, and various freight pipeline technologies. Bulk and capsule
transportation systems are presently used for various solids such as coal,
limestone, copper concentrates, etc. and the technologies are rapidly improving.
The previous symposia were proven to be valuable forums for advancing new
concepts and technologies in a interdisciplinary environment.//
