Active Learning Strategies for Algebra-based Introductory Physics at
UCF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Physics at the University of Central
Florida proposes to implement a two-pronged activity-based curriculum in its
introductory algebra-based physics courses, and contrast these two interactive
pedagogies with more traditional physics lecture and lab learning. The first,
already initiated, is known as full-studio (FS), and is based on the Beichner's
notably successful SCALE-UP approach, a marked shift from the traditional
physics lecture and laboratory setting to a single collaborative physics
workspace rich with technological and experimental tools, and shown to be
particularly effective in achieving student learning gains in conceptual physics
without sacrificing problem-solving skills. The second, more novel and less
abrupt transition from traditional lecture/lab format, goes by the name
"ministudios with lectures" (MSL)---self-contained physics content modules which
emphasize problem-solving, collaborative group work, experimental physics, and
conceptual learning, and will be coordinated with technologically enhanced
lectures. MSL will be compared to both the FS and traditional approaches with
regard to student learning gains, ease of faculty adoption, cost, and
distinctiveness from the calculus-based physics sequence, which has seen
considerably more study than the algebra-based sequence.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF is one of the largest universities in the country,
with a diverse student body numbering well over 50,000, and teaching more
physics credit hours than most any other US physics department, thus providing
an excellent testing ground for these proposed improvements. Additional features
of the pedagogical model include Peer Instruction with "clicker" questions,
Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, and additional instructional support from
Graduate Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants, who receive
regular training in active learning techniques.
