The University of California, San Francisco Science Institute for Elementary
Teachers (UCSF City Science Project) is an integral component of the San
Francisco Unified School District's comprehensive plan for K-5 Science Program
Improvement. The Project will be responsible for the inservice education of 100
teachers over four years. Through three years of month long education sessions,
where the content of elementary science will be presented through sessions
modeling excellent hands-on science teaching, these teachers will become the
UCSF Science Partners. Working in conjunction with an experienced leader in
their school, these newly trained teachers will be responsible for making
significant changes in their school's science program. The 100 UCSF Science
Partners will exhibit leadership by supporting their fellow classroom teachers
as they initiate the city's new hands-on curriculum. In partnership with K-5
Science Support Teachers and the City's Science Specialists, the UCSF Science
Partners will be released to provide presentations, demonstrations and/or team-
teaching with colleagues during the Site-Institute at their own school. In
addition, the 100 UCSF Science Partners will be teamed by grade levels to
provide workshops on specific grade level Model Science Units to teachers
throughout the system. The cost sharing for the project will be 47%.
