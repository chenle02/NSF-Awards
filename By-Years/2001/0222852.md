This is a collaborative project involving University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign and Boston University. The project will build, deploy, test and
package a middleware-oriented distributed account management system. The system
supports the information exchange between grid-enabled systems that are
necessary to implement distributed account management, resource allocation,
usage accounting, and monitoring functions in a heterogeneous grid environment.
The system will be coupled to the a grid transactions system to form a
completely operational, grid-enabled reference implementation.

The ability to manage user accounts, provide access control over its resources,
manage allocations and generate usage reports in a distributed fashion is
critical to the expansion of the grid. The proposed system can be used to build
a highly automated, scalable account management system that will work across
disparate computing systems. The software will be packaged as an open-source
distribution for further development and adaptation by the grid community.
