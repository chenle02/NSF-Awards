Conventional electron microscopes operate under high vacuum, so it is not
possible to examine biological materials, or delicate inorganic materials (such
as gels), without drying them and thereby altering their structure. In contrast,
an ESEM permits high resolution imaging of materials under moist conditions, and
over a wide range of temperature. Researchers from 7 academic departments at
Princeton plan studies including: (1) growth of salt crystals in porous
materials (relevant to deterioration of building materials), (2) corrosion of
cement exposed to carbonic acid (pertinent to geosequestration of CO2); (3)
effects of oxide inclusions on the struc-ture of membranes used in fuel cells;
(4) interaction of bacteria with minerals under conditions simulating the
surface of Mars; (5) growth of fatigue cracks and (6) DNA sharing at neuron syn-
apses. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In addition to research, the instrument will be
used in undergraduate courses and in a wide variety of K-12 outreach projects.
These include Research Experience for Teachers (for local public school
teachers), the Princeton University Materials Academy (for under-represented
high school students from Trenton and surrounding districts), and Materials
Science Days (where un-der-represented students spend the day in hands-on
activities in our labs). &lt;br/&gt;
