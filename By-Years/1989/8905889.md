This award partially supports acquisition of a video imaging system capable of
recording 1,000 frames per second and an Argon-ion laser. The instrument will be
used in studying unsteady gas-liquid flows and particle-particle interactions in
concentrated slurry flows. It also will be used to study particle deposition on
and removal from surfaces. The research should lead to better understanding of
multiphase flows.
