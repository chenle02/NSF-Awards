This project is designed to contribute significantly to providing interesting
laboratory and research opportunities for undergraduate students in the area of
solid state physics and to providing students with the opportunity to share in
the excitement of the recent developments in high temperature superconductivity.
The major acquisition will be a closed cycle helium gas cryosystem capable of
controlling temperature within the 10K - 330K range. Used in conjunction with a
current source and nanovoltmeter, this system will provide for solid state
laboratory experiments and undergraduate research in the fields of
superconductivity and transport properties such as resistivity and Hall effect.
The university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
