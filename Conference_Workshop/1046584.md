Representation theory covers fast range of research in mathematics, and has
close relationships with geometry, number theory, topology, combinatorics as
well as mathematical physics. In order to survey current research and bring in
new blood into the field, the International Conference series on Representation
Theory was initiated in 1998 in Shanghai by a group of mathematicians from China
and the US, since then American mathematicians have actively participated in
each of the ICRT.

This award provides partial support for American mathematicians to attend the
5th International Conference of Representation Theory (ICRT) during August 9--
14, 2010, in Xian, China where specialists from Asia, Europe and United States
will gather chart future research directions. Xian, China has been the cross
point of cultural exchanges for more than 2000 years. The current award
contributes to new scientific exchanges between mathematicians from three
continents and also promotes deeper mathematical research in representation
theory. The conference offers a great opportunity for young researchers to
follow the current stage of active research in representation theory.
