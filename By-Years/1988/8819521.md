Description: This project supports cooperative research by Dr. S. Sengupta of
the University of Miami and Dr. A.K. Mohanty of the Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur, India. These scientists plan to investigate,
experimentally and numerically, the heat transfer in the entrance region of
shells containing finite number of rods. The study will include the effects of
the type of array, the relative distances (distance divided by diameter) between
rods and the channel walls, the Reynolds number and the Grashoff number.
Included will be laminar and turbulent regimes in finite rods bundles bound by
square as well as circular shells. Comparison of experimental and numerical
results will be made to evaluate the adequacy of existing one-equation and two-
equation closures in predicting the developing flow. Scope: The experimental
work on the geometrical types will be carried out at Kharagpur. The analytical
work on the square bundle will also be carried at Kharagpur, while the
analytical work on the circular geometry will be carried at Miami. Thus both
scientists will contribute to the study and their efforts will complement each
other. Both institutes have the facilities to do the required work and will be
building on existing experience.
