Abstract

The proposed activity will facilitate the participation of graduate students and
young researchers in the 9th ASCE Specialty Conference on Probabilistic Methods
(PMC04). The Conference will be held in Albuquerque New Mexico on July 26-28
2004. In particular travel expenses, accommodations and conference registration
fees for ten students will be covered by this activity.

Intellectual Merits

Probabilistic mechanics is increasingly becoming more significant in the
analysis of complex systems exhibiting multiscale and multiphysics behavior. The
PMC04 Conference provides a unique forum for the nurturing and development of
these ideas in the context of engineering mechanics. Sessions are being
organized both in traditional areas of engineering such as wind, earthquake and
offshore engineering as well as in more cutting edge areas such as
nanomechanics, optimization under uncertainty, and risk management of complex
systems. It is expected that about 250 participants will take present their work
at this meeting.

Broader Impact

Special attention will be given to the inclusion of minorities and women in the
group of participants supported by this grant. The broader impact of the
proposed activity consists of providing young researchers with the opportunity
to participate in the premier international conference on probabilistic methods.
This will expose these researchers to the diversity of current thinking and
approaches for this increasingly important branch of science and engineering.
