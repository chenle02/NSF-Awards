This dissertation enhancement grant provides partial support for a U.S.
graduate student, Stephen A. McCord, working under the guidance of Dr. Geoffrey
Schladow, of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the
University of California-Davis, to perform field studies and develop computer
simulations for controlled degassing of Lake Nyos in Cameroon. Mr. McCord will
visit Lake Nyos to collect samples and record data on internal wave activity and
fine scale temperature and conductivity structures, which will then be used to
model the dynamics of Lake Nyos. It is intended to model the use of in situ lake
remediation techniques to safely lower the gas concentrations, which have been
increasing since the last outgassing in 1986, and to predict the resulting water
quality changes due to artificial mixing. Further, the proposed model may be
used in a wide variety of lakes and reservoirs to address water quality and
management issues. Staff members of the Automation and Control Laboratory at the
University of Yaounde will collaborate with Mr. McCord on this project. This
study will make an important contribution to the understanding of the science of
lake hydrodynamics, especially the chemical and physical factors affecting lake
stability. The grant will also provide support to enable a promising student to
establish a strong independent research career.
