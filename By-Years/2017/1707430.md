This project will develop the theory and explore practical applications of a new
algorithm for simulation of plasma -- a state of matter with freely interacting
electrons and ions not bound together in atoms. This new algorithm has the
potential to enable simulation of larger and more complicated plasma systems,
leading to a better fundamental understanding of plasma physics, improved
predictive capabilities for space weather, better modeling of fusion devices and
plasma-based rocket thrusters, and more efficient manipulation of plasma for
semiconductor fabrication and other industrial
purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new algorithm, the speed-limited particle-in-
cell (SLPIC) method, is an extreme variant of the immensely useful particle-in-
cell (PIC) technique. SLPIC facilitates multiscale simulation by avoiding the
need to resolve unimportant small-scale phenomena -- phenomena that must
otherwise often be resolved, even when physically negligible, to avoid numerical
instabilities. To accomplish this, SLPIC limits the speed of fast particles
(e.g., electrons), while keeping track of what their actual speed should be. The
speed-limited motion is a consequence of an approximate Vlasov equation; it
accurately simulates particle distribution functions as long as they change
sufficiently slowly. This project will develop the theory and use of SLPIC,
examining its advantages and disadvantages with respect to standard PIC
simulation, and apply it to test problems, including plasma sheaths, the solar
wind, and Hall rocket thrusters. In addition, this project will explore the
possibility that SLPIC techniques might help mitigate the finite grid
instability well-known in standard PIC methods.
