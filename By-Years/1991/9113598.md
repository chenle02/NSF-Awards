This award will establish a Research Training Group in Linking Levels of
Ecological Organization at the Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan State
University. The faculty group has 11 members drawn from 5 departments. The funds
awarded will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees,
will support research participation by undergraduate students, and will defray
part of the cost of the trainees' research. In addition, funds will be used to
purchase specialized research equipment to be used by the trainees, for trainee
travel to other institutions for specialized training not available at Michigan
State, and to bring investigators from other research and academic institutions
to the Kellogg Station for seminars and workshops. University and other
resources will augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these categories,
and will help extend the program to include the participation of high school
students. The need to train scientists who can synthesize across levels of
ecological organization is significant and growing. If anything, the pressing
issues of global change and of maintenance of biological diversity appear to
make such training increasingly urgent. This program will provide just such
training, taking advantage of the techniques and concepts of researchers who
address a variety of evolutionary and ecological problems at the level of genes,
individual organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems or entire landscapes.
