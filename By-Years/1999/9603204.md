This award supplements a grant supported by an NSF/EPA Award on Water and
Watersheds. The research, performed in collaboration with Winfried Lampert of
the Max- Planck-Institut for Limnology, seeks to learn how individual
zooplankton species respond to the major changes in their algal resources that
occur during cultural eutrophication.. The feeding and fitness responses of
animals from before and after periods of eutrophication will be studied.
Phenotypic and genetic variation in zooplankton populations will be documented
using animals hatched from long-lived diapausing eggs collected from lake
sediments of different ages. The research will lead to substantially enhanced
understanding of how natural populations and communities of freshwater
herbivores respond to anthropogenic environmental change.
