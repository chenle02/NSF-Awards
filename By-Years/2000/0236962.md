With this award, the Special Projects Program of the Division of Chemistry is
supporting Dr. Thomas J. Wenzel of the Department of Chemistry at Bates College,
who will organize and conduct a workshop entitled the "Undergraduate Research
Summit". The workshop will examine issues involved in undertaking and sustaining
chemistry research at predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs). The
summit will be developed by a 12 person steering committee working in close
collaboration with the Chemistry Division of the Council on Undergraduate
Research. The workshop will be attended by a diverse range of stakeholders
including people from a variety of types of PUIs, government agencies and
laboratories, and professional organizations. The Chemistry Division of CUR will
lead in disseminating the report and working to implement its recommendations.
