ABSTRACT York, Donald AST-9405243 This project will produce a detailed digital
photometric map of half the northern sky to about 23rd magnitude. This map will
be used to select about a million galaxies and 100,000 quasars for which high-
resolution spectra will be obtained with the same wide- field special-purpose
telescope. The imaging survey will also be used to produce a catalog in five
colors of all the detected objects, about 108 galaxies and a similar number of
stars, and a million quasar candidates. The survey will then be completed over a
five- year period after an initial test year. The imaging data will be assembled
into a high-resolution atlas and a lower resolution map of the whole area and
those two data sets and the spectra will be published in digital form and made
available in a timely fashion to the whole community. The scientific value of
such a set of data is vast, and applications range from critical investigations
of large- scale structure in three dimensions to the relationships of galaxies
with their environment to the faint-end luminosity function of disk dwarf stars.
