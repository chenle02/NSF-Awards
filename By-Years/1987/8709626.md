The intersection of the legal system and the child welfare system is a ripe
area for scientific inquiry. To date, however, studies of the juvenile court
have largely focused on delinquency issues, and child welfare studies of
substitute care (for abuse, neglect, or dependency) have primarily focused on
the children and on the foster or primary families. Ms. Harnett, under the
supervision of Dr. Schuerman, seeks to combine these two traditions in her
doctoral dissertation research. Her study examines court delay by comparing the
frequency of hearing continuances and the reasons underlying continuances in two
juvenile courts, Cook County (Chicago) and St. Clair County (East St. Louis).
Both of these courts review similar cases but have significantly different
placement durations for children in substitute care. It is hypothesized that
competing court policies and the broader use of discretion account for more
continuances and greater delay. The use of three data sources enables rigorous
analyses and complex controls: juvenile court case records, an independent data
base on child and familial characteristics (of the same cases), and systematic
observation of actual hearings. This research shows considerable promise of
illuminating the interaction between legal processes and social service
practices. Also, it should add to our knowledge of juvenile courts on issues
other than delinquency that are important. Finally, it should contribute to our
understanding of delay and the dynamics of court process in a context outside of
the criminal courts.
