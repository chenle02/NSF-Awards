ABSTRACTS This project is designed to answer important questions that have
arisen in research on minority influence. "What constitutes a minority?" "Is
minority influence merely a special case of more general social influence
processes?" are two such issues. Three series of studies are presented: Series I
focuses on the meaning of minority, the influence of task
subjectivity/objectivity, and the need for closure; Series 2 with the
controversy surrounding minority influence effects on perceptual judgments;
Series 3 with an extension of the initial results into the realm of persuasion,
with special emphasis on source, message, and sleeper effects and the impact of
cognitive load on influenceability. The research makes use of findings which
suggest that people are differentially susceptible to in-group or out-group
influence as a consequence of the objectivity/subjectivity of judgments. The
project has the potential to clarify important issues in minority/majority
influence, and to integrate past findings by highlighting the relevance of
cognate theories (social comparison, social identification), whose utilization
will create a more comprehensive and general model of social influence.
