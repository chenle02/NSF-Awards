9402764 Holzworth The objectives of this proposal are threefold: (1) to
determine ionospheric convection patterns in polar cap, auroral zone and
midlatitudes from stratospheric balloon-borne electrodynamic measurements; (2)
to determine long and short term variability of global circuit; and (3) to
evaluate the importance of stratospheric and tropospheric electric field sources
to inferred ionospheric convection. The research will address problems at the
foot-of-the-field lines for ISTP/GGS satellites. The balloon program's overall
goal is to better understand the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere. It
will play an essential role in providing new data to the problem where neither
satellites nor radars can provide the high time resolution, long duration and
multiple simultaneous data points now available with the PIs data set. ***
