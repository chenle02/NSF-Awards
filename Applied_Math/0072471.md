Dr. Yip plans to investigate the motion of interfaces in solid materials from a
mathematical point of view. He will concentrate on two topics. The first one
concerns the modeling of epitaxial thin film growths. These films can have
important semi- or super-conducting properties. The goal of this work is to
accurately describe the thin film evolutions at large length scales. The
investigator plans to capture the surface diffusion and nucleation phenomena on
the film surface at the continuum level. Both of these mechanisms can have
profound effects on the film growth and the resultant film properties. The
starting point of the research is the Burton-Cabrera-Frank model for the
behavior of atomic layers and its generalizations. The mathematical content of
this work involves nonlinear partial differential equations and numerical
simulations. The second topic is to investigate the effects of noise on motion
by mean curvature in the case of non-uniqueness. Such type of motion is a
simplified model for surface evolutions in solidification processes. It is well
known that the equations can possess more than one solution. The question arises
which is the physically relevant one. This non-uniqueness is a major obstacle to
a better mathematical understanding of the interface motion. In particular, if
the solutions are not unique, it is not clear which limiting solution will be
picked by approximation schemes. Dr. Yip plans to investigate the selection
effects brought out by the presence of noise, that is small random
perturbations. Such an approach has potential applications in many other types
of nonlinear evolution problems.

The mathematical modeling of materials growth phenomena has long been an active
research area. New materials are being continuously searched for and
manufactured. A correct mathematical model can predict and control in positive
ways the outcome of the production processes. This research has two goals. The
first is to bridge in an accurate manner the microscopic and macroscopic
descriptions in epitaxial thin film growths. These films have great applications
in electronic materials. The second is to investigate the effects of "noise"
(that is, random perturbative effects) in the modeling of the motion in
interfaces in materials, such as the interface between different components in
alloys. Even though such noise is known to be present in materials growths, its
consequences still have not been understood completely. Both topics will involve
mathematical analysis and physical intuition.
