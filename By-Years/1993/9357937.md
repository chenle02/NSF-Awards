9357937 GREEN This award provides support to Dr. Donald Green under the National
Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program. The objective of this
program is to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to
enhance the academic career of recent PhD recipients by providing flexible
support for research and educational activities, and to foster contact and
cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that support research
and education. Dr. Green has already made significant research contributions to
the field of political science, and he has the potential to become a leader in
academic research and education. This award will allow the investigator to
pursue his research interests in the social psychology of intergroup conflict.
Specifically, he proposes to develop a statistical model of the incidence of
overt manifestations of intolerance, or "bias crime." He will examine the over-
time dynamics of bias incidents as well as the cross-sectional relationship
between incidents and economic performance, demographic composition, intra-and
interracial crime rates, and survey measures of attitudinal intolerance. This
research has important theoretical and policy implications. Dr. Green also plans
to continue his work on campaign finance, party affiliation, the consequences of
measurement error in survey data, and the role of tangible self-interest in
democratic politics. This work uses survey and experimental data to formulate a
theory about the conditions under which self-interest manifests itself in
political attitudes and behavior. ***
