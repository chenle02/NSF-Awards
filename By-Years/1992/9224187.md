The "new institutionalism" is one of the most promising theoretical
developments in social science. It ranges across disciplines such as political
science, economics, legal theory, and sociology. The early years of political
science (from 1900 through the 1940s) were marked by an almost exclusive study
of formal institutions such as legislatures, executives, the bureaucracy, and
international organizations. The study of politics was highly legalistic. From
the 1950s through the 1970s political science shifted gears toward the study of
individual behavior. A useful corrective came since the late 1970s when, prodded
by economics, political science returned to the study of institutions. This "new
institutionalism" went beyond legalisms to study how institutions arose and to
encompass not only formal structures, but also ideas, value systems, norms, and
culture. The "new institutionalism" is hardly of one piece. Some of its
adherents believe that formal structures matter most, others that informal
institutions such as ideas and values are equally important. Some
institutionalists use an economic approach, seeking to explain how people manage
to cooperate when there are many incentives for them not to do so. Others abjure
this way of thinking, focusing instead on how history shapes policy outcomes. In
this research conference the investigators bring advocates of these many
perspectives together. The objective is to determine the contours of the "new
institutionalism," to seek out areas of agreement, and to set out clearly what
disagreements remain. The investigators have broken down the conference into
five key areas of concern to political scientists and other social scientists:
international regimes; property rights; the state; constitutional design and
democracy; and, organizational theory. The researchers will also have papers and
panels presenting overviews of the field and research agendas for the future.
The conference organizers will publish the papers and remarks and disseminate
them widely.
