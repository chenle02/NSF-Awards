9552590 Schultz The Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD), in
partnership with the Autodesk Foundation, Hewlett Packard Corporation, Sonoma
State University and Santa Rosa Junior College, is implementing project-based
learning in elementary schools. Most of the student learning is to be done in
project-based activities. The design brief is used to engage students in
applying their learning to real world situations of interest to them. Portfolios
are used to assess student learning, evaluate teacher professional development
and to document the progress in the project. Teacher professional development
includes adapting existing materials to the deign brief format; implementing
thematic projects, based on design, in the classroom; assessing student
progress; and assisting other teachers in implementing project-based learning.
