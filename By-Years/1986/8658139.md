On-line problems are extremely common in computer science and operations
research. For these problems an algorithm must be devised to decide how to
respond to a request immediately when the request is made, without knowledge of
future requests. Some familiar examples of on-line problems are: Controlling an
elevator, controlling a disk drive, controlling caches, and data structures. An
extremely powerful technique in the design and analysis of algorithms for on-
line problems is that of amortization. In an amortized analysis, the cost of a
sequence of requests is considered rather than the cost of each request
individually. Algorithms efficient in the amortized sense balance the costs of
expensive requests by inexpensive ones. A variety of new amortized-efficient
algorithms and data structures have been devised. For many on-line problems
there are on-line algorithms with amortized performance that is almost as good
as the performance of any off-line algorithm on any sequence of requests. Such
an on-line algorithm is said to be competitive. The PI is applying known
techniques of amortization and competitiveness to a variety of other on-line
problems, and developing new techniques for doing amortized analysis. The PI has
been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist by the Presidential Young
Investigator panel.
