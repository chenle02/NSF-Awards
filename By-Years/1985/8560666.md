Research will focus on increasing utility of intracellular fluorescence
measurements for control of fermentation and cell culture by correcting on-line
for background fluorescene of the media. This will use the characteristics of
the evanescent wave at the surface of an optic wave guide. The wave penetrates
into the less dense medium only to about the depth of 1/3 to 1/2 wave length.
The thickness of media swept by the evanescent wave is much less than the size
of a cell, thereby essentially separating the fluorescence of the media from
that of the cells.
