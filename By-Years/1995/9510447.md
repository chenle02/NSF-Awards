9510447 Pastor Grizzly Bear Digging in Subalpine Meadows: Influences on Plant
Distributions and Nitrogen Availability Grizzly bears are omnivores who often
feed intensively on bulbs of plants such as glacier lilies. Foraging by bears
can overturn large tracts of subalpine meadows. Preliminary observations suggest
that this activity may increase nitrogen availability, seed production, bulb
nitrogen, and bulb carbohydrate content. As such, these large animals may play
major roles in the structure and function of subalpine plant communities. This
project will rigorously test this hypothesis in areas inside and adjacent to
Rocky Mountain National Park in Montana. This research will consider the role of
a large omnivorous animal on the ecosystems in which they reside.
