?FIRST AMERICAN ACADEMY OF MECHANICS CONFERENCE?&lt;br/&gt;New Orleans,
Louisiana&lt;br/&gt;June 17-20, 2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inaugural
Conference of the American Academy of Mechanics will be hosted in New Orleans,
Louisiana, on June 17-20, 2008. Following this conference this event will be
hosted in the USA every four years to coincide with the International Congress
of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. The proposed conference will provide a
broad forum in mechanics to characterize and assess the behavior of solids and
fluids. It will cover a wide spectrum of topics in mechanics in the areas of
solids, fluids, dynamics, biomechanics, control theory, thermal sciences, etc.
The participants in this conference will address characterization and modeling
of systems at the nano, micro and macro scale. They will also bridge those
scales in an effort to better interpret the behavior of solids and fluids.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will attract researchers from academia,
industry, federal and state agencies and students. It will help the participants
prepare to pursue multidisciplinary research and develop more systematical
strategies in dealing with the mechanics problems for years to come. The
conference will help the participants and the Mechanics community to identify
the current trends in research and the funding opportunities in those areas.
Federal funding agencies and industry will also help promote their research
directions for present and future. A book of abstracts will be circulated in the
meeting along with limited proceedings for some mini-symposia. The wide spectrum
of the mechanics areas outlined above will help in contributing immensely in the
improvement of the mechanics discipline in the engineering, scientific and
educational aspects. &lt;br/&gt;
