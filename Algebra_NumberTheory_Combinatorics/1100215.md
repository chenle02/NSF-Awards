The PI will continue his research in combinatorics and graph theory
concentrating on probabilistic and extremal questions. Random structures and
processes, while being an important object of study of their own, are also very
effective in solving problems of discrete mathematics including those whose
statement is purely deterministic. An important area of their successful
application is extremal combinatorics where, broadly speaking, one has to
maximize or minimize a certain parameter given some combinatorial restrictions.
One example of an extremal question is the Turan function, the maximum size of a
hypergraph without some fixed forbidden subgraph. This is a fundamental and key
question that asks how local restrictions can affect the global structure.
Despite decades of active attempts, most Turan-type questions remain wide open,
such as the famous tetrahedron conjecture made by Paul Turan back in 1941.
During attacks on these difficult problems mathematicians developed a number of
useful and general techniques such as, for example, the Regularity Lemma. The
more recent concepts of (hyper)graph limits and flag algebras seem to be very
powerful tools for studying finite structures and for providing new methods of
operating with large discrete objects. The PI will work on a number of
combinatorial questions, in particular seeking new ways of applying these
techniques. Some promising directions include the Turan function, the stability
property, inequalities between subgraph densities (for example, minimizing the
number of F-subgraphs in a graph of given order and size), hypergraph jumps,
quantitative Ramsey-type questions, and graph embedding problems. Since both
graph limits and flag algebras deal with an approximation to the studied
problem, one important aspect is to develop methods for obtaining exact results
from asymptotic calculations (for example, via the stability approach).

Extremal and probabilistic combinatorics impacts not only mathematics but many
other areas such as operations research, information theory, codes, complexity
and algorithms. Random graphs and processes have been providing successful
models for various complex systems (such as the Internet or social networks).
Such models can be used, for example, for estimating parameters that are
impossible or impractical to be determined directly and for predicting their
future behavior. Graph limits (and graph regularity) provide a method of
approximating large-scale objects by those of bounded complexity; this approach
has already been explored in the context of parameter and property testing in
computer science. The PI will research new ways of applying randomness,
regularity, and graph limits to combinatorial problems. Theoretical developments
in these areas may have significant practical implications.
