This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), jointly funded by the Theory
of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by Computational Biology Activity, BIR and by
the Systemic Biology Program, DEB, addresses problems in the construction of
phylogenies or evolutionary trees. The formulation and effective solution of
this problem requires a collaborative multidisciplinary effort from biologists,
statisticians and computer scientists. The ideal methodology for solving this
problem would include the following steps:(a) Observe data on the species that
exist today; (b) Identify a biological model (such as the Jukes-Cantor model or
Kimura two parameter model); (c) Based on the model from Step (b), design an
objective function and efficient optimization methods for this function so that
the tree that optimizes this objective function is the tree that best fits the
model. Unfortunately, this ideal program is impossible to realize, because of
roadblocks at every step: (i) Data is subject to experimental error and to
errors due to its interpretation and use in phylogeny construction methods;(ii)
It seems difficult to identify a precise biological model for evolution; (iii)
Given the stochastic model of evolution, one candidate for the optimizing tree
is the ``most likely tree''. Given the uncertainty of what is actually the
``best'' model, a most likely tree under one model should still be a very likely
tree under a slightly different model. Demonstrating this has proven to be a
very difficult problem. The goals of this SGER proposal include:(1) Modification
of the ideal methodology so that Difficulties(i) -- (iii) are removed; (2)
Testing of various models using r-RNA and tufA sequence data supplied by a
molecular biologist; (3) Using the experimental results, design of general
methods for inferring phylogeny;(4) Comparison of these new models with existing
models for the data. In addition, one of the goals of this SGER award is to
initiate a multidisciplinary effort between the biologists, statisticians, and
computer scientists at the University of Pennsylvania.***
