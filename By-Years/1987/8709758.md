The long term goal of this proposal is the elucidation of the structure and
mechanism of action of thiamin diphosphate- dependent pyruvate decarboxylating
enzymes; pyruvate decarboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The latter
enzyme is at a key junction in metabolism; a thorough understanding of its
structure and mechanism is of fundamental biochemical importance. The enzymes
will be purified in part by immunoaffinity chromatographic methods. The specific
objectives are to: 1. design and synthesize mechanism-based inhibitors identify
the sequence of the coenzyme and substrate binding sites and determine the
location (including surrounding sequence) of the key Cys SH's of the enzymes. 2.
determine the structure of the key enzyme-bound enamine using electronic
spectroscopy. Ascertain its reactivity vis-a-vis protonation, disulfides, and
flavin, in reactions mimicking all the important classes of thiamin diphosphate-
dependent alpha-keto acid decarboxylating enzymes.
