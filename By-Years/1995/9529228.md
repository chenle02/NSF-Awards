AST 95-29228 PI: David Roberts Milliarcsecond Polarization Measurements of
Compact Extragalactic Radio Sources Radio astronomy at centimeter wavelengths is
used to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the very small scales. This is
accomplished with Very Long Baseline Polarimetry, by which the linear
polarization structure of compact radio sources may be determined on angular
scales of milliarcseconds, corresponding to physical scales of light years at
the distances of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This high angular resolution
allows changes in the structure of jets to be followed on moderate time scales
(a year or less), and the polarimetry reveals the order and orientation of the
magnetic field and allows study of the thermal particle environment around the
heart of AGN. By observing at two or more wavelengths and using the Faraday
effect, the emission line regions of AGN can be mapped out and interpreted in
the framework of a model in which shock waves propagate in jets of highly
relativistic plasma ejected from the active centers of AGN. The ultimate goal is
to elaborate the mechanism that powers AGN, currently thought to be accretion
onto massive black holes.
