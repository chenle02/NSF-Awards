The position of several blocks of continental crust during the Permian-Triassic
closure of the Gulf of Mexico- Caribbean region are presently unconstrained, yet
must be accommodated in any model. This project will obtain paleomagnetic data
from one of the larger of these enigmatic central American Blocks- the Yucatan
block presently exposed in Belize and Guatemala. Paleopoles of late Paleozoic
and Mesozoic strata may constrain the paleolatitude and relative position of
Yucatan during the existence of Pangea and the incipient break up to form the
Gulf/Caribbean region.
