9308414 Bergbreiter We propose to modify polyolefins polymers by surface
polymerization. We aim to adapt existing synthetic methods and develop new
procedures to incorporate initiators into the surface interphase of polyolefins.
The proposed reactions and methods have precedent in solution-state studies and
in preliminary work. Our syntheses are designed to incorporate spectroscopic
labels to facilitate characterization of the modified polymers before and after
surface polymerizations. XPS spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and conventional
physical analyses such as contact angle analysis will be used to characterize
the modified surfaces. Fluorescent labels in conjunction with quenching groups
elsewhere on the surface or in solution will be used to study the 2- and 3-
dimensional character of these interfaces and the effect of graft polymerization
on these interfaces. Our proposed procedures promise to provide levels of
synthetic control not available with existing grafting chemistry. ***
