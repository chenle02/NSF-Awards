Observation of the emission from the OH molecule is used to investigate the
temperature, structure and dynamics of the mesopause region of the atmosphere.
In order to interpret the variations of the ratios of different OH band
intensities requires an accurate knowledge of the rate constants, collisional
energy transfer, and population of the various vibrational levels. This
laboratory study will use state of the art laser photo excitation techniques to
investigate state- specific rate constants and collisional energy transfer with
emphasis on the high vibrational levels.
