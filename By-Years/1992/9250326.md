This project is designed to improve two two-semester introductory biology
courses, one for non-science majors and one for science majors. Specifically,
the project focuses on the revision of the laboratory sections of the courses
from one of a series of cookbook exercises to one that is project oriented
focusing on scientific methodology, data acquisition, collection, organization
and analysis, instrumentation, biotechnology, mathematics and report writing.
Research teams consisting of two students will spend an entire semester
exploring a self-selected research problem. It is thought that the project will
better present science as it is actually practiced, will develop scientific
reasoning skills among our students and will enhance scientific literacy.
