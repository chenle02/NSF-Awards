This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program
Announcement NSF 87-63, Research Experience for Undergraduates, 1987. Under this
award Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will provide eight undergraduate students
with training and support while they participate in ongoing research projects in
the University's Computer Science Department. The award recognizes the
importance of hands-on experience in active research for training undergraduates
for careers in mathematics, science and engineering, and that too few such
experiences are now available. The University recruited some of the students
from other institutions, in order to broaden the base for attracting students to
scientific careers.
