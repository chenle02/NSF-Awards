Abstract

The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is designing a coordinated,
comprehensive program to increase the number of students entering engineering
fields in the targeted Tennessee/Georgia area. By including and impacting both
pre-service and in-service teachers at grades K-12, this program, Bridges to
Engineering Science: Teaching Teachers (B.E.S.T.T.), has the potential to affect
the over 115,000 students in grades K- 12 in thirteen school systems in
Tennessee and Georgia identified as potential partners. The program will include
a partnership between the Colleges of Engineering and Education; interaction
among faculty and students of the colleges and the thirteen targeted school
systems; development of high quality, self contained, apparatus based
engineering science experiments and curriculum units which meet the education
system goals and educational standards; development and dissemination of
teaching materials on hands-on, age appropriate, engaging engineering science
units for grades K-12; special targeted inclusion of groups currently under-
represented in engineering; and formative and summative assessment at all stages
of the project.
