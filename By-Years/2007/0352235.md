This award will help support he annual Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics.
Tuition and travel scholarships are provided for 30 students. The Institute
offers a series of 18 three-day workshops on a wide variety of topics in
statistical genetics.

The intellectual merit of the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics lies in
the dissemination of current methods of statistical analysis to population
biologists and to population and quantitative geneticists, and to the
explanation of issues in current population biology, and population and
quantitative genetics to statisticians. The workshops are taught by leaders in
the field, many of whom have developed the theories being taught and have
written the standard textbooks in those areas.

The broader impact of the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics lies in the
increased awareness among biologists for the power of modern statistical
methodology. This proposal is aimed at exposing students in population biology,
and population and quantitative genetics to the need for sound statistical
analyses of their data, and providing them with the tools for those analyses.
The Institute also raises awareness among statisticians about the opportunities
for research in population biology, and population and quantitative genetics.
