Multi-program execution, the concurrent execution of multiple independent
applications, will play an important role in efficiently exploiting the
potential of future multi-core systems. Researchers use multi-program workloads
to evaluate proposed designs and policies for various aspects of multi-program
execution. Unfortunately, the fixed workload and variable workload multi-program
workload methodologies used today are unsound and lead to incorrect results.
Therefore, the proposed research is aimed at investigating a new multi-program
workload construction scheme, called FIESTA (Fixed Instruction with Equal
STAndalone runtimes), in which application samples are chosen so that individual
application have equal runtimes when executing alone. Samples are then mixed and
matched to form multi-program workloads, but the same samples are used in every
experiment. The research will investigate two issues related to FIESTA:
Generation of application samples and Extension to multi-threaded environments.
FIESTA workloads should produce results that are internally consistent and
plausible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer architecture research surges when new
tools, benchmarks, and methodologies are introduced and distributed. The quality
and depth of single-program experimental evaluation improved when efficient
sampling and simulation techniques like SimPoints were introduced. FIESTA should
provide the same impetus for multi-program execution research and education,
while becoming the standard methodology for sampling both single-threaded and
multi-threaded programs.
