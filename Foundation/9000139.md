Baldwin plans work in pure model theory and connections between model theory
and algebra. In particular, he will study the uses of abstract classification
theory to explain more concrete model theoretic problems. Model theory as a
topic in the foundations of mathematics deals with axiomatic systems. Whether a
given set of axioms admit of any realization (called a model for these axioms)
or possibly only finitely many different realizations, or infinitely many, are a
few of the types of questions treated.
