Economists have long speculated that the measured (income) returns to education
may reflect the correlation of schooling levels with other variables related to
earnings, such as ability. There have been many attempts over the years to
estimate the return to education without bias from omitted variables that are
correlated with educational attainment and with earnings capacity. If education
were randomly assigned, the returns to education would be consistently measured
simply by comparing the earnings of more and less educated individuals. In the
absence of random assignment, the omitted variable bias can be overcome by using
instrumental variables that are correlated with education but have no other
effect on earnings. This project uses Vietnam- era draft lottery categories to
derive an instrument for years of education in a wage equation. As a consequence
of the lottery, the risk of induction was randomly assigned on the basis of
individuals' birthdays. Because it was necessary for young men seeking to avoid
the draft to take draft avoidance measures (e.g. school attendance) before the
cutoff lottery number for the draft was actually known, the lottery has an
influence on years of schooling that differs from its influence on induction. A
second project uses variations in educational attainment by season of birth to
estimate the returns to education. It is suggested that compulsory schooling
laws -- which typically mandate school attendance until age 16 -- interact with
age at school entry to produce a season of birth effect on education. Resolution
of this issue is of substantial importance for education policy and economic
theory. As the average incomes of high school and college graduates continues to
diverge, it is vital to understand more about the relationship between schooling
and earnings.
