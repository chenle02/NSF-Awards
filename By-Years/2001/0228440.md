The proposed focuses on teachers and students in Head Start and State funded
pre-K programs that serve predominately low income and minority populations. The
assumption is that this is a key age group in that lagging proficiency in school
subjects, mathematics included, often has roots in the preschool years. The
intervention is a pre-K mathematics curriculum that is based on knowledge of
human development and that employs technologies fitting for multiple levels. A
randomized experimental design will be used to investigate the efficacy of the
curriculum for students served by Head Start and state-funded pre-K programs.
The proposed study will increase knowledge of scaling up pre-K intervention
across programmatic contexts for diverse low-income students in their growing
knowledge of mathematical ideas. They research design will permit inferences
about what contextual variables contributed to outcomes.
