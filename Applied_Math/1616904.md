Photoacoustic tomography is an emerging hybrid method of imaging that combines
the good contrast of optical imaging and high resolution of ultrasound imaging.
Although significant progress has been made in this area, there are still many
challenging problems whose solutions would not only contribute to understanding
the mathematical foundation of tomography but also fundamentally innovate the
state of the art in imaging technologies. The goals of this project are to
analyze the possibilities and limitations of tomographic methods, as well as to
design efficient algorithms for image reconstruction. Through collaborations
with biomedical engineers, some of these results will be used in designs and/or
algorithms for biomedical imaging methods. They may help better early detection
of cancer and other diseases.

This project has two parts, research problems in photoacoustic tomography (PAT)
and integral geometry problems arising in tomography. The project in PAT will
focus on the issues arising in imaging moving objects, PAT with integrating
detectors, sampling theory, transcranial imaging, PAT with presence of air
voids, and quantitative PAT. The problems in integral geometry problems include
microlocal analysis of geometric integral transforms and theory of interior
tomography. This interdisciplinary project will include close collaboration with
biomedical engineers and the results have the may advance methods in biomedical
imaging.
