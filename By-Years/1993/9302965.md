This award supports collaboration between Barry Rosen, Wayne State University,
and Liu Shusen, State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology,
Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences on the enzymology and
structure-function relationships of an anion- translocating ATPase in E. coli.
The project will focus on the catalytic subunit of the oxyanion pump, which is
responsible for extruding arsenite from cells. Dr. Rosen's group will perform
the protein purification and mutagenesis, and Dr. Liu's group will perform the
rapid kinetic measurements. The Chinese collaborator is head of one of China's
most advanced laboratories ("key labs") which has been heavily supported by the
Chinese government through World Bank loans. The lab has equipment unavailable
in the US PI's lab, providing an important complementary capability. Dr. Rosen
has students of Dr. Liu working in his lab at Wayne State; collaboration between
Liu and Rosen will help keep the skills and interests of the returned Chinese
students viable, providing potential for longer term collaboration. This project
is supported under the US-China Cooperative Research Program.
