Part of the emerging picture of diminishing national economic boundaries is the
movement of foreign firms, not only into presently industrialized countries such
as the U.S. but into Third World countries as well. This is especially true when
we look at the movement of Japanese and American firms into the same countries,
using similar workers in highly competitive industries such as electronics and
auto components. When these firms undertake production operations outside of
familiar social and labor market environment, exciting sociological experiments
naturally take place as well. These endeavors have great potential for teaching
both social scientists, Third World government officials and the managers and
owners of these operations much that will surprise them about alternative ways
of effectively organizing production work. This dissertation research will apply
the skills of two highly and even uniquely qualified individuals (Portes and
student Koido) to a study of local labor markets, internal labor markets and
transnational corporations in a third world nation. Of special interest here is
a comparison of the operations of U.S. and Japanese firms as they differently
restructure their operations in this country. This grant will support the
graduate student's collection of data in the field, primarily through intensive
interviews with plant managers and workers associated with Japanese and American
firms. The faculty PI is qualified by extensive research experience to guide
first rate studies in Third World countries. The doctorial student is uniquely
qualified to do this study, being affluent in English, Japanese and Spanish.
