The PI requests funding to purchase instrumentation that will be operated as
shared-use equipment for deep oceanographic research. The instruments requested,
upgrades to a CCD camera, will be used aboard the submersible ALVIN and,
potentially, aboard remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). The requested upgrades
include a new CCD chip with greater sensitivity, increased light sources for
ALVIN, a video lens with a greater field of view, and improved software that
will increase the data acquisition rate. These upgrades will enhance the
performance of the CCD camera to produce comprehensive, high-resolution digital
photomosaics of the seafloor. Acquisition of a camera system with these
capabilities was identified as a high priority for the Deep Submergence Science
Committee (DESSC) which oversees the operation of ALVIN and other research ROVs.
The instrumentation requested will enhance a wide variety of NSF-funded
scientific research.
