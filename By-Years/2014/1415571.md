This RAPID project centers on LiDAR data collection plus water sample analysis
following the September 2013 storm in the Colorado Front range. In areas
identified as being most highly impacted, post-storm LiDAR data will be
differenced with data collected for the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory
three years earlier using the same protocols. The LiDAR will provide a unique
data set with which to quantify hillslope and channel change with sufficient
spatial resolution to reveal (1) the locations and sizes of hillslope failures
and the transport paths of these failures and their depositional zones, and (2)
channel changes on all streams including sites of both vertical and lateral
scour and deposition. In addition to the LiDAR data analysis, the project will
analyze the chemistry of water delivered from the landscape since the first day
of the storm. This will enable a quantitative assessment of the sources and
transport dynamics of major elements, organic molecules, and isotopes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long duration, widespread area, and severe magnitude
of the storm (70% of mean annual precipitation) is exceptional and provides a
rare opportunity to address fundamental questions about the effects of severe
storms in a semi-arid mountainous wildland-urban interface. The affected region
includes the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory, Rocky Mountain National
Park, and the Big Thompson River. Since the storm impacted areas burned in
recent large wildfires, including the Fourmile Canyon fire of September 2010 in
Boulder Creek, the opportunity exists to probe the role of such one-two punches
in landscape evolution. Graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in
the project, and the data will be made available to test models of how
landscapes respond to rare precipitation events. In addition, the team plans to
infuse storm-related data and insights into its ongoing collaborations with
local schools through its K-12 curriculum of the Science Discovery program, and
through teaching at the college level.
