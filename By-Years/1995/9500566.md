9500566 Hudson The theory of nonselfadjoint operator algebras, and in
particular, the theory of limit subalgebras of approximately finite C*-algebras,
has experienced rapid development in recent years. The proposed research
concerns the structure of triangular AF algebras and their lattices of ideals,
the radical structure and classification of various types of ideals in
triangular AF algebras, factorization questions in operator algebras, the
geometry of the unit ball of triangular AF algebras, and algebraic topology
considerations within the context of operator algebras. Operators can be viewed
as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. In this way a collection of
operators can often be given an algebraic structure and referred to as an
operator algebra. In the case where one is dealing with operator algebras whose
elements can be realized as infinite matrices, it is important to understand how
the algebra is constructed or can be approximated out of finite matrices. An
approximately finite operator algebra is a limit of finite dimensional
subalgebras. This research will contribute to understanding the structure of
these natural operator algebras. ***
