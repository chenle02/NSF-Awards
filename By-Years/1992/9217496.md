Theoretical research will be conducted on cooperative phenomena in strongly
interacting condensed matter systems. In particular, the research will focus on
the interplay between metal-insulator transitions, magnetism, superconductivity
and Kondo physics in disordered electronic systems. The goal of the research is
to understand the possible phases that such systems can display as the disorder
and the Fermi liquid parameters are varied. %%% Theoretical research will be
conducted on systems of electrons which interact with each other so strongly
that conventional theoretical techniques are not applicable. These types of
material systems are relevant to both current fundamental issues in condensed
matter physics and to real materials such as high temperature superconductors
and electronic materials.
