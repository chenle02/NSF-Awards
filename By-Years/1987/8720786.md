The PI proposes to study partial melting of pelitic rocks using natural samples
of the Laramie Anorthosite. Goals are to: (1) constrain phase equilibria in
pelitic rocks and determine melt compositions; (2) test the model of wall rock
melting associated with the anorthosite intrusion; (3) evaluate contamination of
the anorthosite magma by anatectic wells. Chemical analyses, petrologic studies,
and experimental studies will be used to attain these goals.
