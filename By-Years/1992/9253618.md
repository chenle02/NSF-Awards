This research is aimed at the continued development of and student training in
high resolution soft x-ray optical techniques for microscopy and lithography.
Using an undulator at the National Synchrotron Light Source at nearby Brookhaven
National Laboratory, we are able to obtain coherent beams of x-rays with a
wavelength of 1-5 nm (the wavelength of visible light is 400- 700 nm). The PI
has developed a scanning x-ray microscope which focusses these soft x-rays to a
50 nm spot, and this microscope is being used both for transmission microscopy
studies of wet, thick biological specimens, and for the development of new
imaging modalities. The PI has also demonstrated the ability to record x-ray
holograms of biological specimens at 50 nm resolution, and our efforts in
holography and developments at laser labs are leading towards the goal of
recording 20 nm resolution holograms with psec exposure times, thus imaging a
specimen in a timescale shorter than that of radiation damage. Finally, the PI
has also developed a method for designing masks for x-ray lithographic
manufacture of future integrated circuits based on referenceless on-axis
computed holograms; it is hoped to bring this method from computer simulation to
experimental demonstration.
