The U.S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal section cruise was scheduled for 15
October through 5 December 2010. Because of a major irresolvable mechanical
failure of the ship's propulsion system, the expedition had to be terminated in
the Cape Verde Islands on 4 November after completing about one third of the
planned track. This required on-the-spot changes in return travel for all sea-
going investigators as well as in shipping arrangements for all their samples
and equipment. The funds requested in this proposal address the PI's need to
cover travel and shipping cost associated with his participation in the
continuation of the North Atlantic section cruise scheduled for autumn 2011. The
travel costs would ensure that two people can participate in the second cruise,
as well as for one person to travel to Woods Hole to demobilize the ship upon
its return to port. Shipping costs are needed to get a shipboard container with
analytical instrumentation, a CTD, and GO-FLO bottles to the ship and back to
the University of Hawaii. Completing the analysis of dissolved Fe, Al, Cd, Mn,
and Zn recovered from different oceanographic regimes of the North Atlantic
Ocean would significantly further our understanding of the biogeochemical cycles
of these elements in the marine environment.
