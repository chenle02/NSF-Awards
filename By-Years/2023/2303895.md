Josh Forer is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry out
a program of research and education at Columbia University. Forer will study
microscopic chemical reactions that need to be understood to track the evolution
of star-forming gas clouds in galaxies. Additionally, Forer will mentor summer
research with the women's undergraduate institution Barnard College, participate
in Columbia University's Astronomy Public Outreach program of free public talks,
and teach high school students with a strong interest in math and physics.

Forer will develop theory and code to describe the dissociative recombination
(DR) of OH+, H20+, and H2Cl+ at scattering energies relevant to diffuse cloud
temperatures. State-selected rovibronic kinetic DR rate coefficients (needed,
but not available) of these ions will be produced to place constraints on the
relative abundance of molecular hydrogen, the inferred cosmic-ray ionization
rate of atomic hydrogen, and the interstellar radiation field. These constraints
allow astrochemical models to map the transition of diffuse interstellar clouds
from almost purely atomic to increasingly molecular â€” a crucial early step in
star formation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
