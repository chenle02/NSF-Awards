9553202 Si This project will establish a joint research and education program
between Arizona State University and Motorola. This project will iteratively
develop and test novel general-purpose designs for control and systems modeling,
based on adaptive critics (approximate dynamic programming) and recurrent neural
networks. For testing and evaluation, it will focus on the modeling and run-to-
run control of the Reactive Ion Etching process. A new course will be developed
in electrical engineering curriculum on fundamental signal analysis and control
applications to semiconductor manufacturing.
