The Minority University Space Interdisciplinary Network, MU-SPIN, is a program
for minority institutions, as well as colleges with significant minority
enrollments, which is oriented around wide area networking technology and its
use in supporting interdisciplinary research. Sponsorship is by the NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs
Office, the Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters. Based on the
success of the 1991-1994 meetings, this project is to support the fifth meeting
of the MU-SPIN User Working Group, October 4-7, 1995, at Morgan State
University, as well as a set of smaller workshops to be held during the year as
a supplement to the workshops are to provide opportunities for discussions on
networking, communications, and infrastructure building and for the exchange of
ideas on networking and communications to support interdisciplinary research.
Funding will support the cost of participant travel, meals, and arrangements for
the October meeting and expenses for the smaller workshops. The project is
directly relat ed to the interests of the Computer and Information Science and
Engineering Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance
the opportunities of underrepresented populations in the computing field. Access
to adequate facilities, and the interchange made available by the network
connections is an important aspect of this effort, and the programs of the large
October meeting and those of the smaller workshops are expected to enhance the
opportunities of the participants.
