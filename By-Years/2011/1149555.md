The story of Earth's history is locked within marine sediments, with the stable
isotopes of sulfur providing much of this information and timeline. Despite this
utility, what controls the behavior of these isotopes is incompletely
understood. The goal of this CAREER award is to systematically evaluate how
sulfur isotopes are fractionated when growing on different soluble sulfur
compounds. In the same fashion that humans breathe oxygen, these organisms can
grow on sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate and trithionate; these are the targeted
substrates. This work will thus develop a framework whereby specific
fractionations will be linked to particular metabolic processes. In essence,
this is a 'fingerprinting' process. At the core of this research is the team-
based STEM model where local high school students will work closely with
undergraduates from a suite of colleges in New England to conduct all the
experimental work outlined above. This will bring young scientists along on the
path of designing research questions, performing lab-based experiments,
processing data and working with particular instruments, and finally relating
these results to the published literature.
