9632406 Ansari Fiber Optic sensors have the potential to provide true real- time
condition monitoring capabilities for construction materials and bridges in the
twenty-first century. Optical fiber sensors provide remote distributed
measurement capabilities which makes it possible to discern, in real- time, the
formation and progress of damage within various sections of a structure. The
workshop will aid in prioritizing and planning of a coordinated research program
in order to transfer this technology to the practice of civil engineering.
Research activities are divided into six tasks including: sensor
characterization, transduction mechanism, sensor embeddment and adhesion, sensor
durability, condition monitoring of bridges and standards, and specifications.
The workshop will be held during 1997 in Washington, D. C.. The final products
of the workshop will be in the form of a hard bound book detailing the state-of-
the-art on fiber optic sensor systems for construction materials, and a
comprehensive report outlining a detailed five year national plan for research.
