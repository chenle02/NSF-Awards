Before high-performance MIMD architectures become commonplace in production
scientific, engineering, and business applications, three programming problems
that plague current systems must be solved. First, writing parallel programs by
hand is very difficult. The programmer must manage communication,
synchronization, and scheduling of tens to thousands of independent processes.
The burden of correctly managing the environment often overwhelms programmers.
Second, once implemented on a particular MIMD architecture, the resulting codes
are usually not usable on other MIMD architectures, necessitating a substantial
effort to port. This discourages users from parallelizing their code, since new
architectures are introduced so frequently. Third, there is no software support
for transparently executing applications on heterogeneous "meta- systems"
comprised of a variety of high-performance architectures. This proposal
addresses all three of these problems. We have attacked the first two with
Mentat, an easy-to-use, object- oriented, parallel processing system developed
at the University of Virginia. We plan to test the efficacy of the Mentat
approach on a set of real applications on a variety of platforms. The objective
is to determine whether Mentat is easy to use on real applications and to
measure performance. Our approach to the third problem is evolutionary. We will
extend Mentat into a heterogeneous environment, and use the extended Mentat as a
test- bed for meta-systems experimentation. Based on experimental results, a
prototype meta-system that provides an easy-to-use, high performance abstraction
for users will be constructed.
