9402761 Kolata This grant will support a wide-ranging program of basic research
in the areas of nuclear reactions, nuclear structure, and nuclear astrophysics
to be conducted in the Nuclear Structure Laboratory of the University of Notre
Dame, and at other major nuclear research facilities in the US and elsewhere.
The areas of interest include the study of the synthesis of heavy elements in
the Big Bang and in explosive hydrogen-burning processes, the production and use
of radioactive nuclear beams, and the study of exotic nuclear systems such as
superdeformed and hyperdeformed states and the "halo" nuclei that occur near the
neutron- (and possibly the proton-) drip line. Multiphonon vibrations in
deformed nuclei, and the "giant resonance" phenomenon, will also be
investigated. Finally, a new component, recently added to the research programs
at the laboratory, is the study of weak interactions and fundamental processes
in nuclear systems. The research program at the Notre Dame Nuclear Structure
Laboratory has emphasized extensive collaboration with experimental and
theoretical physicists at other universities. This mode of operation will
continue under the proposed grant, as will our own use of such new or
anticipated research tools as Gammashpere, the radioactive nuclear beam facility
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the S800 spectrograph at Michigan State
University.
