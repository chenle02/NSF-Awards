An interdisciplinary conference on "Finite Geometries, Groups and Computation"
will be held on September 4 - 9, 2004 at the Pingree Park Campus of Colorado
State University.

Participants will include leading researchers from Europe, Asia and Australia,
and graduate students and recent PhD recipients. The invited principal speakers
are Eamonn O'Brien (Auckland), William Kantor (Eugene), Rudi Mathon (Toronto),
Tim Penttila (Perth) and Jacques Tits (Paris).

The highest funding priority is to the support of less established researchers.
