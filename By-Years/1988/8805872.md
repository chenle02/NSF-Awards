This research deals with two problems in commutative algebra. The first is to
determine if rings with the approximation property are excellent. The second
problem is related to the Bass-Quillen conjecture. The study of the geometric
properties of rings involves the analysis of the commutative rings that arise in
algebraic geometry. This project concerns approximating regular local rings by
smooth algebras. While interesting in its own right, it also has application to
the Bass-Quillen conjecture on projective modules.
