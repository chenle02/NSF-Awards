Funds are provided for a study of the technological gatekeeping process as it
relates to the dissemination of Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) research results. Technological gatekeepers are individuals in
organizations to whom others turn to for technical information. They are key
elements in an elaborate communication process that influences the flow of
technical information into and within an organization. Data will be collected to
ascertain the degree to which technological gatekeeping is a role enacted by
members of the Industrial Advisory Board members at selected I/UCRC's. Finally,
conclusions will be drawn relating the technological gatekeeping function to
issues of information dissemination within member firms and the retention of
firms as Center members. The principal investigator is qualified to conduct this
study, and the Program Manager recommends an award of $29,512 for one year.
