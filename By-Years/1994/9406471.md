9406471 Moyer Entomopoxviruses are poxviruses of insects and are related to the
more commonly studied vertebrate poxviruses such as vaccinia. The proposed
project has relevance to biotechnology, biological control, and gene expression.
The PI's studies may open the way for a variety of applications including
genetically engineered biopesticides, vaccines, and expression systems for
foreign genes. An entomopoxvirus expression system would be a valuable tool for
all these areas in much the same manner as that of other insect virus expression
vectors have been. There are potential uses of entomopoxviruses in biological
control of insects. Grasshopper entomopoxviruses are presently being developed
for use in grasshopper control programs on rangelands. Identification of viral
genes associated with natural virulence may offer clues to the control of insect
populations. It is anticipated that the genetic engineering methodology
developed in this project will greatly aid in the insertion of insect-specific
toxin genes into entomopoxviruses to enhance their potential efficacy as
biological control agents. The PI's studies may also pave the way for
examination of the molecular aspects of disease production of this as yet
unexploited yet very different and interesting group of viruses. ***
