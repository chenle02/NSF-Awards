Increasing attention is being focussed on the origin and structure of the
Universe. In these studies, analysis of the properties of groups and clusters of
galaxies are essential to studies of large-scale structure. Research supported
under this grant will be devoted to a study of the structure of groups and
clusters of galaxies. Existing databases will be updated. There will also be
studies on the cosmological distance scale. The Principal Investigator is
regarded as an expert in these areas of study.
