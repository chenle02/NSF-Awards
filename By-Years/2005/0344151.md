It has recently been discovered that tiny RNA molecules, called microRNA
(miRNA), are important in the development of both plants and animals, but little
is yet known about how this newly-discovered regulatory mechanism operates. The
principal investigator's laboratory has identified a gene in the well-
characterized experimental plant Arabidopsis thaliana called Hyponastic leaves 1
(HYL1) that encodes a double-strand RNA-binding protein. Preliminary experiments
suggest that the HYL1 protein participates in miRNA regulation. Levels of
several miRNAs are reduced in a hyl1 mutant and elevated in a plant that
overexpresses HYL1. Conversely, levels of several mRNAs predicted to be
regulatory targets of the miRNAs examined are elevated in the mutant and reduced
in HYL1 over-expressing plants, suggesting that the HYL1 protein is involved in
either production of the miRNAs or in miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA levels.
The hyl1 mutant has a pleiotropic hormonal phenotype, exhibiting reduced
sensitivity to auxin and cytokinin and hypersensitivity to abscisic acid. The
objective of this project is to determine whether and how the HYL1 protein
functions in miRNA regulation of gene expression. Proteins that interact with
HYL1 will be identified, located in cells, and their effect on the production of
miRNAs and mRNA stability determined. How this regulatory mechanism functions in
the hormonal regulation of gene expression and what kinds of signaling
mechanisms activate it will also be determined. The principal investigator has
been a leader in providing training opportunities for women and underrepresented
minorities, both in her lab and more widely at her institution. She is also very
active in communicating science issues to the general public. The scientific
results may have practical applications in biotechnology.
