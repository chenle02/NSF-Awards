The undergraduate electrical engineering education in the areas of digital and
analog signal processing, digital and analog telecommunications, fiber optics
systems, and satellite communications systems is enhanced with the development
of a comprehensive telecommunications and signal processing laboratory to
provide students with hands-on test and design experience. By sharing expensive
equipment among these related disciplines, maximum cost effectiveness is being
achieved. The laboratory will comprise five stations consisting of equipment for
signal generation (function, RF, optic), processing (filters, mixers, etc.), and
analysis (oscilloscopes and spectrum analysis), together with a microcomputer
for high- speed data acquisition and digital signal processing capabilities. A
total of nine interdisciplinary junior and senior courses benefit by way of
demonstrations, experiments, and design projects. The knowledge which will be
reinforced by this laboratory ranges from an understanding of fundamental
frequency-domain concepts to more advanced concepts in digital filtering, signal
modulation, fiber optics, and satellite communications.
