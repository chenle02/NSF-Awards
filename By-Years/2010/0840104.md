Compelling questions still abound about the fundamental processes of corrosion,
broadly defined Corrosion initiation mechanisms and the dynamics of materials
degradation are poorly understood. While many corrosion inhibition processes
have been discovered and implemented, there is often little understanding of why
they work. Improved techniques are needed to study and model dynamic corrosion
systems, so that they can be better understood and mitigation techniques can be
better developed. The lack of understanding about corrosion prevents the
development of better mitigation processes and any research on
alternatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this award, the research objective is to
identify the science opportunities that have arisen from recent advances and
accomplishments in the field of fundamental corrosion research that will advance
scientific understanding of the mechanisms of corrosion processes, materials
degradation and their mitigation; prioritize a set of research grand-challenge
questions to fill identified scientific gaps; and make recommendations on a
national strategy in fundamental corrosion research with the goal of gaining the
critical understanding of (1) materials degradation and (2) mitigating
technologies. This strategy should also include recommendations on how to
maximize the dissemination of the outcomes of corrosion research to maximize
their incorporation into corrosion mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
