The investigator will continue his research in exchangeability. The
investigator is one of the originators of the recent activity in exchangeability
and has done extensive work in it already. Exchangeability is a property of
classes of probability distributions that characterizes certain invariance
properties under transformations. Exchangeability is a very weak property to
assume for a sequence of variables and hence it is very important to see how
many "classical"results extend to such dependent sequences of random variables.
The investigator has already proved a number of results related to filtration,
stopping times and stochastic integrals. He will continue his research in these
areas.
