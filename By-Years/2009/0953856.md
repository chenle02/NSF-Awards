The vision of robotic assistants for domestic, health care, and workplace
applications will not come to fruition without the ability to manipulate typical
objects in human environments. However, grasping is challenging in unstructured
environments because object models typically required to control the robot are
not known beforehand and must be acquired through sensors that are imprecise and
incomplete. The majority of research in robotic grasping and manipulation has
attempted to address this problem through elaborate multifingered hands combined
with tactile sensing and sophisticated planning and control algorithms, often
following an anthropomorphic approach. This proposal utilizes an alternative
approach involving a focus on the mechanics of the hand itself to accomplish
most of the needed ?control.? By appropriately incorporating features such as
compliance and underactuation, the uncertainty inherent in unstructured grasping
tasks can be more easily accommodated. The proposed work addresses the problem
of precision grasping of small objects from the surrounding environment and then
begins to address the broader problem of dexterity by examining two-fingered
precision manipulation, while investigating the role of compliance,
underactuation, and configuration on performance in the presence of uncertainty.
This work will be disseminated through publications in scholarly journals and
conferences and will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the
mechanical interaction of robot hands with small objects and the surrounding
environment. These results are expected to lead to the development of low-
dimensional hands for precision robotic grasping and manipulation with
applications including assistive robots and prosthetics.
