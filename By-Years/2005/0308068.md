0308068&lt;br/&gt;Ustach&lt;br/&gt;This award to Duke University provides
support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used on R/V
Cape Hatteras, a 135' research vessel operated by the Duke/UNC Oceanographic
Consortium (DUNCOC) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically, support is recommended to acquire a
thermosalinograph, a pinger, and a Carousel water sampling system and altimeter
for use with the existing conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument. All
of these items are intended for shared-use operation. These acquisitions should
provide a substantial advantage to marine scientists using R/V Cape Hatteras in
their research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
