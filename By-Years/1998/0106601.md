The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) for Polar Marine Sciences is seeking
partial support of participants to attend its 3 rd GRC, "Field Analyses and
Numerical Modeling of Coupled Physical/Chemical and Biological Systems", March
11-16, 2001, in Ventura, California. The conference will provide a great
opportunity for cutting-edge presentations and lively discussion of ideas in
predictive system dynamics that at the forefront of polar marine science. The
scientific program has been developed to foster strong controversy in a friendly
environment and, hopefully, open minds about other or new possibilities to
explore. The conference will be useful for the training of new polar scientists
and the planning for polar research programs that impact on the polar
environment and global change issues relating to these polar environments.
