An architectural model of adenovirus has been developed by combining information
from several areas: a high-resolution crystallographic structure of hexon, the
major coat protein; image analysis of electron micrographs of capsid fragments;
and biochemical stoichiometric determinations. The basic model for hexon packing
is supported experimentally with a three- dimensional image reconstruction at 35
A resolution using unstained images from cryo-electron microscopy. This reveals
that the virion has curved facets, provides the shapes of the vertex proteins,
and suggests locations for several "cementing proteins". Hexon density will be
calculated from the known atomic coordinates. Suitable contrast transfer
functions will be derived to match crystallographic hexons to their electron
microscopic counterparts. Hexon positions in the virion will be refined.
Accurate difference density will be calculated by subtracting a hexon shell from
the virion density to image vertex proteins and minor components in greater
detail. The reconstruction will be extended to higher resolution. Difference
imaging of mutant virions lacking structural components, and virions labelled
with monoclonal antibodies, will identify these proteins and define virion
epitopes. %%% The overall goal of this project is to explore the principles by
which mammalian viruses are constructed from their constituent proteins with the
focus on determining the molecular structure of adenovirus to high resolution.
