It is intuitive that ordinary activity requires on-going memory for what we see,
hear, and do. When crossing a busy street we look left and then right and must
remember both views. In a social gathering, we remember those around us even
when they are not directly in sight. Yet laboratory tests of memory for visual
details show surprising limitations: only three or four objects can be
remembered at a time. Such severe limitations may contribute to human errors in
driving and other activities for instance.&lt;br/&gt;With support from the
National Science Foundation, Dr. Yuhong Jiang will study visual short-term
memory, the form of memory that keeps a visual image in mind for a few seconds.
Other researchers have focused on memory for single brief events. Dr. Jiang goes
beyond the previous work to investigate memory for sequences of visual events.
She also examines how and whether people remember better after prolonged
training. Broader impact of this project lies in its educational value and
potential practical application. The funded study provides research
opportunities for students, who obtain first-hand experience in the conduct of
scientific research. Also, by informing engineers what is humanly possible, the
study can potentially improve the design of human-machine interface, such as
computers, vehicles, and airport surveillance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
