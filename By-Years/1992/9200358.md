This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a one-year period beginning April 1992, ten (10) undergraduate
students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research under the direction
of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. Chemical kinetics has been
chosen as a theme to provide a common thread for communication and discussion
among students initially, and a common base of knowledge for future discourse
among students and faculty. We expect student participants to work side by side
with their mentors, to meet weekly as a group, to present final written and oral
reports to the Department and to participate at a national undergraduate
research conference.
