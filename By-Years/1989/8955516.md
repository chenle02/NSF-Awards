The University of Southern California will initiate a multidisciplinary
academic year commuter Young Scholars project for 50 students in grades 10-12.
The Southern California Student Research Consortium is a cooperative effort
among the Southern California Academy of Sciences (SCAS), the California Museum
of Science and Industry (CMSI), and the University of Southern California. We
will actively recruit high ability students coming from underrepresented
minorities. Students will work in the laboratories of professional scientists
and will gain direct experience in methodology and ethics of scientific
research, as well as learn about careers in science. This program is based on
successful programs sponsored by the SCAS and CMSI. Follow- up options
consisting of separately funded programs by SCAS and CMSI will support the gains
made by participants.
