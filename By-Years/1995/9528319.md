This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan. The study tries to explain variations in fertility
levels in a developing country--Brazil-- through the impact of variations in
television exposure. Previous studies have suggested that the medium has a
`contraceptive effect`, separate from other changes linked to industrialization
and urbanization, through the exposure of viewers to new ideas, values, and
behaviors. The study will examine the hypothesis that the degree of television
exposure affects lifetime fertility and will also focus on the link between TV
viewing and attitudes about contraception, the perceived value of children, and
notions of ideal family size. The methods include qualitative ethnographic
information through participant-observation and intensive interviews, and
quantitative data from a survey of 250-300 women in Arembepe, Bahia, as well as
50-80 women in a more rural community with less television availability. The
data will be linked to a study on this subject in the region a decade ago. This
project is important because it will shed light on the role that television may
play in lowering fertility levels in developing countries, and will elucidate
the link between demographic shifts and the exposure to new ideas and
information. Advances in our knowledge about the causes of family size are
important for planners concerned about world population growth.
