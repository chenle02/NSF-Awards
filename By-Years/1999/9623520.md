Abstract Kapitanski 9623520 The work under the proposed project will focus on
the analysis of the properties of solutions for both nonlinear and linear
Schrodinger equations. The principal investigator will study the uniqueness of
the global weak solutions of the Cauchy problem for a semilinear Schrodinger
equation with critical Sobolev exponent. He will also study the basic questions
of global existence, uniqueness and persistence for solutions in more general
situations: in the case of a curved metric, in the presence of a magnetic field
and/or a confining or singular potential. Such generalizations pose nontrivial
problems concerning space-time integrability properties and formation of
singularities for solutions of the corresponding linear Schrodinger equations.
The analysis of these linear problems is a part of the proposed project. In
comparison with the parabolic and hyperbolic equations, the equations of
Schrodinger type are much harder to work with because of the lack of local
estimates. The investigator has developed techniques based on microlocal
constructions and weighted estimates, that will allow him to get around this
difficulty in the analysis of solutions of linear and nonlinear Schrodinger
equations. The Schrodinger equation is one of the basic equations of
mathematical physics. It provides the mathematical foundation to nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics, which is the source of much of our understanding of the
structure of matter. In a rich variety of circumstances the models based on the
Schrodinger equation and its nonlinear generalizations give the correct
description of the physical reality. From the mathematical point of view, the
Schrodinger equation is an unfailing source of deep and challenging problems.
The proposed investigation, aiming at the analysis of the basic properties of
solutions of linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations, has direct bearing on
some of the fundamental issues facing researchers in partial differential
equations and harm onic analysis.
