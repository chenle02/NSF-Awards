Divergent mate recognition traits can play a pivotal role in speciation by
curtailing gene flow between newly formed species through the evolution of like-
mating within differentiated populations. Changes in communication between males
and females predict a genetic correlation between male mating signals and female
preferences. Testing hypotheses about the male and female genetic components of
the intraspecific communication system will advance knowledge of how these
associations arise. Using next-generation sequencing approaches, genetic lines
that contain differentiated genes involved the origin of species will be mapped
in the genome and their gene products will sequenced. The approach taken is to
1) to test the co-localization of song and preference genes, 2) translate the
results into a nucleotide genome map to generate candidate genes underlying
behavioral change, and 3) build a data set of expressed genes that associates
with different behaviors. A targeted genome assembly and gene annotation will
also be undertaken. Data will be stored and available based upon type of data.
WAV files will be stored on DYRAD (www.dyrad.com), while sequence data will be
deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.

The project will have multiple broader impacts. Many of the fascinating
behaviors that illustrate principles in behavioral ecology and evolution come
from "non-model" organisms whereas the genetic insights into behavior often come
from "model" genetic organisms. The integration of natural behavioral variation
(male signal and female preference) with advanced genomic approaches provides a
bridge between model-genetic study and natural behavioral systems. Insights
promise one of the best empirical and conceptual bridges to explain
diversification. From the education and outreach perspective, the project will
provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and
efforts to reach out to the public will continue via contributions to public
science centers and museum events centered on insects.
