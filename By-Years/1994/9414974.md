NSF and Emory University will co-fund a major renovation of 20-year old Atwood
Hall for the benefit of Chemistry research and research training. The project is
part of a major effort on the Emory campus to consolidate the disciplines of
Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science into one large complex.
Planning for the renovation has followed a carefully developed needs assessment
and design process. NSF support which represents less than 30% of the project
expense will be used to support the installation of a new HVAC system permitting
enhanced environmental control, replacement of ductwork to eliminate particulate
matter, conversion of new and existing hoods to variable air volume design,
modification of the fire protection systems for code compliance, and
installation of a 10base-T system for networking for high speed computing. The
renovations will facilitate research activities in two broad areas: traditional
inorganic, organic, physical and analytical chemistry, and new areas including
materials, biomolecular, and computational chemistry. Thirteen faculty will be
direct beneficiaries of the renovation, and the majority of the 117 graduate
students will receive research training and will conduct independent experiments
within the renovated space. Undergraduates are encouraged to participate in
research activities, and the space enhancements will permit safer and expanded
participation by this group.
