Human computation studies how to collect useful data as a by-product of another
activity in which people are interested (e.g., playing games). A popular example
is the ESP Game, where two players are shown the same image and must
independently generate tags; tags that match become labels for the image. ESP
Game players have generated millions of labels that help improve image search
engines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, little is understood about how to
capitalize on each person's individual expertise to produce the best results in
human computation systems. For example, the ESP Game could generate better
results if automotive enthusiasts labeled images of cars while biologists
labeled images of animals. This project aims to better understand how each
individual's different capabilities can be assessed, dynamically leveraged, and
even improved for the purposes of human-driven data collection.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Improved understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses of human users as teachers and data sources; an
intelligent new objective-driven model of data collection; novel opportunities
to study machine learning algorithms that capitalize on human teachers'
abilities; and an analysis of learning opportunities as incentives for people to
participate in human computation systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
Distribution of large new data sets (e.g., Wikipedia articles in multiple
languages); several Internet-based human computation systems for large-scale
evaluation of machine learning and other algorithms; a new course called ?Human-
in-the-Loop Systems?; workshops held in conjunction with major conferences; and
outreach activities (e.g., summer projects) that introduce female undergraduate
students to interdisciplinary research.
