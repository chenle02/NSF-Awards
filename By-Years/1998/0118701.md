In recent years, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been
shown&lt;br/&gt;to have the power to perform within thousandths of decibels of
the&lt;br/&gt;Shannon channel capacity of memoryless communications channels.
This&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to answer a natural question: how good are these
codes&lt;br/&gt;for transmission over channels with memory? The channels
under&lt;br/&gt;consideration are Markovian memory channels, including both
channels&lt;br/&gt;where the memory is dependent and independent of the
transmitted&lt;br/&gt;symbols. Such channels arise in several applications, such
as disk&lt;br/&gt;drives or other storage media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
analysis and design of LDPC codes has benefited from
representing&lt;br/&gt;these codes as graphs, where the decoding is done by
passing messages&lt;br/&gt;along the graph edges. This graph model allows an
analysis using&lt;br/&gt;martingales that underlies recent advances, including
the density&lt;br/&gt;evolution design technique. The investigators study how to
extend&lt;br/&gt;this graphical modeling approach to channels with memory.
More&lt;br/&gt;specifically, the project is divided into four major tasks:
&lt;br/&gt;designing density evolution algorithms under new channel
models;&lt;br/&gt;evaluating noise tolerance thresholds; engineering codes for
short&lt;br/&gt;block lengths and rapid decoding; and achieving spectral shaping
with&lt;br/&gt;low-density parity-check codes.
