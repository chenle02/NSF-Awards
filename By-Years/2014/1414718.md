Abrupt changes in sea surface temperature (SST) are known to disrupt fishery
productivity and marine ecosystem functioning by affecting the survival and
distribution of many commercially important marine species. A recent ocean heat
wave in 2011 occurred off Western Australia and caused unprecedented warming in
the southeast Indian Ocean. Understanding the causes and frequency of these
extreme warming events are of particular interest to societal and marine sectors
due to their adverse consequences. The frequency of Indian Ocean heat waves will
be addressed in collaboration with Dr. Matthew England from the University of
New South Wales in Australia. This project will use a unique combination of
statistical and state-of-the-art climate models to quantify changes in the
frequency of ocean heat waves in relation to the decadal variability of the El
Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Dr. England is a noted climate expert in this
region and has made significant contributions towards understanding the
variability of SST in the Indian Ocean. This project will model El Niño
teleconnection patterns in the equatorial Pacific with the spatial extent of
extreme warming events in the Indian Ocean using Bayesian statistics coupled
with global circulation model experiments. Much of the variance in Indian Ocean
SST can be explained by ENSO-induced teleconnection patterns that manifest in
the tropical Pacific Ocean. This suggests that Indian Ocean heat waves are not
stochastic phenomena, but are rather modulated by a forced response due to ENSO.
The transient interactions between ENSO teleconnections and extreme SST in the
Indian Ocean are not completely understood, and the emergence of new, coupled
climate models justifies the need for examining changes in climate variability
and extreme oceanographic events. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.
