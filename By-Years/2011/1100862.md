This award provides continued support for the hadron collider-physics program of
the experimental high-energy physics group at Johns Hopkins University, Morris
Swartz - PI, for a three-year period. The intellectual merit follows from the
new era of discovery and understanding which has and will continue to progress
in the field of particle physics. The group will conduct a program of
experimental particle physics research primarily within the CMS experiment at
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The scientific goals of the program are to
determine the source of spontaneous symmetry breaking and to significantly
constrain models of physics beyond the Standard Model. The proposed research
builds on technical innovations and expertise that it has developed over a
number of years. The technical innovations will also assist other CMS research
that makes use of b-tagging or the reconstruction of highly boosted final
states. The broader impact builds on these technical innovations in the area of
distributed databases and simulations on the Open Science Grid most notably in
the fields of astronomy and the life sciences. In addition, there is a strong
educational component through QuarkNet and annual Physics Fairs which especially
benefit underrepresented groups in the Baltimore area.
