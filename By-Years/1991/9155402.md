This proposal provides a plan for the enhancement of the scientific skills of
outstanding middle school teachers of grades 7 and 8 in physical science. These
teachers will later assist in improving the teaching practices of their less
experienced colleagues through the development of Science Teacher Leaders
Resource Teams. Direct participation will involve 182 middle school teachers. A
major objective of the project is to provide staff development for science
resource teachers that includes sequenced courses on key scientific concepts,
principles, and ways of thinking; directed research in scientific problem-
solving; and classroom practice in science, especially content-based inquiry
science. Cost sharing is equivalent to 22% of the NSF award.
