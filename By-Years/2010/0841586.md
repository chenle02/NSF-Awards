0841586&lt;br/&gt;Clyde&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
a new generation 2-G superconducting rock magnetometer with pulsed tube
cryocooler that does not require liquid He, a magnetic susceptometer, and core
drill by the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of New Hampshire.
The SRM and other paleomagnetic equipment will support PI research on the
evolution of mammals in response to changes in climate and tectonics. PI
research relies on magnetostratigraphic correlation of polarity reversals across
spatially distributed cores, some with vertebrate fossil bearing sections,
others without, some continental, others marine. Environmental proxies recorded
in cores allow inferences regarding the effects of regional and/or global
climate change and related tectonics on biological evolution. Studies of the
evolution of mammals on the North American continent as recorded in
Paleocene/Eocene fossils of the Big Horn Basin, studies of the synchroneity of
Paleocene/Eocene land mammal evolution between North America and Asia, and
studies of the effects of Himalayan uplift on biologic evolution will all
benefit from the requested SRM. PI studies will involve significant U.S.
academic and foreign collaborations and student
involvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
