Three workshops are designed for women in cogntive science, especially those
women in the early stages of their academic career. The workshops focus on the
grant writing process and will take place at the Psychonomic Society, the
Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Psychological Science. The
workshops will take the form of a public forum with invited speaker-panelists to
initiate discussion about best practices for the professional advancement of
women in cognitive science at the individual and institutional level. By
partnering with these established societies, the workshops will maximize the
outreach potential to a group that continues to be underrepresented in senior
academic positions in the cognitive sciences.
