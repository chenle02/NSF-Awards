9712925 Sanders This project represents a collaborative effort between Dr.
Sanders and Dr. Mullen of the University of Arizona (ATM-9714397). It involves
an investigation of the impact of initial data uncertainty and model error on,
and the usefulness of ensemble forecasting techniques for, medium range (3-5
day) prediction of explosive cyclogenesis. The principals investigators are
employing fields from a long-term climate simulation with NCAR's Community
Climate Model (CCM2) as well as analyses and operational forecasts of a classic
case of explosive cyclogenesis which was observed during the Experiment on
Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA) project. Critical issues
to be explored include the design of initial perturbations, the minimum number
of members for the ensemble and the minimum resolution required for ensemble
forecast purposes. The results of this research could be of enormous practical
benefit to operational weather forecasting.
