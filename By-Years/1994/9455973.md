9455973 Boyce During the past five years Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has
taken several major steps to modernize the content of elementary courses in
mathematics, science, and engineering, and to bring contemporary computing
technology into widespread use in the instruction of these courses. Two specific
directions are being proposed. The first is to enrich the instruction in courses
in all of these areas by preparing application modules in science and
engineering for use in mathematics courses, and mathematical modules for use in
science and engineering courses. The goal in both these cases is to forge closer
links between instruction in mathematics on the one hand and in engineering and
science on the other. In this way students will see mathematics developed more
closely in the context of applications that are of interest to them. The second
major direction of proposed work is to expand as rapidly as possible the use of
a mode of instruction known locally as studio courses. In this type of course
all class meetings take place in the same room, and the distinction among
lectures, recitations, and laboratories is essentially eliminated.
