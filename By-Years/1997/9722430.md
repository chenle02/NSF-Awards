Abrell 9722430 This award supports a 24 month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Leif Abrell at the Department of
Marine Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan. Dr. Abrell will work
with Dr. Tatsuo Higa, Professor of Marine Chemistry, on a research project
entitled, "An Investigation of Interesting Minor Bioactive Constituents from
Nonconspicuous Okinawan Marine Organisms." Biomedicine has recently been the
major driving force for the chemical inveqtigation of marine sponges and
invertebrates. Pharmacologists, physiologists, and biochemists have shown that
many of these natural products posses properties that modify fundamental life
processes in ways that have important biomedical applications. These molecules
are the leads that the pharmaceutical and chemical industries have begun to
focus on as templates for development of the drugs for the future. The first
compounds reported from these organisms were usually the major constituents and
were isolated in yields large enough to provide sufficient sample size for
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The evolution of tools available to natural
products chemists including molecule separation technologies and high field NMR
instruments for solving the structures of miniature samples now warrants a
deeper and more meticulous look at sample extracts for bioactive constituents.
The proposed research will: 1) collect bioactive extracts from various marine
invertebrate species (sponges, tunicates, and coelenterates); 2) subject the
extracts to bioassay guided solvent partitioning and chromatographic
fractionation to purify active components, and; 3) characterize the structures
and stereochemistry of bioactive compounds. Emphasis in the proposed research
will be placed on compounds which posses potency in bioactivity screens such as
cancer cell lines, viruses including HIV-1, and cancer cell enzymes such as
topoisomerase I and II and DNA polymerase. * **
