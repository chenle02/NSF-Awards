The focus of the research effort is the use of enone-initiated, nickel-catalyzed
carbocyclization reactions to afford highly functionalized, complex products
from simple, readily available substrates. The methodology will be applied to
the synthesis of the cis-fused (3.2.0) bicyclooctane framework of caracyclin,
the tricyclic ring skeleton of pentalenic acid and the exocyclic, trisubstituted
alkenes of geissoschizine and Z-isositsirikine. The educational plan includes
outreach efforts to Detroit schools, the introduction of molecular modeling and
on-line searching to undergraduate courses, course development at the graduate
level and collaborative graduate training with top scientists at Parke-Davis.
With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research
and educational activities of Dr. John Montgomery of the Department of Chemistry
at Wayne State University. Professor Montgomery will focus his research efforts
on drawing together nickel- promoted conjugate additions with meta-mediated
cyclizations as the basis for a new cyclization protocol that will result in the
construction of the complex ring systems that occur in natural products. The
educational plan includes innovative teaching approaches in chemistry at the
high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.
