With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Infrastructure and Facilities programs, Professor YuHuang Wang from the
University of Maryland College Park and colleagues Janice Reutt-Robey, Lawrence
Sita, Chunsheng Wang and Liangbing Hu have acquired an atomic force microscope
system. In an AFM a laser beam is directed to a surface by means of a cantilever
and tip. As the cantilever is displaced by interacting with the surface, a
reflection of the laser beam is displayed on a detector (photodiode). In this
way an image of the surface can be created with the aid of an electronic system.
In general, an AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, imaging, and
manipulation. The microscope is an important tool in the investigation of the
surfaces of materials. It is used in fundamental and applied research to study
morphology of surfaces, surface imaging and functionalization, electrical,
magnetic, chemical and mechanical properties of surfaces. This knowledge enables
advances in developing better materials in fields such as nanoscience and energy
science. The instrument is used in the research and training of undergraduate
and graduate students preparing them for technical careers and opportunities for
advanced education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) studying nanoparticle
transport and internalization at model interfaces, (b) probing quantum defects
in low-dimensional carbon materials, (c) mapping peak current and peak force of
carbon nanoparticles in covetics, (d) imaging small circuits on glass, (e)
studying living polymerization and direct assembly of precision polyolefins, (f)
assessing the integrity and stability of xeolite membranes, (g) understanding
and tailoring designing of solid state interphases for nanostructured silicon
electrodes and (h) studying solid electrode interface formation, structure and
evolution of molybdenum disulfide.
