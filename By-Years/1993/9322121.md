9322121 Chapman Dr. Chapman and his colleagues will carry out an integrated
theoretical and observational research program to understand the size
distribution of the fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The impacts of comet
fragments onto Jupiter provide a unique opportunity to search, observationally,
for smaller fragments in the size range tens to hundreds of meters. These
investigators will use CCD photometry of reflected light from the bolide and
fireball phases as measured on the inner Galilean satellites. They expect to
detect events due to impactors several hundred meters in diameter, and perhaps
down to several tens of meters. Theoretically the group plans to study whether
the visible size distribution of fragments represents the primordial size
distribution of cometesimals, reflecting cosmogenic processes, or instead
reflects attributes of the tidal disruption process itself.
