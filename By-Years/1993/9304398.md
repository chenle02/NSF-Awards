9304398 LUND, Steven P. Recent global geomagnetic field models provide detailed
pictures of the geomagnetic field, both at Earth's surface and at the core-
mantle boundary. However, because of the short time spanned by the historical
data that contribute to these models, they only sample a tiny fraction of the
variability known to occur in the geomagnetic field. This project is to extend
the time period over which global field models are available using time series
of paleomagnetic data derived from archeological artifacts and sediment. A
limited number of high quality data sets exist spanning the past 3000 years, and
these will be compiled and carefully assessed.
