Climate changes have an impact on the faunal and floral remains in marine
sediments. The variation in the organic chemistry of these sedimentary remains
then, can be used as indices of the fauna and flora and the climate in which
these organisms lived. This project will examine a large number of samples from
the varved sediments of the Santa Barbara and Guaymas Basins for alkenone and
dinosterol content. The unsaturation ratio of the alkenones will be used to
address temperature fluctuations and the dinosterol content will be used to
assess the dinoflagellate bloom conditions associated with El Ninyo (El Nino)
events. The samples have been chosen to optimize the expected temporal
variations and to insure preservation of the organic signals in varved
sediments. This research will provide unique information about the plankton
productivity and temperature variations associated with short term El Ninyo
events.
