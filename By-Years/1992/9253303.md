The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) will host a project designed to
improve the teaching of science at the middle school. This is a one year project
that will start in March, 1993 and provide middle school teachers the
opportunity to update their content knowledge in environmental science during a
three week summer institute. Following the institute, the participants will
spend another three weeks as a laboratory intern working with a scientist at an
industrial site. Following this summer institute/internship, teachers will
prepare lessons during the school year with the help of NJIT faculty and their
industrial mentors. The cost-share of the project will be approximately 50%.
