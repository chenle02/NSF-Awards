Dr. Stephen E. Johnson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Johnson's doctoral degree was from the University of
Massachusetts under the supervision of Professor Robert Holmes. Dr. Johnson
intends to continue research at UCLA under the sponsorship of Professor M.
Frederick Hawthorne. Dr. Johnson's area of training and research will be
structural, spectroscopic and theoretical studies of main-group rings, clusters
and hypervalent species. Specific research targets will be the synthesis,
catalytic and materials properties, and bioinorganic applications of multiply-
bonded boron systems. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
