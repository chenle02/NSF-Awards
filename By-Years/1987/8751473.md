The main goals of the project are to provide experienced mathematics teachers
at the middle and junior high school levels opportunities to immerse themselves
in the use of technology to explore and to teach mathematics, to prepare leaders
among the teachers who can communicate their technological knowledge to other
teachers, and to produce teaching materials built around the technology which
can be used for workshops as well as for student instruction. Twenty
participants are selected from among those recommended by the school districts
that have committed to the project. The participants take courses during the
summers 1988 and 1989 as well as during the academic year that deal with
investigations on mathematics and pedagogical topics, such as probability,
problem solving, geometry, and the development of curriculum materials. There is
also an interwoven strand of courses that emphasize technology-related topics,
such as computers in the classroom, using technology to teach instructional
computing research, using technology to teach mathematics, and problem solving
using computers.
