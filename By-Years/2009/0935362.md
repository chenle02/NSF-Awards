This project will investigate new strategies to enhance the participation of
chemistry faculty at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) in research supported
by the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation. The primary
activity of this award will be an annual workshop for faculty at these
institutions to help them to develop competitive proposals for programs in the
Chemistry Division. The overall goal is to cultivate research-active faculty at
these institutions -- institutions that are responsible for the training of
significant numbers of baccalaureate students from groups that have been
underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to maintain its
global competitiveness, the United States must work vigorously to tap neglected
pools of intellectual talent. Students from underrepresented groups are, by
definition, represented at lower rates than their fraction of the population. In
academia, large fractions of B.S. level chemists from underrepresented groups,
receive their training in minority-serving institutions, yet the funding for
research at these institutions is low. This award will support the efforts of
QEM to help faculty at these institutions develop competitive proposals for
submission. The hope is to create a critical mass of research-active faculty at
these institutions to guarantee that graduates from these institutions receive
excellent training in modern chemical research.
