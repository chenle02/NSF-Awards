9311884 Seligman This project supports research in algebra. One of the principal
investigators will work on the realization of finite groups as Galois groups of
extensions of specified fields. The other principal investigator will study the
internal structure of simple Lie algebras in prime charateristic, where the
ground field is assumed algebraically closed and over general fields of
characteristic zero. The majority of the support is for graduate students
working with the principal investigators. This award supports research in two
areas of algebra -- finite group theory and the theory of Lie algebras. A group
is an algebraic object with a single operation defined on it. It has important
applications in mathematics, chemistry, computer science and physics. Lie
algebras arise from another object called a Lie group. An example of a Lie group
is the rotations of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another. Lie
groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of spherical
motion. ***
