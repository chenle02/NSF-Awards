This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfields of
separations science and supercritical fluids. During the twelve month period
beginning 1 May 1989, Professor Olesik will undertake a series of high
resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments in which she will
investigate the molecular interactions between reverse micelles and solute
molecules in supercritical fluids. Specifically, she will determine various
properties of the AOT reverse micelle system and explore the behavior of solutes
in both nonpolar liquids and supercritical fluids at pressures above 5,000 psi.
This Career Advancement Award will enable Professor Olesik to expand her
research capabilities to include the use of high resolution NMR as a molecular
probe. The results of this research could impact broadly in various areas of
analytical chemistry, particularly in chromatography and mass spectrometry.
