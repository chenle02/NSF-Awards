With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Allegheny College will acquire a 300 MHz Fourier-
Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out studies on a) development of new methods for the
synthesis of sulfones; b) synthesis of natural products; c) study of active
centers in metalloproteins; d) development of models to predict the stability of
RNA structure from sequence; e) development of novel complexes to catalyze
oxidation reactions of biological, chemical and environmental relevance. This
instrument will be used for undergraduates in their research and also within the
curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of
areas including environmental chemistryand biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
