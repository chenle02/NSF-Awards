This project involves a grant for training in ethnographic research methods to
the department of anthropology at Northwestern University. The funds will be
used over a period of five years to insure that Ph.D. students in
social/cultural anthropology who take a specified course of study in scientific
research design and methodology have fieldwork experience before they begin
their Ph.D. research. This activity is important to insure that the training of
social scientists is as well-developed as possible, so that the new cohort of
social researchers will be capable of advancing our knowledge of contemporary
problems as well as of basic research issues.
