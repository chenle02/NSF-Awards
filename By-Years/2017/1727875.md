Nanocrystalline metals represent a class of high-strength engineering materials
with benefits for the electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries.
However, their applications have been limited by their thermal instability and a
lack of ductility. A strategy to address these limitations through thermo-
mechanical treatment has been developed. This award supports fundamental
research to understand the mechanisms that lead to improved ductility in
nanocrystalline metals through this processing. The research will enable the
development of sustainable bulk nanostructured metals with high strength and
ductility to withstand application in extreme environments such as high
temperatures and stresses. The work will also provide training to undergraduate
and graduate students to meet the future needs of computationally-driven
materials development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the research supported
by this award is to develop fundamental understanding of the cooperating and
competing deformation mechanisms in grain boundary complexion-engineered
nanocrystalline metals. It will elucidate their hierarchical contributions to
mechanical performance and establish their connection with the disordered state
of grain boundary complexion. This project will develop multi-scale modeling
approaches, drawing from atomistic, mesoscale dynamics, and continuum mechanics
simulations, utilizing kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm and finite element methods
to bridge time and length scales. The direct connection of the model with in-
situ neutron diffraction measurements will rigorously determine the dynamical
interplay of deformation and grain boundary structural evolution. The findings
of this project are expected to advance current knowledge of the underlying
mechanisms controlling behavior in these materials, and to inform their coupling
in the complex non-equilibrium metallic structures. The research results will
provide guidance to complexion engineering for the design of mechanically-
enhanced nanostructured metallic systems.
