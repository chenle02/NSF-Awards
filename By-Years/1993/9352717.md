9352717 Gilmore The project will acquire a GC and FTIR with plotters for the
undergraduate chemistry program. Laboratory experiences will be emphasized which
utilize the requested equipment to bridge theoretical concepts with practical
applications. A useful by-product will be student exposure to computer data
bases as well as an improved understanding of the FT function. . A greater
success in transfer student's adaptability to the four-year college laboratory
experience is a major objective of the improvements. In addition, district
science teachers will benefit from hands-on experiences in SSC sponsored
workshops.
