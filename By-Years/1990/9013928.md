This observational program in precision solar photometry at the Big Bear Solar
Observatory will make use of a unique, special-purpose solar disc photometer. A
new instrument called the solar disc photometer has recently been installed at
the Big Bear Solar Observatory. This instrument is capable of obtaining precise
relative photometric measurements across the solar distance with an accuracy of
one part in 10,000. The proposed research would analyze past data obtained with
this instrument in comparison with those obtained by the now defunct ACRIM
aboard the SMM satellite, and take data with an upgraded version of the
instrument through the current solar maximum period. Expected benefits include:
1) a better understanding of the solar cycle solar constant variations, as would
be gained by detailed measurements of the contribution from faculae, etc.; 2)
observing the polar magnetic field via a quantitative observation of polar
faculae; 3) possibly observing a thermal signature of global solar convection.
