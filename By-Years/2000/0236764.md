ABSTRACT William Hirts/Alexandru Cuc - 0236764 Why do families, colleagues, and
even nations come to remember the past in the same way? How do initially
discrepant memories come to converge on a single rendering of the past? Will
everyday conversations change people's memories so that a collective memory
emerges? And why do some memories spread across a group, while others remain
localized or disappear? With NSF support, under the supervision of Dr. William
Hirst, Alex Cuc addresses these critical issues for the study of collective
memory, focusing on the formation of collective memories in families. To a large
extent, researchers have failed to examine the effect of social structure on
memory, concentrating on universal mental mechanisms that serve as the
foundation for mnemonic processing. Mr. Cuc innovatively explores the
interaction between these well-understood mental mechanisms and the less
understood dynamics of conversation as he articulates the conditions under which
collective memories are formed through conversation. The intellectual merits of
the project stem primarily from the fresh insights Mr. Cuc offers about this
interaction and the rigorous methodology he develops to chart this interaction.
Broader impacts of the project include a better understanding of the formation
of collective memories, not just of families, but of any group, including
nations. This understanding serves as a foundation for exploring in the future
the way collective memories support group identity, be it family identity or
national identity.
