Gravitational Wave Astronomy promises to provide a revolutionary new view of the
universe that can probe previously unexplored regions, including the interiors
of neutron stars, collisions of black holes, which emit energy at luminosities
exceeding the entire visible universe, and even remnants of the big bang. To
gain new insight into the dynamics of the universe, gravitational wave
astronomers need to be able to infer the nature of the sources from the observed
signals. The physical parameters of these sources can be extracted from the
observed signals if the dependence of the waveform on source parameters is known
to sufficiently high accuracy. The success of the gravitational wave astronomy
efforts therefore depends critically on advancements in Numerical Relativity,
especially now that aLIGO is online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goals
supported by this award are to produce waveforms for aLIGO source
parameterization efforts, and to model the remnant mass, spin, luminosity, and
gravitational recoil from highly-precessing spinning black hole binaries (BHBs)
in order to elucidate their distributions, and also how recoils affect the
distribution and growth of supermassive black holes. This research will also
complement other ongoing projects of the RIT group aimed at studying
electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to compact-object mergers and to model
accretion disk dynamics near supermassive black holes via the inclusion of
matter and EM fields in BHBs spacetimes.
