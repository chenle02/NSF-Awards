A recurrent theme in community ecology is that interspecific competition greatly
influences the distributions and abundances of vertebrate species in
communities, and that such competition can lead to extinctions of populations.
Terrestrial salamanders have been extensively studies to test theories about
competition, and interspecific competition appears to be intense among many
species. In eastern North America, widely distributed and abundant species
appear to be strong competitors. Weaker competitors appear to have limited
distributions and many such species are listed as threatened or endangered. This
research will examine the possibility of competitive interactions (particularly
interspecific territoriality) between seven species pairs of terrestrial
salamanders. Experiments in natural habitats will test hypotheses about intra-
and interspecific competition for space, and competitive release experiments
will test hypotheses concerning the intensity of competition. Laboratory
experiments will test hypotheses about intra- and interspecific combat tactics
during aggressive encounters, pheromonal communication, and capturing of food
resources. %%% In the eastern US, one widely distributed species interfaces with
three geographically isolated species. The three isolated species are considered
to be extinction prone as a consequence of severe interspecific competition for
territories from the widely distributed species. This research will provide
valuable field and laboratory experiments that will provide vital evidence
regarding factors leading to the frequently observed population decline of
amphibians, in general, and several species a salamanders, in particular.
