This research is supported by the NSF theoretical and computational chemistry
program. Coupled-cluster and density functional methods in molecular electronic
structure theory will be studied and compared to search for an ab-initio-
derived-functional for density functional theory. An improved scheme will be
explored for computing the triples perturbative correction in Brueckner doubles
theory. These computational methods will be applied to the study of transition
metal systems and combustion processes. In principle, the physical and chemical
properties of molecular systems can be obtained from either the many-body
wavefunction (traditional ab initio theory) or from the electronic charge
density (density functional theory). There presently exist highly developed
computer programs for applying either of these two theories to any of a wide
variety of chemical problems. Ab initio equations, particularly those of coupled
cluster theory, may require very heavy computations using supercomputers, but
these equations are firmly based on well established mathematical and physical
principles. The equations of density functional theory offer significant
computational advantages, but serious questions remain concerning the precise
form of these equations. The present comparative study of ab initio and density
functional methods attempts to develop improved computational methods for
molecular electronic structure computations which combine the strengths of these
two different formalisms. The development of such an improved density functional
theory is currently a hot topic in modern theoretical chemistry. A breakthrough
in this area will greatly extend the size of molecular systems for which
reliable theoretical predictions can be made using modern computers, and will
almost certainly find wide and immediate application. The proposed test
calculations on transition metal compounds constitute the initial steps toward
the rational design of new industrial catalysts.
