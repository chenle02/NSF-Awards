9404561 Brandon The principal investigator plans to study creation and
propagation of oscillations on a model for the evolution of phase transitions
(with a viscoelastic damping term), by considering solutions generated by a
convergent sequence of initial data. Fonseca, Lin, Rogers and the PI intend to
prove the convergence of a numerical scheme for solving a nonlocal variational
problem modelling one-dimensional mechanical phase transitions. Ma and the PI
plan to clarify (numerically first) the full picture for a nonlocal model for
ferromagnetic materials with (nonlocal) exchange energies that yield hysteresis.
The PI and Rogers are currently examining the stationary points of the
James/Kinderlehrer Terfanol model using a symbolic manipulator. The goal of this
work is to aid in the technical knowhow for shape memory alloys. The aim of the
first project is to help in the attempts to model the evolution of phase
transitions in these materials. There are a lot of problems in obtaining
numerical data for phase transitions, the hope in the second project is to help
in solving some of those problems.(The data already obtained is very promising.)
The work with Ma is intended to aid in constructing models that can predict the
behaviour of ferromagnetic materials. Finally, Rogers and the PI hope to gain
further insight into the aforementioned model for Terfanol and for
magnetostrictive materials in general.
