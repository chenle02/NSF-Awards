A circular dichroism spectrometer having far-ultraviolet capabilities will be
purchased as a shared instrument for research in biochemistry, organic chemistry
and inorganic chemistry. The spectrometer will be located in the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland Baltimore County campus
and will be shared among six major users, and three minor users. Of the major
users, five will be at UMBC and one will be at the University of Maryland
Medical School Department of Biological Chemistry. The proposed instrument will
serve primarily the needs of the UMBC campus which does not now have a suitable
instrument for most of this research. The research projects will be in peptide
and protein chemistry, biochemistry of complex carbohydrates, synthetic
nucleotides, nucleic acid chemistry and in metaloprotein chemistry.
