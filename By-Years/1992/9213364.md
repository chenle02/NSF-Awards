This research project has two central objectives. The first is to observe,
measure, and summarize the degree of change and continuity of a number of the
key attributes of the global political system from the Congress of Vienna (1816)
to the present day. The second is to ascertain the extent to which the
postulated mix of change and continuity is associated with fluctuations in the
incidence of international war. More specifically, is war more frequent or
severe prior to, during, or after periods of appreciable system change? There
are several schools of thought, none solidly substantiated by the evidence, but
on the basis of some tentative findings, historical recall, and deductive
reasoning, the working hypothesis in this study is that war tends to peak toward
the close of periods of relative stability in the system's basic configurations,
but produces in its wake a rapid and dramatic set of changes in the system. To
assess this, the major attributes of the political system (structural, cultural,
and material) will be specified, measured, and analyzed for direction and
magnitude of change, singly and in combination. The frequency and severity of
international war will also be measured over time in an effort to ascertain the
extent to which war increases after periods of system constancy/rigidity and
thus precedes and helps account for major system change, Thus, war, is seen
largely as a precursor and catalyst of system change rather than a consequence
of such change. This research continues the Correlates of War project begun by
the Principal Investigator which examines the incidence of war from 1816 to the
present.
