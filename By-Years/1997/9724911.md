9724911 Ferry This award supports a three year collaborative research project
between Professor David Ferry of Arizona State University and Professor Yuichi
Ochiai of Chiba University in Japan. The researchers will be exploring new
applications for nanostructures research. The objective of the collaboration is
to study the nature of quantum transport in nanodevices, in particular the
quantum dot structure as it will appear in nanodevices (as an "open" device and
not a tunneling device). They will investigate the nature in which the crossover
from classical to quantum transport occurs. Through studies of the phase
coherent lifetime, they will also investigate the conditions under which quantum
mechanical effects can be observed in realistic device structures. This project
brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary
expertise, research capabilities and equipment. The collaboration provides a
unique combination of experiment and theory. It is anticipated that these
studies will provide an important insight into those fundamental physical
principles which will determine the operation of future generations of room
temperature nanodevices. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this
project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
understanding and cooperation. ***
