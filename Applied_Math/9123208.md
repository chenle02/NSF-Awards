This project involves mathematical analysis and simulation of two models for
carrier transport. These are: the hydrodynamic model and the energy transport
model (the RT model,) both for conventional devices. Simulation of HFET devices,
a quantum hydrodynamic model, will also be carried out. The model provides for
tunneling effects in heterogenous structures, or compound semiconductors. The
algorithms to be employed for the two dimensional simulations are the
essentially non-oscillatory shock capturing algorithms, and projection methods.
The objective is to produce computer simulation of conventional semiconductor
devices, based upon different mathematical models, by use of new algorithms
developed during the last decade. A cutting edge type of diode, the so-called
tunnel diode, will be studied in terms of a quantum mechanical model.
