This award will support the research projects of a group of mathematicians
whose work centers around operator theory and operator algebras. Some of the
areas of investigation will be (i) multiplication operators on functional
Hilbert spaces, (ii) polynomial hyponormality using multivariable techniques,
(iii) construction of irreducible subfactors with index greater than four, (iv)
invariant theory, Schur-Weyl duality, and tensor product structure of quantum
groups at roots of unity, (v) dilation theory for algebras of operators and
covariant systems, (vi) one-parameter deformations of generalized commutation
relations, (vii) operator algebras generated by Toeplitz and singular integral
operators with random symbol, and (viii) coordinatization techniques to analyze
non-self-adjoint operator algebras. A central aspect of this research project is
an investigation of Hilbert space operators. These objects can be thought of as
infinite matrices of complex numbers but they often arise in a way more suited
to various applications. In the research projects of these investigators a
single operator is usually not the subject of study but rather large classes of
operators called algebras. The structure of such algebras is one of the most
intensively studied areas of mathematics.
