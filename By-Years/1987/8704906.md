This research project will investigate the individualization of land in
American Samoa, which is a consequence of social and economic changes following
World War II. Specifically, the researcher will analyze the legal aspects of
individual ownership in a society where communal land is protected by law,
understand the process of individualization, the reaction of conservative
individuals who call for a return to indigenous forms of land tenure, and the
affects of changes on family organization. This project will contribute to our
understanding of culture change by looking at a society and its traditional
structures as it is transformed on becoming part of the world economic system.
It will also contribute to our knowledge of the processes affecting land tenure
and the attitudes and values which accompany change. This research will make a
practical contribution as well as a theoretical contribution. Too little is
known about land tenure and the social consequences of programs of agricultural
and housing development. Since, the project will address world wide concerns of
land alienation and access to food resources, it will provide information for
policy development.
