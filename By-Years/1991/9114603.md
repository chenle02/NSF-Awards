Professor Rohrlich will work on several problems connected with the realization
of Galois representations of Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves. In
particular, whether certain irreducible Artin representations occur and if so
what are their multiplicities. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
