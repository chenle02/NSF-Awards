The main research objective of this work is to integrate meteorological
procedures for obtaining estimates of mean areal rainfall from satellite Visible
and InfraRed data with hydrological procedures and models for real-time flow
prediction. In particular the goal is to characterize flow-prediction errors
when using satellite rainfall estimates in the real-time prediction of
streamflows from large catchments. Uncertainty due to rainfall estimation errors
is explicitly taken into account and is propagated through the meteorological
and hydrological models and procedures to become uncertainty in the real-time
flow predictions. This is a joint project in which the satellite data analysis
will be performed at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the hydrological
part will be performed at the University of Iowa. The results of this research
will benefit experts, administrators and other users because the developed
methods for integrating rainfall satellite data and hydrologic data will be used
in predicting flows in real-time and thus, the quality of real-time flood
prediction will be enhanced.
