Dr. Goo has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. He has been
very active in the fields of ceramics, metals, and electronic materials, and has
made significant contributions in all these areas. The research being supported
is the investigation of structure-property relationships in various ceramic
materials and metal alloys. These include ordered alloys, perovskites, and oxide
varistor materials. The research will employ analytical techniques including
optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray
diffraction to characterize material structures, and effects such as ordering,
twinning and phase transformations. The research in this grant will have impact
on the understanding of the fundamental basis for various properties of metals
and ceramics, with benefit to a wide range of technologies.
