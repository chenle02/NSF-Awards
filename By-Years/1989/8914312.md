Nomadic Turkana pastoralists of northwest Kenya have been studied for a number
of years as part of a multidisciplinary project concerning the people and their
ecosystem. Among the most interesting components of the human studies is the
demography of the Turkana; although they inhabit an extremely harsh environment
sufficient to impact health and reproduction, the Turkana experience an
unusually high fertility level for nomadic populations, with a very marked
seasonal distribution of births. Recent studies, finding extremely high rates of
infant and childhood mortality, suggest that the fertility pattern may largely
be explained by the pattern and level of mortality. The research proposed here
is designed to examine the pattern of morbidity and mortality among infants and
children, and to identify determinants of observed patterns. Traditional
demographic studies of the causes of morbidity and mortality have emphasized
correlations among socioeconomic factors, such as household size, and risk of
disease and death, and have largely ignored underlying biological processes.
This study will employ recently developed immunological techniques to measure
precisely the effect of nutrition and infection on human health and survival,
and will link these factors to analyses of sociocultural predictors of risk of
disease and death. The results of this work will contribute to our understanding
of micro-level causes of morbidity and mortality, and will facilitate the
development of a unified biological and demographic approach to the study of
child survival.
