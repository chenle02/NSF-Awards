This project will study the development and use of mathematics discourse as a
function of the cultural activities in which students participate at home, in
their local community, in the larger community, and at school. This study would
extend work by prior researchers by investigating the influence of culture and
socioeconomic status (SES) on the discourse practices developed by people to
deal with concepts such as measuring, counting, predicting, comparing, and
contrasting as related to a range of activities. Also in contrast to similar
work by others, this research will focus on analyzing actual activities rather
than participants' later descriptions of those activities. The results of this
research will inform efforts to understand cultural and SES differences in
mathematics achievement and to provide equal mathematics learning opportunities
for all students.
