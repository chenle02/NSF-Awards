Chui DMS- 9406935 This grant is to support an international conference on
Approximation Theory and Related Interdisciplinary Topics at Texas A&amp;M
University. The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers
from various areas closely related to approximation theory. These include
Computational Mathematics, Computer-Aided Design, Harmonic Analysis, Statistics,
and Wavelet Analysis. The conference will also feature awarding of the newly
created Vasil A. Popov Prize in Approximation Theory. Approximation theory
centers on the problem of finding mathematical models for naturally occurring
phenomenon. This ranges form the synthesis and analysis of discrete data to
computer assisted modeling of ontinuous phenomenon, and uses techniques from
several branches of mathematics.
