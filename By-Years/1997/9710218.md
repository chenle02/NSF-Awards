This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is
supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities. It focuses on interaction between Wake Forest
University and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in both research and
education. Students enrolled in the Instrumental Analysis course at Wake Forest
will perform six of their experiments at the Company laboratories using
equipment not available at the University. Directed by Professor Bradley T.
Jones, graduate students will hold six month intern positions at the Company to
learn the use of instrumentation, serve as teaching assistants for the course
experiments conducted at the Company, and carry out research projects in diverse
areas of Analytical Chemistry. One of these projects is to investigate trace
metal determination in natural waters by extraction onto solid phase disks
followed by x-ray fluorescent spectroscopy for the measurement step. Professor
Bradley Jones of Wake Forest University and staff scientists of the inorganic
spectroscopy laboratory of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will cooperate on
experiments for the Instrumental Analysis course at Wake Forest using facilities
and equipment at both the University and the Company. In addition, graduate
student interns will be placed at the Company for six month terms to learn
equipment operation in depth and pursue research on projects of mutual interest
to the principle investigator and the Company. These involve areas such as trace
metal determination in natural waters, and interferences in spectroscopic
measurements occurring with biological samples.
