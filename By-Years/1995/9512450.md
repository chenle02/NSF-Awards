ABSTRACT Kirti N. Ghia Univ. of Cincinnati Proposal No. CTS-9512450 The
Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics and the Department
of Mechanical, Industrial and Nuclear Engineering at the University of
Cincinnati will purchase Silicon Graphics high-performance graphics computer
systems, which will be dedicated to support research activities of faculty in
computational fluid dynamics and thermal sciences and the scholarly pursuits of
graduate students. The proposed instrumentation will be used in projects for
studying fundamental flow physics of high-Reynolds number flow phenomena, namely
general instabilities, transition, turbulence and chaos, using large-eddy and
direct numerical simulations, as well as applied engineering problems such as
pressure distortions on an engine fan plane on a subsonic inlet in presence of
cross-wind. It will also be used for interdisciplinary research involving
problems in areas of fluid dynamics, flight mechanics and structural mechanics,
such as maneuvering body and aeroelasticity problems.
