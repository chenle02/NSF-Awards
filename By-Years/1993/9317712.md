support of a gravity and bathymetric survey of the western Arctic Ocean basin
that will be conducted from a US Navy nuclear powered submarine. The Arctic
Ocean basin is the least explored of all the world's ocean basins. Geophysical
work has been limited to a few aerogeophysical surveys, occasional icebreaker
cruises, and to work from drifting ice islands. This project represents a unique
opportunity to investigate the structure of the Canada and Makarov Basins, the
Chukchi Plateau, and the Alpha, Mendeleyev, and Lomono sov Ridges. The
objectives of this work are to precisely locate the boundary between the
Eurasian and North American plates, to constrain the tectonic models for rifted
margin development of the Lomonosov Ridge, and to constrain models for the
development of the Alpha Mendeleyev Ridge between the Canada and Makarov Basins.
