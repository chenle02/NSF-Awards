The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place just before
the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming
Languages (POPL 2013), which is being held in Rome Italy. This grant will
support 15 or more students to attend the PLMW event plus the POPL conference.
While there is other funding available, this grant is intended specifically to
increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups and gives priority
to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader impacts of the grant relate
to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to
receive mentoring from top members of the programming languages community, and
build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this
important research arena.
