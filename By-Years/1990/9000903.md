The color variation evident in deep sea sediments has the potential to provide
important information on accumulation rates of sedimentary materials. The
present project will develop and test a new technique for analyzing these color
variations in terms of sedimentary cycles using image analysis of deep sea
cores. Color variations will be related to chemical and mineralogical changes in
the cores and the results of this study will be compared to other analyses on
the cores. The ultimate objective of the project is to develop a rapid technique
for establishing age in cores that are dominated by consistent sedimentary
cycles. The project will be undertaken by promising recent graduate who has
rapidly developed her reputation in marine studies.
