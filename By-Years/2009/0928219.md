The proposed research designs new biomaterials to guide the long-range
directional migration of attached mammalian cells in three dimensions. Like one-
way signs, the patterned microarrays and/or microchannels impose directionality
on cell movement and simultaneously guide the migration of cells over tailored
paths. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of biomaterials
capable of guiding cell movement in three dimensions using asymmetric
microchannel networks. To overcome the two dimensional nature of micropatterns,
investigations of a topographic implementation utilizing continuous channels to
guide cell migration and direct cell assembly are proposed. Design guidelines
will be established for maximizing migration speeds while maintaining
directionality in microchannels to set the foundation for a next generation of
biomaterials capable of directing cell migration along three-dimensional complex
paths.

The broader impact of this project includes training undergraduate and graduate
students in biology, biophysics of cell motility, microfabrication techniques,
and polymer/biomaterial synthesis. As a woman, the PI has and will continue to
make special efforts to recruit women and other under-represented groups to
pursue advanced studies in science and participate in undergraduate research
that sparks creativity. The proposed research itself promises broad impact of
new biomaterials capable of assembling multiple cell types for fundamental
biological studies, wound healing, or tissue engineering applications.
