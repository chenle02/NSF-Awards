The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
project involves cross-disciplinary applications of instrumented indentation to
the investigation of elastic-plastic deformation in a number of inorganic and
biological materials systems of increasing visibility and fundamental importance
to the engineering and physiological communities, and spanning nano- to macro-
scopic size scales. The power of indentation as a scientific tool lies primarily
in its experimental simplicity, due to the minimal specimen preparation
involved. However, interpretation of results is non-trivial and key to
successful analysis are sufficient analytical modeling and supplementary
observation. In this plan, indentation will be used to develop constitutive
behavior of three 'testbed' systems: i) rapidly quenched small-volume structures
on substrates, ii) carbon nanotube arrays on substrates, and iii) lung
parenchyma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Academic, industrial and/or clinical
collaborators have been identified to add perspective and disseminate
information. Efforts are planned to develop new interdisciplinary research
courses for university, and practical and pre-collegiate training programs for
K-12 students.
