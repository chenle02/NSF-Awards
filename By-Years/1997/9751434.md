The curriculum in psychology has traditionally enjoyed a heavy emphasis on
faculty student interaction. However, the laboratories have not kept pace with
the state of the field. This project is broadening the emphasis on interactive
learning while enabling students to explore issues which are topical and
current. Through the introduction of an eye-movement laboratory, the laboratory
components in cognitive, sensation and perception, social psychology, industrial
psychology, health psychology, and human factors are all being dramatically
enhanced while the year-long introductory course is being greatly improved. This
equipment is having an exciting effect on student faculty collaborative
research, as well as the Senior Research Thesis requirement, by opening up
concepts and techniques that were previously inaccessible. *
