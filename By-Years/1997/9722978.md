9722978 Bradford Seed germination is a critical developmental transition in the
plant life cycle. While seeds are generally quite tolerant of environmental
stresses, seedlings are highly vulnerable to extremes of temperature or water
availability. Considering that our understanding of the molecular events that
lead to germination is scant, the work proposed here is designed to provide
molecular markers for seed germination. One obstacle to a better understanding
is that seeds, even from a genetically uniform background, germinate at
different times. The work will study the mechanisms that lead to this
heterogeneity using the expression of GFP reporters under the control of
promoters for germination-specific genes which are available. Not only will the
pattern of expression be monitored, the reporter protein will be used to select
stages of germination. Additionally, the influence of plant growth regulators on
the activity of these promoters in seeds with different degree of dormancy or
germination will be studied. The application of results from this work for the
agronomically important trait germination is obvious.
