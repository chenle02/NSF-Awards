9707702 Verona The Maryland Virtual High School Core Models Project will guide
Maryland secondary science and mathematics teachers in implementing
computational science and modeling activities in their classrooms to support
systemic mathematics and science reform efforts as specified in the Maryland
Core Goal. The CoreModels Project will identify and adapt modeling materials
consistent with the Core Goals, establish three regional centers to support the
implementation of the activities, and work with the Maryland State Department of
Education to measure the effectiveness of computational activities in helping
students achieve these objectives. Each regional center will be directed and
supported by teachers who are experienced in using computational modeling in the
classroom and in leading inservice efforts. ***
