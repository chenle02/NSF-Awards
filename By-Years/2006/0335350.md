Abstract Blackadar

The proposal is for partial support of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar
(WCOAS). The planned WCOAS conference is a continuation of a conference series
on operator algebras and noncommutative geometry with focus on participants from
the western states. The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together
graduate students, young investigators, and more senior researchers. The program
features plenary talks by eminent mathematicians, with parallel sessions of
contributed papers by younger participants. The funding will be used primarily
for the travel support of graduate students and young PhDs.
