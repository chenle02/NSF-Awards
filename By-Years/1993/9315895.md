Waterbury 9315895 Previous studies by this investigator have confirmed that the
presence of a diverse group of marine cyanobacterial phages that are capable of
infecting Synechococcus and that they can occur at extremely high titers of 104
phage particles per milliliter. In addition, Waterbury has shown that a natural
bacterial population and its phages follow the patterns predicted from modeling
and chemostat studies of E. coli and its virulent phages. Thus, Waterbury
hypothesizes that due to the acquisition of resistance, virulent Synechococcus
phages play an important role in determining the clonal composition of natural
Synechococcus populations, but that they have little effect on the overall
population densities or mortality. To test this hypothesis, a laboratory project
is designed to develop ribonucleic acid and antibody probes to follow the
species dynamics of Synechococcus and its phages, respectively. This host-
parasite system will prove to be an excellent model to examine the role of
bacteriophages in the oceans. ***
