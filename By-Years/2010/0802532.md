This project is using an experienced team of curriculum developers from Concord
Consortium, a community college with technical programs, and three ATE Centers
to develop 16 field-tested, interactive, model- and computer-based learning
units on electron properties and behavior. These learning units are useful in a
wide range of technical courses such as photonics, electronics, material
science, biotechnology, design of advanced materials, and chemical and
engineering technology as well as in the core science content courses. The
project is using a broad set of formative and summative assessments to improve
the effectiveness of the learning units. The intellectual merit rests in the
project's (1) focus on developing materials for a broad set of difficult,
electron-related concepts, (2) use of research findings in science education,
cognitive science, and educational technology in that development, and (3) team
of scientists, researchers, educators, innovators, and industry representatives
who are leaders in atomic-scale modeling and activity development. The broader
impact emerges from the potential and adaptability of the curricular materials
along with their accompanying professional development courses and workshop
curricula. This impact is also found in the dissemination of these materials
though a public, online data base with broad national reach as well as through
other online libraries.
