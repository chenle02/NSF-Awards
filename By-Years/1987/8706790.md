This ia a proposal for continuation of ongoing research examining the synaptic
circuitry in the mature (Study I) and developing (Study II) rat striatum. The
objectives in Study I are to determine the synaptic relationships between: (1)
dopaminergic afferents from the substantia nigra and intrinsic striatal neurons
containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), opioid peptides (Met-and Leu-
enkephalin), and acetylcholine; (2) cholinergic neurons and medium spiny neurons
containing GABA or opioid peptides; (3) cortical afferents and neurons
containing one or more of the three intrinsic transmitters. The major aims in
Study II are to determine whether removal of dopaminergic afferents by
6-hydroxdopamine in the early postnatal period alters the regional densities of
immunoreactivity for transmitters in intrinsic neurons; the density or
distribution of cortical afferents; or the ultrastructural morphology of targets
neurons or terminals in the mature striatum. The primary method to be used in
these studies is electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with peroxidase, and
radio-iodinated markers for identification of one or more antigens in single
sections of tissue. The results from the two studies should be complimentary and
broaden our knowledge of interactions between three major types of intrinsic
striatal neurons and their synaptic relation to dopaminergic and cortical
afferents. This information is important for further understanding the etiology
and for developing improved therapeutic measures for a number of movement
disorders including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea.
