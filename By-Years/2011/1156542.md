This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program in Physics at William Marsh Rice University. The award will
support students for ten weeks of summer research in topics potentially
including chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, chemical engineering,
materials science, and bioengineering. Each student becomes involved in cutting-
edge research by joining an individual research group and working with graduate
students, postdocs and faculty supervisors. The students will form a cohesive
group through joint housing, weekly interdisciplinary scientific seminars, and
weekly social activities. These activities also include laboratory safety
training and participation in an online course in ethical and responsible
scientific conduct. In mid-session, the students will present brief computer
presentations of their work to each other and the PI. In the seventh week,
students will construct abstracts for their projects. During the last week
students will turn in written reports, design and assemble poster presentations
on their research, then present their posters alongside the other undergraduate
participants in an extremely well-attended session of the Annual RQI Colloquium.
There will also be a lunch meeting with faculty from various disciplines to
discuss strategies for graduate school, the admissions process, and other
professional/technical career options.
