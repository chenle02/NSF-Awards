This planning grant seeks support for examination of Upper Triassic and Lower
Jurassic rocks from Baja California to document the location of the
Triassic/Jurassic boundary, illuminate issues of terrane provenance, and
calibrate zonations with those of other fossil groups. Research will provide PI
with first independent NSF support and allow her to resume a research career
interrupted by several years with industry and other activities. Proposed work
will increase her competitiveness with subsequent proposals.
