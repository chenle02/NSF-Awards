9605155 Burris This summer program is designed to take advantage of the rich
diversity of research and of educational opportunities at the Marine Biological
Laboratory (MBL) in the use of marine organisms in the areas of cell and
developmental biology, and neurobiology. Undergraduate students will be chosen
from applicants recruited from throughout the country. They will be selected on
the basis of their academic credentials and their potential to benefit from an
intensive research experience. Each student will be directed in an independent
research project by a faculty mentor who is an investigator at the MBL. Students
will also attend selected lectures and seminars, group discussions directed by
faculty mentors, and the program's own seminar series in which selected MBL
researchers discuss the value of different marine models in specific areas of
biological investigation. Students will have the opportunity to interact with
leading scientists from throughout the world, to be introduced to the latest
research technologies, and to experience first-hand the intensity, enthusiasm,
and excitement for which the MBL summer experience is well known.
