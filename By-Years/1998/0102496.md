Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PROJECT ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of this project are to develop
nonsmooth &lt;br/&gt;analysis for semicontinuous functions and multivalued
mappings &lt;br/&gt;on smooth manifolds and to apply these new analytical
techniques &lt;br/&gt;to a variety of optimization and control problems.
Examples &lt;br/&gt;of nonsmooth (nondifferentiable) functions on manifolds are
&lt;br/&gt;provided by the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix on the
&lt;br/&gt;manifold of symmetric matrices, the Riemannian metric and
&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian distance functions on Riemannian manifold, control
&lt;br/&gt;Lyapunov functions for stabilization of control systems on
&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and optimal value functions for optimal control
&lt;br/&gt;problems. The major directions for research are the following:
&lt;br/&gt;(i) subdifferential(infinitesimal) calculus for nonsmooth
&lt;br/&gt;functions on smooth manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) applications of
subdifferential calculus to optimization &lt;br/&gt;problems on smooth
manifolds; &lt;br/&gt;(iii) applications of subdifferential calculus to the
study &lt;br/&gt;of invariance of closed sets and monotonicity of semicontinuous
&lt;br/&gt;functions with respect to solutions of differential inclusions
&lt;br/&gt;on manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) applications of these results to the
study of generalized &lt;br/&gt;solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations on
manifolds; &lt;br/&gt;(v) applications to the derivation of optimality
conditions &lt;br/&gt;for general nonsmooth control problems on manifolds;
&lt;br/&gt;(vi) applications of subdifferential calculus for
constructing&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous optimal and stabilizing feedback controls
using &lt;br/&gt;nonsmooth optimal value and control Lyapunov
functions;&lt;br/&gt;(vii) the study of interior point methods in semistable and
&lt;br/&gt;semidefinite programmings via discontinuous feedback techniques
&lt;br/&gt;and the study of generalized gradient flows on
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design of high-performance feedback controls for
nonlinear systems &lt;br/&gt;whose mathematical models include manifolds is an
active research &lt;br/&gt;area oriented to automotive, aerospace, and naval
applications. &lt;br/&gt;It has been recognized that, in general, control tasks
(such as &lt;br/&gt;stabilization or robust optimal control) for these systems
cannot &lt;br/&gt;be performed using traditional continuous feedback and require
&lt;br/&gt;discontinuous feedback. Since existing mathematical tools
&lt;br/&gt;(differential inclusion theory) have proved inadequate for
&lt;br/&gt;analysis of discontinuous feedback performance, this research
&lt;br/&gt;project is aimed at developing new analytical tools and techniques
&lt;br/&gt;for such analysis. But feedback control is not the only one research
&lt;br/&gt;field which will benefit from these new analytical tools. Other
&lt;br/&gt;fields of application for these research results include numerical
&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical optimization, in particular, a development
of&lt;br/&gt;robust numerical methods for new semistable and semidefinite
&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems, and generalized solutions of partial
&lt;br/&gt;differential equations on manifolds .&lt;br/&gt;
