The principal investigators will explore various variational criteria for the
existence and stability of equilibria and steady motions of mechanical systems
in contexts where traditional approaches do not exist or are not completely
understood. They will try to derive conditions under which formal instability
accurately predicts linear instability in the presence of very small damping.
Another objective is the development of a systematic approach to the stability
and bifurcation analysis of symmetric states in phase space. This award will
support research in the general area of dynamical systems. A process which is
very simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely complicated,
nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study of
this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best be modeled
using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence, complex
biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
