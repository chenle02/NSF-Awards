9404207 Loomis This project will give the proposer the opportunity to study
partial differential equations while visiting at the University of Houston.
Specifically, the well-posedness, approximation and long time behavior of
systems of equations whose components are dependent on nonlinear terms will be
investigated. These systems arise in a variety of physical and biological
contexts and present many challenging questions. Little work concerning
functionally dependent reaction diffusion systems appears in the liturature. The
project will address problems arising in the modeling of the historical
dependence of the nonlinearity and the persistence of nonnegativity of solution
components. ***
