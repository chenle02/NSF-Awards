A new approach for the teaching of microprocessor based systems beginning with
sophomore undergraduates is being developed. Concepts are stressed and a generic
view of both the programming and the electronic system aspects of the
microprocessor are promoted. The equipment, two Hewlett-Packard 64000
Microprocessor development systems, support the plan by providing the student
with an industrial strength tool having the ability to be used with many
microprocessor types. Its software development, logic analyzer, and
microprocessor emulation capabilities provide a holistic environment in which
the student can learn and develop systems. The comprehensive nature of the
environment is sufficient for all microprocessor-based course needs, sophomore
through senior level.
