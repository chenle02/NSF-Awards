A research program focusing on mathematical problems in matrix theory will be
supported through this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award. Eight
students will work under the supervision of seven faculty members, using
experimental and theoretical methods on a broad range of research topics. An
introduction to available sophisticated computing tools for mathematical
exploration in matrix analysis: MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple and GAUSS, will be
provided, along with access to a new computer laboratory. It is expected that
students will present their work at regional meetings of the Mathematical
Association of America. Research projects such as the approximation of functions
of matrices will be taken up. Here one considers interpolating polynomials of
complex functions and how the corresponding functions of matrices approximate
one another. Another area of investigation concerns the convergence of products
of matrices. For powers of a single matrix, the behavior of the sequence of its
powers is well known. When the terms of the product are selected from a finite
set of matrices, relatively little is known about convergence. Work will also be
done on the relationship of the spectrum of a matrix and its permanent. For
example, one would like to know the maximum permanent taken over all matrices
with a given spectrum. Other topics include extreme points of nonnegative
matrices, matrix equation and sign pattern matrices.
