Support is requested to purchase a new, high resolution scanning electron
microscope (SEM) for the Biological EM Facility (BEMF), a core facility which
provides state-of-the art electron microscopical instrumentation for all
biological researchers at the University of Hawaii. The BEMF currently operates
a ten- year-old Cambridge S150 SEM, the sole SEM dedicated to biological
research in the State of Hawaii, which has limited resolution (7 nm) and
increasingly expensive maintenance costs. The Cambridge S150 will be replaced
with the Hitachi S-8000 field emission electron microscope, an instrument with
high resolution (2 nm at accelerating voltages of 25kV), ease of operation and
low maintenance costs. The broad operating capabilities of this instrument and
the large specimens that can be accommodated are needed to support the wide
range of biological studies undertaken at the University. The high resolution
capability is required for studies of intracellular organization at the medial
range between that obtainable by regular scanning electron microscopy and the
high magnification obtainable by freeze-etching and transmission electron
microscopes. Examples of projects benefitting from the advanced capabilities of
this mew SEM will be the study of membrane dynamics and intracellular
organization in the endosome-phagosome-lysosome system of Paramecium, the native
state of intracellular organization of anhydrobiotic organisms, vector/virus
relationships of thrips and the control of plant viruses, the age determination
of fish by examination of the fine structure of growth increments of otoliths,
and the study of fossilized sea urchin tests and spines to determine rates of
evolution. This will be the only field emission SEM in the State of Hawaii and
will be available to all users on a cost- sharing basis. The University will
fund approximately 30% of the cost of the instrument.
