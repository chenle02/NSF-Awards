This proposal will support continuing leadership roles for the Indiana
University experimental nuclear physics group in three critical areas of basic
research: (1) understanding the contributions from the internal "sea" of gluons
and quark-antiquark pairs to the overall spin and magnetism of the proton and
neutron; (2) elucidating the properties of nuclear matter at extreme
temperatures, such as those believed to pertain during the earliest instants of
the universe's evolution following its Big Bang origin; (3) testing the ability
of the Standard Model of particle physics to account precisely for the
properties and interactions of low-energy neutrons and of neutrinos.
Measurements in category (1) will be made via two complementary techniques:
studies of spin-polarized proton beam collisions at high energy exploiting the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) facility and a major new addition to the
STAR detector at that facility just completed by the Indiana group; comparative
studies of neutrino-proton and neutrino-neutron scattering processes.
Experiments relevant to category (2) will also utilize RHIC, with focus on the
production in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions of mesons composed from a
heavy quark-antiquark pair, and on differences between the interactions of
quarks vs. gluons in the unique, hot matter produced in those collisions.
Studies of fundamental particle interactions will include: completion of an
ongoing experiment to confirm or refute a controversial signal for the
oscillation of neutrinos from one type to another, a signal that cannot be
easily accommodated in the emerging picture of neutrino states in nature;
dramatic advances in the state-of-the-art for tests of nature's nearly perfect
time-reversal symmetry, by exploiting innovative concepts to search for
forbidden electric interactions of the spin of an electron; improved
characterization of the normally masked weak interaction among neutrons and
protons via highly sensitive exposure of deviations from perfect mirror symmetry
in neutron-nucleus interactions and in nuclear structure. The proposed research
will also involve the development of innovative new technology for tracking
products from neutrino interactions and for producing beams of "ultra-cold"
neutrons for fundamental interaction experiments
