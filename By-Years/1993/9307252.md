Forest landscapes are increasingly fragmented. This project will explore an
important mechanism of forest response to this fragmentation. The objectives of
the proposed research are to 1) determine experimentally whether edges inhibit,
facilitate, or have no net effect on the exogenous control of forest interior
dynamics; and 2) to determine the specific mechanisms for the interaction
between forest edge and interior, and the surrounding landscape. The study uses
exotic species that are not common in forest interiors as indicators of external
influence, &amp; examines relevant processes, including seed input, seed
storage, seed and seedling survival, role of seedling predation, and role of
fine scale disturbances. %%% The interaction between forest islands and the
surrounding landscape may occur principally through forest edges. Yet, existing
research does not indicate how edges work to control the input and survival of
tree seedlings in the forest interior. Plant dispersal and plant-animal
interactions across forest edges play a key role in forest dynamics in
fragmented landscapes. The information will be relevant to management of forest
fragments, restoration and conservation of forests in fragmented landscapes, and
monitoring and compensating for the effects of global environmental change on
fragmented forests.
