Many diseases (acute and chronic) and human physiological conditions (such as
blood alcohol, oxygen, and glucose) need to be monitored continuously for timely
clinical intervention and personalized treatment. However, conventional blood-
based detection is invasive and prone to infection, and thus cannot be used for
continuous monitoring. Recently, it has been found that many vapors from exhaled
breath or transpiring from the skin reflect the conditions of various diseases
(such as diabetes, peripheral artery disease, etc.). Therefore, wearable vapor
sensors provide a completely non-invasive and continuous monitoring solution
that tremendously benefits the patients and the
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has recently demonstrated novel
graphene vapor sensor arrays that can be completely embedded in a micro-gas
chromatography column for rapid (&lt;0.1 s) and sensitive (~ppb) vapor
detection. A wearable, badge-sized micro-gas chromatography column system can
thus be made to collect and analyze vapors transpiring from the skin with on-
chip data processing and transmission capability. The proposed project will be
focused on the effort to commercialize the wearable micro-gas chromatography
column technology. The team has designed and fabricated such columns that can be
integrated with graphene sensor arrays seamlessly. The team has also tested the
graphene sensor's response time and sensitivity and showed a detection speed
over 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art.
