The Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics provides core support to the Board of
Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) to aid the science community and advise
federal agencies on atmospheric sciences and climate research issues. The BASC
is part of the National Academies, chartered by Congress in 1863 to provide
independent science advice to government. The BASC uses volunteer experts to
assist in the design of research studies and workshops and to review and assess
findings and assess priorities. The BASC also facilitates US involvement in
international research programs such as World Climate Research Program, Climate
Variability and Predictability Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BASC broadly
impacts policy by synthesizing scientific information so it is useful to
federal, state, and local decision makers. Thus this activity has substantial
broader impacts.
