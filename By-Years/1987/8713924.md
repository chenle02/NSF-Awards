Protistans are a varied group of micro-organisms that defy the simple
classification of life into plants and animals. The International Society for
Evolutionary Protistology will meet in England during July, 1987, and a variety
of important problems regarding evolution and classification of the Protista
will be discussed. Dr. John Corliss requests a modest sum that will allow a
contingent of four American protistologists to attend the meeting. These four
investigators cover the spectrum of protistan diversity and the range of
approaches to their systematics. Each member of the delegation will either be
presenting a research paper or chairing a symposium session. In addition, the
delegation has been allotted time on the program for a planning session, during
which participants will draft a plan for several workshops, to be held in
conjunction with international protistological conventions over the coming five
years. These workshops will address the problem of protistan evolution and
classification using the full range of modern techniques.
