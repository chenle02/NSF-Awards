The University of Missouri at Rolla will initiate a one-week, residential and
commuter, Young Scholars project in Engineering Technology for 120 students
entering the 12th grade. Students attend a one-week program (40 students/week
for three consecutive weeks in June) designed to present science and engineering
careers relating to minerals, materials, energy, and the environment. Twenty
students from this group are then selected to return for an additional three-
week research experience to be conducted in August, with the particular
discipline of the research being selected to match student interest.
