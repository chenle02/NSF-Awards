A new Biology Core curriculum has been developed to remedy the prior static
approach in general biology involving passive presentation of vast amounts of
information, and the need to address decreased performance of the current
biology majors in the college. The new core will eliminate General Biology and
consist of Cell Structure and Function, Genetics, and Organismal Biology. The
courses will require active participation by students in the acquisition of
information in the laboratory and in the analysis of the data obtained.
Equipment to facilitate these goals includes a micro-video and microscope system
to allow students to study cells and tissues in both a qualitative and
quantitative manner. Spectrophotometric and electrophoretic equipment will allow
students to work further in quantitative laboratory studies. The university will
provide 50% matching funds.
