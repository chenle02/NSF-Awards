The Seventh International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources
will be held June 13-17, 1988 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
previous six conferences have focused on the utilization of finite element
methods in water resources. In view of the broad use of computational algorithms
in various applications, this is the aim of this, the Seventh, to expand the
conference and include a number of non-civil engineering participants. The
expanded scope will enhance scientific exchange in the areas of computational
algorithms development and water resources. In keeping with the goals of
Computational Engineering Program to enhance algorithm development in
collaboration with discipline programs, this Conference is being jointly
supported by Computational and the Natural &n Man-Made Hazards Programs.
