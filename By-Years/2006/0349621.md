This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a
prototype Lithium-ion battery that has inherent cost advantages for a NGV
FreedomCar and hybrid electric vehicle, HEV, requiring compact pulse-power. The
unique rolled-ribbon cell can meet the cost requirements and deliver thousands
of pulses and recharges. The battery design projects power at 2-4kW/kg and power
density at 7.5kW/liter similar to an ultracapacitor, with 20 times greater
specific energy at 100- 120Wh/kg .

The rolled-ribbon design is a technology that enables US producers to compete by
lowering the materials requirement, packaging and safeguard costs of a large
high-power battery. It fulfills the need for high power at low cost. In
addition, this disc-shaped design exhibits excellent passive thermal management
with inherent safety. Gasoline savings will reduce air pollution and oil
imports.
