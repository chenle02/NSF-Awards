An REU site is continued. Research support is awarded to motivated and
academically superior engineering undergraduates in their junior and senior
year. The program has both the summer and academic year components. At least
three of the eight REU participants will be selected for summer participation
from applicants from colleges and universities other than Syracuse University. A
particular focus of recruitment effort will be to attract participants from
women, minority and disabled student groups. For the current (1989-90) REU
project, two of the eight participants were minority students and one of the
minority participant was a woman. Seven faculty members in the mechanical and
aerospace engineering Department have expressed interest in supervising the
research efforts of the REU participants. The areas in which the faculty members
are actively engaged in research span experimental and computational fluid
mechanics, gasdynamics, aerodynamics, heat transfer, helicopter aerodynamics and
aeroelastic stability, aeroacoutics, noise control, automotive engineering,
paper technology and robotics. A REU participant may select research problem in
any one of these research areas of interest to him or her. * The expected
profile and the accomplishments of the REU participants for the current
(1989-90) project are outlined under "Results from Prior NSF Support" in the
Narrative pp.9-12, with additional details in Appendix VI, pp. 16-21. The
profile of the REU participants for 1990-92 is outline under item 16. (pp.
IX-X). ** Under the research interests of each faculty supervisor, some typical
research problems to be suggested to REU participants are listed in the
Narrative (pp. 3-9).
