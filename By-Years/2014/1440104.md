This award supports a Conference on Cell-Cell Communication in Bacteria (CCCB).
The organizers have designed a program that showcases innovative new research
based on theory-driven, multi-disciplinary approaches and the use of novel
technologies to garner a deeper understanding of the cell-cell communication
underpinning coordinated group behaviors in bacteria. Such pheromone- or
metabolite-mediated signaling within and between species of microbes, often
termed ?quorum sensing?, represents a biological phenomenon of great importance
to life on earth by controlling a range of microbial behaviors and processes
with enormous consequences for human and animal health, agriculture, energy and
the environment. The budget requested will be used to support travel of
beginning investigators, as well as postdoctoral and student researchers,
several of whom will be selected for oral presentations based on their submitted
conference abstracts. The organizers of the conference have made a particular
effort to be broadly inclusive in terms of gender balance and minority
participation.

The conference, which will be held in October 2014 in San Antonio Texas, will
bring together leading researchers in the field including international
participants. The CCCB organizers present a forward-thinking agenda at this
conference with presentations by theorists, computational biologists, engineers,
chemists and physicists. Some sessions focus on host-pathogen interactions and
the role of cell-cell communication in pathogenesis, symbiosis and mutualism.
Other areas focus on understanding how bacterial pheromone-mediated signaling
affects host plants or animals, which are now known to have evolved mechanisms
to detect, disrupt, and respond to microbial signals.
