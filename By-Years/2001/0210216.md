This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER. The objective of the proposed work is to
explore new methods for wet chemical preparation of GaN and AlGaN quantum dots.
While extensive research has been conducted on metal chalcogenide quantum dots
in recent years, comparatively little research activity has been directed toward
studying III-nitride quantum dots. The primary reason for this neglect has been
the relative difficulty of preparing III-nitride quantum dots that are isolated,
monodisperse, and manipulable. The proposed new synthetic method is based on a
simple exchange reaction carried out in a coordinating solvent or in a non-
coordinating solvent containing an adsorbate that stabilizes growing
nanoparticles and protects them from flocculation. The advantages of this method
over previous routes to GaN are inexpensive starting materials, mild reaction
conditions, extension to other III-nitrides and their alloys, and facile
processing of the product material. This ease of processing is key to eventually
incorporating these quantum dots into thin film electronic and optical devices.
The specific aims of this project are to investigate the effects of different
reaction parameters (temperature, solvent, and other additives) on the rate and
yield of the reaction and to discover the optimal methods for isolation of the
desired product. The successful completion of this work is expected to enable
research and development of new composite materials and devices containing III-
nitride quantum dots as integral, functional components. The experimental work
will be performed by an undergraduate research assistant and two graduate
research assistants under the guidance of the PI and one of the co-PIs. These
students will benefit from the highly interdisciplinary nature of the research
and exposure to a wide variety of techniques both synthetic and analytical.
These include dry box, vacuum line, and soxhlet techniques as well as a variety
of electronic, structural, and particle size characterization methods. The two
students will initially focus on different aspects of the project (synthesis vs.
characterization), but by the end of the year, both will have gained experience
with the full range of techniques being used.
