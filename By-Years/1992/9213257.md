This is the first year funding of a three year continuing effort. This is
research to test the feasibility of obtaining images of brain electrical
activity related to information processing and learning while people use
different types of computer interfaces. The first part of the effort is to
extract electroencephalographic (EEG) signals related to cognitive aspects of
computer use from contaminating potentials generated by eye movements and muscle
activity. A formal experiment will then be conducted in which subjects acquire
skill in using both a graphical and non-graphical user interface to perform two
text-editing tasks (correcting typographical or semantic errors). Neural-network
pattern discrimination will be used to find the differences between the EEG
spatial patterns for the typographic an semantic tasks, as well as how the
patterns change as subjects learn to use each type of user interface. Successful
completion of this project should pave the way for using EEG measures to
investigate problems in human-computer interaction.
