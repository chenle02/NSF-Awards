Proposal Title: Finite Element Superconvergence in Computational Mechanics
Proposal ID Number: DMS-0074301

Abstract

The objective of this project is the finite element superconvergence. The
research efforts will be devoted (1) to develop general theory of finite element
superconvergence and its recovery with emphases on triangular elements,
irregular grids, and harmonic functions; (2) to develop superconvergent theory
for those successful numerical methods in handling boundary layers and locking.
Some recent mathematical theory in finite element superconvergence, asymptotic
regularity, as well as improved interior analysis will be employed in the
roject.

The superconvergence study is of great importance for adaptive design of
computational algorithms. Therefore, the proposed research has a direct
application in high-performance computing, computational mechanics,
computational fluid dynamics, financial mathematics, mathematical biology,
manufacturing, and other scientific fields. The research will widen the
knowledge in scientific community on both mathematical theory and practical
algorithm design.
