This project will examine changes in North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) flow at
the highest possible age resolution during the most recent interstadials (Oxygen
Isotope Stage 3) in a core from the Bermuda Rise. 230Th will be used to
determine sedimentation rate and adjust age control, and Cd/Ca in benthic
foraminifera will be used as a tracer for NADW. The goal is to determine whether
there were millenial- scale variations in NADW and, if so, whether they
correlate in timing and magnitude with variations previously identified in ice
cores from Greenland. A positive answer would tend to support the hypothesis
that changes in thermohaline flow are linked to high-latitude ice growth.
