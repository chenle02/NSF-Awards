The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division
has supported a comprehensive investigation of curve-crossing events in chemical
reactions being carried out by Professor Guo at the University of Toledo.
Professor Guo is conducting a study of non-adiabatic transition dynamics in the
photodissociation of small molecules, including new three-dimensional quantum
mechanical calculations of the photodissociation dynamics of alkyl iodides in
the gas phase. Professor Guo's new approach treats the dissociation degree of
freedom by a quantum wavepacket method while characterizing environment motions
by classical trajectories. The quantum and classical subsystems are coupled via
the Ehrenfest scheme so that the wavepacket and the trajectory can be propagated
self-consistently. %%% Most chemical reactions can be adequately understood as
involving reactant and product molecules in their ground electronic states.
However, there are many important reactions, including most processes that are
initiated by ultraviolet radiation, for which the reaction process involves
interaction between the ground and excited electronic states. A new theoretical
method is being tested that should permit prediction of the probability of such
processes and thereby contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of
processes initiated by light.
