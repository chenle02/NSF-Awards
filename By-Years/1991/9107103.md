ABSTRACT The aim of the project is to prepare a much-needed Reference Grammar
of Hausa, the largest language in all of Nigeria, Africa's most populous
country, and unquestionably one of most important languages in all of sub-
Saharan Africa. This reference work, which will be the first new grammar of the
language to appear in over fifty years, will consist in a comprehensive
description of all aspects of the language, including pronunciation, word
formation, syntactic structure, and dialect variation. It will also include
information on its linguistic history and development. In addition to being a
major contribution to Hausa linguistic scholarship per se, the grammar will also
serve as an invaluable reference work for scholars interested in comparative
Chadic and Afroasiatic, and for general linguists concerned with broad questions
of linguistic theory and typology. The project will be carried out at Indiana
University, a major center of African studies, by the Principal Investigator, an
internationally recognized authority on the Hausa language, assisted by a team
of Hausa language experts, including a number of linguistically trained Hausas
speakers. The final product will be a large reference book prepared using modern
computer capabilities and distributed through normal academic publishing
channels.
