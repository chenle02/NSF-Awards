This action is to support the travel cost of twenty American Scientists who
will be attending the Twelfth Congress of the International Union of Prehistoric
and Protohistoric Sciences to be held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, September,
1991. The meeting will allow American anthropologists the opportunity to
interact with scientists in their fields from around the world. It also allows
the opportunity for scientists from different nations to initiate scientific
collaborations on topics of common interest. The location of this meeting is
important at this time in history due to the numerous changes taking place in
the eastern European countries.
