The patterns and processes of mammalian mitochondrial gene evolution at the
nucleotide sequence level will be investigated. The primary focus of this
research will be on the rate of sequence change in the cytochrome c oxidase
subunit II (COII) gene encoded in the mitochondrion. This particular gene
interacts directly with the nuclear cytochrome c gene. The COII gene varies in
the amount of amino acid substitutions that have occurred in particular
mammalian groups, and this observation is pronounced in comparisons of rodents
versus primates. The primary strategy of this research is to amplify DNA
fragments containing the COII gene using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
the sequencing of amplified single stranded DNA. This procedure will be used to
evaluate the mode and tempo of COII gene change in rodents, primates, and
related mammalian orders. These data will provide direct information on the
extent of differential rates of change in this gene, the coevolution of genes
encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and the evolutionary
relationships among and within particular mammalian groups.
