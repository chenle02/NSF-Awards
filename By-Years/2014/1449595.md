This award will support at least 26 students to participate at the 2014 SACNAS
National Conference that will take place in Los Angeles (October 16-18, 2014).
The students' participation at the conference will be facilitated by a
"Geosciences Roadmap to the 2014 SACNAS Conference Programing" document. This
guide, available as PDF and app, will assist graduate and undergraduate students
and professionals to better take advantage of the sessions that would benefit
them the most. In addition, the PIs and collaborators will develop a "Geoscience
Mentoring Handbook for the 2014 SACNAS National Conference". This mentoring
guide will facilitate a consistent message from the mentors to the students,
including constructive criticism and resources for students. Lastly, the PI will
facilitate a conversation among faculty, geoscience societies, and industry on
strategies for enhancing participation of under-represented students, in
particular undergraduates, in Geosciences; a report from this conversation will
be shared with the Geosciences community at large. The students selected to be
funded through this award will come primarily from Tribal Colleges and Hispanic
Serving institutions; they will be asked to contribute to and assess the guides
that would be developed to support meeting participation.
