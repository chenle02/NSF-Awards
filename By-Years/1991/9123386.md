The high brightness positron beam at Brandeis University is being used to
perform low energy positron diffraction (LEPD) and positron reemission
microscope (PRM) experiments. The LEPD technique can provide a more precise
structural determination of compound semiconductor surfaces than its electron
counterpart, low energy electron diffraction (LEED). The proposed experiments
are designed to extend the present 80 nm spatial resolution to 1nm. Compound
semiconductors and metal surfaces will be investigated. The PRM will produce up
to 50,000x magnified image of positrons reemitted at low energies from a thin
Ni(100) film. The extreme sensitivity and nondestructiveness of low energy
positrons to subsurface defects and overlying atoms will be used for imaging
features, such as monovacancies an interfacial defects in submonolayer metal
film growth, that can not be seen with conventional electron microscopy.
