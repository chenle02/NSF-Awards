9216474 Bowen The objective of the research is to develop generic fuzzy
constraint-based architecture for Multiple Agent Process Control. Among the
benefits of the project will be: 1. This project will improve the effectiveness
of process control technology by cross-fertilizing research results from fuzzy
logic, constraint processing, and process control. In particular, the project
will involve fundamental research aimed at a) developing a new set of control
engineering techniques based on the use of constraint network processing to
achieve coordination between multiple agents in the control loop; b) developing
new fuzzy constraint network-based process control techniques for handling non-
linear systems, complex systems, adaptive systems, and systems with time delays.
2. This project will enable industry to address a broader class of control
application. In particular, we will a) provide the industrial community with a
generic fuzzy constraint network- based architecture for process control; b) use
our industrial contacts to achieve a widespread dissemination of information
about this new technology. 3. This project will improve the quality of
Engineering Education by incorporating the newly developed fundamental control
engineering techniques into graduate and undergraduate level courses on process
control. ***
