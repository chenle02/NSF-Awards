Improving and enhancing undergraduate STEM education is crucial to the economic
well-being of the nation. Additionally, innovation is a critical piece of an
effective STEM education of the future. In this project, Minnesota State
University (a comprehensive, public institution) and Normandale Community
College (a neighboring two-year college) will collaborate to host a workshop
that will bring together participants and researchers from multiple STEM fields
who are working to evaluate STEM education innovation. Workshop participants
will examine barriers, both real and perceived, in program and institutional
accreditation and examine how such barriers affect innovation for the STEM
student experience. The synthesis of discipline-based perspectives on benefits
and challenges related to assessment, evaluation, and accreditation in STEM
education and their relationships will also be a focus of the workshop.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed workshop will be to examine how
assessment, evaluation, and accreditation have allowed innovation in STEM
education to develop, persist, and/or perish. A key contribution of this
workshop to the improvement of STEM education will be bringing together
participants from life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, engineering,
and computing to discuss issues and challenges related to assessment,
evaluation, and accreditation. Case studies from evidence-based effective STEM
programs at institutions throughout the country will be included in the
workshop. The workshop will provide a forum to examine these exemplary STEM
undergraduate programs, including examining possible successes and failures in
accreditation of such innovative programs. By synthesizing knowledge and
experiences across STEM fields and disseminating this information broadly, this
work will influence further discussions about ways to improve STEM education in
the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
