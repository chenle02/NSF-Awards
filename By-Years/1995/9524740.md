OPP-9524740 PETERSON, BRUCE ABSTRACT One of the expected effects of global
climate change on the Arctic is a dramatic change in the freshwater balance.
Changes in freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean will affect sea ice formation,
wetland and ocean productivity, and thermohaline circulation in the world's
ocean. In spite of the importance of freshwater runoff to the Arctic and global
climate, a contemporary data set for the entire Arctic has never been compiled.
This project will use examine data from North American sources and Russian
sources to quantify the contemporary water balance and the annual variability of
that balance. The water runoff data will be used in models to estimate the flux
of sediment and nutrients from the continents to the adjacent seas. This
contemporary, baseline data set and model will be used to judge the likely
impacts of predicted climate change on circumarctic water and nutrient balances
and will provide a means for estimating contaminant pathways and potential
impacts. The results of this research project will provide a benchmark against
which future climate changes may be assessed.
