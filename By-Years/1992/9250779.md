This project enhances the undergraduate Instrumental Analysis course by focusing
it on practical electronics and data acquisition techniques that apply to real
research problems. Inexpensive modular instruments will allow students to
perform sophisticated experiments with apparatus that is partially constructed
during the laboratory. Use of lasers and computer control of instrumentation,
fast transient data acquisition, phase sensitive detection, and the use of
optical detectors are emphasized. Experiments involve organic and inorganic
photochemistry and spectroscopy, kinetics, and chemical physics.An independent,
short research project requires the student to apply his or her training to an
original problem. The project also improves the undergraduate Physical Chemistry
laboratories.
