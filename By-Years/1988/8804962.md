This grant will establish at Mount Holyoke College, an Research Experiences for
Undergraduates research site. Each summer for the next three years, twelve
students will be engaged, in mathematical research. They will be drawn primarily
from nearby colleges and universities and possibly from some schools further
away. The students will work in groups of four, each group carrying out a
different project under the supervision of a faculty member. The three research
areas will be in algebraic geometry, partial differential equations, and
statistics. They will involve extensive computer experimentation and will be
directed at mainstream areas of mathematical research in which experimental
evidence promises to illuminate, and possibly even overcome, current impasses in
purely theoretical attacks. The groups will meet separately several times a day,
but ample opportunity will be provided for students in different groups to
exchange ideas. More specifically Dr. O'Shea will lead a project on limits of
tangent spaces, Dr. Peterson will lead a project on evolution of planar domains
and Dr. Gifford will lead a project on the use of bootstrapping in principal
components analysis.
