This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Curriculum Development in Systems for
Smart Communications," at Villanova University, under the direction of Dr.
Robert H. Caverly. The overall objective of this project is to develop a series
of educational concept modules covering basic and advanced topics in smart
communications technology that overlap not only the principal investigators'
research but also the "best practices" in the field.
