This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in
support of the conference on "Bacteria-Material Interactions" is cofunded by the
Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program, in the Division of
Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This conference
will focus on how materials interact with bacteria, and in developing an
understanding the nature of these interactions. One possible outcome of this
conference would be in coherently developing better materials that enhance
positive tissue-cell/material interactions and simultaneously inhibiting
bacterial colonization. This conference would provide an important forum for the
exchange of ideas among not only the established and emerging leaders in this
field but also the next generation of scientists, who will carry the field
forward and integrate it into the broader context of advanced biomaterials.
Exchange of ideas at the forefront of this important field, and definition of
key pathways for the development of next generation infection-resisting
biomaterials would be identified and shared amongst a broad array of scientists
and engineers. Sessions will be organized covering a broad range of topics
related to materials, and material-microbial
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: With this award, both
graduate and undergraduate students would be able to present their research
findings, and would provide them an opportunity in discussing potential career
choices with individuals from academia, government, and industry. The broadest
impact of this project would be the interdisciplinary scientific and
professional training/experience that the various young researchers supported by
NSF funds would have. These experiences will help train a diverse and
interdisciplinary set of students who will integrate the new paradigm in
designing novel materials in preventing bacterial infection.
