A diffusing-vortex method, for solving the two-dimensional incompressibl
Navier-Stokes equation, will be extended and applied to the external
incompressible viscous flow over a generally smooth blunt body. The numerical
advantages over other Langrangian vortex methods will be further demonstrated by
reducing total CPU time and by avoiding cut-off procedures. The new approach,
which is an approximate expression of the Green's function of the diffusion
equation, will be constructed for a general two-dimensional smooth contour at a
high Reynolds number. A benchmark case, the cylinder problem will be used to
examine the accuracy of the code and the effect of spatial mesh length and time
step length on computational results. The proposed finite difference analysis
based on the diffusing vortex method can be applied to the unsteady
imcompressible viscous flow past two dimensional geometry typical of circular,
elliptic, and other type of cylinders with CPU time less than vortex method by
one order of magnitude.
