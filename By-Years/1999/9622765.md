This award supports the research of Professor M. Vancliff to work in non-
commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising from the
theory of graded regular algebras. In particular, Professor Vancliff will try to
classify the quadratic regular algebras of global dimension n with Hilbert
series the same as that of the polynomial ring on n variables that map onto a
certain twisted homogeneous coordinate ring of a quadric lying in n-1
dimensional projective space. She hopes that this will lead to methods of
constructing examples of Artin-Schelter algebras with new behavior. This is
research in the subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring theory. Algebra
can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, algebra has
direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In fact, much of non-
commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in quantum mechanics and
this proposal continues to explore areas that connect directly with modern
quantum field theory.
