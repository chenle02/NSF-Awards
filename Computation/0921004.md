Ion channels are critical for biological function and also represent remarkable
electronic devices of independent interest. They facilitate and regulate the
flow of charged ions in and out of cells, and they do so with precise behaviors
that are not fully understood. The more accurate models and more efficient
numerical algorithms will significantly advance the research on ion channels and
other important proteins. In this project, the PIs plan to study models for two
ion channels (sodium and calcium channels) to understand the role of dielectric
models in predicting the mechanism of ion channels. In particular, the PIs will
build upon an existing model that uses a very simple, almost naive, yet
remarkably effective, model of dielectrics. They then will analyze this model
mathematically to further reveal its properties and range of applicability.
Moreover, they will study a more sophisticated model of dielectrics, commonly
known as a non-local model. In addition, this project will provide multi-
disciplinary training opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students.
Fast computation of numerical solutions of ion channel models including nonlocal
continuum solvent models is essential for quantitative understanding of critical
physiological processes and cellular metabolism and energetics, which is central
to improving our understanding of health and diseases. The new ion channel
models, nonlocal continuum solvent models, and efficient numerical algorithms
developed in this project will be a considerable contribution to mathematical
biology, computational physiology, and computational mathematics. They will play
important roles in studying various ion channels, computing continuum
electrostatics for solvent-solute systems, and simulating large scale protein
systems.
