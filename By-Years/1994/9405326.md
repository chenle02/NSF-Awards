9405326 Scholz The mechanism of fault propagation through rocks is of
fundamental importance in understanding brittle deformation. Recently, a
mechanical model for the zone of intensified deformation near crack tips, the
process zone, has been developed. This work will be an extensive field test of
process zones intended to characterize the nature and geometry of process zone
in 3-D and to determine their scaling relationship with fault scaling
parameters. This study will involve describing both macro-and microstructures
associated with process zones, with a concentration on the microstructures such
as microcracks and pressure solution surfaces. The results will be tested
against the present model and the model further developed.
