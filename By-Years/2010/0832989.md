This award helps support a workshop from June 9-11, 2008 in Trieste, Italy to
explore ways to improve the quality and value of climate reconstructions through
a coordinated assessment of uncertainties in paleoclimate proxies. One goal of
the workshop is to explore a possible coordinated strategy for the future
collection and integration of proxy data from key geographic regions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, the researcher, and his
colleagues, have organized an international workshop to focus on three primary
elements that include: 1) climate proxies with decadal, or better, temporal
resolution; 2) how the uncertainties related to climate reconstruction using
these proxies can be quantified; and 3) how these same uncertainties can be
reduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the award will provide participant
support for approximately twenty individuals at U.S. institutions with expertise
in paleoclimatology and related aspects of climate research to participate in
presentations and discussions that examine the scientific strengths and
weaknesses of various climate proxies. The participants will include seasoned
researchers, new investigators, and students. In this manner, an open and lively
exchange of views will be enabled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
