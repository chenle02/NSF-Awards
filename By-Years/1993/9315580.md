9315580 Flynn This Planning Grant award will enable the investigators to perform
a feasibility study to determine if an alternate technology could be developed
to replace the medical radiograph film system. Current-regulated field emission
arrays used in conjunction with thin phosphors will be evaluated to determine if
an electronic display for digital radiographic data with image quality
essentially equal to that of a film with backlit illumination can be achieved.
The study will be restricted to the investigation of a technology for static
displays. This research is important since it is estimated that the cost of
using film for radiographic procedures is substantial. A filmless system should
not only decrease the costs associated with film but also should improve the
overall productivity associated with clinical care. ***
