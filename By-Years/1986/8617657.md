The objective of this research is to derive improved constitutive equations for
finite plastic deformation of single crystal and polycrystalline metals. The
research encompasses the systematic experimental and theoretical investigation
of the deformation processes in single crystals and its extension to bi-
crystals, tri-crystals and finally to polycrystalline metals. The study will
combine the concepts of micro-mechanics with the macroscopic theories. The
research will contribute to the large effort of modeling the mechanical behavior
of materials, and will allow reliable simulation of metal-forming processes and
prediction of material failure in mechanical and structural systems.
