The proposed project will support students and teachers, as well as Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Native Alaskan college students (at both
undergraduate and graduate levels) to participate in challenging and inspiring
conference activities taking place at the 2017 International Microwave Symposium
(IMS), which will be held in Hawaii Convention Center, Honolulu, HI, June 4-9,
2017. Support will be provided for an educational program called IMS Connect
which was initiated at the 2014 IMS Symposium held in Tampa, FL, continued to be
offered in follow-up events and will be expanded further this year. The proposed
work will focus on exposing middle and high-school students and their teachers,
as well as college students through the STEM Experiences for Students and
Teachers Project, to exciting opportunities related to broad technology areas
such as electronics and communications. The students will learn about the
science and engineering aspects related to the RF and Microwave field, including
various aspects related to components, circuits, electromagnetic approaches, and
novel concepts in high frequency techniques from microwaves to millimeter-waves
and Terahertz. The project will assist in enhancing the recruitment and
retention within STEM disciplines such as Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE), with broader impacts on improving the engineering workforce base, with
commensurate economic benefits to the country.
