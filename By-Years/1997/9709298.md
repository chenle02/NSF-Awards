This proposal seeks funding to develop a formal theory of parties as electoral
institutions. The project begins by showing the consequences of treating
political parties as collections of self-interested actors whose goals are
sometime in conflict, rather than treating them as unitary actors who always
have the same interests. The second part of the project focuses on issues in
which voters (and candidates) have similar, strong interests. One way of
conceiving those issues is that they are similar to core items that parties fold
into their platforms. Both parts of hte project enable the invesitgators to
answer questions about the positions that a party adopts over time as it tries
to anticipate it's opposing party's position. The projects also enable the
researchers to gain insights into which party members will be most loyal and
whether party leaders can do anything to encourage party harmony.
