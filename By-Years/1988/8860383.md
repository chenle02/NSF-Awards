Thermoplastics, being semicrystalline materials, are sensitive to process
history. Crystallinity significantly affects mechanical properties.
Relationships governing nucleation and crystal growth in fiber-reinforced
thermoplastics are poorly understood. Crystals can be preferentially nucleated
at and oriented perpendicular to fiber surfaces. This transcrystallinity has
been shown to significantly increase heat deflection temperature.
Transcrystallinity would be expected to affect other matrix- dominated
properties such as transverse tensile strength, transverse modulus, fatigue and
creep. Surface treatments, involving plasma chemistry processes, of intermediate
modulus graphite fibers have been shown to induce transcrystalline growth where
fiber manufacturer's surface treatments had no effect. The effect of fiber
surface chemistry on transcrystallinity, if understood, could be used to develop
thermoplastic composites with improved matrix-dependent properties. Promotion
conditions for transcrystallinity growth will be investigated through a study
involving fiber processing, surface chemistry characterization, crystalline
morphology and composite mechanical studies. Anticipated results should define
optimum surface chemistry conditions for transcrystalline growth.
