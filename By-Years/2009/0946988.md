Professors Michael P. Doyle, Jeffrey T. Davis, Daniel E. Falvey, Lyle D. Issacs
and Herman O. Sintim of the University of Maryland have submitted a proposal in
response to the CRIF: MU solicitation to acquire a high resolution double sector
mass spectrometer. The research projects it will support are related to a
variety of studies including: (i) synthesis and application of unnatural amino
acids; (ii) characterization of small molecule intermediates used in
supramolecular chemistry, molecular recognition, and the assembly of receptors
for transmembrane ion-transport; (iii) development of highly selective and
efficient catalytic processes for the synthesis of biologically relevant
compounds; (iv) the study of photo induced electron transfer reactions and the
generation of novel high spin organic species; (v) development of small molecule
probes for electron and electrophile migration along strands of DNA; and, (vi)
total synthesis of antibiotics of the family of Platensimycin.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical
composition of a sample and determine its purity. A high resolution mass
spectrometer has the capability of performing accurate elemental composition
analysis of compounds. This makes it a powerful tool for identification of known
and unknown or new compounds. This acquisition will benefit undergraduate and
graduate students in their research and in a new experimental course to be
developed. Students and faculty at Howard University Virginia State University
and Catholic University will also use it to analyze samples.
