9315393 Majerfeld This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research in solid state and microstructures between Arnoldo Majerfeld,
University of Colorado, and Pierre Tronc, Ecole Superieure de Physique et de
Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France. The objective of their research is to
investigate the physical properties of p- type gallium arsenide multi-quantum
wells and superlattices. They will examine their use in infrared photodectors
and imaging. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the
fabrication and electrical and optical characterization of these structures.
This is complemented by the French theoretical and computational expertise in
optical absorption and electrical transport. The proposed research has important
commercial applications and will advance understanding of the design of normal
incidence infrared photodectors. ***
