The departments of physics and chemistry of the New Mexico Institute of Mining
and Technology will establish a REU site in the area of atmospheric sciences.
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology has ongoing programs in studies of
atmospheric electricity and chemistry centered around the facilities available
at the Irving Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research located at 3240 m
altitude in the Magadalena Mountains near Socorro, New Mexico and the physics
and chemistry laboratories on the New Mexico Tech campus. The New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology has a long-standing policy of involving
undergraduate studies in research activities. Historically about 80 percent of
the B.S. chemistry and physics graduates go on to graduate or professional
schools after graduation. A total of 12 faculty (9 from physics and 3 from
chemistry) will be available for involvement in this project. Ten or more
studies will participate in the summer program and about five students will
continue their research involvement through the academic year. At least one half
of the summer students will come from other regional academic institutions.
