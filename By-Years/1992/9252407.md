An upper-division laboratory course is being established for undergraduate
students at the senior level who are pursuing physics and related disciplines.
Within this laboratory course, there are 13 experiments. These are as follows:
1) x- ray analysis; 2) electrical resistivity vs. temperature; 3) Hall Effect
vs. temperature, drift velocity; 4) thermal conductivity vs. temperature; 5)
thermoelectric power vs. temperature; 6) magnetic susceptibility vs.
temperature; 7) magnetization vs. temperature; 8) superconductivity - metallic
and oxide; 9) infrared absorption; 10) internal photoemission; 11) minority
carrier lifetime; 12) Mossbauer spectroscopy; and 13) electron tunneling.Most of
the equipment items are being purchased, but they are making for themselves such
items as low-temperature dewar stations with associated cryogenic probes and
vacuum plumbing.A one-semester introductory lecture course in solid state
physics is also being developed the at same time. The lecture and laboratory
courses are being offered together.
