Experiments are carried out to probe the competition between ionization and
dissociation in highly excited small molecules. The analysis of data includes a
calculation of statistical covariance between all the fragments (both ions and
electrons), which allows identification of specific collision partners and the
transition state of their parent molecular systems. Experiments are performed
with long (15 ns) and short (10 ps) pulsed 193 nm radiation at power densities
between 1 GW/cm2 and 100 TW/cm2. At the lower intensities, the effects of
resonant bound and unbound intermediate states on this competition are studies.
At higher intensities the details of Coulomb explosions and above threshold
dissociation are studied in diatomic systems.
