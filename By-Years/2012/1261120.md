Decentralized architectures for decision-making are coming to the fore as more
and more distributed infrastructures are deployed to address current challenges
and needs of society, including "smart grids" for energy distribution, sensor
and actuator networks for ecological monitoring and control, sustainable mass
transportation systems, etc. The objective is to ensure that local actions at
the nodes result in coherent collective behavior of the network. Systems of this
type operate in highly uncertain environments that are noisy, unpredictable and
possibly subject to adversarial disturbances. The goal of this research project
is to develop a comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic framework for real-
time adaptive decision-making in such large-scale systems under resource and
cost constraints.

Online decision-making is concerned with real-time sequential planning in the
presence of model uncertainty, nonstationarity, and possibly adversarial
disturbances. The investigators study a novel extension of this paradigm to
decentralized settings, where the actions have to be taken at the nodes of a
large network, and the nodes only have access to noisy local information. The
research entails explicit consideration of a temporally varying environment with
a priori unknown dynamics; analysis and application in settings with significant
model uncertainty, potential unmodeled statistical dependencies in observations
either across the network nodes or over time, and possible adversarial
contamination of data; and accounting for the influence of the decisions and
network actions on the surrounding environment. The theoretical component of the
project captures the impact of decentralization on the quality of the decision-
making; the algorithmic component is to develop, analyze, and implement
algorithms that come as close as possible to the derived theoretical bounds.
