9411170 Feng A serendipitous development of theoretical physics in the past
decade was the apparent confluence of the central themes of several areas of
physics: quantum measurement, quantum chaos, mesoscopic physics and quantum
cosmology. Although all these robust areas focus on vastly different aspects of
physics, covering atomic-molecular, quantm optics, condensed matter as well as
nuclear, particle physics and general relativity, it seems that they all stand
on the questions of quantum-classical correspondence (QCC). ***
