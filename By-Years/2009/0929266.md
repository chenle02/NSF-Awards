The PI?s request EAGER funding to focus on validation of the coupled CWB-ESP
instrument using field collected materials. This will not only allow the PI?s to
overcome reviewer concerns, but will be a major step forward in preparing the
CWB-ESP system for routine field deployment.. The main objectives
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1: Coupling the CWB to the ESP: the Microfluidic
Block (MFB) interface&lt;br/&gt;2: Select and optimize hybridization and
detection protocols&lt;br/&gt;3: Detection of targets in field-collected samples
using model systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ESP-integrated CWB is potentially a
major advance toward unattended, long term study of specific populations of the
microbial community, with numerous potential applications beyond ecological
research. During the course of this research, graduate, undergraduate and high
school students will be involved directly and trained in the fundamentals of
design and analysis of systems. The PI?s intend to engage diverse students and
underserved minorities, by incorporating their research ideas and work into
existing educational programs. &lt;br/&gt;
