DMS-0100710&lt;br/&gt;Nicholas J. Kuhn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Kuhn has a
long record of developing &lt;br/&gt;methods to solve interesting problems in
homotopy &lt;br/&gt;theory, K-theory, and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the largest part of this project is &lt;br/&gt;to connect new
'polynomial' resolutions of classic &lt;br/&gt;function spaces to other things:
model categories of &lt;br/&gt;structured spectra, equivariant stable homotopy,
&lt;br/&gt;classial loop space theory, and periodic homotopy. &lt;br/&gt;These
connections will be used to calculate previously &lt;br/&gt;inaccessible
cohomological invariants of both such &lt;br/&gt;function spaces and infinite
loop spaces. A second &lt;br/&gt;part of the work is a continuation of the study
of the &lt;br/&gt;generic representation theory of finite fields. &lt;br/&gt;In
particular, from his homotopical/K-theoretic point &lt;br/&gt;of view, he is
studying his newly discovered lattices &lt;br/&gt;of generalized Schur algebras,
with an eye towards &lt;br/&gt;gaining insight about the modular representations
of &lt;br/&gt;the finite permutation groups, and the finite general
&lt;br/&gt;linear matrix groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory, K-theory,
and representation theory &lt;br/&gt;are mathematical subjects in which one is
trying to &lt;br/&gt;discover, and ultimately classify, fundamental building
&lt;br/&gt;blocks of various sorts of mathematical structure. &lt;br/&gt;(This
is quite analogous to a chemist studying simple &lt;br/&gt;molecular
configurations, and how these can be assembled &lt;br/&gt;in more complex ways.)
Homotopy is concerned with &lt;br/&gt;deformations of geometric objects such as
higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensional surfaces. A sample hard problem is to
&lt;br/&gt;understand the `shape' of all continuous functions &lt;br/&gt;from a
sphere (surface of a ball) to itself. &lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is
concerned with the algebraic &lt;br/&gt;symmetries of more rigid and discrete
objects such &lt;br/&gt;as configurations of lines and planes. A sample hard
&lt;br/&gt;problem is to understand all the basic ways in which &lt;br/&gt;the
set of n by n matrices of 0's and 1's can act on &lt;br/&gt;strings of 0's and
1's. Finally K-theory is a &lt;br/&gt;sophisticated hybrid of the two. Professor
Kuhn is &lt;br/&gt;studying new connections relating these subjects, by
&lt;br/&gt;developing and using a variety of state-of-the-art
&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and homotopy theoretic tools.&lt;br/&gt;
