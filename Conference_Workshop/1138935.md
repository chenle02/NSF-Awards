Tropical geometry is a young and rapidly growing area in mathematics, rooted in
algebraic geometry, complex analysis, commutative algebra, and combinatorics,
with successful applications in computer science, biology and statistical
physics, in addition to other areas of mathematics. Tropical geometry is a
polyhedral analogue of algebraic geometry. Algebraic varieties over a valued
field are replaced by polyhedral complexes, retaining some invariants of the
original algebraic varieties. Tropical geometry provides a framework for solving
algebro-geometric problems using concrete combinatorial tools. Recent years have
seen tremendous development in tropical geometry that both established the field
as an area in its own right and unveiled its deep connections to numerous
branches of pure and applied mathematics.

A workshop on Tropical Geometry will be held at International Centre for
Mathematical meetings (CIEM) in Castro Urdiales, Cantabria, Spain, on December
12-16, 2011. It will be the first major international event in tropical geometry
in two years and will as such serve to display the most recent developments, to
foster interaction within a geographically wide-spread community, to initiate
new collaborations, and to sustain and broaden the mentoring network within the
field. The workshop will have 22 invited talks, a poster session, a software
presentation, and a special discussion session devoted to open problems. The
list of speakers includes senior as well as young promising researchers and all
leading female mathematicians in the field. Graduate students and early career
researchers will be able to showcase their work and get feedback from leading
experts at the poster session. Around 60 participants, including around 30% from
under-represented groups, are expected. To disseminate the results of the
workshop to a wider audience, slides and notes from the presentations and
discussions will be placed on the web. Conference proceedings of refereed
articles on tropical geometry will also be published.
