This project, a collaboration between a psychologist and economist,
investigates learning and adaptive behavior in economic environments. The work
has experimental, computational, and theoretical components. Broadly speaking,
the aim is to help to develop game theory to make it more descriptive of
observed behavior and to conduct experiments to test such theory and suggest
directions for empirical work in naturally occurring markets. The larger goal is
to help to understand how economic actors behave when they are learning about
the economic environment, and how this may differ from their behavior when they
have become very experienced with that environment.
