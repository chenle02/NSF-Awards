In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Metz will pursue spectroscopic and dynamical studies of
reactants, products, and intermediates of transition metal cations in which the
C-C and C-H bonds are activated. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy will be used to
extend previous studies of electronic states to also include the vibrational
ground states of the ions. IR absorption is monitored via photodissociation of
molecules tagged with a weakly bound spectator molecule or by photodissociation
of untagged molecules. Specifically, systems to be studied include ions involved
in the conversion of methane to methanol, conversion of methane to larger
hydrocarbons, and activation of larger hydrocarbons. Also to be studied are
small ions of atmospheric and astronomical interest. This research will be done
with students and postdoctoral research associates.
