The focus of this NIRT project on Novel Nanoengineered Chromophore Aggregates
with Controlled Electronic and Optical Properties is on the design, synthesis,
optical characterization, and modeling of novel materials, with the objective of
nanoscale control of charge transfer and optical functionality between organic
building blocks. The well-defined aggregates proposed here are important new
systems of relevance to molecular electronics. The research examines the
potential of single molecules as microcircuitary components such as switches,
memory and transistors. Molecular aggregates which contain paracycophane
contacts will be synthesized and used in this project. The investigation on the
optical and electronic characteristics will be focused on the paracyclophane
dimmers.
