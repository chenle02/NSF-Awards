A real-time system has specific time constraints for the processing of a
database query as well as consistency requirements for its temporal data. If it
is not possible to produce an exact answer to a database query by a specified
deadline, approximate query processing can be used to provide an approximate
answer within the time constraints, but it does not address the temporal
dimension of the data. This project integrates the two areas of approximate
query processing and temporal data models in order to design an approximate
query processing system for temporal data. A new semantics of approximation is
being developed to include the different types of temporal data and consistency
requirements of a real-time database. The approximate relational algebra
operations are extended to include new approximate temporal operations. The
semantic information needed during approximate query processing to incorporate
the temporal dimension and maintain consistency is being determined. The result
of this project will provide a design for the implementation of an approximate
query processing system that can be used in environments where data consistency
must be maintained and deadlines must be met. ***
