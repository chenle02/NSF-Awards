MALCOLM S. GORDON, PROPOSAL # IOS-0833352 In situ measurement of vertebrate
swimming in natural environments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Present understanding of
the nature of water flows around swimming animals is almost entirely based on
laboratory studies in confined tanks and flumes. Major technical limitations of
such studies result in our knowledge being only an approximation to reality.
With support of this grant the Principal Investigator, working with Prof. J.O.
Dabiri and a postdoctoral associate, will carry out the first series of tests of
a new technique and new apparatus for studying water flows around actively
swimming animals under more natural conditions. The apparatus [Self-contained
Underwater Visualization Apparatus (SCUVA)] is being developed in the laboratory
of Prof. Dabiri at the California Institute of Technology. It is based on the
use of the technique of digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV) together
with digital video recording and scuba diving. Expected results will be a new
tool to obtain quantitative, engineering quality, water-flow data from large,
free-swimming, marine animals (porpoise and tuna). This study will provide
substantial advances in our understanding of how animals swim, data that could
lead to improvements in the design and operation of human engineered underwater
vehicles and advanced training for a women postdoctoral associate in preparation
for her entering a career in basic research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;
