The workshop on Quantum Information Science in Computer and Natural Sciences is
being organized by the Physics Frontier Center at the Joint Quantum Institute of
the University of Maryland to help the Computer and Natural Sciences community
become aware of the possibilities of developments in Quantum Information
Science. This is in connection with the recent program solicitation from the
National Science Foundation NSF 12-540 CISE-MPS Interdisciplinary Faculty
Program in Quantum Information Science. The workshop plans to have about 65
participants from academic institutions of the United States including 15
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this workshop stems
from the potential to connect people in the computer sciences and other areas of
MPS with leading researches in Quantum Information in a favorable environment to
foster collaboration, including spending sabbaticals at the QI primary centers
in the United States. This will help fulfill the United States National Science
and Technology Council report A Federal Vision for Quantum Information
Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of this activity include the
multiplicative effect that the participants, when returning to their
institutions, will have for the expansion of Quantum Information Science.
