Intellectual merit: Ultrasound biomicroscopy produces exquisite images of tissue
microstructure but has failed to make the leap to widespread clinical use. A
major technical obstacle has been the lack of suitable sensor arrays operating
at high ultrasonic frequencies. The fundamental hypothesis of this proposal is
that ?optoacoustic? technology can revolutionize the imaging performance of
ultrasound biomicroscopy systems. Optical techniques for ultrasound detection
can produce broadband, large aperture, and highly populated sensor arrays
unattainable with conventional ultrasound technology. The research goals of this
career development plan are to (1) develop optoacoustic sensor arrays for high
speed data acquisition; and (2) develop optoacoustic-based array scanners for
real-time imaging. The proposed research involves device technology, data
acquisition techniques, and image reconstruction algorithms.

Broader impacts: The education and outreach activities will include middle
school students, high school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate
students, and continuing education professionals. High school and undergraduate
students can perform many aspects of the proposed research. Undergraduate and
graduate students will gain hands-on experience with a lab component developed
for a medical imaging course. Converting this course to distance-learning format
will provide access to continuing education professionals. Web-based remote
laboratories will provide world-wide access to instructional experiments on
ultrasound imaging and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Encouraging high school
students to remotely access the ultrasound imaging equipment will interest them
in science and engineering. Enthusiasm for engineering among middle school
students will be fostered through hands-on projects, imaging demos, and tours of
the local hospital?s medical imaging facilities. Significant gaps remain in
imaging technology as the need for a broader array of techniques has grown
tremendously. The potential benefits to society are far-reaching, as effective
imaging systems can impact all aspects of human life from the health and safety
of individuals to homeland security.
