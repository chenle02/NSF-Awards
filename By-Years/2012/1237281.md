This grant provides funding to support a workshop focused on Materials by
Design. The workshop seeks to share the state-of-the-art in this area as well as
identify opportunities for research advancement. It will bring together leaders
from academe and industry to identify: critical challenges in materials
development, existing and emerging computational and experimental techniques
that have the potential to facilitate rational materials design in new ways, and
best working practices for collaborative research between industry and
universities and understand how they may be exploited to facilitate materials
design and the accelerated development of new materials.

The workshop will also involve identifying approaches to storing, sharing,
interrogating, and using the increasingly voluminous quantities of data
generated by computational and experimental materials research. The organizers
will seek the participation of groups underrepresented in science and
engineering by leveraging activities with their existing support programs at
Brown.
