This award supports a two year study of the rheology of basal ice. The study has
two principal parts: 1) measurements of the ice flow field around an artificial
irregularity at the base of the glacier Engabreen in northern Norwway; and 2)
development of a theoretical (numerical) model, that describes the
threedimensional flow field in basal ice. Tunnels through the bedrock beneath
Engabreen, will provide the unique setting and opportunity to directly measure
the flow field in basal ice. The velocity field will be determined by using a
video camera to monitor the position of markers in the ice. The numerical model
will be based on an existing finite element code at the University of Minnesota,
taking advantage of the facilities at the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute.
Comparison between the model and the experimentally observed flow fields will
permit an evaluation of various constitutive laws. Numerical values will be
determined for the material constants in the models that give the best fit to
the observed flow field.
