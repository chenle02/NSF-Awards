This project will support International Research Collaboratives (IRCs), which
are groups of law and science researchers organized to undertake various
sociolegal research projects. As well, the project will support the Junior
Scholars Workshop (JSW), which will to train and mentor the next generation of
sociolegal scholars. The project will connect and engage an interdisciplinary
group of scholars and researchers with current and cutting-edge theoretical,
methodological, and policy approaches, thus enhancing law and science
scholarship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the cross-
disciplinary research endeavors of the IRCs by providing support for scholars to
participate in them at the 2022 annual conference of the Law and Society
Association. The research activities of the IRCs will build upon the many
research collaborations that have produced important scientific discoveries by
advancing knowledge and understanding in the several interdisciplinary and
disciplinary-specific fields of sociolegal studies. As well, the project will
bring together entry-level scholars at the JSW, which will serve to guide,
prepare, and mentor the next generation of sociolegal researchers, further
developing and advancing law and science scholars and scholarship. In doing so,
the project will link a new cohort of scholars with more established
researchers, thus providing networking and collaborative opportunities while
fostering the future of the sociolegal field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
