9357614 Schlom This research involves the synthesis of oxide multilayers
uniquely suited to investigate solid state phenomena vital to the development of
integrated microelectronic devices utilizing the extraordinary properties of
oxides. Molecular beam epitaxy will be used to grow epitaxial stacks of oxide
superconductors, ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, etc. with unit cell layering
precision. ***
