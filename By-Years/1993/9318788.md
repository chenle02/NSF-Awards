9318788 Dwyer This is an award to provide support for research, the objective of
which is to determine conditions under which bacteria that have been shown to be
capable of degrading organic contaminants of soil can be utilized in field-scale
decontamination of soil. The target organic compounds this investigator plans to
work on are diaryl ethers, compounds that as a class include the dioxins,
substances of great pollutional significance. The organism the investigator
plans to use, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, has been found to degrade diaryl
ethers, a property attributable to its containing genes for enzymes that cleave
these compound's ether bond. Results of this research are expected to include
the substrate range for this organism and its enzymes, the conditions that are
appropriate for its use in field-scale operations and the stability of its genes
for degradation of the target substances. This research is expected to provide
guidance for the conditions under which microorganisms may be evaluated for
their use in decontamination of soils and provide the basis for engineering
design of systems to remove the target contaminants from soil. ***
