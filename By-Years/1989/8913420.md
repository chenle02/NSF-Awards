This proposal requests partial support of foreign travel expenses for invited
lecturers at the 1989 Inorganic Geochemistry Gordon Research Conference, to be
held August 14-18 in Andover, New Hampshire. Specific themes to be addressed by
the Conference include ore deposits that are part of regional, large-scale, ore-
forming systems, the physics and chemistry of flow through porous and fractured
media, the microanalysis of individual fluid inclu- sions and isotopic zonation
patterns, and applications of theoretical geochemistry to aqueous organic
species and the evolution of sulfur in magmatic systems.
