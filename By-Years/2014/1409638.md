Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) leads the 46-member system of public
higher education in the state. Its ADVANCE IT-Catalyst award will enable faculty
and administrators to partner to develop policies and practices that allow
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) women faculty to thrive
in the system, and help keep excellent faculty and important role models doing
their best. IT-Catalyst awards help institutions jump-start key institutional
transformation to serve the needs of the new faculty being hired as the baby
boomer generation retires. MTSU will conduct a detailed self-assessment,
collecting data on hiring and promotion of STEM women at MTSU. They will use a
variety of social media to inform both MTSU faculty and sister institutions with
similar mission and geography.

MTSU will engage multiple stakeholders in a cross-campus discussion of how to
improve MTSU's recruitment, hiring, and professional development of its STEM
faculty. They will host a conference to disseminate their findings across the
public higher education system in Tennessee and beyond.
