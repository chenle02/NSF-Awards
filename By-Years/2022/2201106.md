COllaborative Next-generation Technology In the Northeast: the UMassUnity
Machine (CONTINUUM) extends an existing computational resource, UMass Amherstâ€™s
UNITY cluster, with eight novel servers that support cutting-edge IBM POWER,
GPGPU and FPGA architectures. This extension enables key computational efforts
at UMass Amherst and Dartmouth campuses, and the University of Rhode Island in
numerous important science areas, including gravitational wave science,
metagenomics, earthquake detection, modeling cancer and others. Based on the
science requirements, the existing Unity cluster is extended with eight Power9
nodes, each with dual 2.7 GHz 16-core processors, 256 GB memory, accelerated by
dual Nvidia Tesla V100 GPGPUs and a Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA. Beyond the initial
science drivers proposed, the new servers support many more collaborative
research teams on the three campuses. Furthermore, CONTINUUM enables scientific
development for the entire Open Science Grid (OSG) community, with access to 20%
of the compute time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new servers also serve as an
important tool for training undergraduate and graduate students in the efficient
use of cutting-edge HPC systems. In addition, CONTINUUM supports research and
education in an EPSCoR state (RI) and a university campus in Massachusetts with
38% students of color. To promote collaborations with researchers in the wider
region, CONTINUUM personnel participate in the regional HPC Day conference and
collaborate with the Northeast and CAREERS Cyberteams
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
