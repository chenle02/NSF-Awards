This workshop proposal aims to bring together a wide range of researchers on a
very relevant and ambitious topic. It will start a timely discussion on how
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be made safe for public good, and how current
advances in the field can become a supporting backbone for that usage. The
proposal addresses a topic that has a lot of potential for research but has been
very sparsely visited so far in both engineering and computing research
communities. Overall, this is a strong workshop proposal which will lead to
novel research conversations on two major topics of importance for today’s
society – AI and digital ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is to be
conducted over 2 days at the University of California Berkeley campus, both in-
person and via videoconference, with 50 attendees, including stakeholders across
industry, non-profits, academia, government and supra-national institutions,
building on years of collaboration and consultation with the EU Commission,
World Economic Forum, OECD, UNESCO, and GPAI; and with major foundations
including Schmidt Futures, Kavli, Open Philanthropy; and several national
governments. The PI has done a good job in putting together an impressive
agenda, featuring academia, industry, and government organizations. The proposed
workshop has five suggested topic areas including: 1) fundamental topics for
safe and beneficial AI systems; 2) Considerations for provably safe and
beneficial algorithmic media; 3) Considerations for provably safe and beneficial
human-robot interaction; 4) Relevant technical considerations to enable a
regulatory framework governing the deployment of powerful AI systems within a
secure digital ecosystem; and 5) Considerations regarding fair
access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
