Saline and dilute groundwaters of distinct origin converge and mix in two
juxtaposed Paleozoic aquifers in Missouri and Kansas. Research is proposed that
will investigate the processes that control the flow history and geochemical
evolution of groundwaters in this large-scale flow system. Processes to be
examined include gravity-driven flow, fluid mixing and water-rock interaction.
This examination will be accomplished through the analysis of the waters for a
range of chemical and isotopic systems, including major and trace element
concentrations, H, O, Sr, Nd, B, U, Th, Pb and Ra isotope compositions, and rare
earth element concentrations. Models for the evolution of the groundwaters will
be evaluated using quantitative models that simulate chemical and isotopic
exchange during the migration of subsurface fluids. The models developed for
this flow system are expected to have significant implications for a variety of
geologic and environmental issues, such as the origin of basinal brines and Pb-
Zn ore deposits, the transport of radionuclides, trace metals and hydrocarbons
in the Earth's crust, the diagenesis of sediments and the management of water
resources.
