Ceramics are used increasingly for structural applications in view of their high
temperature stability and high hardness. Unfortunately most ceramics are very
brittle and possess low fracture toughness values. One way to increase the
toughness of structural ceramic materials is to prepare composites with ceramic
whiskers as reinforcing fillers. The methods for producing these fillers
currently are rather expensive. The P.I. proposes a simple new method of
producing Beta-sialon fiber in SiO2/C/Na3 AIF6 mixed melt in flowing nitrogen
gas. The proposed research will address the yield and structure of Beta-sialon
whiskers, reaction mechanism and optimum processing conditions.
