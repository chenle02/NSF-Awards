Abstract EEC-9615556 Fickas This award provides funding for development of
Intranet capabilities of SERC developed software. The proposed research
addresses the next goal of SERC intranet research by taking the SERC software
outside of the applications developed particularly for SERC to more generalized
applications. Using the intranet built for VSERC as a basis, the research
proposed will "bundle" the applications of VSERC along with other capabilities
such as text and data submission, security, text analysis, retrieval, editing
and resubmission by remote users, and creation of a database. The research
builds on existing VSERC capability and other tools into a "toolkit" for the
creation of intranet services in various settings. This research seeks to
integrate services and capabilities into one system.
