This award supports the participation of US-based researchers and students in
the conference "From Permutation Groups to Model Theory" to be held at the
International Centre for the Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland during
the week of the 17th to the 21st of September, 2018.

This workshop will bring together researchers in three different fields: model
theory, group theory and combinatorics, with a touch of computer science as
well. Expected topics include: the model theory of pseudofinite groups
especially as it relates to approximate subgroups and model theoretic tameness,
interactions between computational learning theory and model theory in the area
of VC-dimension, the subject of asymptotic classes and measurable structures,
and the theory of Jordan permutation groups. Details about the conference may be
found at http://www.icms.org.uk/permutationgroups.php .

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
