With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Dr. Christopher Calderone from Carleton College. Small
molecules, produced by microbial cells and known as non-ribosomal peptides are
the source of dozens of clinically useful medicines, including antibiotics and
anticancer drugs. The structures of these molecules is incredibly complex and
diverse, but they are all produced by "assembly lines" that are made up of only
a handful of different types of repeating biological machinery. This research is
identifying new types of biological assembly line machinery that can explain the
origins of a large number of non-ribosomal peptides and ultimately allow the
design of new varieties that are not currently accessible. The new varieties
could have valuable therapeutic potential. An additional important component of
this project is the development of the LearningWorks program in downtown
Minneapolis to teach underserved middle-school students molecular biology
concepts and techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is aimed at
characterizing a predicted subclass of condensation domains involved in non-
ribosomal peptide biosynthesis. Though non-ribosomal peptide synthetases have
been extensively studied over the past decades, mechanistic reasoning and
bioinformatic analysis suggests that there is a broadly distributed, but as-yet
uncharacterized, subclass of the condensation domain involved that is able to
catalyze dehydration in addition to canonical amide-bond formation. These
experiments are aimed at reconstituting the biosynthetic pathway from
Pseudomonas aeruginosa that leads to aminomethoxy-trans-butenoic acid (AMB) in
vitro, the centerpiece of which is a predicted condensation domain-catalyzed
dehydration. In addition, this funding supports the development of educational
modules for incorporation into the undergraduate teaching lab and the curriculum
of LearningWorks, a public-private partnership in downtown Minneapolis that
serves middle-school students from underserved populations.
