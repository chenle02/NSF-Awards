The purpose of this research is to develop a control scheme for laser machining
to ensure optimal and repeatable process operation. The research will
concentrate on developing sensing techniques for laser machining processes,
developing a new sensor integration approach, refining laser machining control
models, developing a set of sensor models and formulating a controller design
for responding to changes in state variables.
