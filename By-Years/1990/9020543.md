This proposal continues research on the saddle point method and applies the
complex coordinate approach to compute resonance widths in atoms. Of particular
interest are branching ratios between optical and Auger channels, highly excited
four and five electron systems, core excited Auger states, spin dependent
processes and the interpretation of experimental data of highly excited states.
