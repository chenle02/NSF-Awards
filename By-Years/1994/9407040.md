This award funds a research planning workshop on object representation in
computer vision. The workshop will be held on November 2-4 at the City
University of New York in New York City, and will bring computer vision experts
together to formulate a set of proposed representational schemes and a
methodology for evaluating and comparing different approaches. A report will be
produced for wide dissemination, which will contain a review of existing
research and recommendations for future research. The workshop is jointly funded
with ARPA. To enhance the educational impact of the event, each participating
institution will be invited to send one student to the meeting.
