This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research on grassland
microbial ecology between R. Peter Herman of New Mexico State University and
Anna Martensson of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The award
adds an international dimension to the Jornada LTER (Long-term Ecological
Research) site on desert grasslands and allows for comparative research with
pasture grasslands near Uppsala, Sweden. The objective of the research is to
study: (1) changes in microbial community structure and function associated with
woody plant invasion intograsslands; and (2) the transfer of nitrogen between
legumes and non-legumes and the role that mycorrhizal fungi play in the
transfer. The investigators will compare juniper and rose shrub invasions of
pasture grasslands with creosote invasions of desert grasslands. They will also
study questions related to mycorrhizae mediated nitrogen transfer. This
international project connects two long-term ecological research sites with two
distinctive ecosystems. It allows for comparative investigations and for the
development of long-term data sets collected in the United States and Sweden.
