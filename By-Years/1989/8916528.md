Studies of how investments in roads and other forms of physical infrastructure
affect regional economic development in developing nations have tended to focus
on large-scale economic activities. Over the last few decades, however, a major
share of the economic growth in developing nations has been in small-scale
enterprises (SSEs), some of which operate within formal legal structures, some
of which do not. The concentration of investments in infrastructure in many
nations have benefitted larger urban centers, often to the relative detriment of
smaller cities and rural areas. This doctoral dissertation proposal will examine
the relationships between infrastructure investments, the establishment of
small-scale enterprises, and the growth of market centers and nearby locales in
rural parts of Kenya. Existing and potential SSEs will be identified through
census inventories and financial records, leaders from a sample of SSEs will be
surveyed to determine how current and perceived investments in infrastructure
affect locational decisions, and a more general model of regional economic
impacts of infrastructure improvements will be developed. This project will
provide valuable data and analyses of how decisions to improve the
infrastructure within developing countries affect the economic vitality of rural
areas. Although focusing on a case study in Kenya, the insights from this
project will be of great use to persons conducting related work elsewhere. This
project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar
to continue to develop independent research skills.
