This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to accelerate
construction of humane, efficient and intuitive user interface (UI) - a system
of small, wireless, gesture-sensitive displays that act in concert as one
interface. People can efficiently execute cognitive tasks through spatial
manipulation of groups of physical objects.

New gesture-based UIs recently launched into the market indicate that market and
technology conditions are right to develop multi-object interfaces - systems
that elegantly connect the (increasingly smart) world of physical objects to
networked digital information. If successful, the approach will provide a UI
that can address a broad range of human-computer tasks, from media creation to
data analysis to social communication. In the immediate term, a novel
interactive entertainment system, building on existing, successful set of game
applications will be deployed. Historically, the entertainment domain has
provided a profitable staging area in which to introduce novel UI systems. This
market is large, has price flexibility, and its consumers have a demonstrated
desire for novel interactions.
