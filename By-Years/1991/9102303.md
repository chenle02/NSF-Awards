This development project will provide a CCD-based x-ray area detector system
for collecting and processing diffraction data form protein crystals and other
macromolecular assemblies using laboratory x-ray sources. The detector will have
a 115 mm- diameter active area, 1024X 1024 resolution elements, a dynamic range
of 4000, a DQE of up to 0.6, and a readout time of &lt;6 seconds. The system
will be a fully-tested, integrated data- collection package, and include the
detector, a UNIX-based workstation, software, a goniometer, and documentation.
The performance, cost, availability and reliability of each component will be
considered n the design, so that the system can be widely distributed. The
individual components will be thoroughly characterized, and the complete system
tested extensively by collecting data from a variety of protein crystals. This
integrated system will be ready for use, without need for further hardware or
software development.
