This is a SBIR Phase I project. The goal of the project is to develop an
improved CCD camera for X-ray imaging system for protein crystallography. The
immediate objectives are to test the feasibility of using fiber optically
coupled CCDs for protein crystallography and to study methods for correcting the
distortion in fiber optic bundles. Cameras of the type proposed here are
expected to be suitable for a variety of medical, scientific and industrial
radiography applications.
