In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Nessan J. Kerrigan of the Department of Chemistry at Oakland
University will explore the development of the catalytic asymmetric ketene
heterodimerization reaction and its applications. While catalytic
homodimerizations of ketenes have received some attention over the last twenty
years, ketene heterodimerization has remained a very underdeveloped reaction,
despite its great potential. Problems associated with the thermal ketene
heterodimerization reaction include poor ketene heterodimer regioselectivity,
competing ketene homodimerization, low ketene heterodimer yields, and absence of
asymmetric variants. Professor Kerrigan's group will investigate a stepwise
mechanistic approach, promoted by a chiral alkaloid organocatalyst under mild
conditions, rather than a (concerted) thermal cycloaddition approach, in order
to facilitate a regioselective and enantioselective heterodimerization reaction.
Some applications of the methodology toward the synthesis of biologically active
molecules will be investigated and aldol reactions of ketene heterodimer-derived
metal enolates will also be evaluated. This work could lead to more efficient
and flexible access to building blocks useful for the preparation of an array of
structurally complex and biologically active molecules. Such chemistry will
contribute to green synthesis as the proposed ketene heterodimerization
methodology avoids the use of metal catalysts. Successful development of the
methodology will have an impact on the pharmaceutical and chemical industries,
as it will provide ready and inexpensive access to a number of desirable
building blocks for complex molecule construction. This project will provide
excellent training of students, ranging from undergraduate to post-doctoral
levels, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the
sciences.
