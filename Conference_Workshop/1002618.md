Advances in the theory of partial differential equations have had profound
implications and applications in mathematics, science, engineering and industry.
The interplay between partial differential equations and applications has been
particularly interesting in geophysical fluid dynamics and climate dynamics. The
investigator and his colleagues hold an International conference on Advances in
Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and their Applications to Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics during May 31 - June 4, 2010 in Fudan University, Shanghai,
China. Funding supports US researchers, in particular, junior, women, and under-
represented researchers, to attend the conference. The conference contributes in
promoting, enhancing, and stimulating international research interactions and
collaborations in the mathematical sciences, more specifically, in applied and
computational mathematics.

The aim of this international conference is to bring together experts who work
on diverse frontiers of nonlinear PDEs and their applications to geophysical
fluid dynamics to survey recent progress and current challenges, to discuss how
new ideas and methods could advance the field in coming years. The conference
involves a large number of researchers from the United States, China, and other
countries, and contributes significantly to the development of the international
applied and computational mathematics community. A special forward-looking
session is arranged for panel discussions, focusing on the challenges and
opportunities facing the fields of nonlinear partial differential equations and
geophysical fluid dynamics. Findings from this special session, together with
other papers by the speakers and the participants, are published in the Chinese
Annuals of Mathematics.
