This project uses Autocad Release 11 with Advanced Modeling Extension executed
on 80386 DX class computers equipped with six megabyte RAM, 80387 math
coprocessor, 14" VGA 640-480 PIXIL graphics monitor, 80 megabyte hard disk
drive, and 33 mhz speed with cache memory. Input/output is accomplished using a
digitizer / laser jet printer. These tools are used while teaching design
visualization and design communication. The solid model 3-D database allows the
introduction of mass properties analysis into the Engineering Design Graphics
course. Also, the value of this database in analysis, manufacturing and
construction and design documentation is discussed and demonstrated. The Barr-
Juricic model of the modern Engineering Design Graphics course is followed as
outlined in the paper, The Engineering Design Graphics (EDG) Curriculum
Modernization Project: A White Paper Summary, presented at the NSF Symposium on
modernization of the Engineering Design Graphics Curriculum.
