National Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program.
The ability to selectively modify material interfaces is important for: the
surface hardening for mechanical or corrosive wear resistance, the production of
thin films on semiconductors for advanced microelectonic devices, the deposition
of polycrystalline and single crystalline diamond thin films for several
advanced technologies, and the fabrication of advanced catalytic materials. The
focus of this research is to study in detail, using both experimental techniques
and mathematical modelling, the basic mechanisms, kinetics and dynamics of
relevant chemical reactions at material interfaces. Concomitant with this
effort, alternative (non-thermal) methods to promote chemical reactions,
selectively, at interfaces will also be studied. The work will use an ultra-high
vacuum scattering apparatus to investigate the influence of: (1) molecular
kinetic and vibrational energy, (2) the bombardment of surface species with
ions, radicals electrons and energetic neutral rare gas atoms, (3) intense
electromagnetic radiation (laser and synchroton), (4) substrate heating and (5)
surface and bulk additives (dopants, promoters and inhibitors) on chemical
reactions relevant to thin film formation. The initial experimental work will
include studies of the surface chemical processes inherent in the formation of
silicon nitride films and in the doping of silicon.
