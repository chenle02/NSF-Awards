This proposal addresses the biosynthesis of complex iron-sulfur clusters in
nitrogenase. The formation of these clusters requires participation of multiple
accessory proteins, and the function of several of theese proteins, products of
the nifS, nifU, and nifM genes, will be investigated. The nif gene products are
all purified and available. Proposed studies will determine whether or not nifS
catalyzes formation of an enzyme-bound persulfide which is the ultimate S donor
in iron-sulfur cluster formation and whether nifU and nifM are involved in iron-
insertion. These studies will require development of a biochemically functional
resonstitution system. %%% The biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters is a poorly
understood process whose significance goes well beyond the nitrogenase. In
addition to redox systems, iron-sulfur enzymes are involved in hydrolytic
processes as well as in linking transcription to the cell's redox state or iron
loading. The use of biochemical and genetic approaches to the assembly of the
nitrogenase iron-sulfur clusters will be of general importance and will
establish a paradigm for studies of other iron-sulfur and iron-molybdnum
centers.
