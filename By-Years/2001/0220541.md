The objective of the program is to develop a student support and scholarship
program that builds on established relationships with local industry and with
alumni. Students selected for the program based on financial need and academic
potential receive annual grants of $3125, for up to three years, as
encouragement to complete a degree in computer science or mathematics. These
grants are used to reduce the loan and employment portions of the students'
financial aid packages, rather than to replace grants from other sources. Thus,
they provide substantial economic incentive to the students. Each of the four
years of the program, 31 students majoring in computer science or mathematics
are selected. Individual students are eligible beginning in their second year,
and receive funding for up to three years, provided they continue to meet the
eligibility criteria. In addition to meeting financial need and nationality
criteria, the student must demonstrate the potential for academic
success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the program receive individual
guidance from faculty and student support professionals, including the College's
full-service Career Center. However, the most noteworthy aspects of the student
support are those that connect outside of the College. Each year, students in
the program are taken on trips to visit at least two companies in the region and
talk with alumni there. Additionally, alumni employed at a wider sampling of
employers participate in an annual "round table" discussion held at Gustavus.
Last, but not least, alumni volunteers stay in touch with a few students each,
in order to provide individualized mentoring. Frequent contacts with local
industry, and in particular with alumni, provide the reminder that an exciting
career awaits those who are well prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
