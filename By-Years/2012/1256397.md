THhis RAPID requestaims to collect a new and exciting data set that will support
geyser eruption&lt;br/&gt;research currently funded by the National Science
Foundation. The goal of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to create a short-term
seismic array that will monitor and characterize the seismic&lt;br/&gt;behavior
of the shall subsurface at El Tatio Geyser Fields. This is the third
largest&lt;br/&gt;geyser field in the world. Due to the more relaxed stance on
marginally invasive&lt;br/&gt;scientific investigations, El Tatio is an ideal
location to deploy such a network. The data&lt;br/&gt;will be unique in sensor
density and duration. Consequently, results will likely surpass&lt;br/&gt;those
for any other geyser field. The goal is to characterize subsurface processes
resulting in seismic vibrations and&lt;br/&gt;correlate these sources with
surface eruption characteristics measured by Michael&lt;br/&gt;Manga?s group (at
UC Berkeley). The concurrent measurements of temperature,&lt;br/&gt;discharge
rate, eruption height, eruption duration and recurrence time, will make this
data&lt;br/&gt;set completely unique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world?s third
largest geyser field, El Tatio is a key geotourism location.
Better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the subsurface processes for such locations
will eventually help&lt;br/&gt;education the broader public. Geyser eruptions
are also key for understanding volcanic&lt;br/&gt;eruption processes as well as
constraining important properties for geothermal energy&lt;br/&gt;generation.
Because this is a unique data set, and the data will be archived at the
IRIS&lt;br/&gt;DMC for posterity, we anticipate that the data will contribute to
further investigations&lt;br/&gt;into geothermal and geyser processes.
