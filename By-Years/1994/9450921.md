9450921 Shaw Rio Salado Community College has purchased microcomputer hardware
and software to enhance faculty and student support in Science and Math courses
through the use of microcomputer-based laboratory teaching and learning systems.
Serving primarily female (64 %), single-headed-of-households, and by utilizing a
multi-disciplinary, integrated curriculum model which allows Science and Math
students access to experiments which do not currently exist due to space and
funding limitations, Rio Salado improves the chances of such students continuing
their education in Science and Math and provides a continuing educational
experience outside the "traditional" classroom site through modemed instruction
and tutoring during "non-classroom" hours. Rio Salado assists science students
through computer-aided classroom instruction and interactive computer laboratory
simulations utilizing existing software packages and electronic networks.
