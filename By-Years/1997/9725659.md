9725659 Wadhwa The main goal of this proposal is to gain better constraints on
early condensation, accretion and differentiation processes and their chronology
in the solar system through geochemical and isotopic studies of meteorites. The
proposed research has implications not only for the formation of planetesimals
in the asteroidal belt, but also for the early history of the Earth. The work
plan is comprised of two main lines of research on undifferentiated and
differentiated meteorites and involves isotopic measurements of long-lived and
short-lived ("extinct") chronometric systems. The first project involves the
determination of Al-Mg, Mn-Cr and initial Sr isotopic systematics in the
refractory calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from primitive carbonaceous
chondrites and has implications for high-resolution chronology of the early
solar system relative to these earliest formed condensates. The second project
involves the determination of Sm-Nd systematics of phosphates in pallasites to
establish the timing of core-mantle segregation on their asteroidal parent body.
The constraints offered by these two projects will provide a better resolved
picture of the timing and geochemical consequences of the early processes
operational in the inner solar system.
