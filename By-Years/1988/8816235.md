A one-year study to explore and develop an oxidation process for III-V
semiconductors in an OMCVD system is proposed. The oxidation can serve the
purpose of either in-situ cleaning or mask generation for selective epitaxy,
utilizing the different oxidation and sublimation temperatures of various III-V
compounds and their oxides. In-situ oxide mask generation not only reduces the
processing procedures for selective epitaxy but also provides better
semiconductor-oxide interfaces. Preliminary experiments carried out in a
modified reaction chamber with an additional oxygen inlet and exhaust has been
extremely promising. Successful development of this project will create new
revenues for both semiconductor processing ("all-vacuum" process) and III-V MOS
devices.
