A workshop will be held to present and discuss data relevant to the question of
how early nervous systems evolved. Specialists in various disciplines working
with a range of primitive organisms will attend. Three major areas of the
nervous system will be examined. (1) Excitability--the presence and properties
of voltage-gated ion channels. (2) Intercellular communication-- the methods
used by cells to communicate with one another. Intercellular communication in
very primitive organisms may be the forerunner of synaptic transmission in
higher nervous systems. (3) Sensory transduction--the ability of cells and, in
higher animals, specialized sensory receptors to transduce environmental stimuli
into useful cellular events. The workshop will last 4 days and consist of talks
by invited experts, poster sessions for presentations by other participants and
organized discussions "lead" by recognized experts.
