This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
increased quality control in the cement industry. Quality control is vital in
conserving natural resources And energy. If, for example, cement is not mixed
with desired specifications, the mixture must be wasted. When one considers the
energy expended in the various kilns and mills, the wastage is not only of
materiel but tremendous energy as well. Once the mixture has been incorrectly
produced, it may not in most cases, be economically feasible to correct the
defects. This project will develop an on-line cross-belt mineral analysis system
to ensure quality control. The system will couple two new technologies: a new
long-lived electronic neutron generator and a new method of data analysis. It is
hoped that the resulting system will have increased sensitivity over current
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial benefit of this technology aims to
improve the quality of products produced by the cement industry. With on-line
analysis, incorrectly mixed products can be corrected before the milling and
drying processes. Thus, resources and energy can be conserved.&lt;br/&gt;
