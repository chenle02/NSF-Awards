A unique field and laboratory facility for the study of surface and subsurface
hydrogeology is being installed. This facility will provide students with the
opportunity to observe the short and long term components of the hydrologic
cycle in relation to the behavior of atmospheric, surface water and groundwater
environments. Included among the capabilities of the facility are: (1) the
ability to drill, case and test groundwater boreholes, (2) use of a networked
field portable computer system, (3) completion and interpretation of borehole
geophysical logging, and (4) collection and interpretation of remote sensing
images. The facility will provide significant educational opportunities for
undergraduates enrolled in courses offered in civil engineering, earth sciences
and pre-engineering.
