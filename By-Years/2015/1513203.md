This infrastructure proposal supports the acquisition of a multi-robot team
suited for operations in coastal environments. The robot team consists of two
underwater vehicles (AUVs), three surface vehicles (ASVs), as well as unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs): two fixed-wing UAVs and two quadrocopters. The target
domain is the coastal waters of South Carolina. In several applications such as
environmental monitoring, homeland security, resource utilization, and
contamination tracking, there is a need to track a mass of water, record a set
of properties, such as salinity, temperature, presence of different substances,
and also record the position and boundaries of the said body. The proposed
infrastructure will enable computing research for addressing the above problems.

This project revolves around enabling research on several CISE research fields
at the University of South Carolina, including algorithmic development for
multi-robot coordination, path-planning and state estimation; planning under
uncertainty; sensor fusion from different modalities; and human-robot
interaction.
