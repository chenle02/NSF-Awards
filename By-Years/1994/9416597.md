Abstract ATM-9416597 Broecker, Wallace S. Columbia University Title: AMS
Radiocarbon Measurements Aimed at Improving Our Understanding of the Events
Associated with the Last Glacial Termination The objective of this project is to
learn more about the nature of the climate changes which brought the Earth from
full glacial to full interglacial conditions between 14,500 and 9,500 14C years
ago. Two aspects are addressed. As heat transport to high latitudes depends
critically on the pattern and rate of deep sea ventilation we need to learn more
about paleo circulation. Radiocarbon measurements on coexisting planktic and
benthic foraminifera from deep sea sediments offer important and as yet largely
untapped information. Second, ocean circulation may have ceased between Heinrich
layer #1 (14,300 14C years ago) and the onset of the Bolling (12,700 14C years
ago). Evidence is accumulating that a pronounced trans-USA wet event following
the pattern seen during El Ninos occurred during this time interval.
