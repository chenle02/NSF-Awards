This is a cooperative US-USSR research project involving the Institute for
Physical Science and Technology of the University of Maryland and the Oil and
Gas Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. The research
is concern with the development of theories of static and dynamic critical
phenomena. The goal is to develop accurate representatives of the thermodynamic
and transport properties of fluid mixtures in the critical region which can be
used for engineering applications such as the evaluation of thermodynamic cycles
involving supercritical fluids, heat- transfer calculations in supercritical
fluids, and evaluation of the performance of supercritical extraction process.
This project will involve three staff members at the Oil and Gas Research
Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences and one staff member of the Grozny Oil
Institute working at the University of Maryland. This cooperative research will
provide the US research group with a large amount of experimental information to
test their theoretical results. One graduate student from the Maryland group
will visit the Oil and Gas Research Institute and/or the Grozny Oil Institute.
