The social insects have always posed an evolutionary puzzle to biologists. They
have evolved worker castes which rarely or never reproduce. But how can genes
that prevent reproduction ever become common in populations? The answer is that
workers aid the reproduction of relatives who, though they do not express the
genes for worker behavior, do possess them and transmit them to their offspring.
A combination of theory and empirical evidence suggests that the aid given must
be considerable: workers must generally increase the reproduction of their
relatives by more than the amount that they decrease their own reproduction. How
such reproductive efficiencies of scale can be achieved is the main theme of the
proposed research, focusing on primitively social insects that have not evolved
caste specializations. Mathematical models will show how simple and plausible
patterns of mortality and reproductive timing can lead to these efficiencies of
scale. Field studies of wasps will serve to test the models. The result of this
work will be a better understanding of why some species engage in altruistic
behavior and why others do not. These insights may lead to the recognition of
similarities underlying the evolution of altruism in the social insects and
higher animals.
