This project is an investigation into algorithms and mechanisms that will allow
sophisticated staging of input and output data in desktop grids. Data staging
allows the system to store data semi-permanently in the underlying peer-to-peer
structure, and to run multi-node jobs (applications) whether they be tightly-
coupled parallel applications, arbitrary work-flows, or anything
between.&lt;br/&gt;We are building support for these application types by
extending our current desktop grid infrastructure in three distinct areas. We
are developing cluster identification techniques that can define arbitrarily-
sized virtual clusters through both passive and active network measurement. We
are incorporating virtual cluster descriptions into the underlying peer-to-peer
infrastructure to allow the scheduling algorithms to map multi-node jobs to the
clusters. Finally, we are incorporating data placement into the underlying
infrastructure; data is placed according to use and process
binding.&lt;br/&gt;This work will impact several research areas, including that
of distributed and decentralized scheduling, application description, network
characterization, and storage networks. In all of these areas our work will
explore the tension between local autonomy and global, aggregate
objectives.&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms and techniques will have broad
applicability across a wide range of emerging distributed and collaborative
applications. However, the work described here will also explicitly and
immediately impact the quality of research conducted by our collaborators in
astronomy and elsewhere. The ability to run parallel applications, and those
with more complicated inter-relationships, will enable whole new classes of
scientific applications to be run on top of ad-hoc grid-like
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
