9355462 Merideth The New York City Urban Cities Initiative (UCI) seeks funding
to develop a comprehensive plan of operation designed to increase the access,
participation, and success of New York's underrepresented students in
mathematics and science education. The UCI, a collaborative of key city
stakeholders, has assisted in the planning process and has helped to identify
key strategies that will lead to systemic reform in mathematics and science
education. The UCI planning team will agree upon actions to implement a shared
vision and will solicit endorsement from cooperating institutions. Planning
grant goals are: to identify the needs of the diverse communities served by the
school system; to involve key stakeholders in exploring the constructivist
learning theory; to collect and interpret base line data; to identify and
prioritize the use of fiscal resources; to build consensus for a vision of
mathematics and science education; and to prepare and submit a comprehensive USI
proposal for New York City Schools. Three groups (USI Systemic Management Team;
USI Cabinet; and USI Working Groups) will be convened to assist in the
implementation of the self-study.
