Doctoral Dissertation Research: Determinants of Social Movement
Participation&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Linda Molm (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Kelly Jean Bergstrand (co-
PI)&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Why
and under which conditions do people participate in social movements? This is a
classic question, and a significant amount of research has identified biographic
and contextual factors that shape movement participation. However, we know
little about the degree to which the substance of issues problematized by social
movements affects their ability to recruit participants and resources. This
dissertation research seeks to address this gap by assessing whether some issues
are inherently more powerful or appealing than others in attracting public
support -- and if so, why. To address this question, the project is grounded in
social psychological theory (specifically, Affect Control Theory), which helps
gauge cultural meanings associated with identities and behaviors and thus helps
identify enduring, systematic trends in the way people evaluate and perceive
events that go beyond personal histories. Central hypotheses derived from this
theory are tested by means of a vignette-based experiment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this research
have broader implications for society, such as providing information to the non-
profit sector or to policy makers. Findings from his study could help to explain
the popular appeal of some issues, and indicate why other issues that may be
important to address for the well-being of society may not have found sizeable
public support.
