9320539 Pak The aim of this project is to improve the current understanding of
dynamic soil-foundation interaction, from theory to practice, focusing on
shallow building foundations embedded in granular soils. The objectives are to:
(1) examine and delineate the applicability of existing analytical and numerical
solutions to the physical problem, (2) perform thorough parametric studies to
clarify the influence of important foundation and soil parameters on the dynamic
response, (3) identify and adapt relevant existing theories to granular soil
conditions by calibration, and (4) develop more comprehensive solutions and
formulas to deal with the stress-induced heterogeneous soil conditions intrinsic
to this class of problems. To achieve these goals, a fundamental series of
experiments will be conducted on a geotechnical centrifuge. The interest is in
determining the foundation response in vertical, horizontal, and rocking modes
under earthquake and random loading. Particular attention is given to the
development of a comprehensive data set on the effects of: (i) foundation size,
(ii) static foundation load, (iii) nonlinearities due to dynamic excitation
levels, (iv) foundation shape, (v) embedment, and (vi) intrinsic and global
parameters on the dynamic response. In addition to furnishing the much-needed
physical basis for further theoretical and numerical developments, this research
will allow the derivation of direct semi-empirical relationships which can be of
immediate value to designers. ***
