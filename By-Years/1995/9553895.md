9553895 Walker This Local Systemic Change project is submitted by a consortium
"Building Bridges to the Future." Extensive collaboration and commitment from
the three school districts (West Windsor- Plainsboro, Ewing and Lawrence
Township) is evidenced by the fact that the three district supervisors will each
commit 50% of their time to managing the project. The Building Bridges
partnership consists of the three districts and seven research and development
centers including American Cyanamid, Bristol Myers Squibb and Union Camp.
Additional science and education expertise will be provided by faculty from
Princeton University, scientists from Sigmi Xi, the American Physical Society
(APS) and AAAS, Trenton, N.J. When this staff development initiative is
completed every elementary teacher including ESL, bilingual and special
education teachers in all three districts will be employing the inquiry approach
to the teaching of elementary science grades K-6. The 5 year project will target
574 teachers in 15 schools. 40 mentor teachers will be assigned to school
districts in proportion to size. 26 volunteer teachers have already begun to
pilot FOSS, Insights and STC science modules in their classrooms. They will then
make recommendations for adoption by the school board. Total Request of
$1,722,000 is from NSF. Cost Share is $5,292,078.
