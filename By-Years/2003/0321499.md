This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II (SBIR) project will develop and
demonstrate a novel prototype solvent extraction (SX) device, which, by virtue
of its highly uniform shear and mixing intensity, has the potential to supplant
existing SX units in terms of extraction and phase separation rates. The
technical approach of the Phase II project is as follows: 1.) Develop
performance and scale-up principles for the SX device, optimize the hardware
configuration and process conditions; 2.) Apply the results to the design of a
reliable prototype SX system that demonstrates improved mass transfer and phase
separation, and decreased entrainment at power consumption levels equivalent to
existing equipment. The Phase I copper extraction work showed a 3-5 fold
improvement in extraction and phase separation rates over existing mixer-
settlers that are used in the minerals industry for the recovery of copper.

The commercial benefits of the ResonantSonic solvent extraction device to the
minerals industry are reduced equipment size and footprint, reduced solvent
loss, and improved electrowinning efficiency. Reducing the solvent loss to the
environment has great societal benefit as losses can exceed 100,000 gallons per
year per mine site. Other potential applications are metals separation, and the
recovery of vitamins, antibiotics, and other pharmaceuticals
