9219621 Wannamaker The PIs will study the magnetic and thermochemical properties
of synthetic single crystals of titanomagnetites emphasizing their dependences
upon long-range cation ordering. The effects of high- temperature
nonstoichiometry on the magnetic behavior in the titanomagnetite solid solution
series are poorly understood. Although nonstoichiometry and SRO have been
suggested as possible explanations for the disparate magnetic results obtained
in this mineral system, there has yet to be a definitive experimental
confirmation of this hypothesis. Further progress in understanding the crystal
chemistry and magnetism of titanomagnetites is now possible with an integrated
approach combining thermoelectric measurements, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and
magnetic measurements for a suite of titanomagnetite single crystals spanning
the range from magnetite to ulvosponel. ***
