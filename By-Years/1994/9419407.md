9419407 James Hanken The ultimate goal of this research project is to
understand the developmental basis of anatomical differences in anatomy of the
head among species. The studies focus on a unique population of cells--the
neural crest--from which many cranial tissues in vertebrates are derived. The
specific contributions of neural crest cells to the skull and cranial
musculature in different species will be assessed by labeling these cells with a
fluorescent dye early in development, before they begin to migrate throughout
the body, and tracking their movement to see which cranial tissues are derived
from the labeled cells. The research will also determine whether neural crest
cells contain the developmental information that is responsible for anatomical
differences among species and document the place and time during development
where genes are expressed that might mediate the development and adult fates of
neural crest cells. The research will increase our knowledge of the genetic and
developmental mechanisms underlying the integrated evolution of complex
anatomical structures.
