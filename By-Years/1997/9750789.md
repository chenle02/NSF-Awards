This project is enhancing the high-performance parallel processing laboratory
through the addition of an SGI Origin 2000 four-processor machine. The
department has grown tremendously in its experience, expertise, and curriculm
concerning parallel processing in the past 4 years, and this new machine is
allowing it to develop further, giving students access to state-of-the-art
hardware and enabling them to conduct experiments and run the type of
simulations that have previously been impossible.
