9616840 Clark This five-year project, sponsored by Texas A&amp;M's Engineering
Experiment Station, will carry out a program of teacher enhancement for physical
science teachers, primarily in grade 9. The project consists of three
components. One component is to select and provide 24 physical science teachers
a series of two week summer workshops over a four-year period. In the summer
workshop the teachers will learn up-to-date strategies for teaching physics and
chemistry content appropriate at that grade level. The second component is to
carry out follow-up workshops with these lead teachers at the annual meetings of
the Science Teachers' Association of Texas and the Texas section of the AAPT.
The third component is to support the lead teachers in the program to carry out
workshops which, over the life of the project, will involve 260 additional
teachers in grades 7-9 with over 100 hours of content/pedagogy instruction. The
program with the second tier teachers will be supported by project staff and
periodically evaluated in order to maintain high quality and determine impact.
The award is being matched with local funds in an amount equivalent to about 40%
of the NSF award.
