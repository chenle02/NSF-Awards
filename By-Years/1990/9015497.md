This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination Theory and
Collaboration Technology. This is one of eleven winners under that competition.
This study investigates certain aspects of the role of computerized information
systems as instruments of coordination in complex organizations. Questions
addressed in this research include: What kinds of coordination problems do
computerized systems actually resolve, and to what extent? What social and
economic impacts result from the use such systems? The research gathers
empirical data through cross sectional studies, comparative case studies and a
longitudinal survey of manufacturing firms that have relatively structured
systems that can be characterized as Computer Integrated Manufacturing. Results
expected from the research include empirically grounded accounts of the role of
computerized information systems in coordinating activities of complex
organizations and increased theoretical understanding of the economic and
sociological impacts of these information systems.
