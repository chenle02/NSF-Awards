This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused upon
demonstrating the feasibility of developing a new class of nonlinear optical
(NLO) materials. Continued advances in laser-based system components are
essential for keeping the nation's technology infrastructure at the forefront.
Diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser systems represent one of the most
important technologies being developed for many of these applications-with
particular emphasis being placed on generation of coherent light at heretofore
unrealized combinations of power levels and wavelengths extending from the IR to
the deep UV. A limiting factor in the development of DPSS laser technology is
the lack of suitable laser and nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals having optimized
physical properties. The development of new, efficient, robust, versatile, and
readily manufacturable fixed- or tunable-frequency laser and NLO crystals is
essential for the continued advancement of DPSS technologies. Demonstrating the
potential to develop materials having these required NLO properties-coupled with
unprecedented transparency into the DUV combined with superior thermal and
mechanical properties-is the Phase I goal.

Successful completion will lead to commercialization of a new class of materials
that will enable production of a variety of state-of-the-art laser-related
products. In the private sector, laser materials and systems have become
critical components in the manufacture of essentially all microprocessor-based
electronic devices and in a variety of medical therapeutic and diagnostic
procedures. Other key government and commercial uses include sensors for remote
sensing of pollution and atmospheric gases such as ozone and water vapor,
satellite-to-satellite communications, optical computing, and advanced
communications. Clearly, the potential market for this type of next-generation
technology is substantial and diverse.
