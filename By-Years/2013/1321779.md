The investigators design explicit sensing matrices in concert with signal
processing algorithms that outperform the state of the art. They progress
towards solutions of several of the most significant open problems in compressed
sensing and frame theory: (a) to find deterministic constructions of matrices
with the restricted isometry property (RIP); (b) to construct real and complex
equiangular tight frames (ETFs), including the maximal ETFs conjectured to exist
by Zauner; (c) to design fast and reliable algorithms for phase retrieval;(d) to
prove recent refinements of Wright's conjecture regarding the minimal number of
injective intensity measurements; (e) the Paulsen problem: How to project onto
the manifold of unit norm tight frames (UNTFs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Threat
detection requires high-quality sensing and effective signal processing
algorithms. Most modern threats have faint signatures, leaving intelligence
agencies with two main problems. First, you can't find what you don't seek. That
is, in order to detect a threat, you must first adequately sense the region of
interest. Because of this, part of the work focuses on new mathematics that will
improve sensing capabilities. This has the unfortunate side-effect of adding to
the existing fire hose of data, exacerbating the second main problem: "finding a
needle in a haystack." At the moment, analysts must wade through unimaginably
large data sets in order to extract actionable intelligence. As such, the
remainder of the work focuses on new mathematical ways of processing big data
sets.
