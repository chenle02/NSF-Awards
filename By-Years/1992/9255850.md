The recent focus in the mathematical community on calculus and the development
of the NCTM Standards for K-12 teachers is providing a framework to consider
mathematics courses taught at two-year colleges and lower division mathematics
courses taught at other institutions of higher education in this country. These
courses are important elements in continuum and pipeline issues, as well as
general mathematical needs of students not continuing in mathematically oriented
fields of studies. The American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges
(AMATYC) is undertaking a leadership role in designing a framework for systemic
reform of college mathematics in the curriculum leading to calculus. The first
stage is a meeting of an AMATYC National Steering Committee consisting of
leaders of AMATYC, MAA, and NCTM as well as others actively involved in the
development of innovative mathematics curricula and Standards . In the second
stage a small invited conference of a National Task Force is being held to
establish guidelines for the development of a set of Standards for two-year
college and lower division mathematics and to formulate a plan to build
consensus for mathematics reform among two-year college and university
constituencies.
