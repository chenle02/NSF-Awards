This project is establishing a Geographic Information System (GIS) teaching
facility that permits students to learn fundamental principles of computerized
cartography and spatial data analysis. GIS products including specialized maps
and overlays are being used in a variety of classes and teaching situations,
both as examples of computer applications and as specific aids in courses in
biogeography and applied ecology. The proposal includes funding for both
software and hardware needed in creating and maintaining a geographic database
for Mt. Desert Island and its immediate surroundings. Students select specific
regions of the island and by digitizing a series of maps containing data ranging
from hydrology to current land-use patterns, create a comprehensive picture of
the island's biogeography. As the project develops, increasing areas will be
covered and the resulting digital model will be available to both the academic
and general community as an aid in planning, resource use, and development. The
project provides students a unique opportunity to interact with and to learn to
apply state-of- the-art cartographic techniques. The grantee institution is
matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
