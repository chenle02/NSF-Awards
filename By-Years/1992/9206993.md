This grant supports the research of Professor G. Andrews as principal
investigator and Professor D. Brownawell as co-principal investigator. Professor
Andrews will work on problems in additive number theory. In particular, he will
concentrate on various conjectures arising from partition theory. Professor
Brownawell will work on problems arising from Diophantine approximation and
transcendental number theory in particular problems arising from Drinfeld
modules. This is research in the field of number theory. Number theory starts
with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one whole
number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was
originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half
century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
