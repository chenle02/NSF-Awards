A two-week intensive workshop for college teachers of astronomy is being offered
each summer for the next 3 years. The workshop features a hands-on approach to
laboratory work, both in the laboratory and in the observatory. The groups
review current laboratory resources and their adaptation to the needs of the
participants institutions, participate in observing with small telescopes, and
interact with invited speakers concerning topics currently at the forefront of
astronomical research. The resources of Sommers-Bausch Observatory and Fiske
Planetarium, both nearby on the campus, are being fully utilized.
