In this project, magnetic fields are used to break emulsions of water in oil.
Typically, water-in-oil emulsions are mixed with aqueous solutions containing
magnetic additives. The resulting water-in-oil emulsions contain magnetic
droplets which can be polarized by low-level magnetic fields. It has been shown
in Phase I of this work that the polarized droplets orient and aggregate in
drop-strings. These aggregated drops can subsequently be removed more easily by
settling. Thus, with low residence time and low energy consumption, emulsions
can be broken and drier oils can be produced. The fundamental aspects of
viscous, interfacial, and magnetic forces affecting the above processes are
studied. A continuously operated pre- pilot bench-scale unit will be built and
used to demonstrate the process on a larger scale than previously. The results
will be used to help evaluate the commercial feasibility of the process and help
evaluate additives and process parameters.
