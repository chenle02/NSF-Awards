Four campaigns launching stratospheric balloon flights above large thunderstorm
systems with sprite production potential are executed in Brazil to measure
associated electromagnetic fields and X-ray fluxes. The first data pertaining to
the electric field, electrodynamics, optical emissions, and X-ray production
within 100 km of a sprite are assembled, and used to improve our understanding
of underlying sprite physics and sprite energetics. The data are broadly
disseminated and cast as input to existing sprite models.
