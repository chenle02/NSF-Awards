This project includes research in recursion theory, which is the study of
relative complexity of computation, constructive mathematics, logic, and their
relations to computer science. In the purely recursion-theoretic areas, the
major topics are the study of the structure of the complexity degrees of
recursively enumerable sets and effectively approximable ones. The complexity
theoretic problems connected with computer science include various polynomial-
time problem considerations: pure structure theory and applications to algebra,
analysis, logic and other areas. The topics involving logic and computer science
center on intuitionistic mathematics as the proper framework for extracting
verified programs from formal mathematical proofs of existence.
