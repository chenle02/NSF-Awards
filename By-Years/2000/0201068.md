Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Farsi/Ramsay/Yu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for
the tenth West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS),to be&lt;br/&gt;held at
the University of Colorado on October 12-13, 2002. The WCOAS is a decade-long
tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United States. The
Seminar provides an invaluable opportunity for these researchers to stay abreast
of their field, fosters and reinforces ties among the western universities, and
provides&lt;br/&gt;young researchers with a forum in which to present their
latest results and discuss them with senior mathematicians. The high
concentration of operator algebraists in the western United States and Canada
has been one of the main reasons for the success of the WCOAS.
