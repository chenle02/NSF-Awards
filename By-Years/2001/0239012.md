ABSTRACT CTS-0239012 P. DOYLE, MIT

This program is an integrated approach to education and research of transport
phenomena with an emphasis on polymer dynamics. The research portion focuses on
a fundamental understanding of polymer collisions. DNA will be used as a model
polymer to directly observe the collision dynamics of polymers with obstacles. A
novel approach to producing dynamic obstacles will make use of self- assembling
magnetic colloids, in addition to added polymers. This will allow for a wide
variety of collision dynamics to be explored. Stochastic simulations will be
developed which take into account the microstructure and dynamics of the
obstacles themselves, in addition to the DNA. Multiscale simulations will be
developed for simultaneous simulation of DNA-polymer-colloidal collisions. This
work will have direct impact on the fields of DNA separations in lab-on-chip
devices where collisions ultimately lead to size separation and also
understanding the rheology of complex liquids where collisions can take the form
of transient entanglements. In parallel to the research portion of this project,
an integrated education plan will be developed. Undergraduates will participate
in micro research projects that will produce modules which will be used to
enhance graduate courses taught by the PI. These modules will stress molecular
aspects of transport phenomena. A new graduate course covering topics in
biology, polymers and engineering will be developed. A new undergraduate Hands
on ChE workshop recently introduced by the PI will be further developed. Science
teachers from the KIPP Academy (for at-risk grade school children) will be
mentored and an annual workshop for them.
