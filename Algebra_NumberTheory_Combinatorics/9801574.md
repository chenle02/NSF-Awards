9801574 Pandharipande In this project, Pandharipande will study Gromov-Witten
invariants of algebraic varieties. The project goals are to establish the
Virasoro constraints in certain fundamental cases, find new universal relations,
understand related Chow rings of spaces of stable maps, and study the
enumerative geometry of descendent integrals. Virtual localization techniques
will be studied and used. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.
Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
