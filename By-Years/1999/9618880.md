Abstract MARTIN, C. AST-9618880 An existing CCD system will be modified for the
detection of pulsations in the optical light of isolated, rotation powered
pulsars. The detection of pulsations will 1. provide unambiguous identification
of the optical counterpart of pulsars where the counterpart is believed to be
known and in those where it is definitely not; 2. distinguish between thermal
and non-thermal emission mechanisms producing the optical light; 3. allow a
measurement of the temperature of old neutron stars which are weak or absent in
the X-ray band; and 4. permit a search for evidence of heating by exotic
processes such as magnetic monopoles.
