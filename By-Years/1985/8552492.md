The focus of this research program in biochemical engineering is to gain a
fundamental understanding of the host-plasmid interactions that occur in
genetically engineered microorganisms and to explain how these interaction
affect the stability, growth kinetics, and product gene expression in
recombinant systems. The program is primarily experimental, but the experimental
data will be mathemetically modeled. Expert systems metholodlgy will be used to
control complex biological processes.
