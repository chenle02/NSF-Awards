Many theories have been advanced to explain high unemployment rates in the urban
black population. None taken alone offers a satisfactory explanation for the
high unemployment rate or for interracial unemployment differentials, so there
is much room for improved explanation. This dissertation project will
interracial differences in the job referral process, with particular attention
to the nature and extent of such networks among urban blacks, the effects of
neighborhood poverty concentration on network structure and composition, and
interracial differences in organization of networks and their effects on
employment. The study will combine quantitative analysis of the Urban Poverty
and Family Life Survey with 50 in-depth, face-to-face interviews.
