This research project will focus on the mechanism and factors responsible for
the development of autoimmune demyelination in the central nervous system.
Central nervous system myelin is a sheath that covers the axon and together
(myelin and axon) are functionally responsible for transmitting signals from the
brain to other parts of the body. Any disturbance in the association between
myelin and axons, such as myelin loss (demyelination), will have grave effects
on brain function. Demyelination is an immunological process that involves the
body's defenses, particularly the white cells (known as lymphocytes); once
activated, the white cells enter the brain and begin the process of
demyelination. Recent studies using a rat animal model have shown that the
process of white cell activation involves a particular antibody, a unique
protein produced by another type of white cells. The aim of this study is to
prepare large amounts of this antibody with highly restricted specificity, known
as monoclonal antibody, and document the molecular properties. A second
monoclonal antibody against the first antibody will be prepared, using both
monoclonal antibodies to study synergistic and/or antagonistic roles in the
activation of white cells. A clear understanding of the mechanism responsible
for activating and controlling the processes by which a particular white cell
destroys normal myelin of the central nervous system is anticipated, utilizing
the unique experimental system in this study.
