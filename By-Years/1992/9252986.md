Classroom ready materials on agriculture related mathematics will be developed
by a team of authors consisting of eastern washington secondary teachers,
Washington State University professors, and non-academic members of the
agriculture industry. The materials will be designed to supplement existing
secondary mathematics classes and will include student work pages, computer
exercises, cooperative learning projects and a video tape informing students of
the important role of mathematics in agriculture. Some material will be written
to include parental involvement. The materials will be based on information
gathered from practicing agriculture professionals in eastern Washington and
will be piloted in six districts. Additional teachers will be trained to use the
materials during a one-weak conference and through courses taught at the three
branch campuses of Washington State University. A communicating network of 80-
100 teachers will result which will help address problems of isolation in rural
districts.
