The questions of how the nervous system processes information about the sense
of touch and various levels of unpleasant sensations elicited by applying
stimuli to the skin are poorly understood. In this project the investigator will
conduct a detailed study of how spinal cord neurons discriminate between such
stimuli, an important part of the processing of the information. It is already
known that it is possible to categorize spinal cord neurons on the basis of the
type of stimulus that leads to their activation. For example, some respond when
the skin is stimulated with light touch, others when it is stimulated with
pressure, still others when the stimulus is heat, and so forth. It is not known
to what extent the various subcategories of tactile and mechanical stimuli can
be unambiguously identified by the responses of individual spinal cord nerve
cells. This is the issue to be addressed in this project. The approach will be
to record activity from many spinal cord neurons while subjecting the skin to
precisely controlled mechanical stimuli. In addition, activity will be recorded
simultaneously from spinal cord neurons and nerve fibers carrying the
information from the skin to the spinal cord, allowing the investigator to
discover how the neuronal signals are transformed during processing in the
spinal part of the nervous system. This is very basic information with a number
of implications in health related research engineering.
