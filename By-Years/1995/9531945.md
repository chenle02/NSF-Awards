Two widely grown grass species native to the western U. S. (Elymus glaucus and
Nassella pulchra) will be used as model systems to determine the extent of
adaptation across environmental gradients from coastal to interior sites in
California. Adaptation to local environments will be determined in a series of
reciprocal transplant experiments. If grass populations are found to be adapted
to the local environment, this would indicate that seed should not be
transferred outside of these regions. We will also determine the capacity of
non-local populations to evolve the attributes of the local populations. Results
of these studies will have broad implications for use of native grass germplasm.
If populations are able to evolve in this manner, strict maintenance of the
integrity of existing populations may in some situations be a lower priority
than seed collection methods that maximize the amount of genetic variation in
the initial collection. The proposed research will significantly increase the
current understanding of the importance of different aspects of native grass
adaptation to habitat restoration. Knowledge of 1) the spatial scales of local
adaptation, 2) the evolutionary potential for further adaptation, 3) the
evolutionary consequences of genetic contamination, and 4) the potential for
unwanted genetic shifts in seed production will enhance the chances of
successful establishment of native grass species. An increase in the use of
these native species will promote the maintenance of biodiversity and facilitate
the restoration of ecosystems with both healthy ecological function and
evolutionary potential. Findings from these studies should assist with
developing practical solutions that benefit both the native plant seed industry
and ecosystem health.
