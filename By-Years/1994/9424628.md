This research is concerned with the modeling and manipulation of uncertain and
inaccurate information in database systems. Database systems are evolving into
knowledge-base systems, and are increasingly used in applications where handling
uncertain and inaccurate data is essential. The research objectives include: (1)
Extending existing methods for the modeling and management of uncertain and
inaccurate data to contemporary database models such as object-oriented
databases, (2) investigating techniques of combining information obtained from
different sources and characterizing the application domains suitable for each
technique, (3) devising methods to estimate and update credibility of
information sources, and (4) applying these techniques to the extraction of
useful information from large volumes of data. The results of this research can
be used in realizing more intelligent database and knowledge-base systems that
are suitable for applications that require handling uncertain and inaccurate
information such as medical, legal and military applications.
