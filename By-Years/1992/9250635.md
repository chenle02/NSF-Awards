The goal of this program is to revise and improve the curriculum of the
sophomore, junior and senior year physics laboratory courses through the
introduction of the microcomputer. The program will address the need perceived
by the UMass/Boston Physics Department to provide training to students in the
use of a computer in making physical measurements, an essential skill to be
mastered by physicists in today's technological society. By integrating
computers into the laboratory environment students will receive a hands- on,
intuitive feel for the computer as a powerful tool available to supplement their
experimental work. The University of Massachusetts at Boston was established
with a mission to serve the urban areas of Boston. Our student body has a high
percentage of disadvantaged students who do not have access to computers outside
the university setting. Implementation of this program will provide them with
the laboratory experience in computer use which is required for them to compete
successfully upon graduation.
