This award supports development of the program for a 2.5- to 3-day workshop to
bring together PIs from across the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)
program. The PI is formulating a steering committee that is in turn identifying
topics and establishing a workshop agenda, including speakers and panelists.
Specific objectives of the PI meeting include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- to
stimulate coordination and collaboration amongst SaTC PIs working on different
projects;&lt;br/&gt;- to foster new collaborations between SaTC researchers and
researchers in other disciplines;&lt;br/&gt;- to share experiences and learn
from others' experiences in transitioning research into practice;
and&lt;br/&gt;- to develop ideas and share methods for improving education,
recruitment, and career development in
cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a strong community among SaTC
researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of existing
research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate students.
