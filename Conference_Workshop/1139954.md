The purpose of this workshop is to identify new research and educational
opportunities in the mathematical and computational geosciences with particular
focus on the NSF program on Collaboration in the Mathematical Geosciences. The
workshop will bring together the leading senior and promising junior researchers
to discuss current research trends in the mathematical and computational
geosciences. The workshop program will include presentations from the leaders in
the field which will inspire break-out sessions devoted to subfields as well as
to cross-cutting, interdisciplinary research. The participants will discuss the
scientific, educational, and organizational challenges faced by researchers
engaged in the field. The results of the discussions and conclusions will be
summarized in a white paper that will be presented to NSF for use when planning
future initiatives in mathematical geosciences.

The participants at the workshop, through open discussion, will identify the
promising research trends and hot topics in the field of mathematical and
computational geosciences. This, in turn, will stimulate the development of new
mathematical and computational research supporting the understanding of
phenomena in the geosciences and the coupled energy-environment system. It will
also support understanding of approaches to the management of energy resources.
The participants will identify important ways in which research and education in
the field can contribute to the new NSF-Wide Initiative on Science, Engineering
and Education for Sustainability (SEES) and programs such as Mathematics of
Planet Earth 2013.
