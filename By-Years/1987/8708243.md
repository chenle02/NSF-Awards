This proposal requests 50% support for the acquisition of alpha counting
equipment to be utilized in geochemical, glaciological, hydrological and
environmental engineering research programs at the University of New Hampshire.
The equipment will allow precise low level measurements of the natural and
artificial radioactive isotopes of plutonium, uranium, radium, polonium,
actinium, thorium, protactinium and lead for dating and tracer studies in
natural water, ice and sediments. The departments of earth sciences and civil
engineering are providing laboratory space and the university will provide the
remaining 50% of the equipment purchase costs.
