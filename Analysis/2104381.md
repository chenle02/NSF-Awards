The main subject of research is complex analysis, which combines complex numbers
with the theory of calculus. Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many
applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the
flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering
(for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for
instance: image processing and quantum computation). Moreover, complex analysis
of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject,
but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. The primary
aim of the efforts of the PI is to further the theoretical understanding of
complex analysis of several variables.

The PI will advance the understanding of the behavior of holomorphic maps
between bounded domains in higher dimensional complex Euclidean space. In the
field of several complex variables, there have been many deep investigations
into when holomorphic maps extend continuously to the boundary, the behavior of
iterations of holomorphic maps, and the properties of the biholomorphism group
of a bounded domain. The standard approach to studying these problems uses
methods from partial differential equations and differential geometry. The PI
will study these problems using techniques from the theory of non-positively
curved metric spaces. This approach is motivated by the great success of
geometric group theory, where metric space techniques applied to group theory
have lead to many important results. By using metric spaces techniques in
several complex variables, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which
are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make
progress on old problems. This part of the activity will enhance knowledge about
the biholomorphism group of complex manifolds, connections between the boundary
of a domain and its complex geometry, the iterations of holomorphic maps,
continuous extensions of holomorphic maps, realizations of Hermitian symmetric
spaces, and the complex geometry of certain smooth quasi-projective algebraic
varieties.
