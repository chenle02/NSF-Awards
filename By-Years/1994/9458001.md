Technical abstract: The focus of the research is to study the effects of
quantum phenomena such as energy level quantization and single- electron
charging on electronic transport in nanostructures. It is proposed to utilize an
atomic force microscope (AFM) with a conducting tip to serve as a local
electrostatic gate. A voltage applied to this tip will influence transport with
a submicron resolution. Some of the systems to be studied with such a technique
are chemically synthesized arrays of metal and semiconductor clusters with
diameters less than 10 nanometers. These studies will be carried out at
cryogenic temperatures. Other applications include local magnetic resonance
measurements including magnetic resonance imaging on a submicron scale. Non-
technical abstract: The focus of the research is to study effects of a single
electron on the properties of extremely small, atomic sized, devices. It is
proposed to utilize an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a conducting tip to
serve as a local electrostatic gate. A voltage applied to this tip will
influence transport with a microscopic resolution. Some of the systems to be
studied with such a technique are chemically synthesized arrays of metal and
semiconductor clusters with diameters of tens of atoms. Other applications
include local magnetic resonance measurements on scale of perhaps a thousand
atoms.
