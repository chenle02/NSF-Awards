Under this award the PIs will investigate the hypothesis that the amplitude of
millennial-scale climate variability is linked to continental ice sheet. They
will investigate millinennial-scale variability in the climate system for the
time interval of climate transition toward large and predictable extremes, the
mid Pleistocene between 0.9-0.4 Ma. At this time the Earth was operating under
different boundary conditions than those occurring form the present to the last
0.4 Ma. The research will provide high resolution (~500-800 yr) climate records
from the subtropical ocean. Planktonic foraminiferal d18O record will provide
the timing and amplitude of millennial-scale climate change between 0.4 and 0.9
Ma. Mg/Ca ratios of paired samples at orbital-scale resolution (~3 kyr) will
allow us to monitor overall SST changes in response to large-scale
glacial/interglacial climate change. The results will be the first to resolve
mid Pleistocene orbital and millennial-scale subtropical sea surface
temperature. The study is ideally suited to enhance environmental awareness in
undergraduate students, a necessity for schooling future high school teachers.
The study will be the focus of one senior thesis and will also involve two
graduate students who will gain a strong geochemical background.
