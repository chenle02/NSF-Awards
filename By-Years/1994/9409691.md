9409691 Sreenivas The research deals with the study of systems whose states have
logical or symbolic, rather than numerical values that change with the
occurrence of events called Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS). In this
proposal we outline research issues concerning modeling, analysis, control and
performance evaluation of DEDS. The supervisory control problem for a broad
class of infinite-state DEDS is solvable. This fact can be used to combat the
complexity problem in DEDS. This issue is the focus of the modeling and analysis
section. The control section addresses an archetypal problem in the control of
DEDS, where we propose a novel approach to the elimination of deadlocks.
Finally, in the performance section we consider an approach that will permit a
system designer to modify, automatically, discrete event simulation programs
that only estimate performance so as to efficiently obtain the sensitivity of
the performance. This sensitivity information can be used towards system
optimization using stochastic approximation techniques. ***
