This project is an experimental and modeling study of the flow of thin liquid
films over complex, textured surfaces of the type suggested for use in ordered
gas-liquid contactors. Such a surface might be a wire gauze or corrugated sheet.
Attention will be directed at the influence of surface geometry, flow rate, and
fluid properties on the formation and stability of dry patches. Modeling will
attempt to relate fluid flow phenomena on the "microscopic" or gauze wire scale
to the larger scale flows over the packing as a whole. Ordered packing offers
some advantages over conventional random packings for gas-liquid contacting. The
efficiency of contacting is determined in part by the liquid flow patterns.
