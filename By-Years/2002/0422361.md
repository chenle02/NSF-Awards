The Next Generation of Manufacturing Engineers Program for the Automotive Sector
Program awards scholarships to mechanical and industrial engineering students at
the bachelors, masters and doctoral levels who desire to prepare for careers in
automotive manufacturing. A total of 29 scholarships per year for four years are
awarded. Scholarships are awarded based on financial need and academic promise
with attention to developing a diverse workforce of automotive engineers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit focuses on an interdisciplinary and
vertically integrated approach, that is, approaching manufacturing from a total
supply chain perspective that considers the vehicle from design through assembly
to customer delivery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts includes outreach to
K-12 students and teachers, and energetic recruitment and retention of women and
African-American undergraduate and graduate students. Student recruitment,
support and mentoring are be provided by the BellSouth Minority Engineering
Program and the local student chapters of the Society of Women Engineers, the
National Society of Black Engineers, the Institute of Industrial Engineers, the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Society of Automotive
Engineers. This project ensures a supply of well-trained engineers in the
growing automotive industry in the Southeast and helps encourage further
development of this industry within the region, which has historically been
economically and educationally disadvantaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
