*** 9453128 McCully This is a five-year proposal to provide 100 hours of teacher
enhancement for the 2040 K-8 teachers of mathematics and science in Fresno
Unified School District (California). The district program will focus on
curriculum on the California adoption list with enhancement being done in
conjunction with the California Renaissance project (SSI) and teams involving
the California Mathematics Project and California Science Project. Schools will
be involved as units of enhancement with no school starting mathematics and
science at the same time. This project is being done in close coordination with
the Fresno Urban Systemic Initiative. Cost-sharing is listed at $ 8,750,000 or
150% of the project. ***
