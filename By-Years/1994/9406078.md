9406078 Ridgway PI will investigate the Cantwell Basin strata in Alaska,
addressing questions of depositional systems, basin development and
paleoclimate. Strata in the basin may preserve the Cretaceous- Tertiary
boundary, as well, offering opportunities to investigate fossil plant community
changes at this time in a high-latitude basin. Analysis of the Cantwell Basin
will be a key step in developing a regionally integrated data base for strike-
slip basins along the Denali fault system.
