An investigation of the potential for altering the boiling curve through the
effects of high velocity and high subcooling is proposed. The emphasis of the
research will be to design and perform experiments using a single liquid, Freon
113, flowing over an electrically heated cylinder in crossflow. The goal will be
to demonstrate whether the unstable transition boiling region can be averted
altogether under high velocity and subcooling for this liquid. The experiments
will be carried out in a flow loop capable of circulating liquids at high
volumetric flow rates. An electrically heated thin-walled Hastelloy-C cylinder,
0.635-cm in diameter, will be used as the test surface. It will be mounted in a
7.62 x 7.62 cm square test section. This research considers aspects of
convective boiling in the transition region. The transition region of the
boiling curve is typically avoided due t instability of the phenomenon as well
as the lack of control of fluids under these conditions. The proposal seeks to
entirely avert the transition region by employing a highly subcooled liquid at
high velocities. Evidence is presented in the proposal to indicate that this
conjecture has some justification, and this experimental effort will quantify
this phenomena.
