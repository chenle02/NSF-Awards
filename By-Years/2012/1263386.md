The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project has the objectives
to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research that advances the
state-of-the-art for creating interactive virtual experiences, with a particular
focus in human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and virtual humans.
Hosted by the University of Southern California Institute for Creative
Technologies (ICT), students are immersed in a unique multidisciplinary
community that combines academic researchers in computer science, psychology,
communications, and medicine with the creative talents of Hollywood and the
video game industry. The techniques and technologies advanced by ICT research
projects drive the creation of compelling virtual reality environments and
characters with immediate relevance to a broad range of application domains
including training, education, rehabilitation, medicine, and entertainment.
During the 10-week summer experience, students are also involved in weekly
seminars to provide training in research methodology and the process of applying
to graduate school, along with biweekly interactive workshops for team building
and mentorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The undergraduate student cohorts are
composed of a diverse palette of interdisciplinary backgrounds reflecting the
multifaceted culture of the institute, with a particular emphasis on selecting
individuals from underrepresented groups in computing and institutions with
limited STEM research opportunities. By engaging these students in
interdisciplinary research and better preparing them for graduate school, this
project has the potential to broaden participation from underrepresented
populations and increase enrollment and retention in graduate programs in
computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about this project can
