Slurm is an open source resource management and job scheduling system that is
widely used on small and large high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Slurm
is highly tuneable, with many settings that can significantly influence job
throughput, overall system utilization and job wait times. Unfortunately, in
many cases it is difficult to judge how modification of these settings will
affect the overall performance of the HPC resource. This project develops a
prototype version of a Slurm simulator that allows HPC personnel to tune Slurm
parameters, to optimize throughput or meet specific workload objectives without
impacting an HPC system in production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Slurm
simulator could have impacts far beyond computer science and the field of
scheduling. The ability to optimize scheduler parameters on production HPC
resources, most of which are significantly oversubscribed, has the potential to
dramatically improve job throughput for researchers and reduce the ‘time to
science’. The simulator would allow many different job scheduling schemes to be
rapidly evaluated, and implemented if they are useful or rejected if they are
not. Furthermore, the ability to model the impact of various features that
impact job execution time (such as network traffic, parallel file system loads
and node sharing) can be explored to determine if they merit additional
scheduler development work. The developed framework would allow researchers in
other science and engineering fields to incorporate their models, and study a
range of problems affecting the performance and execution of users' jobs on HPC
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
