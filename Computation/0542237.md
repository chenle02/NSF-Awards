The principle investigator and his collaborators plan to construct, streamline
and analyze a suite of multiscale data representation methods in various
nonlinear and geometric settings, as well as their applications. Some of these
multiscale representations include: free-form jet subdivision surfaces,
multiscale representation of vector and tensor fields on free-form subdivision
surfaces, wavelet-like transform of nonlinear range data, e.g. time series or
spatial arrays of data taking values at a manifold. The PI intends to explore
theoretical questions such as: When a traditional spline or subdivision method
is modified to apply to data which satisfy specific nonlinear constraints, how
would the curviness of the underlying nonlinear manifold affect the stability,
approximation and smoothness behavior of the original method? The PI and his
collaborators are also developing software tools for the fast prototyping and
computational analysis of these novel multiscale methods, as well as applying
them to real datasets. Fueled by the advances in various sensing technologies
(in optics, syntheture aperture radar, etc.), new forms of data type begin to
arise in many different significant fields in science and engineering, and it is
the task of mathematicians to help preparing the world to make good use of such
data. Obvious application areas include material sciences, diffusion tensor
imaging, hyperspectral imagery, computer aided design/animation, robotics
(motion planning), just to name a few. In each of these technologies, efficient
multiscale methods is a must for processing tasks such as the compression,
registration, fast search, browsing, structure reconstruction, etc.
