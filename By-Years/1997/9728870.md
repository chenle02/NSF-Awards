An isotope ratio mass spectrometer will be purchased for use in ecological and
environmental studies. Among the problems and systems to be probed are:
sensitivity to change in arid land ecosystems; water source and humidity
information and tree rings; carbon-13 and oxygen-l8 in modem tooth enamel; the
history of atmospheric carbon dioxide; and carbon isotope ratio variation and
stress tolerance in soybean.
