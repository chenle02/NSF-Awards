9705200 Rosenstein This project, coordinated by the New Jersey Mathematics
Coalition (and a major partner with the SSI) will use the recently completed New
Jersey Frameworks in mathematics and science as the core of a parent education
effort that will reach 300,000 parents of school age children in the state,
representing 50% of the parent population and all 603 school districts. This
project will be a vehicle for providing opportunities for parents to become
familiar with these standards. The project will undertake a three-stage approach
to parental outreach: (1) awareness activities, including the development of
materials printed in both English and Spanish, public television, and a Website;
(2) increasing involvement of parents through establishing a clearinghouse for
information; and (3) activation activities to help parents work more effectively
on mathematics and science reform efforts at the school, district, and state
levels.
