This project supports two anthropologists studying how pastoralists in Botswana
think about and manage their "life course", meaning their family size,
demographic composition, and wealth. The focus is on men's reproductive
decisions in a society where cattle is the main form of wealth and the kinship
system reckons descent primarily in the female line. Using a combination of
methods including in-depth interviews, participant-observation, time-allocation
studies and small-scale surveys, the researchers will learn how people manage
their income, wealth, and family ties in order to attain their desired level of
security and well being. Specific hypotheses to be tested are drawn from
evolutionary theory. This research is important because we must understand men's
reproductive goals and strategies in order to manage the growth of population.
Studies like this one provide case material for theory development to allow
scholars to predict the impact of policies designed to limit population growth.
