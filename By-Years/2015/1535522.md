Recent developments and availability of commoditized White Box (WB) and Bare
Metal switch designs along with open network operating systems have opened the
door for new and open source approaches to network software development.
Interest is growing in the research community in these devices and the
extraordinary development possibilities these devices enable, which may have
long term implications for greatly expanding the national infrastructure at
lower cost and with increased programming flexibility. Potential advantages of
this emerging movement to the research and education networking community
include; lower cost of ownership for commercial off the shelf hardware;
development on widely available Linux-based network operating system; easier
integration of network provisioning into available cloud orchestration tools;
reduced time in deployment and provisioning; and increased intelligence
throughout the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project at Indiana
University investigates the scalability, functionality, and performance of WB
platforms in combination with network operating systems and software defined
networking technologies including OpenFlow implementations. The project includes
creation of a testbed that is shared with network researchers.
