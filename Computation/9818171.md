This project consists of a series of interdisciplinary conferences in applied
and computational mathematics conducted by the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The conferences are designed to bring together
mathematicians, engineers, and scientists who are developing and applying new
mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms. A key feature of this series is
the inclusion of focused, interdisciplinary, academic/industry workshops in
which mathematical, statistical and computational scientists from academia can
interact with mathematicians, statisticians, and computational scientists,
engineers, and scientists in academia and in industry on specific areas and
problems of practical interest. The primary objective of the conferences is to
initiate new interaction among the creators and users of mathematics and thereby
contribute to the understanding of mathematics and encourage its application to
problems of society.
