Computer workstations and image sequence acquisition and processing equipment
will be acquired and dedicated to research in computer and information science
and engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects, all
concerned with the computational and algorithmic issues in processes and systems
that combine vision and motion. These projects include: (1) purposive vision in
robot exploration of three-dimensional scenes, (2) analysis of dynamic
photometric properties in image sequences, (3) motion planning for two whole-
sensitive robot arm manipulators sharing common space, (4) sensor-based motion
planning for a mobile robot operating in an unstructured environment, and (5)
tracking moving objects using snake models. This will provide facilities for
image acquisition, processing, motion planning and motion simulation, enabling
these projects to perform necessary experimental testing of the theoretical and
algorithmic methods that are being developed.
