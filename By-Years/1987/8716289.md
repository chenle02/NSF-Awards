This dissertation research seeks to examine the rise and growth of a steel firm
(Tata Iron and Steel Co.) in India under Colonial rule. The goal is to describe
various aspects of the steel industry in India as it developed over time,
concommitant with the worker's movement and the the Nationalist movement. This
research uses a case study approach to examine the internal and external forces
which influenced the course of industrial and labor history in India. The
project will contribute to an understanding of the processes of
industrialization more broadly as well as within India itself.
