The present work focuses on a new type of toughening mechanism -- extensive
diffused damage surrounding in the main crack-tip. The proposed research is
motivated by a recent discovery of a ductile fracture mode in strain hardening
brittle cement matrix composites (SHBMC) reinforced with 1-4 % polyethylene
fibers. Crack propagation is observed to be accompanied by extensive volumetric
inelastic deformation surrounding the crack tip, in addition to conventional
fiber bridging and pull-out in the crack wake. The off-crack-plane energy
absorption is found to be even higher than the fiber bridging energy in some
specimens we have tested so far, with total fracture energy reaching 34 kJ/m2.
This represents roughly 3400 times the fracture energy of the virgin matrix
without fibers. As reference, the fracture energy of aluminum alloys is between
8 - 30 kJ/m2. Experimental investigations on R-curve behavior, and on- and off-
crack-plane fracture energy partitioning will be conducted based on the J-based
fracture testing technique. Correlation between pseudo strain-hardening
processes in uniaxial testing and the spatial evolution of damage during the
ductile fracture process in notched specimens will be used to establish the
detail micromechanisms of the ductile fracture mode.
