9410201 Roy Large scale random forces acting on a dynamic systems can cause
deviation much above the critical threshold response level. After that level,
the system may immediately fail or it may switch to another unwanted regime,
such as the capsizing of ships in rough seas, free standing structural failure
due to ground motions during an earthquake, and extinction or explosion of
biological populations due to random environmental fluctuations. In this
research project, the probability of occurences is determined analytically using
nonlocal, asymptotic methods via Markov process theory. Both single and multiple
degree-of-freedom systems are considered with wide-band or narrow-band, Gaussian
or non-Gaussian random excitation. Comprehensive digital simulations are
conducted to assess the range of validity of the asymptotic methods. In
addition, analog electronic experiments of the mathematical formulations are
conducted which provide a useful hands-on complement to digital simulations of
nonlinear stochastic dynamics. ***
