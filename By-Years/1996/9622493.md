This grant is to support travel for the ACM Workshop on Applied Computational
Geometry to be held on May 27-28, l996 in conjunction with the second Federated
Computing Research Conferences (FCRC) in Philadelphia, immediately following the
ACM Symposium on Computation Geometry. This workshop is mainly designed to bring
together practitioners and theoreticians in computational geometry and other
related applied fields to discuss the current research and future directions in
these communities, to facilitate technology transfer from theory to practice,
and to identity future joint programs and collaboration. ***
