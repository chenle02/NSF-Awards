9632352 Yeh This action is to support U.S. participation in the International
Workshop on Tsunami Mitigation and Risk Assessment, to be held in Petropavlovsk-
Kamchatskiy, Kamchatka, Russia, August 1996. This workshop is organized by the
Institute of Computational Technologies, Russian Academy of Sciences,
Novosibirsk, Russia. The workshop theme is "the state-of-the-art of the problem
of long-term tsunami prognosis (estimation of tsunami risk)", and the following
topics will be discussed: (1) paleo-tsunami research, (2) historical catalogs
and data bases, (3) seismo-tectonics of tsunami, (4) numerical models of tsunami
behavior, (5) methods of tsunami-risk calculations, and (6) mitigation and
counter-measures The format of the workshop will be round-table discussions with
40-minute invited presentations on each particular topic. This workshop is a
follow-on to three major workshops on tsunamis held in the United States during
1995: Tsunami Deposit Workshop, Seattle, Washington, 21-23 May, and the two NSF-
supported workshops, Tsunami Measurement Workshop, Estes Park, Colorado, 28- 30
June, and Second International Workshop on Long-Wave Runup Models, Friday
Harbor, Washington, 12-16 September. In order to use the limited funds as
effectively as possible, the PI will establish close communication, via the
Internet e-mail system, with the US tsunami scientists and engineers who are
unable to attend the workshop. Tsunami researchers and practitioners are already
in close communication via the Tsunami Internet mailing list sponsored by the
NOAA (National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration) Pacific Marine and
Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle. Active participation of US
scientists and engineers in this workshop in Kamchatka will contribute
significantly to the continued efforts toward tsunami disaster mitigation, and
assure the continued activity and momentum in this important area of disaster
mitigation. ***
