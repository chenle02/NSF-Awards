This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
demonstrate a novel three dimensional (3D) ear camera technology that enables
audiologists to acquire multiple 3D images of external ear (auricle) and ear
canal, and to produce complete 3D digital ear model that serves as a "digital
ear impression". The digital ear impression data will be sent instantly to
manufacture's lab via the Internet, dramatically reducing the delivery time. The
digital impressions enable the hearing aid manufacturers to take advantages of
the latest breakthrough of CAD/CAM and rapid prototyping technologies. This
technology will permit mass product customization of hearing aid devices within
a one-day time frame.

The commercial potential would be a process that would drastically reduce the
time for custom-fit hearing-aid devices. Even including the quality insurance,
electronics calibration, and shipping, the entire process would be shorted from
weeks to a few days. More importantly, the digital impression technology will
improve the quality of fit, thus enhance the hearing functionality for impaired
people.
