This project deals with the properties and applications of balanced codes. In a
balanced code, each code word contains equal number of 1's and O's. These codes
find many applications in computer and communication systems such as noise
reduction in VLSI systems, fault masking in bus lines of VLSI systems, delay
insensitive communications in asynchronous systems, data transmission in fiber
optics, data storage in optical discs and magnetic tapes, and fault tolerant
synchronous circuits. The objective of this research is to develop design
methods for balanced codes suitable to these applications. Our aim is to design
codes which require low redundancy but at the same time have fast and simple
encoding/decoding algorithms. Other topics such as error correcting balanced
codes, asymmetric error correcting and detecting codes applicable to the above
mentioned applications will also be investigated.
