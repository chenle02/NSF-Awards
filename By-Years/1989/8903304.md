The recently erupting fields of computational geometry and algorithmic robotics
have demonstrated the essential nature of efficient algorithms for problems in
combinatorial optimization and graph theory. There are very few geometric
algorithms that do not have some graph theoretic component, either in their very
structure or in their use of data structures. The main thrust of this research
is to explore geometric problems that arise in applications to robotics and
computer vision, and bring to these problems the many tools of graph theory. In
some cases, new problems need to be formulated and solved; in other cases, the
methods currently being used will be investigated to see if there are possible
improvements that may come from the application of graph theoretic concepts and
algorithms. The basic goal is to prove (worse-case) bounds on the computational
complexity of problems, either by producing an efficient algorithm if one
exists, or by proving a "lower bound" such as NP-hardness. In cases of NP-hard
problems, the goal is to devise efficient heuristic algorithms, if possible with
provably good effectiveness. In particular, the investigation will include
important variations on shortest path and shortest cycle problems in robotics,
"beautification" problems in geometric modelling, visibility questions that
arise in graphics and computational geometry, and image matching problems that
arise in computer vision. //
