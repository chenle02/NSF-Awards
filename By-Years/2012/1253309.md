Wirelessly networked systems of intra-body sensors and actuators could enable
revolutionary applications with a strong potential to advance medical treatment
of major diseases of our times. Yet, most research to date has focused on
communications along the body surface among devices interconnected through
traditional electromagnetic radio-frequency (RF) waves; while the key challenge
of enabling networked intra-body miniaturized sensors and actuators that
communicate through body tissues is substantially unaddressed. The main obstacle
to enabling this vision is posed by the physical nature of propagation in the
human body, which is composed primarily of water, a medium through which RF
electromagnetic waves do not easily propagate. This project takes a different
perspective and investigates for the first time the fundamentals of ultrasonic
networking in human tissues through a closed-loop combination of mathematical
modeling, simulation, and experimental evaluation. The project is investigating
four intertwined research tasks, i.e, (i) ultrasonic channel modeling and
capacity analysis; (ii) physical/medium access control layer solutions for
ultrasonic communications; (iii) distributed and asynchronous cross-layer
control and resource allocation algorithms based on stochastic modeling of
ultrasonic interference; (iv) performance evaluation through a multi-scale
simulator and a software-defined testbed.

The project will integrate research and education with the following core
contributions: (i) establishment of a visiting scholar program with a focus on
ultrasonic networking and its applications; (ii) establishment of a new
graduate/undergraduate course on acoustic/ultrasonic networking, and development
of a new textbook on this topic; (iii) a broad set of activities to reach out to
underrepresented students; (iv) pursuit of technology transfer activities in
this field. The project can lead to novel, safe and energy-efficient methods of
communication between implanted medical devices and the outside world.
