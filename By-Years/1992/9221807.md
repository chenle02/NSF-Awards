FSU Marine Data Management and Research This program is a multi-year dual-
emphasis effort between U.S. data centers and laboratories of the states of the
former Soviet Union (FSU). One result of the recent political and economic
changes is that large volumes of irreplaceable historical marine environmental
data are at serious risk of bring lost to global research programs. Included in
these data are long-term observation of high potential value to ocean science
programs such as WOCE, JGOFS and other climate change studies. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), through its Environmental
Information Services, is working with counterpart groups of the FSU. Initial
program efforts are emphasizing oceanographic data rescue, quality control and
data intercomparison. Additional collaborative efforts between U.S. and FSU
researchers are developing new data access and display techniques, technical
applications in support of joint research efforts, and new information products.
This project is part of the US-USSR-(Russia) Agreement on Cooperation in Ocean
Studies.
