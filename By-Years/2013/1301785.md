The PI will investigate the Galois cohomology groups of function fields of
curves over number fields. Let F be the function field of a curve over a number
field. If p is a prime and F contains a primitive pth root of unity, a symbol in
degree n Galois cohomology is simply a cup product of elements in the degree one
cohomology modulo p. Voevodsky's theorem implies that every element in the
degree n Galois cohomology modulo p is a sum of symbols. It is proposed to study
boundedness of symbol length for F for each prime p. This study has consequences
for bounding the u-invariant of F. The PI also proposes to study questions
concerning the admissibility of finite groups over function fields of curves
over p-adic fields.

A basic pursuit of geometers and number theorist is to find common solutions of
polynomial equations. A homogeneous polynomial of degree two is called a
quadratic form. It is known that every quadratic form in at least five variables
over a totally imaginary number field has non-trivial zero, thanks to the Hasse-
Minkowski theorem. It is an open question whether every quadratic form in
sufficiently many variables over the function field of a curve over a totally
imaginary number field has a non-trivial zero. By a theorem of Voevodsky,
quadratic forms are classified by Galois cohomology invariants over any field.
We propose to study the existence of non-trivial zeros for quadratic forms in
sufficiently many variables over function fields of curves over totally
imaginary number fields, by studying boundedness questions for symbol lengths in
Galois cohomology.
