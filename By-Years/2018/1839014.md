The volume and heterogeneity of scientific data goes beyond a researcher?s
ability to find relevant data, make different formats interoperable, and deal
with difficult ontological and language issues. Progress requires bringing
together experts in data curation with experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to begin a dialog and collaboration on AI tools to span the gap between data and
its reuse. The PIs will organize the conference "Challenges and Opportunities in
Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse in the Data Revolution: Harnessing the Power
of AI"; the objective is to bring together diverse stakeholders including
research librarians and data managers, the AI community, and users and consumers
of scientific data to dialog around critical places in the data lifecycle where
AI could be groundbreaking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by
the National Science Foundation?s Public Access Initiative which is managed by
the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
