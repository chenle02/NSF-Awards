Although mechanized induction is relevant for science and technology, standard
methods, such as similarity-based learning, are seriously limited for learning
hard concepts from poorly understood domains. Several important domains, such as
protein folding, would benefit from more advanced treatment of data and partial
knowledge to construct new features that help similarity- based learning. The
goal of this project is to improve methods for feature construction, using
increased interaction between computer and user to take advantage of the
strengths of each. Two thrusts of this project are more dynamic construction and
more interactive refinement. For dynamic construction, the problem of
constructing representations is decomposed into several subproblems for forming
and selecting components for new features. Components are dynamically determined
by information contained in automated analysis of data and knowledge. For
interactive refinement, the approach allows partial specification of "hunches",
which can represent domain-dependent or independent heuristics. These fragments
of knowledge can be updated by the learning systems and re-examined by the user.
