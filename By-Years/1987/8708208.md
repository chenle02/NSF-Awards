The Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) is currently
involved in seismic research of the continental crust that requires intensive
computer use for data reduction, storage and interpretation. This proposal from
COCORP requests hardware and software for integrating COCORP computing with the
new Cornell Supercomputer Facility. The data to be interpreted is expected to
make major contributions to understanding the deep geology of the continental
crust all over the world. The dedicated minicomputer system utilized by COCORP
to date cannot fully accomodate the most modern processing techniques such as
pre-stack migration nor can it handle the needed concurrent processing of COCORP
and non-COCORP data sets required by global syntheses of seismic data.
