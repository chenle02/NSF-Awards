MIDDLE MATH is a project to improve the undergraduate mathematics preparation of
middle grades teachers. The project is focusing on the development of an
algebra/number class, and a precalculus course that forms a bridge from the
algebra class to the later calculus sequence. The curriculum development will be
based on experience and seminal recommendations by the NCTM, MAA, and
mathematics education researchers. The model for course development is grounded
in a dynamic cycle of research on the materials and their affect on student
learning. The project team includes mathematicians and mathematics educators.
The projects benefits from the strong institutional commitment to improve the
quality of teacher preparation , and a research video laboratory that
facilitates study of teaching and learning with new course materials and methods
of instruction.
