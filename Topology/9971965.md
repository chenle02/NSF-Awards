9971965 Eliashberg The central theme of this project is Symplectic Field Theory.
This is a new area that is yet to be developed. It emerged recently as a
generalization of Contact Homology Theory. The project has several goals. One is
to define new invariants of contact manifolds and their Legendrian submanifolds
and develop tools for computing these invariants. The second goal is to explore
new algebraic structures emerging from Symplectic Field Theory. The third goal
is to construct new enumerative invariants in Symplectic Floer theory that are
closely related to three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory but may be easier to
compute. Finally, Symplectic Field Theory should permit the development of a
relative analog of Gromov-Witten invariants for symplectic manifolds with
contact boundaries, and thus provide new tools for computing Quantum Cohomology
of symplectic manifolds. Symplectic Geometry and Topology has proven to play an
important role in different areas of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. The
old and newly discovered areas of interactions between Symplectic Geometry and
Topology, Hamiltonian Dynamics, Low-dimensional Topology, Algebraic Geometry,
Quantum Field Theory, and other fields generate a host of important problems. A
systematic development of Symplectic Field Theory, which is the main goal of the
current project, should provide answers to some of these problems, as well as
open new areas of applications of the field. ***
