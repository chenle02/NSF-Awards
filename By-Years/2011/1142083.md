Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Mt. Erebus is one of only a handful of volcanoes
worldwide that have lava lakes with readily observable and nearly continuous
Strombolian explosive activity. Erebus is also unique in having a permanent
convecting lava lake of anorthoclase phonolite magma. Over the years significant
infrastructure has been established at the summit of Mt. Erebus as part of the
Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory (MEVO), which serves as a natural laboratory to
study a wide range of volcanic processes, especially magma degassing associated
with an open convecting magma conduit. The PI proposes to continue operating
MEVO for a further five years. The fundamental fundamental research objectives
are: to understand diffuse flank degassing by using distributed temperature
sensing and gas measurements in ice caves, to understand conduit processes, and
to examine the environmental impact of volcanic emissions from Erebus on
atmospheric and cryospheric environments. To examine conduit processes the PI
will make simultaneous observations with video records, thermal imaging,
measurements of gas emission rates and gas compositions, seismic, and infrasound
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;An important aspect of
Erebus research is the education and training of students. Both graduate and
undergraduate students will have the opportunity to work on MEVO data and deploy
to the field site. In addition, this proposal will support a middle or high
school science teacher for two field seasons. The PI will also continue working
with various media organizations and filmmakers.
