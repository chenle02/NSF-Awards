This is a three-year effort to produce models of the high latitude ground
magnetic field variations as function of the solar wind and IMF conditions. The
work uses the same technique of spherical harmonic expansion that has been
utilized in the existing ?Weimer models? of ionospheric electrodynamics. In the
new model the scalar magnetic potential will be matched to ground based
magnetometer measurements. First, a static baseline model will be developed.
Next, dynamical information where the magnetic field is perturbed due to sudden
pressure pulses in the solar wind will be included through a superposed epoch
analysis, equivalent to a disturbance-response classification process. Datasets
from the Canadian CARISMA chain, the Greenland Chain, and the Virtual Global
Magnetic Observatory residing at Virginia Tech will be used together with solar
wind data from the ACE satellite. &lt;br/&gt;The new models will have widespread
utility within the space science community and also has the potential to
contribute directly to improved space weather forecasts and/or nowcasts in the
near-term future. &lt;br/&gt;
