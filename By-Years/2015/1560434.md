This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new
REU site at Tennessee Technological University focused on security of cyber-
physical systems. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are
built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computational
algorithms and physical components. New CPS technology will transform the way
people interact with engineered systems that often are fundamental to daily
lives including transportation, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, building
design, and many other areas critical to our society. It is vital that these
systems operate and interact with people seamlessly and that they are secure and
privacy-preserving. The REU site will provide undergraduates the opportunity to
work during the summer with faculty mentors in state-of-the-art research labs on
projects that are compelling and important to all of us. The Division of
Graduate Education CyberCorps (R) Scholarship for Service Program is co-funding
this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is led by an outstanding team
offering modern facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in
explorations of problems related to developing secure cyber-physical systems.
Students will learn how to use current tools and techniques to solve those
problems that have direct impact on people and the quality of daily life. The
team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from groups
traditionally under-represented in computer science. The students will
participate in research and professional development activities all designed to
achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer
science and engineering, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-
represented in computing fields, and increasing recruitment of students into
graduate programs.
