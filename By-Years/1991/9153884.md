The museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, in collaboration with the
University of Chicago, proposes to develop a major new exhibit on "Imaging
Science." Imaging science is a new field rapidly emerging from its roots in the
physical, biological, and behavioral sciences, and the graphic arts, and is
becoming increasingly important in all areas of scientific research. The primary
rationale for developing an exhibit about imaging science, and related
programming, is to enhance the overall scientific literacy of four million
visitors that come to the Museum each year. In view of the scientific, medical,
educational, and cultural value of images, the Museum and University of Chicago
believe that an exhibit on imaging science will have broad appeal to museum
visitors of many different ages and backgrounds. Today, scientific imaging
empowers us to look inward, at the infinite complexity of ourselves, and outward
to the edge of our universe. The main thrust of the exhibit will be to teach
visitors how images communicate knowledge. Technological advances in computer
workstations, that are revolutionizing scientific study, will be highlighted.
Exhibit sections will also identify imaging science breakthroughs that will
impact the lives of students and members of the workforce in the 1990s and
beyond.
