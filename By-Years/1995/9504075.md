9504075 Oden The almost simultaneous development, over the last decade, of hp
adaptive finite elements and multi-processor computing as means of dramatically
improving fluid flow simulations makes the possibility of combining them very
intriguing. The potential payoffs are very high but there are many challenges
before such a combination can be achieved. Promising new developments in data
structures, adaptive strategies, problem decomposition and robust parallel
equation solvers, albeit in the context of model elliptic problems, make this
problem tractable. In this project an attempt will be made to extend most of
these developments onto solving complex three dimensional viscous incompressible
flows. In particular this project will develop a new hp adaptive finite element
code built on top of an extendable hash table based data structure and equipped
with sophisticated a posteriori error estimators, adaptive strategies for
generating optimal meshes, and customized preconditioned conjugate gradient type
parallel equation solvers.
