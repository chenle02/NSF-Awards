9355652 Klyczek This project will provide an inservice program in biotechnology
for both secondary life science and agriculture education teachers through a
variety of workshop settings. The intent is to address the local, state, and
national recommendations to increase the science aspect of agriculture and to
create opportunities for agriculture education and life science teachers to work
together. The program will provide participants with new scientific knowledge
related to biotechnology, specifically including: gene cloning, tissue culture,
DNA analysis, and genetic modification of plants and animals; laboratory
experiences that illustrate new techniques in biology; information that is
important from a consumer point of view, e.g. practical applications of
biotechnology in agriculture and medicine; opportunities to share teaching
experiences; successful demonstrations, teaching strategies, and laboratory
experiences; and opportunities to discuss public concerns and ethical issues
related to biotechnology. The project will reach a minimum of 300 teachers in
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South Dakota.
