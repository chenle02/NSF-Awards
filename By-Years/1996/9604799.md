9604799 Wessel How do biophysical neuronal mechanisms interact to achieve the
computations required for proper function of neural circuits? Largely due to
recent advances in optical imaging of neuronal activity we now believe that the
single neuron is far more complex and dynamic than previously known from single
electrode studies. A combination of electrode recording and optical imaging
methods on the nervous system of he leech has been developed recently. This
combination of methods will be used to investigate the integration of synaptic
inputs in the dendrites of single neurons. The following specific questions will
be asked: (1) What is the cellular basis of a non-linear response to sensory
synaptic inputs ? (2) Do portions of a neuron act as relatively independent
functional units ? The leech offers spatially extended neurons with evidence,
from past work, for non- trivial processing. The established neuronal circuitry
and anatomically localized connections between identifiable neurons in the leech
are particularly advantageous in the study of single neuron computation. It is
thus possible to stimulate one or more identified cells presynaptic to the cell
under study, and monitor the dynamic interaction of postsynaptic potentials
along neuronal processes. In addition, due to the small number of neurons in the
leech ganglion, single neuron computation can be understood within the network
context. The proposed project will extend our understanding of neuronal
computation from the level of biophysical mechanisms of single neurons to the
collective computation of a small neuronal network that produces behavior. Since
the results focus on the properties of single nerve cells, they will likely
generalize to all species, including humans.
