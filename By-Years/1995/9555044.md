We propose the development, offerings and assessment of a series of writing-
intensive, interdisciplinary science courses and related activities constituting
"The Wesleyan Science Writing Program" (WSWP), designed to complement
department-based undergraduate science instruction by emphasizing the
development of effective oral and written communication skills as methodologies
for the discovery of ideas and critical exploration of scientific topics. The
program will also provide opportunities for both science and non-science majors
to investigate critically and collaboratively the practices of science by
"teaching the conflict" on various scientific topics and cultural studies of
science, and establishing a cross-disciplinary community of learning among
students and faculty from diverse disciplines. Students may pursue a "Science
Writing" major and senior thesis in the WSWP. Additionally, students with career
interests in scientific and technical writing will receive instruction and
credentialing appropriate at the appropriate undergraduate level. Courses will
also be open to non-science students to fulfill Wesleyan University's general
education expectations. The WSWP will also serve as a structure within which
research-active science faculty with a background and interest in writing and
the liberal arts, as well as humanities faculty and writing professionals, can
apply innovative teaching strategies such as active, cooperative and
collaborative learning, case method teaching, and discussion-based instruction,
and expand the ways in which state-of-the-art electronic technologies are
utilized to enhance instruction. The results of the program will be disseminated
through both printed and electronic media. In this manner, and to the extent
that it is demonstrably successful, the WSWP will provide a model for programs
at other institutions interested in establishing a similar program.
