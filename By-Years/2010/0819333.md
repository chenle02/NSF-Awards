&lt;br/&gt;The effective adoption and use of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
systems are profoundly affected by their poor usability characteristics. The
goal of this research is to improve the usability of ERP systems in order to
lessen user training time and increase user performance and satisfaction. Using
collaboration theory as a unifying framework, the proposed engineering processes
and methods for analyzing human-computer interaction and performing system
design and evaluation include (1) design principles and field studies for
enhancing system usability, (2) concrete implementations that embody and
illustrate the application of these design principles to ERP system interfaces,
and (3) evaluation methodologies for measuring collaborative properties. This
research will also investigate the validity of three scientific principles for
creating and analyzing software for real-world systems: (1) Greater
collaborative strength of software yields greater usability, (2) Embedding
knowledge about the users, tasks, processes, domains, usage logs, and its own
interface components into an ERP system strengthens its collaborative
capabilities, and (3) Usage logs are the true reflection of reality. Outcomes
from the project will include new methods and approaches for evaluating and
enhancing collaborativeness and usability that are applicable to the design of
large-scale real-world software systems.&lt;br/&gt;
