The propagation of F-region equatorial irregularities along a common magnetic
flux tube or along nearly common flux tubes is investigated using instruments
deployed at Neiva, Columbia and at Cerro Tololo, Chile. The instruments deployed
are all-sky imaging systems using 777.4 nm, 620.0 nm, and 557.7 nm narrow-band
filters, and 50-Hz high sampling rate "ScintMon" GPS receivers. These
instruments are complemented by the Jicamarca Peru ISR, other GPS receivers in
South America, and C/NOFS satellite measurements to determine how local
irregularity and scintillation data can be reconciled with physics of plasma
transport along an entire magnetic flux tube.
