West Virginia University is developing a two course sequence for in-service
science teachers, aimed at providing the scientific content and applied
scientific and technical skills necessary for middle to high school science
teachers to lead an inquiry-based study of local watersheds. Modeled using the
GLOBE Watershed Dynamics investigation and using new and established GLOBE
protocols, the course content focuses on physical processes and interactions
between land cover and hydrologic systems occurring within watersheds. Taking an
Earth system science approach, geospatial technologies are applied in support of
spatial thinking and spatial analysis; remote sensing, GPS, and GIS are used to
explore, map, and analyze interactions between terrestrial and fresh water
systems. The course sequence is an interdisciplinary partnership between the
West Virginia University Eberly College of Arts and Sciences and the College of
Human Resources and Education.
