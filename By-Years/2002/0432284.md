Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0432284&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Jozef H. Przytycki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial participant support for the 18th&lt;br/&gt;conference in the series,
"Knots in Washington." This meeting is&lt;br/&gt;devoted to the theme of
Khovanov homology, and aims to bring&lt;br/&gt;exponents of that new theory
together with recent and current&lt;br/&gt;students in topology, along with
experienced researchers in other&lt;br/&gt;aspects of knot theory and quantum
topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large number of methods have been developed for
computing&lt;br/&gt;numbers or polynomials that each measure some aspect of
the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of a knotted curve in space. The
Alexander&lt;br/&gt;polynomial, which is approximately 70 years old, is the
first&lt;br/&gt;example of this powerful class of tools. The search
for&lt;br/&gt;sharper ways to distinguish one knot from another and
to&lt;br/&gt;understand associated geometric questions gathered
speed&lt;br/&gt;approximately 20 years ago with the discovery of the
Jones&lt;br/&gt;polynomial and related invariants. Mikhail Khovanov of
the&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Davis, found in 1999 that the
Jones&lt;br/&gt;polynomial can be viewed as a one-line summary of a
richer&lt;br/&gt;theory, and ongoing work with Khovanov's ideas will be
the&lt;br/&gt;theme of this conference.&lt;br/&gt;
