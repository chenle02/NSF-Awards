Bruchid beetles are parasitic on the seeds of their host plants, and their
degree of host specificity may be an important factor in their geographic
distribution and evolutionary history. Dr. Clarence Johnson is a recognized
authority on the systematics and biogeography of South American bruchids, and he
proposes continued investigation of their taxonomy, distribution, ecology and
evolution. The proposed research would involve extended field collecting and the
first application of new computer-based methods for reconstructing evolutionary
relationships among bruchids. The proposed research will have impact beyond the
narrow confines of beetle systematics. The patterns found among bruchid species
and genera can be used to test biogeographic hypotheses based on other
organisms. Beetle-host plant relationships will impact on a broad range of
coevolutionary hypotheses. Application of modern analytical tools will serve as
a model for entomologists in general.
