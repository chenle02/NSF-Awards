The focus of this research is on the formulation and development ofnovel,
effective techniques for distributed, network-wide resource allocation and
connection management in broadband integrated services digital networks (BISDN)
within the framework of fault-tolerant operation. The focus of these techniques
is to optimize the utilization of network switch and transmission resources in
meeting user demand and service quality requirements, especially under heavy
usage and/or operation under network faults. In addition, the focus includes
development of alternative, novel fault tolerant switch architectures, network
topologies and transmission facilities. Relative to other research on resource
allocation and connection management for BISDN, the approach here is unique in
that fault tolerance is incorporated not only within the resource allocation and
connection management algorithms, but also into the network switches, topography
and transmission capabilities.
