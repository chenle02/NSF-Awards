Salisbury University, in collaboration with California State University Fresno,
Humbolt State University, Kennesaw State University, New College of Florida, and
Pittsburg State University, is developing online materials to enhance several
mathematics courses, including those for prospective teachers. Students
frequently find abstract mathematics difficult to visualize. They rarely see
links between coursework and independent mathematical inquiry. The PascGalois
Project provides an interesting class of discrete dynamical systems generated
over algebraic structures, such as groups, and color graphical representations
of these systems that allow students to see algebraic and number theoretic
properties intertwined with the dynamics.

The primary objectives of this project are to: develop online activities
including Java applets that provide a visual component for courses including
abstract algebra, discrete mathematics, number theory, dynamical systems, and
computer graphics; develop students' visual and intuitive understanding of
difficult mathematical concepts; model effective use of technology for
prospective mathematics teachers and better prepare them to implement the NCTM
standards; and create a bridge between upper-level courses and undergraduate
research by providing a source of interesting and accessible research projects.

The intellectual merit of the project is in the innovative activities designed
for upper-level mathematics courses, revealing connections between courses that
otherwise may appear unrelated, and the undergraduate research projects that are
generated. Two summer PascGalois retreats highlight the undergraduate research
efforts.

Broader impacts follow from online dissemination of the Java applets and
activities through a venue such as MathDL. These activities will be integrated
throughout the mathematics curriculum.
