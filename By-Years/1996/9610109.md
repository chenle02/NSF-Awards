This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Michigan to acquire a
Siemens SMART/CCD system for collecting X-ray diffraction data. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) new
olefin polymerization catalysts based on boratabenzene zirconium derivatives,
(2) synthetic analogs for the FE/Mo/S site in nitrogenase, (3) bimetallic
clusters and HDS catalysis, (4) extended networks based on supramolecular
bonding, and (5) the coordination chemistry of manganese. The X-ray
diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the
precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and
it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules.
