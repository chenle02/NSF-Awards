The investigator and her colleagues consider a novel high order adaptive semi-
Lagrangian approach for kinetic plasma simulations. The major challenge of
kinetic simulations is the huge computational cost, from the high dimensionality
(3-D in physical space and 3-D in phase space) and from the spatial and temporal
multi-scale features of the problem. To address these challenges, the proposed
methodology consists of three advanced numerical techniques: 1) a conservative
semi-Lagrangian method with high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) reconstructions; 2) a high order Strang split spectral deferred
correction method to bridge time scales of different species and integrate in
time with high order accuracy; 3) mesh adaptivity by incorporating the Strang
split Semi-Lagrangian WENO method into the framework of adaptive mesh
refinement. As a result of high order accuracy and adaptivity in both space and
time, the investigator and her collaborators hope to apply the algorithm in
realistic plasma applications with affordable computational cost by using
relatively coarse and dynamically adaptive mesh. The eventual goal is to enable
large-scale parallel simulations in order to predict/confirm/explain the
physical phenomenon observed in a broad range of applications.

The investigator and her collaborators aim at developing robust and highly
efficient numerical algorithms. The well-developed algorithm will have a direct
impact in plasma applications, such as developing fusion energy, the modeling of
magnetosphere, among many others. Besides, there is large room for further
extensions and applications. The algorithm can be extended to solve the more
general Boltzmann equation. It can served as a microscopic solver in a mix
kinetic-hydrodynamic model via the heterogeneous multi-scale method. While
designed for the plasma simulations, the proposed algorithm can be further
extended to astrophysics applications, semi-conductor device simulations among
many others. The broader impact comes from the multi-disciplinary nature of the
proposed research. The proposed research will initiate and serve as a solid
foundation for collaborative research work with applied mathematicians, plasma
physicists and astrophysicists. The collaborative work will not only expedite
the development of the research in both sides of collaborations, but also help
training graduate students with a diverse background and multidisciplinary
skills.
