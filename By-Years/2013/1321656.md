1321656&lt;br/&gt;Gao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
new computational equipment to support research and research training in
seismology, geodynamics and rock mechanics at the Missouri University of Science
and Technology. Three PIs and their 34 graduate students will benefit from the
planned acquisition of a 4 node, 16 CPU per node Linux-OS cluster each with 256
GB RAM and a 36 TB RAID mass store system. The compute cluster will support
computational intensive analysis of seismic observations to constrain the
geodynamics of the lithosphere and upper mantle through observations of shear
wave splitting, particularly in extensional settings, finite element forward
modeling of fracture development within reservoir rocks, and modeling
investigations of rock mechanical implications of liquefied CO2 subsurface
injections, to name a few. Students trained will be well positioned for future
careers in academia as well as the extractive
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
