This project supports hosting the four-day 23th edition of the GENI Engineering
Conference (GEC), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be held
June 15-18, 2015, on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus. The
Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that
is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI is an
instrument designed to address three issues:

1) Science Issues: We cannot currently understand or predict the behavior of
complex, large-scale networks; 2) Society Issues: We increasingly rely on the
Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience; and 3)
Innovation Issues: Pre-GENI substantial barriers existed to at-scale
experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies.

GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two
kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will
greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale
networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or
connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants.
The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an
opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to
formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand
what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions
might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members,
including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an
instrument for research; this project supports further development and use of
the research instrument.
