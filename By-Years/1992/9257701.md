This is an N.S.F. Young Investigator Award. Dr. Levin plans to examine the role
played by hormones in the development of sex differences in bird song in a
tropical species in which both sexes sing. She also proposes to investigate the
possibility that environmental factors such as latitude may affect the degree to
which hormones control adult song.
