In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Fereshteh Billiot of Texas A &amp; M University
Corpus Christi and Professor Kevin Morris of Carthage College and their
undergraduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the effect of
pH on chiral recognition by amino acid derived surfactants towards other
species. The effect of pH on these surfactants will be studied with solution-
phase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods, combined with other physical
characterization methods. The surfactants show promise as pseudo-stationary
phases in capillary electrophoresis separations of chiral mixtures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral molecules are molecules that have "handed"
symmetry. They differ in structure from each other only in the sense that they
are mirror images of each other. Since they have identical chemical structures,
except for their handedness, mixtures of the chiral isomers are difficult to
separate. Professors Billiot, Morris and their students are interested in
designing new ways to separate chiral isomers. This work has important
applications in purification and analysis of pharmaceuticals. The undergraduate
students working on this project will gain useful experience in carrying out the
physic-chemical characterization of these interesting surfactant systems. As
part of this work, Prof. Billiot will continue her strong efforts at encouraging
students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences
