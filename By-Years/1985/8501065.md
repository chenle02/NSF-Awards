This project develops a generative expert system for the design of building
layouts; these layouts are treated as "loosely-packed" arrangements of
rectangles, which include "densely-packed" arrangements as a special case. In
this form, a broad range of applications becomes possible, while the restriction
to a basically rectilinear world allows for a rigorous, formalized treatment.
The system consists of a robust generator capable of finding all possible
arrangements and a tester able to prune the search tree traversed by the
generator and to filter out the most promising of "efficient" rectangles, the
"orthogonal structure." The tester uses knowledge contained in a knowledge base;
it is programmed in a style which allows for an easy expansion and modification
of that base, using well-established techniques from the field of artificial
intelligence. By varying the knowledge base, the system can be adapted to
various problem domains.
