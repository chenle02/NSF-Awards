Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can
be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging
Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to
perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic
sources. This award supports scientists at the University of Iowa in their work
on VERITAS. The group will contribute to operations of the observatory and
conduct scientific analysis of data from highly-energetic galactic gamma-ray
sources. They will also lead an effort to establish a long-term accessible
archive of the VERITAS data. Each summer, the group will host an undergraduate
summer intern from an underrepresented minority group through the University of
Iowa Summer Research Opportunities Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University
of Iowa group will use VERITAS to study very high energy galactic particle
accelerators to probe their acceleration mechanisms. They will observe with
VERITAS the new pulsar wind nebulae and extended shell-type supernova remnants
originally detected by complementary gamma-ray survey observatories. They will
continue to operate and maintain the VERITAS pointing monitors and to contribute
to array operations. The group will also lead a new effort to archive the high-
level science results from VERITAS within the NASA HEARSAC system.
