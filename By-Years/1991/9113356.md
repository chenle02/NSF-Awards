Jackson State University (JSU) is unique among Historically Black Colleges and
Universities in its undergraduate meteorology program. The physics program too
is turning out highly-qualified students. Through the two programs, the
Department of Physics and Atmospheric Sciences has made significant
contributions is preparing minorities for the work forces and for graduate
programs. The maine goal of this proposed project is to prepare and motivate
minority undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees and/or professional careers
in physics and atmospheric sciences. The project objectives include the
following components: (1) the offering to high ability undergraduate students
early research experience by working with dedicated mentors and role models
during the academic year at JSU; (2) the development of academic enrichment
activities which will maintain and enhance the interest of the students in
physics and atmospheric sciences' (3) the provision of opportunities for
students to participate in off-campus research during the summer months, and (4)
the production of graduates in physics and atmospheric science who will be
prepared to pursue graduate studies in these fields. Students will be required
to take special courses which will consist of supervised research projects, and
formalized training in technical writing and literature survey as well as
laboratory experimentation. Besides written reports, students will make at least
one oral presentation of their research. Students will travel to at least one
conference or meeting related to their research experiences, and will be
encouraged to present papers where possible and appropriate. Field trips,
seminars, etc. will be organized. Participating faculty mentors will be expected
to accompany students to conferences and professional meetings.
