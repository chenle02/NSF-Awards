This project will study knot and link concordance and its implications for 3-
and 4-manifolds. We will study the smooth concordance classes of topologically
slice knots via the recently defined bipolar filtration, using techniques of
gauge theory, Heegaard Floer homology and von Neumann signatures. We will
attempt to exhibit a primary decomposition of the knot concordance group using
noncommutative localization techniques. We will also study the set of
concordance classes as a metric space, under several natural metrics. We will
also establish new structure in the knot concordance group, a sort of Wang
sequence, arising from the failure of several conjectures of Kauffman.

In its broadest terms this project is about the mathematical structure of the
"shape" of 3- and 4-dimensional objects. Understanding complex shapes has many
applications. The geometric structure of proteins and other complex molecules is
crucial to drug development. The geometric configuration of cellular DNA is
important in determining the precise mechanisms of cellular processes. The
geometric shape of organs (especially the brain) is vital to the field of
medical imaging. The prediction of shape from incomplete data (satellite
imaging, sensor networks) has important military and commercial applications.
Additionally, this project will increase the participation of U.S. citizens,
permanent residents and women in mathematical research and education. This
project focusses on knot theory, which is known to parametrize all 3-dimensional
manifolds.
