Dr Dodelson will focus on two issues central to understanding dark matter and
dark energy: selection bias in measurements of weak gravitational lensing, and
detecting the photons produced as dark matter particles annihilate. Galaxy
surveys can include only objects above a given size and apparent brightness.
When light from a background galaxy passes close to a dense region on its way to
us, its light is bent ('lensed') so that it appears brighter and larger than
otherwise. This bias introduces an illusory concentration of faint distant
galaxies in the same parts of the sky as nearby concentrations of matter. A
preliminary calculation shows that selection bias could change some measured
quantities by as much as 10%. Dr Dodelson will undertake more detailed
calculations, including an analysis of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
prepared for the Dark Energy Survey, and studies of how galaxy images are
distinguished from those of stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. His aim is to
understand how selection bias is likely to affect future large surveys to
measure dark energy with weak lensing, and to develop analysis methods that
minimize it. Current ideas about the particles making up the dark matter predict
that they should have finite lifetimes, so that gamma ray telescopes such as
Fermi would detect thousands of photons produced when dark matter particles
annihilate. However, the 'background' of gamma rays from our own Milky Way, and
from the active nuclei of galaxies, is far brighter. Dr Dodelson will explore
methods to extract the dark matter signal from the
background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will be trained by
participating in the research. Dr Dodelson plays a significant role in large
collaborations including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey,
and the SuperNova Acceleration Probe, which aim at constraining the fundamental
physics that gives rise to the dark energy.
