Healthcare workers in the Ebola crisis are at risk for infection due to routine
interactions &lt;br/&gt;with patients. These workers wear protective gear to
protect them while handling contaminated material. But this gear can be
challenging to remove safely. This award envisions that remote-controlled robots
could perform common nursing duties inside hazardous clinical areas. If
successful, this approach could significantly reduce the frequency with which
healthcare workers are exposed to contagions and other biohazards. This project
will develop a prototype mobile manipulator robot, a human operator?s console,
and operator assistance algorithms to automate or partially-automate tedious and
error-prone tasks. Medical professionals will be consulted at the start of the
study to establish a prioritized list of clinical tasks for Ebola treatment, and
at the end of the study to evaluate the prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will explore the tele-nursing concept across the fields of mechanical
design, sensors, motion planning and control, human-robot interaction, and robot
system integration. Tele-operation of complex tasks, in particular, bimanual
manipulation in highly non-engineered environments, is still a major research
challenge, while contribution will be made also in algorithms for operator
assistance for human-guided manipulation. The research is directly applicable to
other infectious disease scenarios as well. Improving operator interfaces may
also further our knowledge of human-controlled robots in other fields, such as
household service, space robots, and material handling in industry and
logistics.
