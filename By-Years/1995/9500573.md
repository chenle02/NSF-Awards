This conference is concerned with linear algebra and its applications. The
special emphasis of this meeting is structured matrix problems. Topics that will
receive special attention in this context are sparse matrices and special
matrices occurring in signal processing. This emphasis will be realized via
carefully selected invited speakers and minisymposia. A second point of focus is
the educational aspects of linear algebra. Emphasis will be put both on
curriculum and educational tools. A matrix is a rectangular array with possible
entries from a wide variety of rings. This is a field which originated in the
nineteenth century as part of algebra. It is currently very active in view of
its many applications and connections with other parts of mathematics as well as
other scientific and technical disciplines.
