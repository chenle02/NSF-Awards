This grant provides funds which permit the equipment from the now defunct
Smithsonian Institution Radiocarbon Laboratory (SIRL) to be transferred to the
University of Pittsburgh. With university support it will be operated under the
direction of Dr. Robert Stuckenrath, the former Smithsonian director. Over many
years Dr. Stuckenrath and the SIRL have analyzed many archaeological samples and
these dates have made a major contribution to the increase of anthropological
knowledge. In 1986 the Smithsonian announced the closing of its Environmental
Research Center of which the radiocarbon laboratory was a part and this, in
effect put the SIRL out of business. Transfer of the laboratory to Pittsburgh
will allow tits service to the discipline to continue and therefore funds should
be provided.
