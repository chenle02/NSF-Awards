9315370 Granados This award support the participation of 10 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering of Biopesticides
for Insect Control, scheduled for November 1994 in Kyoto, Japan. The co-
organizers are Professor Robert Granados, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant
Research, Cornell University, and Professor Tsuguo Matsumoto, Kyoto Institute of
Technology. The seminar will focus on the genetic engineering of insect
pathogens used as biopesticides, development of a greater understanding of the
molecular interactions between pathogenic microbes and their insect hosts, and
improvement of biological control tactics for insect pests and vectors using
these new agents and knowledge. The seminar will bring together leading
scientists from the two countries who specialize in the area of biological
control to address novel molecular approaches for the genetic manipulation of
microorganisms for insect control. The seminar has a multidisciplinary character
of contemporary research on insect pathogens and will impact the areas of
biological, environmental, agricultural, and medical sciences. In particular,
the exchange of information will accelerate the development of new strategies
and tactics for controlling harmful insects that account for agricultural,
medical, and veterinary problems. ***
