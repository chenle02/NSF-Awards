The Ohio State University Summer Physics Institute is a ten-week internship,
centered on a research project undertaken by each student under the supervision
of a mentor at Ohio State. Each student will conduct research with his or her
faculty mentor in one of the areas of research of the OSU physics department:
astrophysics, nuclear physics, high-energy physics, condensed matter physics,
and atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The students are also encouraged to
attend workshops, sponsored by the department, in computational physics,
presentation techniques, and instrumentation and electronics, along with a
required session in shop safety and procedures. The objective of this program is
to introduce students to physics research through a hands-on research
experience, and to encourage interested students to pursue research in physics
beyond the undergraduate level.
