This project is investigating, developing, and implementing a suite of novel and
innovative digital tools to enable researchers and educators to easily document
progress, results, and other outcomes of their projects for inclusion in the
National STEM Education Digital Library (NSDL). By making use of the semantic
web features of the NSDL Data Repository, combined with the wiki, bookmarking,
and tagging tools supported and integrated in this project, contributors create
context around their research, link it with educational practice, and connect
the research to background materials critical to understanding and teaching
about it. In addition, the tools allow researchers and educators to add metadata
and references to publications, web sites, and other digital resources related
to their work (whether created by themselves or others); and more generally, tag
and rate digital resources that have value to the STEM education community. By
directly serving to engage principal investigators in making their research and
education outcomes known through NSDL, this project is amplifying the broader
impacts of all projects.
