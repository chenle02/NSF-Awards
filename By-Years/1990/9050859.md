Modern optics is the basis for some of the most innovative applications in
today's technology. Lasers and modern optics have also had a major impact on the
experimental work in the physical sciences. Yet this field has received very
little attention in most college physics curricula. While some physics
departments have tried to reverse this trend in either their courses for the
majors or for the non-majors, few have attempted to incude this field in a
connected and comprehensive manner in their undergraduate curriculum. Union is
introducing experimental modern optics and lasers at several stages of the
physics curriculum both to educate a wider audience, and to provide a stronger
background for those who would pursue this field at a more advanced level. They
are using high-quality optical components, lasers, detectors, and analysers for
advanced experiments, and also in laboratories for non-science majors. In
addition, they are involving students from other sciences and, especially,
engineering in the work. The college is matching the award with an equal amont
of funds.
