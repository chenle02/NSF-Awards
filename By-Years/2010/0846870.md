Dr. Watt's research deals with the rise of complex biological adaptations from
simpler beginnings. His team uses as a study system a group of insects whose
field and lab biology are both well known, allowing for greater analytical power
to study the whole process of natural selection, from chemical mechanisms to
actual differences in fitness among inheritable variants in the wild. Also, the
fact that these insects' energy-demanding flight uses physiology common to all
cellular life makes the studies of this "evolutionary model" system of general
relevance to many other physiologically active animals (including
humans).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, Dr. Watt has found evidence of a
historical "innovative step" in the structure of a particular catalytic protein
which is central to animal energy processing. This "step" confers sharply
increased resistance to heat stress on populations and species which carry it,
as compared to other ancestral species. Perhaps as a consequence, in one
population of a lowland species, now thermally resistant in this energy
processing mechanism, Dr. Watt and his team find a very wide range of new
variation experiencing temperature-related natural selection. Further, out of
this range of variants, new and more complex combinations are becoming
successful. This work will first explore the nature of the processes generating
these combinations, and then test the generality of the findings among genes and
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will bear on major conceptual issues in
evolutionary biology, such as: &lt;br/&gt;- How living complexity arises from
simple beginnings, which has been a central focus since Darwin;&lt;br/&gt;- The
likelihood that some living mechanisms may exhibit chronic natural variability,
rather than there routinely being one superior "type" which is predominant in
populations;&lt;br/&gt;- Clarification of the connections between large-scale,
long-term "macroevolution" across populations and species, and local
"microevolution" adjusting populations to local conditions in the short
term.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the complexity of adaptation to
naturally changed thermal conditions will be important in understanding the
stresses placed on these mechanisms by rapid human-caused change of local and
global thermal conditions. There are implications here for conservation and
environmental management and for agriculture and medicine as the environmental
context for both change rapidly.
