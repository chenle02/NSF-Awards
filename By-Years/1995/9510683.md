9510683 Peterson This GOALI (Graduate Student Industrial Fellowship) award is
made to evaluate a new technique for obtaining the velocity of an ultrasonic
wave in concrete. Due to the low signal to noise ratio in oncrete, the
conventional ultrasonic analysis methods are frequently inadequate. The use of
wavelet decomposition of the ultrasonic signal may provide more details on the
dispersion characteristics and thereby improved time of flight data. ***
