The PI's research program will focus primarily on the chemical ecology and
larval biology of marine invertebrates, including continued collaborative
investigations of the functions of secondary metabolites isolated from marine
organisms (particularly anti-fouling and defensive compounds), larval
chemoreception prior to settlement, and the influence of hydrodynamics on
settlement behavior.
