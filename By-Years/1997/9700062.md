Nettleship The project develops micromechanical models based on the
densification of an alumina powder and an Inconel N625 superalloy powder to
predict the path of microstructural changes occurring during densification. The
effects of some processing variables on the microstructure and constitutive
parameters that would be needed for the continuum mechanics models are also
being studies. Earlier models have not performed well due to the lack of
accurate values for kinetic information such as diffusion coefficients as well
as due to not including the internal structure of the powder particles into
micromechanical models. The factors are taken into account and experimental
verification of the model is performed. ***
