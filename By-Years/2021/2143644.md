Quantum cryptography promises a future communication infrastructure that is
secure against threats posed not only by today's technology, but also against
threats posed by future technological breakthroughs, including the development
and deployment of large-scale quantum computers. Despite this great potential,
however, there are several practical and theoretical hurdles that must be
overcome before this technology can see wide-scale adoption. Towards overcoming
these challenges, this project has four primary high-level goals: (1) to reduce
the complexity of current quantum cryptographic systems (especially for the end-
user, which can translate to potential cost effective implementations); (2) to
increase the efficiency and noise tolerance of quantum communication protocols;
(3) to broaden the range of cryptographic applications for which quantum
resources may be used; and (4) to increase understanding of the foundations of
quantum secure communication. This project also has an extensive educational
component, providing new opportunities for undergraduate students to become
involved in quantum cryptographic research, while also developing new
educational material to instruct early undergraduates, and the general public,
in the theory and use of quantum communication and cryptography. Such knowledge
will be vital to the future workforce, and to future
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's ultimate goal is to advance the
understanding of the theoretical foundations of quantum cryptography, while also
advancing capabilities within this field. Through the use of a hybrid classical
and quantum approach, the PI will develop a novel security analysis framework
based on a new class of entropic uncertainty relation, relying on both classical
and quantum methods. Such a framework will be immediately applicable to various
"weakly-quantum" protocols which have device restrictions placed on users; it
will also be broadly applicable to general quantum cryptography and quantum
information theory research. The PI will also harness the power of classical and
quantum communication to develop new adaptive countermeasures to improve the
security and performance of current quantum cryptographic protocols. Finally,
new quantum cryptographic primitives beyond key distribution will be developed,
broadening the range of applications that quantum resources may be applied
towards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
