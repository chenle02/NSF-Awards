9313436 Guiltinan This award allows Pennsylvania State University to renovate
their complex of six greenhouses, a total of about 28,500 square feet of
research and research training space. These greenhouses were built in 1949 and
have not undergone any renovation since that time. The types of research carried
out in this space include control of plant gene expression, control of plant
cell expansion, biosynthesis of starch, plant growth regulation, effects of air
pollutants on plants, and the molecular basis of cell recognition in plants.
These greenhouses are also used for various graduate and undergraduate courses
in plant science and specifically an interdisciplinary training program in
advanced root biology. These facilities are used by 20 faculty, 8 postdoctoral
fellows, 60 graduate students and about 145 undergraduate students. Thus, the
renovations will impact a large number of mature researchers and existing
research projects but a larger number of students being trained in biotechnology
issues concerning plant science. This modernization project is important because
of it's potential regional and national impact on the growing biotechnology
infrastructure. ***
