0112421 Mitchell

This Americas Program award will support Dr. Gary E. Mitchell, North Carolina
State University in collaboration with Dr. Mahir Hussein of the Universidad de
Sao Paulo in Brazil. The aim of the project is to study quantum chaos through
measurement of a system that mimics chaotic behavior - acoustic resonances in
quartz blocks.

By studying an experimental system exhibiting chaotic behavior, the researchers
intend to address some open questions in quantum mechanics that may shed light
on fundamental processes in nuclear physics. The project will take advantage of
a recently established experimental program in Sao Paulo and combine the
expertise of the US group in analyzing nuclear spectra for signatures of quantum
chaos. The collaboration will have an educational component by promoting the
exchange of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
