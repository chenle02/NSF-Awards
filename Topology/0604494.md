Large scale topology of metric spaces

The project is dedicated to the large scale geometry and topology, a relatively
new interdisciplinary subject which studies very large scale properties of a
space. It is opposite to the classical topology which is a science of small
scales, since it is based on the notion of a continuous transformation which is
local by the definition. The project is devoted to the large scale counterparts
of the following classic topics of topology: Dimension Theory, Cohomology
Theory, Theory of Embeddings. Among the research problems selected for the
project are: The quest for a large scale analog of Morita theorem that states
that asymptotic dimension increases by one after crossing the space with the
reals; the quest for the asymptotic analog of Alexandroff theorem connecting
cohomological approach to dimension to geometric one; and a problem of quasi-
isometric embedding of discrete groups into the product of trees. One of the
main goals of the project is potential applications to the Novikov Higher
Signature Conjecture and some other related conjectures. The classical topology
has the century long history and now it is substantially developed in all
directions. Its long and painful birth at the end of 19th and beginning of 20th
centuries was inspired and pushed by the progress in natural sciences and
mathematics, in particular in analysis. By the end of the 20th century in many
areas of mathematics the necessity appeared for a discipline which would be
similar to topology and which describe behavior of the large scale world. Such a
discipline started to hatch in a last decade or so. This proposal is a further
push for rising of such a science. There are already many connections between
the asymptotic topology and applied disciplines. Thus, a part of this project is
the study of the connection between large scale embeddings into the product of
trees and aperiodic tilings and hence the quasi-crystals. Another connection is
to the computer science. It turns out that the asymptotic infinite
dimensionality of certain sequence of graphs would give the foundation for PRA
("product replacement algorithm") which is a noncomutative version of Gauss
elimination algorithm. It is known that PRA works well in all instances but
still it lacks a rigorous mathematical justification. Developing of the
asymptotic dimension theory up to the task is the heart of the proposal.
