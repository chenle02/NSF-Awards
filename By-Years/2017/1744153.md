This award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending PETS 2017,
the 2017 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium. The Student Fellowships helps
cover the travel expenses for these students, making it possible for them to
attend the symposium and participate in the discussions of recent advances and
new perspectives related to the design and realization of privacy services for
the Internet and other data systems and communication networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PETS symposium brings together privacy and anonymity
experts from around the world and presents a valuable opportunity for
researchers to share their result and learn about the state of the art in
privacy. Participation in the conference can be an important part of the
graduate-school or college experience of the sponsored students, providing them
the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having
the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in privacy.
