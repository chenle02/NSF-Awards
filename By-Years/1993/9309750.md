9309750 Ealick We propose to implement modern computer hardware in combination
with the new X-ray detectors and synchrotron radiation in order to greatly
improve the quality and efficiency of X-ray crystallography data obtained from
biological macromolecules. The major task in this implementation will be to
develop new computer altorithms for rapid analysis o the X-ray diffraction data.
Not only will these algorithms allow the experimenter to rapidly evaluate the
quality of each individual data set, it will also form the basis by which the
experimenter can interactiely evaluate the structural results and consequently
make more use of experimental resources.
