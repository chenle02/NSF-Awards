9353062 Faile Chowan College seeks to initiate a three-week, summer residential,
Young Scholars program in Interdisciplinary Science for 20 students entering
grade 10. The students will be provided an enrichment experience in biology,
chemistry, physics, and computer usage through the participation of hands-on
laboratory activities, field trips, and lectures and discussions. Students will
engage in ethical issues and career awareness activities. The highlight of the
project is the participation in a research project under the guidance of faculty
members at Chowan College.
