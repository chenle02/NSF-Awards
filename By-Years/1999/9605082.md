*** Newman A physics research program for ten undergraduate students will be
continued at UC Irvine each summer for the next three years. The program
involves projects with a variety of physics research groups under close
supervision by faculty and senior research staff. Research opportunities are
offered in the areas of experimental elementary particle physics, condensed
matter, plasma physics, and astrophysics. Close contact between student
participants, encouraging the sharing of research experiences in these varied
areas is promoted by providing shared housing, and through social activities.
The research experience is further enhanced through a seminar series, visits to
the labs of fellow participants, and excursions to other research labs in the
Los Angeles area. ***
