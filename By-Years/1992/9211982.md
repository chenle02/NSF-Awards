ABSTRACT It is known that aggressive children tend to perceive ambiguous
negative events as intentionally caused by others. Such judgments then provoke
hostile retaliation. This robust empirical finding is elaborated in the current
research, using attribution theory to illuminate the dynamics of aggression and
to guide the creation of an attributional intervention with African American
school-aged boys labeled as aggressive. In seven studies, sociometric procedures
will be used to identify aggressive males and matched groups of nonaggressive
subjects. Laboratory paradigms taken from social psychology will then be used to
investigate the antecedents of judgments of intent and responsibility. Among the
topics to be examined are: a) whether aggressive children over-attribute hostile
intent to others in both aggressive and nonaggressive contexts; b) the
likelihood that race (i.e., perceived prejudice) is used by black subjects as an
attributional cue in judgments of self-responsibility; and c) whether aggressive
children understand the communication strategies and excuses that are used to
mitigate anger from others. These findings will then be used to create an
intervention designed to reduce hostile behavior among African American boys
labeled as aggressive. The intervention will be tested in an actual school
setting and its development is guided by the belief that a change in cognition
(i.e., attribution to intent) should lead to changes in the feelings and
behavior that logically follow this causal inference.
