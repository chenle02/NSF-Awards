Dissertation Research: Mechanisms and Significance of Ontogenetic Changes in
Respiratory Function During Insect Locomotion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jon Harrison
and Scott Kirkton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this research is to examine
how body size affects the respiratory physiology of active insects. Initial
results show that larger/older grasshoppers fatigue quicker during repeated
jumping, which suggests possible problems with oxygen delivery to the muscle.
This project utilizes American locusts (Schistocerca americana) to determine how
structural changes in both the respiratory tracheal system and the jumping
muscle vary with body size during development. The tracheal structure will be
measured using light and electron microscopy, while the leg muscle metabolic
biochemistry will be measured using enzymatic assays. The amount of oxygen
consumed during jumping will be measured for the whole animal using flow-through
respirometry and leg muscle oxygen levels will be measured with electron
paramagnetic resonance. The results of this project will help understand the
general relationship between body size and tracheal function and provide a test
of the hypothesis that gigantic insects of the Paleozoic Era were made possible
by increased atmospheric oxygen levels. &lt;br/&gt;
