9418720 Bohrson This is a two year project to document U-Th disequilibria
characteristics of pumice glass and minerals from two compositionally zoned
pyroclastic deposits from the Phlegrean Fields, Italy: the Campanian Ignimbrite
and the Neopolitan Yellow Tuff. High-precision thermal ionization mass
spectrometry will be used to document the 230Th/232Th characteristics and U and
Th concentrations (by isotope dilution) of pumice glass that represents the
compositional ranges of the deposits. In addition, phenocrysts (feldspar,
magnetite) from selected pumice will also be characterized. These data will be
used to document processes and timescales associated with the generation of
zoned crustal magma bodies using geochemical and fluid dynamical modeling. In
addition, the integration of geochemical and fluid dynamical modeling represents
a potentially powerful approach for understanding the development of chemical
gradients in crustal magma bodies.
