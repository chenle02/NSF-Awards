This research is to develop a technique to date movements on faults by analysis
of the distribution of cosmic-ray-flux- generated carbon-14 in calcite on
exposed limestone fault scarps. The initial area of investigation will be in
Pleasant Valley, Nevada, and in the Oquirrh-Stansbury Ranges, Utah. Carbon-14
production will be calibrated on surfaces of known age such as Bonneville and
Provo Shoreline features which have previously been used to calibrate in situ
produced cosmogenic isotopes. Future studies could be extended to use other
minerals which will greatly extend the method's usefulness. The goal is to
extend the record of earthquake occurrence on exposed faults into pre-
historical times. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
