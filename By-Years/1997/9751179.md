This project addresses the problem of developing within young women scientists
the confidence in using up-to-date research instrumentation that can foster
their career goals and encourage them to seek graduate and professional
education. The objective is for each of the science majors to become competent
in using the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS), understanding its
theoretical foundation and practical applications. This project provides a major
piece of equipment needed by the chemistry program. This project permits an
orderly incorporation of GC-MS throughout the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum. GC-MS experiments are presented for laboratory courses throughout
the 4-year chemistry program. All of the undergraduate students at the college
are women. A significant percentage are identified as members of a minority
group. An arrangement made with the Chemistry Department at another college
involves site visits to this college for the instruction of their students on
the GC-MS. Additionally, the instrument permits continued development of
microscale experiments in the areas of organic, inorganic, and environmental
chemistry. *
