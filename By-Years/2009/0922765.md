This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trends such as
increasing energy costs and desire for improved functionality are driving
materials and structures to be lighter, smaller, and more complex without
sacrificing critical properties such as strength and endurance. Examples of
these advanced technologies include: ultra-lightweight and biologically-inspired
structures, advanced composite materials, micro-electro-mechanical systems, fuel
cell technology, and snow engineering. In order to meet performance
expectations, engineering researchers in the College of Engineering at Montana
State University (MSU) must be able to explore across widely different length
and time scales. The combination of the acquired ARAMIS high resolution digital
imaging system and the Polytec laser vibrometer provides assessment of static
and dynamic structural responses that can be connected back to material
microstructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This capability allows MSU researchers to
discover new material properties and solve important problems in
material/structure interaction, while simultaneously providing new opportunities
for research and teaching activities. The flexibility of the acquired
instruments stimulates interdisciplinary study that improves the quality and
depth of research at MSU. These tools are utilized for education at the
undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral level to illustrate fundamental
concepts and new ways of engineering "seeing". MSU's strong commitment to
undergraduate research through required senior research projects, summer
undergraduate projects, and Native American summer research programs such as the
Montana Apprenticeship Program, further expands the impact of this acquisition
as educational research instruments. The capabilities of the new instruments
also opens opportunities for new fields of study at MSU, as well as the
discovery of new materials for basic science and technology.
