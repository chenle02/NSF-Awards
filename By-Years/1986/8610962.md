The project will (1) develop a methodology for systematically collecting data
relevant to architectural decision making; (2) collect the needed data using
CAM/SAM's resources and first-hand knowledge of Mexico City buildings, design
firms, and design practices: (3) convene a working symposium of leading U.S. and
Mexican architectural practitioners and researchers to analyze the data and
other relevant information, indentify lessons learned, and develop consensus
guidelines; and (4) publish and disseminate these guidelines to U.S. architects
through a national conference and the existing channels of the AIA. Th project
will focus on three areas: the architect's role in earthquake hazard mitigation,
the effects of building configuration, and the effects of nonstructural building
components.
