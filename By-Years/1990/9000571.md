Image formation in and through irregular media, ranging from atmospheric
inhomogeneities to the very difficult case of diffusely scattering media such as
human tissue, remains a major challenge of image science. The range of
technology that has been brought to bear on these problems is considerable,
including active adaptive optics, image deconvolution, phase retrieval and phase
conjugation. The present work proposes various ideas for imaging through
inhomogeneities and for imaging objects embedded within inhomogeneities. The
first category, imaging through inhomogeneities, embodies extensions of a
technique recently developed by the principal investigator for imaging through
inhomogeneities using a superresolution technique. The goal is to extend this
capability in various ways, in particular, to eliminate the need for an
aberration- free path from source to the mixer, which can be accomplished by
combining spatial and temporal encoding techniques. The second category is the
imaging of objects embedded within the inhomogeneity. Several techniques are
proposed, such as confocal scanning with the use of extremely short pulses of
light.
