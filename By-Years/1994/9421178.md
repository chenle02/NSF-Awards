Abstract AST-9421178 Becker, Robert H. Collaborative Project: The FIRST Survey:
Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm. Dr. Robert Becker, at the University
of California at Davis, and Dr. David Helfand, at Columbia University, will
collaborate on a project to carry out a survey known as FIRST Survey: Faint
Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm. The survey will be done with the Very
Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at a wavelength of
twenty centimeters. A catalog of over one million radio sources, each with
position accurate enough to allow unambiguous identification of their optical
counterparts, will be derived from the data. FIRST will provide a fundamental
resource for the world-wide astronomical community. ***
