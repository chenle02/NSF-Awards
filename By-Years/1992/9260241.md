A "hypercomputer" is the parallel computer that emerges when one sums the unused
cycles over all the computer nodes on a Local Area Network. However, fault-
tolerance is a critical issue for longer-lived applications running on typical
LANS where node failures are not uncommon. Process checkpoint and restart
mechanisms will be developed to allow parallel network computations to proceed
even as their constituent parts fail. The resulting system will be a fault-
tolerant, extensible, cost effective supercomputer based on low cost, high
performance scientific workstations connected via a local area network.
