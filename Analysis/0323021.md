In this project, the PI will investigate several different aspects of the theory
of linear partial differential equations associated to manifolds with singular
Riemannian metrics. These include the propagation and diffraction of
singularities for the wave equation on manifolds with conic and edge
singularities, and the structure of the fundamental solution for the time-
dependent Schrodinger equation on manifolds with scattering metrics. Tools such
as the Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform will be studied and refined as needed.

Linear partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe wave propagation
(such as the classical wave equation and the Schrodinger equation) are of
fundamental importance in physics and geometry. The propagation of waves on
curved spaces often involves the geometry of the underlying space in a subtle
manner. When the space is `singular,' either in the sense of being infinite in
extent or of having degenerate properties in a finite region, the relationship
between geometry and the properties of solutions to PDEs is especially
fascinating and poorly understood.
