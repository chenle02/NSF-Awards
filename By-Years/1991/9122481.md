Models containing unobservable variables arise very often in economics,
psychology, and other social sciences. They may arise because of measurement
errors, or because behavioral responses are in part determined by unobservable
characteristics of agents. To obtain meaningful statistical inferences for
models containing unobservable variables requires either the expansion of
existing data bases together with more precise measurements of variables of
interest or the development of analytical frameworks to extract information from
currently available data sources. The aim of this project is to continue
developing analytical frameworks to enhance the reliability and validity of
Federal statistical data. Attention is directed to cases where the use of latent
variable models by researchers appears appropriate because of measurement
errors, or because of the lack of measurable counterparts for the conceptual
variables. The investigation centers on three issues (i) categorical or grouped
data, (ii) the hedonic approach to demand analysis, and (iii) modelling
unobserved heterogeneity in panel data analysis. The overall objective is to
refine the methodology to establish empirically valid inferences. Professor
Hsiao's research on modelling unobservable variables has been very fruitful.
While his analytical approach, often requires the imposition of hypothetical
assumptions, he has shown that it can yield useful information when properly
conducted. Not only does the approach provide a means to take advantage of
information that might otherwise be misused or totally ignored, it also can
accomplish this desirable goal at relatively low cost.
