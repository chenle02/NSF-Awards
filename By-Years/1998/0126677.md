Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a
laboratory for an existing two-course sequence in electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC) and in the senior design projects in this area. Industrial laboratories
and the labs at other academic institutions serve as models for the University
Michigan-Dearborn lab. Because the institution is in the heartland of the US
automotive industry, the experiments emphasizes automotive applications. The
laboratory is providing hands-on experience with experiments on radiated
emission, radiated immunity, conducted emission, and conducted immunity EMC
testing. The evaluation uses student and graduate surveys that are conducted
with assistance from the University's Center for Engineering Education and
Practice and an industrial advisory committee. Dissemination plans include
posting information on the laboratory web site and publishing conference papers
and journal articles.&lt;br/&gt;
