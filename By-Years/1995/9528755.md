ABSTRACT Edward L. Cussler University of Minnesota CTS-9528755 This project, a
joint effort of the University of Minnesota and the Deluxe Corporation, aims at
continuing development of lithographic inks with dramatically reduced
environmental impact. While these inks were invented and are being
commercialized by Deluxe, their basic science and their extensions to other
products are obscure. This project will supply that basic science. The key is
understanding the thermodynamics and transport phenomena of the ink's resins.
These are organic polymers of moderate molecular weight with pendant carboxylic
acid side chains. The resins are lipophilic when acidic but emulsifying agentq
when basic. As a result, the are successful in printing but can be washed with
water at high pH. They suggest similar, pollution preventing strategies for
machine oils, vanishes, and solvents for microelectronics.
