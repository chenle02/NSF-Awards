This conference will provide a comprehensive perspective on RecA and related
protins by bringing together for the first time scientists working on the
biology, genetics, enzymology and structure of RecA and related proteins from
prokaryotes to mammals. The meeting will be organized to encourage interaction
and informal discussion; the goal being to allow scientists working on RecA from
different disciplines to educate each other as to the approaches and
understanding they have of this area. The meeting should have an impact on a
number of fields because of the variety of processes that are controlled by
RecA.
