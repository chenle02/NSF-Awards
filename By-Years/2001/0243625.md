The UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy will host a 10-week summer REU
program providing a rich experience in research for participating undergraduates
each year. The department has a long history of training undergraduate students.
Prospective REU mentors are faculty mentors who have devised well-defined
research projects of appropriate scope and who will initiate and oversee the
participants' progress. Four areas of physics are targeted: plasma physics,
solid-state physics, astrophysics and high-energy physics. The aim of this REU
program is to convey to the student participants the full range of activities
involved in the research process. This includes carefully defining the project
in a realistic way, actually carrying out the planned research activities (a mix
of data acquisition, data analysis, theoretical explorations, and final
interpretations) and the written and oral presentation of the final results.
Some emphasis is given to the technical and oral presentations in this REU
because of a strong belief that writing and speaking about ones' data and
results are a critical, oft-ignored component of research, and that this is true
in any research environment be it university, government, or industry. The
individual research programs will be augmented with group activities such as
weekly seminars, lab tours, museum tours, a desert telescope experience and
other social events. The program is aimed at a geographically and culturally
diverse group of upper-division (junior level) undergraduate students in the
physical sciences.
