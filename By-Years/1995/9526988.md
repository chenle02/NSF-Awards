9526988 Getting The PI proposes experiments to measure the complex torsional
modulus of olivine and periclase at high temperatures, small strain amplitudes,
and seismic frequencies by subjecting a cylindrical sample to harmonic torsion.
The ability to measure strain wave attenuation over large frequency and
temperature ranges is important for the direct interpretation of attenuation of
seismic waves in the earth for the interpretation of lateral seismic velocity
variations, and to illuminate the fundamental relations between stress,
microdefects and strain wave propagation. The systematic study of inelasticity
in earth materials is a vital complement to the study of the elastic properties
of these materials. ***
