This is a grant for participant support at the "Workshop on Equivariant,
Chromatic, and Motivic Homotopy Theory" to be held at Northwestern University
from Monday, March 25 to Friday, March 29, 2013. A remarkable number of the main
results in homotopy theory of the past few years have been achieved by
calculation, following on and benefiting from a period of building and
implementing large theory, especially in derived algebraic geometry. The
conference organizers hope to emphasize this point, highlighting the recent
calculations and explaining what we have learned about basic homotopy theory.
The largest success has been the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem and
the attendant resurgence in interest in computational techniques in equivariant
stable homotopy theory. Complementing this has been more progress in chromatic
homotopy theory, both with large spectra, such as ring spectra coming from the
theory of topological automorphic forms, and with small spectra, such as the
K(2)-local sphere. There have also been new applications of old techniques, as
the use of the Goodwillie calculus to study the EHP sequence and the use of
Hochschild homology to make difficult calculations in algebraic
K-theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partly due to the shock provided by the solution
of the Kervaire Invariant Problem, a great many young researchers have entered
the field of algebraic topology, ranging from beginning graduate students to
junior tenure-line faculty. This grant will be used entirely to support the
participation of the members of this cohort in the conference. For those with
established or emerging research programs the conference will provide a forum to
publicize their work; for more junior researchers, the grant will support their
attendance and work to integrate them into the wider
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information can be found at the
