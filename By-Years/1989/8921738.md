Under the guidance of Dr. Henry Bunn, Mr. James Oliver will analyze
archaeological materials to collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will
focus on faunal remains from the FLK site which is located in Olduvai Gorge,
Tanzania. He will examine patterns of bone fracture, looking especially at
details of edge shape and conformation and, on this basis, attempt to determine
causation. To aid in this analysis, he will analyze bone broken by carnivores
and will also examine fracture confirmations of bone broken with lithic tools.
Through comparison of archaeological material with control samples, he should be
able to determine the relative roles which each agency played in shaping the FLK
assemblage. The Olduvai FLK site dates to approximately 1.7 million years ago,
and the archaeological materials it contains provide some of the first evidence
on early human behavior. The faunal materials from sites such as FLK have been
the subject of intense archaeological disagreement. Some researchers argue that
these remains were brought to the site by early hominids, were broken open by
them, and represent the results of hunting, butchering, and consumption. Others
argue that the bones result from carnivore kills and are only associated by
chance with stone tools. Mr. Oliver's research should help to resolve this
question. This project is important for several reasons. First, it will provide
insight into the cultural adaptations of early hominids. Secondly, it will help
to develop general methods which can be applied to many archaeological sites.
Finally, it will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
