The objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
project is to conduct an exploratory study of a research platform capable of
validating theories of system design. The research platform will eventually be a
cyberphysical system testbed where nominal and faulty behavior of the hardware,
software, and human control subsystems can be experimentally observed and
compared to predicted behavior by different design analysis theories. This
platform will enable the development of a scientific process for design theory
validation, explore the nature of nominal and faulty emergent behavior, and
expand research into fault detection and system health management. This project
is developing the platform through design, construction, and use of a small-
scale testbed incorporating an autonomous robot team, software, and human
interface and control. This exploratory study will address the feasibility of a
cyberphysical testbed, establish a baseline for design theory validation on an
example analysis theory, and provide preliminary data necessary for developing a
more complex testbed.

If successful, this research will establish a general process for system design
theory validation through experimentation. Further, the small-scale research
platform developed in this work will provide insight into testing and predicting
emergent behavior in systems and be used as a validation and evaluation tool to
support collaborative research in the systems design community. The validation
metrics that will be developed in this work can be used to optimize tools and
methods in ongoing research to address the complex nature of failure in
cyberphysical systems.
