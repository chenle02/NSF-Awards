Dr. Corliss is awarded funds to continue his research with Dr.Thunell
(University of S.Carolina) in the investigation of the Quaternary
paleoceanography of the Sulu and South China Seas. Sediment deposition in these
two basins is controlled by intervening sills that greatly inhibit the exhange
of bottom water. During a cruise in 1988 Drs. Corliss and Thunell collected
transects of cores along these sills to document changing paleoceanographic
conditions during glacial/interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene. With
their present award they will complete their core analyses and extend them to
include studies of living benthic foraminifera collected in their box cores. The
ecologic and isotopic information derived in this manner will be used to
reconstruct the history of changes of the late Quaternary paleoenvironments of
the region. Their data will also be used to reconstruct the late Quaternary
history of monsoonal circulation of the western equatorial Pacific; they intend
to compare this history with results derived from other studies of the NW Indian
Ocean.
