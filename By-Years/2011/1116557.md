Computers and people live in a world governed by policy. At the lowest level,
policies determine how information flows within networks; at the highest level,
they describe how users' personal information is shared across applications. Of
course, end-users, as policy authors, make mistakes: rules can have unintended
consequences and multiple policies can interact in ways that their authors
didn't intend. Users can benefit from tools to help them understand the policies
they write and maintain. Policy analysis refers to rigorous methods for
detecting these situations before they cause harm. Given the personal and
sensitive information migrating to cloud-based applications, analyzers for
mainstream policy contexts have clear impact on computing
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior research has shown that first-order
logic is a suitable foundation for capturing and analyzing many application- and
network-based policies. In particular, analyses based on scenario-finding
provide concrete and detailed feedback for policy authors. This project focuses
on techniques to make scenario-finding effective for real-world policies based
on first-order logic. Specifically, the project pursues (1) foundational
research on algorithms for model-finding in first-order logic, (2) methods to
analyze federations of policies across multiple levels of abstraction (such as
found in cloud computing), (3) handling additional policy features such as
numeric constraints and dynamic network routing, and (4) methods to
automatically generate repairs to policies against requirements or scenarios.
The PIs' existing Margrave policy analyzer serves as a testbed and deployment
vehicle for this research.
