9724949 Little The Federal Facilities Council is a cooperative association of
federal agencies having interests and responsibilities related to building
science and construction. Established in 1953 on the recommendation of a
committee of the National Research Council, the Federal Facilities Council (FFC)
serves as a unique forum in which the sponsoring agencies meet regularly among
themselves and with other organizations in the design and construction,
maintenance, management, operation, and evaluation of federal facilities.
Tangible products of the FFC include symposia, which usually are held at the
National Academy of Sciences, and reports. Through the years, the FFC has
conducted or sponsored more than 150 formal studies and investigations dealing
with virtually every aspect of the design, construction, and operation of
facilities. By helping the agencies solve problems and improve the design of
federal facilities, the FFC has saved taxpayers untold millions of dollars. ***
