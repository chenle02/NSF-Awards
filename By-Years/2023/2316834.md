In this project managed by the Chemistry Division at NSF, Professor Milligan and
his students at Thomas Jefferson University aim to design and study new chemical
reagents that are capable of forming ring structures in molecules upon exposure
to visible light. Prof. Milligan plans to use the newly developed reagents to
create new approaches for integrating visible light-enabled chemistry into
undergraduate organic chemistry curricula. The project will support and expand
partnerships between Thomas Jefferson University and the public school district
in the city of Philadelphia. The goals of these efforts are to improve access
and understanding of career opportunities in STEM among high school students.
Professor Milligan and his students focus on the design, synthesis, and study of
reagents that are capable of forming heterocycles upon irradiation with blue LED
light. The reagents of interest are “bifunctional” in nature, meaning that they
are capable of both traditional polar and visible light-triggered radical
reactions sequentially in the same flask. The goal of the work is to leverage
the paradigm of chemical reactivity to investigate the synthesis of a variety of
cyclic molecules, including molecules of biological interest.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
