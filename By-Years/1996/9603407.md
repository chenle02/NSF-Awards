This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in astrophysics
between the NSF Science and Technology (STC) for Particle Astrophysics at the
University of California, Berkeley, and the French Center for Astrophysics
Research, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France. The U.S. and French
research teams are led by Joseph Silk, Professor of Physics and member of the
STC at Berkeley, and Gilles Chabrier, leader of the French center. Specifically,
support will be provided to advanced U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers affiliated with the Berkeley STC for their travel to France. The
U.S. and French teams will focus on the fundamental problem of dark matter, a
topic identified as the highest priority in astrophysics research. Evidence
indicates that 90% or more of the Universe is made of dark matter, and that this
matter may be in the form of particles dating back to the beginning of the
Universe. The study of the dark matter problem has important implications for
understanding the origin of the Universe and the fundamental nature of matter.
In this project, the U.S. and French teams will perform theoretical
investigations of the astrophysical constraints on particle dark matter, the
characteristics of candidate dark matter particles, and stellar evolution in the
Universe, in which dark matter may play a central role.
