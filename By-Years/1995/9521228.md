9521228 McCaughan Wavelength division multiplex/switching networks have the
potential for greatly augmenting the flexibility and information carrying
capacity of present fiber optic systems. Channel number and channel density are
currently limited by the center-frequency stability of diode lasers. Processing
variations and carrier-induced index changes can produce up to +7 nm wavelength
variations among devices. As an system composed of an array of Er: LiNbO3
waveguide distributed feedback lasers integrated with traveling-wave modulators.
This material system possesses none of the processing or electronic
variabilities of semiconductor lasers. Lasing frequencies should, therefore, be
determined solely by the reproducibility of the grating lithography. We propose
a joint effort between the University of Wisconsin (UW) and United Technologies
Photonics (UTP) to produce the device. We expect to demonstrate fully functional
and packaged devices. The results of this program will be a greatly enhanced
understanding of these active waveguide devices, and the in-depth knowledge and
experience to develop commercial LiNbO3 products. ***
