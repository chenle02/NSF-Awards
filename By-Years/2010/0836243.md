This award provide support for participants at the next three Northeast
Probability Seminars which will be held in November, 2008-2010. This annual
conference series attracts roughly 80 participants each year. As in previous
meetings, the organizers anticipate roughly equal numbers of junior and senior
researchers participating in the conference. For the 2008 seminar, four
distinguished Probabilists (including one woman) have been invited to present
one-hour lectures. All four invited speakers have accepted the invitation.

Priority will be given for the support of junior researchers and members of
underrepresented groups who do not have other sources of support.
