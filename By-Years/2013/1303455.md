This project aims to extend and expand the Illinois Cyber Security Scholars
Program (ICSSP), which targets the government service workforce with the
CyberCorps(R): SFS scholarship program. The College of Law (COL) becomes a new
partner in this extension so SFS opportunities are now available to CS/ECE
graduates and Juris Doctor Law students. The ICSSP selects from an annual pool
of over 2,700 graduate and 6,700 undergraduate students and third-year community
college transfer students to create a cohort of Illinois Cyber Security
Scholars. Each year the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program admits 190 students of which
40% are from underrepresented minority groups. This expansion also improves
outreach to minorities and 2-year college transfer students and increases the
candidate pool of excellent students especially those coming from financially
disadvantaged backgrounds. The senior project, contact with UIUC's Information
Trust Institute faculty, and cooperative program with government facilities
expose scholars to a better integration of research and education than is
possible in the classroom alone. Furthermore, scholars bring their practical
experience back, enriching the classroom experience for other UIUC students. In
addition, proposed expansion of the ICSSP involves taking an interdisciplinary
approach that emphasizes the importance of law and policy in addition to
technical solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has an important
mission of preparing cybersecurity professionals for positions in agencies of
the Federal, state, local and tribal government. Using knowledge and skills
obtained in the program, the graduates are well prepared to meet challenges of
protecting the information and infrastructure resources of our Nation.
