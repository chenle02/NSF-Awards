This award is for an REU site for the next three summers to be held at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Fourteen undergraduates will spend eight
weeks during the summer to work with several faculty members on their research
projects and to participate in two seminars. The students will present their
results in seminars attended by all the students and many faculty members. The
students will be encouraged to publish their results if this seems appropriate.
The students will be recruited from a wide area primarily in the south but not
restricted to that area. The mathematical projects are in many parts of
mathematics. Some examples are computational methods for phase change problems
involving supercooling and dendritic growth, generalized semigroup rings,
construction of 3-dimensional manifolds, Egyptian fractions, modeling the
spatial nature of the spread of plant diseases, modeling the effects of a
toxicant on a population, systems of ordinary equations in simple control theory
and ecology growth, matrix involutions, random processes, and circle packings in
the plane.
