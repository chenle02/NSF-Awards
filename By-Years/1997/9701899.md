9701899 Goldstein This proposed research focuses on the consequences and
implications of leaf level nutrient limitation to photosynthesis, forest growth,
and ecosystem processes caused by nitrogen versus phosphorus, the two most
widespread and important limiting nutrients. The researchers propose to
determine the consequences and implications of leaf level N versus P limitation
in a very well-defined and constrained age sequence of sites in the Hawaiian
Islands. The sites are all natural forests dominated by a single tree species,
with remarkably constant environmental conditions, along which experiments have
demonstrated that N limits production in young sites, and P limits the oldest
site. Long-term fertilizer experiments are ongoing in these sites, so we can
evaluate both nutrient-limited plots and the consequences of removing limitation
by N or P. Results from this study will both augment and be integrated with
investigations of belowground processes, stand-level characteristics, and
ecosystem-level nutrient cycling to better understand tropical forest dynamics.
Such information will have substantial implications for both the responsiveness
of forests to change, and the restoration and management of forest ecosystems.
