This project develops the Multigrid Machine (MGM), a highly parallel VLSI
architecture for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using the
multigrid methods. The mutigrid methods are one of the most efficient solution
methods for PDEs and are inherently parallel. The MGM is developed using the
super-copresser methodology, which has been applied to realize special-purpose
VLSI architectures for sorting, matrix multiplication, and the solution of PDEs
using finite difference methods. The MGM is a synchronous architecture highly
suited for VLSI implementation and is able to solve problems of arbitrary
dimensions. The MGM developed with cost-effective supercomputer performance will
influence many domains which require high-speed solution of PDEs. Its
development will allow new knowledge to be gained in the use of synchronous
parallel arrays to implement asynchronous iterative algorithms and the design of
new parallel multigrid algorithms for VLSI implementation. The flexible software
emulator and timing model for the MGM will be useful for studying many other
domains in which multi- level algorithms are effective.
