9723330 McKim To investigate the mechanism of chromosome pairing in D.
melanogaster, a combined approach of genetics, molecular biology and cell
biology will be applied. Several aspects of the problem of initiating meiotic
chromosome pairing and recombination will be addressed. Very little is known
about the gene products that are required for this process. Two genes with
important roles in this process, mei-W68 and mei-P22, have recently been
identified. The protein product of these genes will be identified and the
expression pattern of the transcript and protein will be characterized. One of
the ways to understand this process is to characterize mutants defective in
meiotic recombination. The temporal expression pattern of these genes will
indicate when they are required. Only one gene involved in this process has been
cloned and its function remains unknown. Both genes will be characterized. The
object of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of meiotic homolog
pairing and recombination in Drosophila melanogaster females. During meiosis,
paired homologous chromosomes are held together by a structure known as the
synaptonemal complex (s.c.). Despite the ubiquitous nature of the s.c., there is
considerable controversy on how it forms, its components, and its relationship
to meiotic recombination. The studies in this proposal will enhance the
understanding of two crucial issues in meiotic chromosome behavior. First, how
do meiotic chromosomes pair and synapse; how much is based on DNA sequence
similarity, and how much is based on "pairing sites". Second, what gene products
have a role in this process, and what is the function of those gene products.
