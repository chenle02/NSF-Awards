Hemocyanins are large, oligomeric proteins containing binuclear copper centers
were oxygen is reversibly bound. The binuclear copper center is not unique to
hemocyanins but is present in a variety of proteins that perform many important
biological functions. Hemocyanins, however, may be considered as prototypes of
this general class of metalloproteins. The large size of the native hemocyanins
and the existence of subunit diversity have hindered researchers in their
attempts to unravel the structural basis for the disparity in chemical
reactivity and spectral properties exhibited by the binuclear copper centers of
hemocyanins of different species. Two subunits, designated IIIA and IV, of
Limulus hemocyanin show differences in chemical reactivity similar to those that
exist between the hemocyanins of different species. The small size and single
binuclear copper center of these subunits should greatly facilitate the
structural interpretation of chemical, spectral, and electrochemical studies.
The two Limulus subunits and proteolytic fragments of these containing intact
binuclear copper centers will be studied using chemical probes coupled with ESR
spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques in an attempt to
unravel the basis of the disparity in chemical reactivity and spectral
properties of the binuclear copper centers of the hemocyanins of different
species.
