This project enables Franklin Pierce College to introduce "Discovery Laboratory
Exercises" to 47% of its undergraduates. Our working definition of a "Discovery
Laboratory", which is compatible with Pierce's newly implemented
interdisciplinary curriculum plan, includes: exercises to encourage the
induction of principles by experiment and not merely verification; a forum for
students to investigate scientific processes at a level consistent with their
own intellectual development; experiments with instruments that offer state of
the art laboratory experiences to emulate the future workplace; generating the
excitement of discovery in science to attract undergraduates to careers in
science; opportunities for both science and non-science majors to experience the
capabilities of technologically advanced instrumentation. The twenty-four
discovery laboratory exercises cited in this work will be applied to Biology,
Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Integrated Science courses. These labs are
designed to improve the scientific and technological literacy of both the
science and non-science major students and to convey that the study of science
is an active process - not a reactive one.
