9520874 Murnane This grant supports a US-Bulgaria Research Project on
"Cooperative Research in Ultrashort-Pulse Laser Optics" between Drs. Margaret M.
Murnane and Henry C. Kapteyn of Washington State University, and Prof. Ivan P.
Christov of the Department of Physics of Sofia University. This project will
perform coordinated experimental and theoretical work on novel techniques in
ultrashort light pulse generation and measurement. The project will combine the
experimental expertise of the group at Washington State University with the
theoretical capabilities of the group at Sofia, to address important and
significant problems in ultrafast optics. The investigators will perform: (1)
experimental and theoretical studies on ultrashort-pulse modelocked Ti:sapphire
lasers, to investigate the fundamental limits of modelocking, and study the
physics of the modelocking mechanisms with a view to design more efficient and
better femtosecond lasers; (2) studies of fundamental limits on the electronic
nonlinear response of materials, using light pulses of unprecedented short
duration, with a view toward impacting the design of efficient frequency
conversion techniques for ultrafast studies in many areas of science, heretofore
experimentally inaccessible; and (3) the generation of 1-10 femtosecond optical
pulses in the ultraviolet and x-ray region of the spectrum using novel and
speculative methods, sources which would have uses in the study of ultrafast
chemical and material dynamics. This project in physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in
Bulgaria and the United States to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
