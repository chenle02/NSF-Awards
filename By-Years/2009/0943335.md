This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation for the &lt;br/&gt;R/V Cape Hatteras, a 136-ft long
research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the
Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request for a Ku-
Band antennea was declined becaause the Program is going a different directions
with fleet-wide communications. The award includes one
item:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Ultra Pure Water
System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
