This award supports the purchase of a digital confocal microscope and image
analysis system. The image analysis system will allow custom-design of unlimited
programming routines for automated and semi-automated image capture for
conventional, confocal and real-time video microscopy. The confocal system will
employ an inverted microscope to accommodate imaging of live cell cultures,
whole tissue mounts and fixed, slide-mounted samples. The group of 5 major users
who will share the instrument have research programs in diverse aspects of cell
biology, including neurobiology, cytoskeletal dynamics, cell-cell interactions,
and environment interactions between bacteria and algae. Confocal microscopy has
become a standard tool in cell biology. However, there is currently no confocal
microscope at or near the institution. Thus the impact on the users' research
will be substantial. In addition, over 20 students at all levels from
undergraduate to postdoctoral have ongoing projects that will directly benefit
from the confocal system.
