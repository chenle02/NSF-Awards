This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is intended to
demonstrate Surveyor Telescope for Atmospheric Research (STAR) as a viable real-
time nighttime ozone monitor. STAR is reaching fruition as an atmospheric
extinction monitor in support of other optical instrumentation. STAR can also be
used for direct data collection by using the extinction properties of absorption
lines and bands. To demonstrate this data, which include information from the
Chappuis bands of ozone, are analyzed, interpreted and validated against
published sources. The anticipated result is to incorporate data analysis
algorithms in the data collection routines so real-time data reporting will be
demonstrated. STAR is also poised to measure atmospheric water vapor and upon
further study has multiple applications for atmospheric research.&lt;br/&gt;
Such an instrument will aid the understanding of global atmospheric changes by
allowing detailed, regular, worldwide nighttime measurements of relevant
quantities. Having divulged its potential as an ozone monitor, and through a
preliminary survey of the atmospheric studies community, interest in STAR has
already been established, and its market potential has developed well beyond
initial expectations.&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: atmospheric extinction, ozone monitor,
computer imaging telescope, nighttime&lt;br/&gt;
