9351541 Weiss This project involves fundamental changes in the ways statistics
is taught in required and advanced undergraduate statistics courses in
psychology. Students, many of whom have poor academic preparation and/or
language difficulties, benefit from a highly visual and interactive learning
environment by using an electronic classroom facility that contains student
workstations with computers linked an instructor's station, as well as to the
department and university computer networks. Mathematical and statistical
illustrations are presented in a manner which enhances concepts. Students also
perform appropriate exercises while the instructor monitors their progress and
interacts with them. It is expected that the facility will also benefit
instruction in experimental psychology, testing, and courses in computer
applications in psychology. ***
