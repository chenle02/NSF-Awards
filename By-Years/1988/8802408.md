Many interesting optimization problems are nonsmooth, i.e. the functions to be
minimized are not differentiable in some parts of the domain. Application areas
are diverse, including structural analysis, control engineering, operations
research and numerical analysis. The main goal of the proposed research is the
dsign of efficient algorithms for some important classes of nonsmooth
optimization problems. This is possible only by taking full advantage of the
structure which is present. Because of the lack of smoothness, standard
algorithms are not applicable.
