9624962 Ailion NMR (and NQR) techniques for the study of the ultraslow
diffusion of large topological. defects will be further developed by the PI and
applied to detecting the diffusion of the modulation wave in structurally
incommensurate insulating and incommensurate glasses. These techniques are based
on measurements of the magnetization decay over the incommensurately broadened
NMR lineshape. In addition, rotating-frame relaxation time techniques will be
developed for measuring the slow motions of quadrupolar nuclei. These techniques
will be applied to elucidating the nature of such motions during the transition
from a perfect incommensurate crystal to an incommensurate glass. The techniques
developed in this project should be applicable to motions of other topological
defects such as dislocations in deformed solids, domain walls in magnets,
superconducting flux lines, charge and spin density waves, and layered
boundaries in layered structures. %%% Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
techniques will be developed further and applied to the study of the ultraslow
motions of large massive defects in solids, which can not be detected by other
techniques. However, a novel technique, recently developed by the principal
investigator, can detect motions that are several orders of magnitude slower
than can be observed by the conventional techniques. In particular, these
methods will be applied to the motions of a particular defect. called the
modulation wave, which exists in a special class of disordered material (called
incommensurate), which has properties intermediate between that of a perfect
crystal and a glass. This research touches on the transition between perfect
crystals and disordered matter as well as on the nature of glasses. The insight
gained may be important in understanding the properties of magnets and
superconductors, and the new techniques should be app licable to motions of
other large-scale defects in widely different solid state systems. ***
