This project changes the way the engineering curriculum is structured by: 1)
repackaging the material taught in the basic engineering sciences into five
courses, each of which is based on similar scientific and mathematical
background; 2) including in these revised engineering science courses
significant engineering design experience. These steps will address several
concerns about engineering curricula including: 1) the increasing number of
"basic" engineering science courses that result from identifying these courses
with the various engineering disciplines; 2) the separation of engineering
design from engineering science in the minds of students with the consequent
lack of appreciation for the interaction of engineering science with engineering
design; 3) an apparent loss of interest by students in creative engineering
efforts as a result of the heavy doses of analysis in the engineering sciences.
Institutional funds commited to this project are approximately one-third of NSF
funds.
