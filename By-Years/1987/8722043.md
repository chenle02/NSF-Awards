This geological field conference will bring together a group of U.S. and
Southwest Pacific geologists and geophysicists with the geological structure and
history of the collision zone of Papua New Guinea across the Ramu-Markham Fault
Zone. Landsat imagery of the zone will be obtained prior to the field conference
to provide reference material for evaluation of the stratigraphy, paleontology,
and metamorphism of the zone. This field study will serve as the basis for
planning of future international broader-scale field research in this region
which has generally not been accessible until recently.
