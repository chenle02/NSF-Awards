Computational geometry is the branch of theoretical computer science devoted to
the design, analysis, and implementation of geometric algorithms and data
structures. Geometry is everywhere: geometric problems arise naturally in any
computational field that simulates or interacts with the physical world. The
planned research focuses on the fundamental problem of designing algorithms that
are robust and can withstand (potentially catastrophic) failure. Failure might
range from network failure, corruption of data, or data being noisy. The
algorithms and insights obtained from the technical work will benefit computer
science and related disciplines where geometric algorithms are widely used. The
project will support and train at least two new PhD students in Computational
Geometry at UIUC. In addition, the project would train underrepresented
undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The problems to be studied in this
project include: (i) reliable spanners, which remain good spanners even after a
catastrophic failure of nodes, (ii) computing good orderings of points, such
that various problems can be solved directly on these orders, (iii) sampling for
convex ranges, (iv) geometric optimization where the input is provided
implicitly, (v) geometric partitioning via Ham-Sandwich cuts, and efficient
geometric algorithms for such problems, and (vi) handling outliers for various
geometric optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
