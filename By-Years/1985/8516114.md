This research is focused on the development of new interactive graphic design
techniques for spatial mechanisms. The goal is to make available to designers of
mechanisms (e.g. manipulators, mechanical grippers, etc.) certain recently
developed spatial synthesis tools. Specifically, the target systemd will provide
means for computing, manipulating, and displaying from arbitrary viewpoints the
loci of lines in (parametric) mechanisms with mechanizable trajectories.
