We propose to carry out a systematic spectroscopic study of the crystal
chemistry of iron, including investigations of oxidation, reduction,
disproportionation, and partitioning of iron in mantle and core materials at
elevated pressures. The principal tools will be 57Fe Mossbauer and crystal-field
spectroscopy, techniques that are ideally suited to studies of iron-bearing
phases. The results will be correlated with vibrational spectra measured by
Raman scattering and infrared absorption spectroscopy. The multi-anvil apparatus
at SUNY Stony Brook, and diamond-anvil cell and piston-cylinder apparatus at the
Geophysical Laboratory will be used for their complimentary pressure range and
experimental conditions. Spectra will also be studied as a function of pressure
in diamond-anvil cells. We shall map the P-T-fO2 conditions of the
graphite/diamond buffer to lower mantle pressures with the piston-cylinder
apparatus and the multi-anvil device and at ultrahigh pressure with the diamond-
anvil cell. The results will be used to enlarge the existing thermodynamic
database for iron-bearing mantle and core materials, which is crucial for
modelling the mineralogy, chemical composition, and oxidation state of the deep
interior.
