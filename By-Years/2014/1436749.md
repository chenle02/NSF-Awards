Renewable energy has been increasingly penetrating into the power grid system
due to the stimulus plan from the government and its environment-friendly
nature. But meanwhile the output of renewable energy (such as wind and solar) is
intermittent. As a result, the increasing renewable energy penetration increases
volatility for the power grid system, which is reflected as more significant
electricity price fluctuations in the current deregulated electricity markets.
Fortunately, the batteries of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles can serve as
buffers to accommodate this by storing electricity when the renewable energy
generation is high and discharging otherwise, so as to achieve power balance and
flatten the electricity prices. This provides a promising win-win process of
tackling renewable energy generation uncertainty and reducing fossil fuel usage,
which can further achieve a sustainable integrated power-transportation system.
This award supports fundamental research to efficiently integrate the plug-in
hybrid electric vehicles into the power grid system at transmission and
distribution levels, and show how this improves current deregulated electricity
market practice. If successful, this project will help increase utilization of
renewable energy and reduce greenhouse emissions for both power and
transportation industry at minimum cost. By closely collaborating with
Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the findings of this project can be
implemented to industry faster. Finally, the underrepresented Ph.D. students
will be recruited and motivated to participate in this project.

Integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles into the power grid system is
technically challenging. This research is to explore advanced stochastic
optimization and game theory models to formulate problems and develop innovative
solution approaches to solve the models so as to help derive optimal decisions
for system operators and market participants with different objectives, such as
maximizing the social welfare for the system operators and maximizing the total
profit for the market participants. This study will lead to innovative trading
policies for the market participants and refined market design rules to ensure
fairness and cost efficiency for the electricity markets, while ensuring high
utilization of renewable energy. Furthermore, the innovative solution techniques
explored, including convex and monotonicity analyses for Markov decision process
utilizing the problem structure, linearization and decomposition algorithms for
stochastic optimization problems with equilibrium constraints, and cutting
planes and branch-and-cut algorithms for multistage stochastic integer programs,
will lead to methodology innovations in each corresponding field.
