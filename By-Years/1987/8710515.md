The objective of this project is to study the electrical properties of single
crystal junctions of Zn0 epitaxially grown on yttria stabilized Zr02 using AC
impedance spectroscopy techniques. In AC impedance spectroscopy, the impedance
of a sample is measured as a function of frequency, Z(w), and an equivalent
circuit representation of the sample is developed using complex plane
techniques. Each component in the equivalent circuit represents some physical
parameter of the sample. Study of how the components vary with changes in
experimental conditions provides insight into the physical processes that govern
charge transport. The series of experiments that will be done to study the
Zn0/Zr02 single crystal interface are, 1) Z(w) will be monitored as a function
of temperature in an inert gas atmosphere, 2) Z(w) will be monitored as a
function of applied bias voltage at constant temperature, and 3) Z(w) will be
measured as a function of oxygen partial pressure at constant temperature. The
results of this series of experiments will provide valuable insight into the
nature of the charge transport process across solid semiconductor/electrolyte
boundaries.
