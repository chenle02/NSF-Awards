The University of Michigan is disseminating the Global Rivers Environmental
Education Network (GREEN) project nationally. Teams from five regions
(southeast, northeast, southwest, northwest, and midwest) will be selected and
trained to be leaders of Project GREEN. These regional teams will be responsible
for the recruitment and training of other middle and high school teacher teams
in their area. The project builds on previous work using watersheds to create a
science/social science interdisciplinary course at the secondary level. The
project will begin August 1, 1992 and continue to July 30, 1995. Cost-share for
the project is approximately 16%.
