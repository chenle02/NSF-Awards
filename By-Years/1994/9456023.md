9456023 Berger The University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University,
William Rainey Harper College, and Saint Xavier University propose the formation
of The Chicago Consortium for Applications of Mathematics Across the Curriculum.
This initiative will create, share and evaluate curriculum changes and
enhancement materials associated with the applications of mathematics in the
physical and biological sciences. This new consortium will develop concurrent
syllabi, create modules and software, and design linked courses which will be
tested first at the consortium schools, and later at peer institutions which
share the largely urban and commuter student body demographics. Input from
Argonne National Laboratory will be an added enrichment source and provide
insight into math/science applications of current national importance.
