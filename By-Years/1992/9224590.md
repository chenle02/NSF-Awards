The funding will support the conference on Fundamental Aspects of Quantum
Theory at the University of South Carolina on December 10-12, 1992. The
conference brings together from around the world experts on the theoretical and
experimental foundations of quantum mechanics and its connections to gauge
theory, condensed-matter physics and quantum gravity. Other topics that will be
discussed are quantum optics, quantum statistics, quantum cosmology, the
measurement problem, and geometric phases. The proceedings will be published.
