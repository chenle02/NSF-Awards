The general objective of this project is to study material instabilities, such
as phase transitions for fluids and elastic solids and metastable equilibrium
states for crystals with defects, in a Continuum Mechanics framework. The
theoretical tools involved in this program are continuum mechanics, geometric
measure theory, partial differential equations, thermoelastodynamics and the
calculus of variations. Relaxation and lower semicontinuity properties of
nonconvex bulk and interfacial energies will be obtained and singular
perturbation methods will be used in nonlinear elasticity to resolve
nonuniqueness of equilibria. These results will help us understand and predict
the surface structures and geometries of crystals subjected to thermal or
mechanical treatments. When the minimum energy is not attained, the role played
by the surface tension in stabilizing the oscillations, and the dynamical
creation of the microstructure and its evolution within the framework of
generalized measure-valued solutions, will be studied. Thermochemical equilibria
for coherent two-phase alloys when physical variables, such as composition, are
taken into account will be considered. This study will enable predicting the
dependence of equilibrium phase composition on the overall composition and
volume fraction. Models to analyze defect interaction, dislocations, different
types and arrangements of domains and global effects of defects will be
addressed. In particular, variational formulations for metastable equilibria of
elastoplastic crystals with defects will be analyzed. The mathematical problems
addressed in this project -- phase transitions for fluids and alloys,
equilibrium states for crystals with defects, defect interaction and global
effects of defects -- are areas of intense work in contemporary material
science. Only recently they have been addressed mathematically in a systematic
way. The questions involved escape the framework of classical mathematical
theories. Therefore, accomplishing these goals will require manipulation of some
very recent mathematical tools and possibly the introduction of new ones.
Addressing such issues may have a significant impact in the industry and
technology as it will help to predict the surface structures and geometries of
crystals subjected to thermal or mechanical treatments and, in general, it will
promote a better understanding of smart materials.
