With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Ned A. Porter of the Department
of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. The research will extend
the PI's investigations of the mechanism of oxidations in chemical and
biochemical systems. In order to facilitate these mechanistic studies, a series
of free radical clocks will be developed. These clocks will be used to measure
the rates of reaction of peroxyl radicals with a variety of biologically
relevant substrates. The technique will allow measurements over a wide range of
rate constants. The chemistry of substituted pyridinols, a new class of
antioxidants that appear to react with peroxyl radicals some 10 to 100 times
faster than vitamin E, will be examined. A variety of these pyridinols will be
evaluated as antioxidants in low-density lipoproteins, LDL, the peroxidation of
which has been implicated the development of coronary artery disease. This
research, which will involve students in a broadly interdisciplinary program, is
expected to provide fundamental data that will contribute to our basic
understanding of antioxidant chemistry and biology.
