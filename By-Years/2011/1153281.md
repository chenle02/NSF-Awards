Building on an infrastructure of student support assembled with the help of an
NSF grant to assist students with disabilities, the University of Southern Maine
is testing the effectiveness of scholarships in improving educational
opportunities for students of STEM disciplines. The program awards scholarships
to academically talented but financially needy incoming students, both first-
year and transfer, to offset a large part of their unmet need. The students are
supported through an intensive summer bridge program, a living and learning
community, faculty and peer mentors, advisors, and tutors, along with seminars
to foster strong study habits and career awareness. Opportunities for
undergraduate research and co-operative internships further engage the students.
The model thus developed is non-intrusive but comprehensive, using recruitment,
retention, and placement to maximize the success of students, many of whom are
of non-traditional age, first in their family to attend college, or otherwise
underrepresented in the STEM workforce.
