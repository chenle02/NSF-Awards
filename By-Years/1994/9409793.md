9409793 Boesgaard Observations will be made to determine the abundances of the
light elements lithium, beryllium and oxygen in stars and in the interstellar
gas. The abundances of lithium and beryllium in the oldest stars gives
information on inhomogenieties in the early universe while the beryllium and
oxygen abundances in stars of various ages hold clues to the way in which
elements formed as the galaxy aged. Both lithium and beryllium will be used to
test mechanisms which operate within stars. This research will take advantage of
new technical developments in astronomical detectors and new theoretical
advances in stellar atmospheres, stellar interiors and Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
