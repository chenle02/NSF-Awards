We have demonstrated heterologous protein expression in Neurospora crassa using
two promoters - the glucose repressible promoter of grg-1 and the constitutive
promoter of the B-tubulin. Neurospora transformants expressing a bovine
preprochymosin cDNA accumulate soluble, enzymatically active mature chymosin in
the culture medium. One important element of heterologous protein expression
systems is the appropriate host strain, for which protease deficient mutants are
often superior. Neurospora secretes an alkaline protease in the presence of
protein in the culture medium when also starved for carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur.
When induced, the alkaline protease comprises 40% of secreted proteins. We are
cloning cDNA and the genomic locus encoding the N. crassa secreted alkaline
protease in order to develop an improved host and additional expression vectors
for expression of heterologous proteins. %%% The development of microbial
systems for expression of heterologous proteins has enabled the isolation of
greater amounts of scarce proteins, often in greater purity than is possible
from the original source. Proteins so expressed have applications ranging from
industrial use, through protein biochemistry research, to human therapeutics.
These clones will be used subsequently to create alkaline protease deficient
disruption mutantions and to add the protease promoter and secretion signal
peptide to our expression vector repertoire.
