This project incorporates programmable logic control equipment into the
instrumentation and motor control laboratory. Used in conjunction with the
existing pneumatic trainers, boiler control panels, flow, level, pressure, and
temperature process stations, process control plant simulator and motor control
circuits, the state-of-the-art programmable logic control workstations allows
students to directly apply their understanding of theories presented in class.
This also allows students the opportunity to be exposed to practical
applications and experimentation with programmable logic control equipment and
instrumentation.
