Winthrop College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus network
to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern area of
the country and comprises 13 states. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Winthrop College a 56 thousand bits per
second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network
speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers
along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the school to explore innovative educational resources.***//
