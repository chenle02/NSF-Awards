This project aims to build a foundational library of primitives for calculating
statistics on time series at online or near-online speeds. A time series is
simply a collection of data arriving in time order. They arise in fields ranging
from physics to finance or medicine or music. Often the data comes from sensors,
that are becoming deployed in rapidly increasing number of applications and
whose data rates are continuing to increase sharply. Fast (online) response is
desirable in many applications (e.g., remote aiming of a telescope to a fast-
moving object of interest). The faster the volumes of the time series data grow,
the more important it is to derive summary statistics about the data. This
project aims to provide tools for the rapid incremental computation of basic
statistics (such as correlation and burst detection) on collections of thousands
or more time series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has two thrusts: the
development of algorithmically efficient methods for calculating such statistics
and the engineering of these methods and already known approaches to yield
practical implementations. To ensure concreteness, the research and
implementation activities are driven in part by collaborations with physicists
and other scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical primitives will
enhance research and the national cyberinfrastructure in any application
requiring the fusion of time series information. Note that this work encompasses
all kinds of time series, including time series for music and other media. This
may attract K-12 students, drawing them to science through applications such as
query by humming. The project's Web site
(http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/shasha/papers/statstream.html) is used to broaden
dissemination of results. &lt;br/&gt;
