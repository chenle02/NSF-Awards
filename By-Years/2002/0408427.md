Sensing Intrinsic Nano-Microstructural Characteristics of Hardening Concrete
with High-Frequency Transverse Waves&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To assure high quality
of concrete construction, reliable sensors are needed to monitor the setting and
hardening process. This proposal presents a high frequency wave reflection
(HFWR) technique, which uses ultrasonic shear waves to monitor the hydration
process of cementitious materials. The proposed investigations are aimed at
studying the fundamental relationships among evolving microstructure, mechanical
properties, and HFWR-measurements. It is intended to draw synergies by combining
experimental techniques, which probe nano and microstructure and numerical
modeling. The collaboration with a world-wide network of researches will involve
undergraduate and graduate students. The research plan is to develop a sensor
that reads the information stored in the evolving nano and microstructure and
immediately use this data to infer the intrinsic mechanical properties. The
procedures and models to be developed have a high potential to be generalized to
other materials that undergo percolation processes.&lt;br/&gt;
