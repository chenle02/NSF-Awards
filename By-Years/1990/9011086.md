Dr. Goldberg is continuing his research toward a biography of General Leslie R.
Groves, Commanding General of the Manhattan Engineer District. No scholarly
biography of Groves has yet been written. All previous treatments of Groves show
him "full blown" and unexplained in September 1942 in the office of OSRD
Director Vannevar Bush. Dr. Goldberg's study is providing a context for
understanding who Leslie R. Groves was, why he was picked to head the atom bomb
project and why he was so effective. In addition, this biographical study
provides a vehicle for analyzing anew the changing relationship between the
military and civilian sectors of the American scientific and technological
research communities during and immediately after World War II.
