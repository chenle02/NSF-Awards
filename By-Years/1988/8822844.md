This award will provide funds for three faculty, two research associates, three
graduate students and three undergraduate assistants to continue their research
in elementary particle physics at the Fermilab proton-antiproton Tevatron
collider, the world highest energy colliding beam facility presently available.
The principal experimental effort of the Michigan State University group
involves collaboration on the construction and operation of a new large
calorimeter for the D0 detector (experiment E740). The group has designed and is
producing the charge readout system of the calorimeter. It also has the
responsibility for development of the calorimeter on-line software and to
perform the off-line analysis and extraction of physics results for the first
run of the D0 experiment. The proposed experiment seeks to understand the nature
of the elementary constituents of matter. Particular emphasis will be on hard
scattering processes at high energies especially lepton production in hadronic
collisions and production of particles with high transverse momenta. This field
has been very rich in recent years resulting in much new information on the type
of elementary constituents (quarks and gluons) and on the nature of their
interaction.
