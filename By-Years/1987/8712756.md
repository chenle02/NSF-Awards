The long range objective of this program is to develop mass culture procedures
that can be readily applied to improve the efficiency of producing monoclonal
antibodies (MAb's). This proposal focuses on using engineering approaches to
describe cells at the metabolic level so that the ways they utilize energy to
proliferate and produce MAb's can be better understood and utilized to gain
effective control. In Phase I, reactor systems will be tested to compare their
performances, and they will be characterized with respect to their mass transfer
coefficients, cell densities, and MAb production rates. In Phase II, attention
will be directed to more fundamental aspects such as the mathematical modeling
of cellular growth and metabolism. Essential to this effort will be
representation of complex biological nonlinearities within a structured
mathematical formalism. Using these mathematical formulas, models of cellular
subsystems will be developed and then integrated to give the cell growth model
and MAb production kinetics. The kinetic information will then be incorporated
into a reactor model to determine the most effective production strategies and
control methods. This grant application is an excellent example of the type of
crossdisciplinary proposal we wish to see in the Engineering Directorate's
Biotechnology Program. It was rated very good by the cross-disciplinary Panel
reviewing this proposal and the Principal Investigators are considered well
qualified to carry out the proposed research. I recommend funding of this
proposal for three years in accordance with the revised budget.
