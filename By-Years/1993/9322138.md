9322138 Stevens This program provides twelve Summer Undergraduate Research
Experiences (SURE) Fellowships in the Biological Sciences for each of two years
beginning in the summer of 1994. The program will be managed by the Council on
Undergraduate Research (CUR). The Program will focus its attention on this
country's approximately 1,000 primarily undergraduate institutions. Because of
their size and/or lack of a long tradition of undergraduate research at these
institutions, it has not been possible or practical to establish NSF-REU sites
at many of them. Consequently, a major segment of the academic community is
precluded from participation in the NSF's REU program. A special feature of
these Fellowships is that the participating students (and faculty) will be
linked by a specially developed electronic bulletin board which the students
will use weekly to report progress on their research. The bulletin board will
also enable students to share their experiences with each other and to pose
questions about their research as the summer progresses. ***
