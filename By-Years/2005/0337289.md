This project is a one-year study to begin to establish mulit-channel seismic
profiling as a tool for physical oceanography. The PI will investigate what
oceanographic features are reflective at low frequencies and to acquire the
first joint physical oceanographic and seismic reflection data set. Existing
datasets in the North Atlantic will also be used to determine whether water
column reflections exist in those data sets. Broader Impacts: This study will
develop a new approach for imaging thermohaline structure in the ocean by
bringing ideas, tools and people from a different discipline into physical
oceanography. The study will also contribute to the education of students and a
postdoc including a woman and a minority.
