This two-year project is directed toward middle school mathematics teachers and
includes four-week summer institutes, classroom followup, and academic year
inservice meetings. Teachers will work with the Middle School Mathematics
Project materials, participate in an open-ended problem solving seminar, and
study probability and statistics. The project includes an opportunity for
teachers to conduct summer demonstration classes with middle school students, to
participate in a "Community of Scholars", and to become involved in leadership
activities. Project staff will be involved in classroom followup and support.
Cost sharing from local school districts, Southern Illinois University, and the
Illinois Board of Higher Education equals 26% of the NSF award.
