The PI studies several problems about triangulations of (lattice) polytopes
which are motivated by connections to other fields of mathematics: The
reconstruction problem is concerned with the relation of a polytope and its
graph, which is of interest for linear optimization. Algebraic applications are
concerned with polytopes whose vertices have all integral coordinates. The
existence problem of unimodular triangulations and its variations has
implications to computational algebra, algebraic geometry, and physical string
theory. The methods used are mainly discrete geometric or combinatorial, with
some ideas borrowed from topology and differential geometry.

Convex polytopes are fascinating objects that have intrigued not only
mathematicians since the ancient Greeks. The Platonic solids --- the
tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron ---
are the most prominent and most mystified examples. Since George Dantzig's
simplex method, linear optimization has been a driving force behind polytope
theory, and it certainly is one of the most successful applications of
mathematics to the `real world'. In the mean time, polytope theory found many
more applications within mathematics, and beyond. Besides linear and integer
programming, there are optimization, CAD, visualization, and even theoretical
physics, just to name a few.
