It is widely recognized that the earth's climate is dynamic and that significant
changes have occurred in the past. Paleoenvironmental records from ice cores are
an important tool for understanding the processes responsible for previous
climate changes. This award supports the measurement of the electrical
conductivity of an ice core that will be drilled at McMurdo Dome, Antarctica in
1992-1993. Specific objectives of this proposal are: (1) to assist in
determining the age/depth relation for the McMurdo Dome core and to provide the
location of stratigraphic marker horizons; (2) to identify segments of the core
that have anomalous chemical characteristics so that other research groups can
direct their efforts to significant, short duration features and; (3) provide a
record of the volcanic activity that has affected the area.
