This award will support five students participating in research at Haystack
Observatory. A poster was widely distributed which listed sample of possible
students' projects was widely distributed. Five students will carry out research
projects under the supervision of individual scientists at Haystack Observatory,
which carries out major research programs in radio astronomy, geodesy,
atmospheric science, and radar wave propagation. The hands-on experience
available to the students is an excellent approach to attract them into science
research careers. The award is made under the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Program.
