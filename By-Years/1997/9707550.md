9707550 He This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers.
Dr. He will develop diffusion or mobility ordered homonuclear coherence
correlated NMR spectroscopy. A dimension of electrophoretic mobility or
diffusion will be introduced to the homonuclear correlated spectroscopy (COSY)
by applying a pulsed electric field and magnetic field gradients. In a dimension
of electrophoretic flow of diffusion, COSY spectra of different proteins will be
sorted according to their electrophoretic mobilities or diffusion rates. Hence,
the traditional COSY spectra of the proteins will be separated and their
interactions studied. The technique being developed here will provide new
information for studying folding processes and protein interactions during
molecular signaling processes, during DNA transcription, or during normal and
abnormal cell growth. ***
