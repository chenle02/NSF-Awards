9457903 Robicheaux This research involves the theoretical description of atomic
and molecular states near the ionization threshold. Time dependent techniques
will be studied for insight into the electronic dynamics. The direct calculation
of experimentally measured parameters that include statistical errors will be
undertaken for correlated systems. ***
