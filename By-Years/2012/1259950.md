The ASPIRE project provides scholarships to support academically talented
students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in
STEM at Johnson C. Smith University. In addition to scholarship aid, students
are being supported through such activities as early involvement in
undergraduate research driven by community challenges and a STEM mentoring
network which includes peers, faculty, alumni and local industry professionals.
The intellectual merit of this project lies in the well-conceived plan that
leverages financial support for students with new activities and existing
resources at this historically black college. The combination provides
comprehensive support for the STEM scholars, in many cases shortening time to
degree. The broader impacts include connecting talented graduates with the STEM
workforce and graduate programs, as well as providing a well-assessed model for
similar institutions in the region and beyond.
