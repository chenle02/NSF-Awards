9221651 Potasek The understanding of solid state devices and their interaction
with optical fiber components is of importance in both solid-state physics and
communications. Electroabsorption modulators made with bulk III-V semiconductors
or multiple quantum well (MQW) are becoming important devices for encoding
information in high-speed lightwave systems. Important issues remain to be
resolved regarding their operation at high optical power, their integration with
single-frequency lasers, and the effect of chirp on long-distance, high-speed
fiber transmission for conventional and soliton systems. A study of the dynamic
effects of the saturation of modulators is important for future applications of
these devices, since most applications require the devices to operate at both
high speed and high optical intensity. Additionally, we plan to study the
effects of high input intensity of the modulator chirp since, for the most
applications in fiber optic communications systems, especially when erbium-doped
optical fiber amplifiers are used, it is important that the modulator operate
with low chirp. ***
