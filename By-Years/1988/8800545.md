This award supports the participation of U.S. scientists in a bilateral seminar
with Taiwan on medium and high-energy nuclear physics to be held in Taipei, May
1988. The seminar will focus on a broad range of issues facing medium-energy and
high-energy nuclear physics, in light of construction of technology such as CW
electron machines in the GeV range, which may allow unprecedented advances in
particle physics. This project is sponsored under the cooperative science
program between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Coordination
Council for North American Affairs (CCNAA).
