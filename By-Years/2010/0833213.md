Intellectual Merit: Nanotechnology, which focuses on the synthesis,
manipulation, and application of materials less than 100nm in size, is a
tremendously popular subject in modern day science and engineering research.
These nano-sized particles possess properties, such as increased surface area
and mobility, which are unique and can be exploited to advance emerging
technologies. To date, nanoparticles have been used in a wide array of
technologies including electronic, biomedical, energy, environmental, catalytic
and materials applications. Due to their significant potential, nanoscale
materials are expected to be manufactured at an increasing rate in the near
future. However, it is currently uncertain whether their environmental risks
outweigh their technological benefits.

The focus of this proposed research is on inorganic nanoparticles, specifically
metal oxides (e.g., ZnO and TiO2), which have been incorporated into personal
care products (PCPs) for UV-protection.

Toxic substances in sludge will adversely affect the biological processes
responsible for anaerobic digestion.

Broader Impacts: Nanotechnology is a dominant area of research in the fields of
science and engineering. A significant amount of resources, allocated by both
public and private agencies, have been directed toward advances in the
development and manipulation of nanoparticles resulting in a variety of
nanotechnologies with considerable potential. Research, as described herein, is
necessary to eliminate the uncertainties and to determine the environmental
risks associated with specific applications of nanoparticles (e.g., personal
care products).
