0101195&lt;br/&gt;Barron&lt;br/&gt;In continuation of work that is presently
funded by a one-year NSF SGER grant, the PI's propose to elaborate on this novel
class of structured, sequence-specific heteropolymers to develop close mimics of
natural SP-B and SP-C, that will be stable and biocompatible for in vivo use.
This medically-relevant research project offers potential for broad impact on
the field of biomaterials engineering, by demonstrating the usefulness of non-
natural, sequence-specific polymers for biomimicry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
aims are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To design, synthesize, chromatographically purify, and
spectroscopically characteize the secondary strutures of peptoid mimics of
helical, amphipathic LS proteins SP-B and SP-C;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To
perform in vitro biophysical characterization of peptoid SP mimics as spreading
agents for biomimetic lipid admixtures, carrying out studies on a pulsating
bubble surfactometer and a Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface balance, and making
comparisons to LS containing natural petpides;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) To
formulate a therapeutic, biomimetic LS replacement containing both phospholipids
and SP mimics, that is effective, bioavailable, biocompatible, and more cost-
effective than animal LS;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) To carry out in vivo testing
of optimized biomimetic LS replacements in a murine model of RDS, in
collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital; and,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(5)
To deepen the present fundamental understanding of the relationship between LS
protein structural features and biophysical functioning in phospholipid surface
films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
