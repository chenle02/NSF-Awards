A workshop will be convened in late 1992 to bring together natural and social
scientists from Latin America, Canada, and the United States to consider needs
for integrated research related to the potential impacts of global change on
societies and on national and regional economies. Topics tentatively identified
for discussion include: changes in land use and their impacts; coastal zone
utilization and management; past environmental and social change and their
linkages to past global change; and predictions of global change and their
impact on societies and economies. The workshop will permit timely
identification of topics of highest priority for human dimensions research
related to global change which could be incorporated into the scientific agenda
of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI). The Workshop
is being organized under the auspices of the Human Dimensions and Global
Environmental Change Program (HDGECP) and the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Program (IGBP).
