This project is designed to extend investigations of viral diversity and the
magnitude and variability of bacterial and algal mortality due to viral attack
in the Arctic Ocean. The PI proposes to extend these studies with emphasis on
sea ice microbial communities for comparison with the underlying sea water.
Collection, fixation, and concentration of melted sea ice samples will be
accomplished at sampling sites by deployment from US Navy submarine. Subsequent
analyses will be conducted in the laboratory. Total counts of viruses and the
frequency of viral infection in phytoplankton and bacteria in sea ice and
seawater will be determined by electron microscopy on fixed samples. To examine
natural community diversity, concentrates of viruses will be purified and
subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to separate viral DNA based on
genome size. From the number, positions, and staining intensity of different
bands, the PI will estimate the diversity, genome sizes, and abundance of
viruses in each sample. Through coordination with other researchers, the PI will
relate viral abundance, the frequency of viral infections, and viral community
diversity to hydrographic and biological variables to determine those which may
be important in regulating viral propagation in arctic sea ice and seawater.
