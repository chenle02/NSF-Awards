This research involves the use of optical coherence techniques, such as photon
echo and hole-burning experiments, to study rare earth doped glasses in which a
refractive index change or second harmonic generation has been optically
induced. These photoinduced phenomena are being used in a number of fiber optic
devices, but a detailed understanding of the underlying microscopic mechanism is
lacking. The objective is to gain insight about the microscopic nature of these
photoinduced changes. One part of the research focuses on the local structure
and dynamics of the rare earth ion whereas a second part deals with the dynamics
of the host glass. The results of these experiments will provide insight into
the microscopic changes associated with photoinduced phenomena in glasses and
may lead to the development of more efficient materials and devices. The
interactive activities consist of teaching an advanced undergraduate courses in
Physical Chemistry, advising and mentoring of undergraduate students, organizing
a seminar series, and organizing a seminar series for students and faculty in
the Chemistry department.
