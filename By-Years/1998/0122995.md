The investigators will develop a new method to obtain two-dimensional images of
sporadic clouds of mesospheric sodium. These images will be constructed by
combining data from a sodium lidar and an optical spectrometer obtained during
arctic summer months. The project involves minor modifications to existing
instruments at Poker Flat, Alaska, and the development of analysis and
calibration software to perform the two-dimensional imaging with high
reliability. The mesopause region hosts persistent layers of neutral and ionized
metallic atoms that are replenished by the ablation of meteors. These metal
layers can be used as tracers of the thermal, chemical, and dynamical conditions
near the mesopause. Although the altitude distribution of these layers have been
studied using various techniques, the horizontal structure of the layers remains
unknown. This investigation aims to observe the two-dimensional structure of
metallic layers using the sun to illuminate sodium atoms, and sensitive
instrumentation to detect the scattered sunlight. The simultaneous lidar
measurements will provide information about the altitude distribution of the
layers. Various models have shown that the temperature structure in the
mesopause may be a sensitive indicator of global change. Understanding the
distribution of sporadic layers in the mesosphere is important in studying
processes that heat and cool the middle atmosphere.
