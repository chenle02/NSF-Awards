The symposium ``Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics 4'' will be held at Carnegie
Mellon University on Friday September 24 and Saturday September 25, 1999.

The symposium will include three extended presentations of applications of
Bayesian methods. In these applications the statistician has been an integral
member of the research team. Two contributed poster sessions will also be held.
The objectives of the symposium are to: (i) identify and focus attention on
specific implementation and theoretical problems that hinder applications of
Bayesian methods, and to identify candidate solutions; (ii) provide a forum in
which the interplay between statistical theory and practice will be explored in
the context of concrete research projects; (iii) provide a small-meeting
atmosphere within which junior investigators and graduate students can explore
substantial Bayesian applications with experienced researchers; and (iv) produce
a volume containing well-documented case studies and data sets suitable for use
by researchers, practitioners, educators and students of applied statistics and
other quantitative fields.

As increasingly much background information becomes available to scientists
undertaking an investigation, it is important to utilize previous knowledge
effectively in designing studies and analyzing data. Bayesian statistical
methods are tailored to this purpose. There have been many recent advances in
Bayesian statistical theory and computation, but scientific meetings rarely
spend substantial time discussing applications. The purpose of this symposium is
to concentrate attention solely on applications of Bayesian statistics. The goal
is to elucidate the interplay between theory and practice and thereby identify
successful methods and indicate important directions for future research.
