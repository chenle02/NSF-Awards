The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland Cooperative research project between
Dr. Bogumil Laszkiewicz of the Technical University of Lodz and his counterpart,
Dr. John Cuculo of North Carolina State University, is to examine biopolymer
fibers prepared from spinning solutions with concentrations above 10% cellulose
for their structural qualities and their behavior during fiber formation.
Results may determine optimal conditions for the coagulation of spinning
solution into fibers. Funds for this project are awarded through the Maria
Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund II, Warsaw, in accordance with established
guidelines.
