Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will attempt to further
elucidate the structure of particles which interact via the strong nuclear
force. The technique to be used replaces the space - time continuum by a
discrete lattice of points. Some of the calculations will be aimed at testing
the reliability of this technique. Since the technique is in wide use in a
number of applications, this test is important. Clearly, so too is the effort to
better understand the structure of the particles.
