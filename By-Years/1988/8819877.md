Salt or osmo-sensors play a major role in the neural and neuroendocrine
regulation of salt-water balance in the human body. However, there is no
agreement on their precise location in the brain or periphery, their
morphological features are unknown, their mode of activation incompletely
understood, and their neural integration virtually unexplored. Dr. Alex
Baertschi has developed an animal model system to study these issues. He will
first determine the physiological significance of a splanchnic salt-input
sensitive mechanism by comparing the effects of systemic and gastric saline
infusions on plasma arginine vasopressin. Next he will determine sensory
mechanisms and peripheral neural pathways for salt-input detection. Finally, he
will determine the central route of splanchnic salt- input sensitive afferents
to the magnocellular hypothalamic vasopressinergic nuclei. This work is
important as we try to understand how the nervous system codes for and
integrates information concerning salt intake. This work is relevant to eating
behaviors both normal and abnormal and may give us a more defined knowledge
regarding salt sensors in the human body.
