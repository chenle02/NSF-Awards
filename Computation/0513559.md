Thin shell structures are widely constructed and manufactured because a well-
designed shell can sustain a large load with remarkably little material. While
elastic shells can exhibit great strength, their behaviors can also be very
difficult to predict and they can fail in a catastrophic fashion. Despite many
experiences accumulated in the engineering literature, the mathematical theory
of shells is still being developed, and there is not a single numerical method
that is provably reliable.

The objective of this research is numerical methods for a variety of parameter-
dependent models including thickness-dependent linear elastic shell equations.
The resulting methods will yield solutions that are uniformly accurate with
respect to the parameter. A shell structure could be bending-dominated,
membrane-dominated, or intermediate, reflecting its load-bearing ability. The
main efforts of this project will be devoted to the intermediate shell problems
whose solution exhibits the most elusive behavior and ever-increasing
singularity as the shell thickness becomes small. Moreover, most realistic shell
structures are of this kind. The resulting methods will be directly applicable
to membrane-dominated shells, and will be helpful for satisfactorily solving
bending-dominated shells to which most of the numerical analyses have been
devoted. Aside from shell problems, we also study anisotropic heat conduction,
beam-string deformation, and the Reissner-Mindlin plate bending model with a big
twisting moment loaded on the plate boundary. Under suitable conditions, these
problems have features resembling those of intermediate shells, which are often
left open in the literature.

Shell problems are practically important, mathematically interesting, and
computationally challenging. The project will result in numerical methods that
are valuable for practitioners. There are interdisciplinary connections with
engineering and other applied mathematics and scientific computing disciplines,
and with industry.
