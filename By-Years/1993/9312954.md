9312954 Paulson The goal is to develop and validate new technology and
methodology that will enable investigators and AEC industry planners to use the
computer to plan projects in detail--including processing, waiting and move
activities --and to classify planned activities as value-adding (VA) or non-VA.
The research methods will include careful observation and analysis of actual
construction processes. Then based on this observation and some of prior work,
PI's will develop theories of how to do detailed planning, to infer whether
activities add value, and to suggest plan options that reduce or eliminate non-
VA activity. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling techniques, PI's will
build symbolic models to implement that theory. In addition, will build
interactive graphic user interfaces to help investigators do careful validation
to compare observation, theoretical prediction about plans for specific
projects, and the actual output of the planner.
