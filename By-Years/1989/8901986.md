The research of John Welch is supported by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry
Program. Welch, associate professor of chemistry, is studying new ways to make
organic compounds that contain fluorine. His approach is characterized by the
goal to prepare small, simple molecules that contain fluorine that also have the
unique ability to be readily incorporated into larger, more complex molecules.
Welch is also developing methods by which chiral fluorine containing molecules
can be prepared. General methods for the diastereo- and enantioselective
synthesis of monofluorinated materials by using simple, inexpensive, achiral
monofluorinated compounds will be developed. Asymmetry and functionality are
introduced using the carbon-carbon bond forming reactions or rearrangements of
these fluorinated building blocks. The fundamental utility of Ä±3,3!-sigmatropic
rearrangements of fluorinated ketene acetals will be explored. Novel new
chemistry of fluorinated enamines will be investigated as means to prepare
allyated fluorinated ketones. Organometallic chemistry of chromium fluorinated
carbene complexes as a means to prepare fluorinated lactams will be examined.
