This project is a renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Site at the University of Arizona. The goal of the project is to empower
students to engage with the myriad applications that are related to autonomous
ground vehicles and machine learning. The approach is the application of model-
based design approaches that raise the level of abstraction to permit the safe
operation of a full-sized robotic vehicle testbed. The 10-week Site will provide
10 NSF-funded undergraduate students with immersive research experiences,
sitting side-by-side with graduate researchers and working on one of the most
compelling, and complex applications of today: autonomous systems. A diverse
group of students recruited nationwide will produce an exciting final
demonstration of their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full-size robotic car
will be paired with core research in machine learning, made possible with data
gathered with automotive sensors. These themes provide a context in which
participants will explore research in model-based design for cyber-physical
systems, machine learning, human-in-the-loop systems, control, and autonomous
systems. Participants will use a spiral development process, where new project
requirements are added after previous requirements are verified, as part of the
safety procedures for the full-sized vehicle testbed. Through these process
structures, participants will leave behind datasets, software, and video
demonstrations of their projects. This project will improve the reproducibility
of the work and provide records of the experience to benefit the state-of-the-
art, and artifacts that demonstrate the potential that model-based approaches
can empower undergraduate researchers in discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
