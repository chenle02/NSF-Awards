The proposed study will build upon two data bases of DNA sequences Ä±nuclear
encoded small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) and B-subunit of vacuolar ATPase
(vATPase)!. Cladistic analysis of sequences from taxa selected in a current
study to reconstruct the phylogeny of ascomycetes with features enhancing
arthropod dispersal supports the hypothesis that these features (including long-
necked ascomata and evanescent asci) are examples of convergence and parallelism
in fungi. The research proposed here includes 1) field studies to provide fungal
life history details within the complex arthropod assemblages and to obtain
specimens for 2) expansion of the molecular data sets. Taxon sampling is based
upon the hypothesis that phoretic symbioses of fungi and arthropods provide
opportunities for obligate mutualisms between the organism. Taxa for sequencing
(yeasts, pleomorphic ascomycetes with yeast stages, and some apothecial forms)
include many species that have mutualistic associations with arthropods. Due to
the sampling design, an additional outcome of the study may be answers to age-
old questions of fungal phylogeny. These questions include the relationships of
yeasts to other fungi (reduced and non-monophyletic as currently suggested?) and
the relative position of perithecial and apothecial ascomycetes to each other
and to yeasts (also involving questions of monophyly). Established field and
culture techniques as well as DNA sequencing will be used to obtain data.
Cladistic analysis will be performed on the independent rDNA and vATPase data
sets, and congruence (or non-congruence) will be used as a measure of support of
the hypotheses.
