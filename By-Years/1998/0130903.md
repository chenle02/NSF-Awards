With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University will
acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable faculty to carry
out research in the following areas: a) magneto-electronics of transition-metal
clusters; b) studies of supramolecular assemblies of cyanine dyes on nucleic
acid templates; c) environmentally benign hydrogen peroxide activators; d)
characterization of the catalyst used in atom transfer radical polymerization;
e) characterization of conducting polymers used in self-assembled and nanoscale
materials; and f) determination of the rate of gated charge transfer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including catalysis materials chemistry.
