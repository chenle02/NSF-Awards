The project design includes plans to upgrade the undergraduate experimental
psychology laboratory at Bloomsburg University. The specific goals are to
increase the variety, flexibility, and complexity of experiments performed in
laboratory courses, allow for demonstrations in courses without labs including
learning, cognitive, physiological, and behavior modification, and increase the
number of students participating in independent research projects. The plan is
to 1) interface a series of operant-conditioning chambers for rats with an IBM-
compatible computer and examine a wide range of variables that affect learned
behavior, 2) use six IBM-compatible computers, hardware, and software to conduct
experiments in areas of human perception, cognition, and social behavior, and 3)
use recording equipment to measure physiological responses such as heart rate,
blood pressure, brain waves, skin resistance, muscle tension, blood flow, and
limb movement in order to examine physiology-environment interactions. With this
equipment students will design and conduct high-quality animal and human
experiments that demonstrate a wide range of psychological phenomena.
