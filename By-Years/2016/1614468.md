This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for
Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices
that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields
of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-
on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and
mentorship experiences. This ITEST project aims to research the STEM career
interests of late elementary and middle-school students and, based on the
results of that research, build an informal education program to involve
families and community partners to enhance their science knowledge, attitudes,
experiences, and resources. There is an emphasis on underrepresented and low
income students and their families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
research and test a new model to promote the development of positive attitudes
toward STEM and to increase interest in STEM careers. Phase 1 of the project
will include exploratory research examining science capital and habitus for a
representative sample of youth at three age ranges: 8-9, 9-10 and 11-12 years.
The project will measure the access that youth have to adults who engage in STEM
careers and STEM leisure activities. In phase II the project will test a model
with a control group and a treatment group to enhance science capital and
habitus for youth.
