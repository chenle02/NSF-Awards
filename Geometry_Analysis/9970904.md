Abstract

Award: DMS-9970904 Principal Investigator: Charles P. Boyer and Krzysztof
Galicki

Professors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several projects in
geometry and topology. The objective of all the projects is to investigate
fundamental questions in Riemannian Geometry with the two main focal points,
Contact Geometry and Einstein Metrics. The questions and problems proposed here
are based on the principal investigators' work which exploited a fundamental
relationship between contact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and two
particular kinds of Kaehler geometry. These are the Q-factorial Fano varieties
(Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive scalar curvature) and the Calabi-Yau
manifolds (Kaehler Ricci-flat metrics). Our recent work has led to a significant
progress in studying many classical problems as well as resulted in the
development of completely new techniques. Most notably, we were able to
construct compact locally irreducible positive scalar curvature Einstein spaces
with arbitrary second Betti number in any odd dimension greater than 5. We now
are at the point where several classification problems and conjectures described
in this proposal appear to be within our reach. Furthermore, the type of
Einstein geometry that we are studying has recently become of interest in
Theoretical Physics in the context of superconformal field theory and string
theory, and gives our work an interdisciplinary flavor.

Mathematics is the foundation upon which our modern technology is built, and
much of its understanding and development must preceed technological progress.
Nevertheless, our research into a particular type of geometry is closely linked
to some important problems in modern Theoretical Physics and should provide an
important mathematical basis for their understanding.
