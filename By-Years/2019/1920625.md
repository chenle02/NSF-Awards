This project will focus on grass-stabilized sand dunes and loess landscapes
(areas of thick wind-blown dust deposits) in the Great Plains, to determine how
processes that shaped these landscapes in the past will influence their response
to future climate change, especially more frequent severe drought or heavy
rainfall. The research will test whether soil formation over hundreds to
thousands of years, including accumulation of organic matter and fine dust, can
significantly reduce the susceptibility of certain parts of these landscapes to
wind and water erosion. The results will be important for predicting patterns of
future accelerated erosion and dune activation, with major practical
implications, since the level tablelands of the loess landscapes are prime
agricultural land and the dunes are important rangeland and key recharge areas
for the Ogallala Aquifer. Increased erosion could also affect sediment input to
streams and release carbon stored in buried and surface soils in these
landscapes. The project will provide research training to a diverse group of
students and will include development of effective ways to communicate the
results to local communities and other stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will test hypotheses on the interactions between geomorphic processes
and soil formation in the evolution of loess tablelands and adjacent dune
fields. The hypotheses propose that aeolian processes (deflation, slow loess
accumulation, and dune activity) influence spatial patterns of soil formation
and organic carbon accumulation, which in turn influence thresholds for wind and
water erosion through effects on vegetation resilience and mechanical strength.
Study sites will be selected to allow comparison of soil and sediment properties
related to nutrient and water availability and shear strength on tableland
summits and adjacent slopes with varying soil development and recent loess
accumulation, and on dunes with varying soil development. Field and lab
measurements will be combined with modeling of soil hydrology, geospatial
analyses, and luminescence dating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
