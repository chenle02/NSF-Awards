This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software
and hardware products that assist people with low vision to efficiently read and
process information from many sources. These products will combine optical
character recognition (OCR), speech synthesis and recognition technologies,
together with customizable displays based on the latest vision research to
accommodate a variety of visual impairments. These products will incorporate a
'Pick and Click' user interface, developed in Phase I, which does not require
viewing the screen, yet presents visual displays useful to a low vision person,
and is intuitive to fully sighted teachers experienced with graphical user
interfaces (GUIs). Included in the products will be functions particular to the
low vision market, such as reading text optimally, enlarging pictures, and using
a video camera for magnification while handwriting and viewing 3D objects. In
addition, 'Pick and Click' interfaces to the most common computer applications
programs, such as word processing, e-mail, Internet browser, spreadsheet, and
financial accounting will be included. Low vision users will benefit from a low
cost interface that provides a clean and less cluttered presentation of
information on the screen. JBliss Imaging's proffered new technology has
potential to improve access to and capability of manipulating information for
the low vision population.. The technology also has potential to serve
individuals with other disabilities, such as dyslexia and other forms of
challenges to learning and reading abilities. Commercial applications are in
schools, libraries, businesses, and homes.
