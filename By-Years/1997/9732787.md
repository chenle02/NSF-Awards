9732787 GREENE This project will provide support for shipboard scientific
support equipment for the research vessel POINT SUR, an NSF owned ship operated
by the San Jose State University, Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, and dedicated
to use in support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the
proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support
for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
retrieval sites. The Project Director, Jonathan M. Prince is fully qualified to
direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the
institution to replace two life rafts and acquire a communications integrator
and a digital television receiver. ***
