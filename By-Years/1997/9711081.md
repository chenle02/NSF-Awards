Abstract Proposal No: 9711081 Proposal Type: Request for Conference Support
Principal investigator Georges Belfort Affiliation: Gordon Research Center This
grant is awarded through Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
International, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Georges Belfort. The grant is to
be used for travel Support to the 1997 Gordon Conference on Membranes: Materials
and Processes. This Gordon Conference will address the theme of membrane science
and technology. The conference is very pertinent to emerging areas of
separations technology. Membranes are very important in chemical and biochemical
separations and advances in membrane technology are expected to lead to
processes that will replace conventional chemical separation processes, e.g.
distillation. The interdisciplinary nature of the conference will allow cross-
fertilization of ideas. For example, the notion of using biomimetic principles
for membrane design is an area that biochemists and chemical engineers can
fruitfully collaborate in. The conference will bring together academic and
industrial participants, engineers and physical scientists, and a mix of mature
researchers and new researchers including students. The focus on discussions, an
integral part of the Gordon Conference format will aid information dissemination
and enhance the educational component of the conference.
