This award supports continuing analysis of observations from the STEPS project
(Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study) conducted in
western Kansas in the early summer of 2000. Data from polarimetric radar,
aircraft, sounding balloons, and a lightning-mapping network are employed to
investigate the relation between thunderstorm electrification and the
microphysical and kinematic properties of clouds. Special attention is directed
to storms that exhibit anomalous behavior such as the absence of lightning,
predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning, or much intracloud lightning.
Motivating the work are questions about the source region for the positive
charge in clouds that produce positive lightning, the kinematic and
microphysical differences that distinguish these clouds from the more typical
ones, the role of intracloud lightning in the creation and maintenance of
anomalous charge structures, and the extent to which the occurrence of lightning
and its polarity can be predicted once convection develops. The work is done in
collaboration with STEPS investigators from other institutions, and involves
analysis and synthesis of data from two S-band polarimetric radars (the CHILL
radar of Colorado State University and S-Pol of NCAR), 3-D maps of lightning
flashes from the New Mexico Tech lightning-mapping array, microphysical and
electrical measurements obtained by the storm-penetrating T-28 aircraft of South
Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and vertical soundings of the
thunderstorm electric field measured by special balloons of the National Severe
Storms Laboratory. The project will lead to a better understanding of storm
electrification and to new ways of monitoring and predicting storm intensity.
