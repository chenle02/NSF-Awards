A Workshop on the Quantum Chromodynamic Vacuum Structure will be held at the
American University in Paris, June 1-5, 1992. Young American scientists will
participate. Quantum Chromodynamics is the candidate theory of the strong
nuclear force. Many basic questions about this theory are unanswered. Some of
these, including the question of why particles carrying the nuclear analogue of
electric charge are never free, and the question of how to treat the theory when
the nuclear force cannot be regarded as a perturbation, will be discussed at
this workshop. The participation of young scientists, from who needed new ideas
may come, is important.
