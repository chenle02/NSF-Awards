This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on a variety of
topics involved in fluid mixing and fluid instabilities. Work is planned on
instabilities in fluidized beds, interfacial instabilities, mixing in flows with
large density non-uniformities, and mixing in gas flows with the occurrence of
shock waves. The results will have applicability ranging from processing in the
chemical industry to operation of supersonic combustion ramjet engines.
