An "Engineering Research Experience for Undergraduate" (REU) Site for ten (10)
women and minority students is established. The REU program will be conducted in
conjunction with an ongoing Undergraduate Summer Research Program, sponsored by
the Texas engineering Experiment Station for the past eight years, and the
Minority Engineering Program. Students for the REU Program will be selected from
institutions that have predominantly minority enrollments including the
University of Texas at El Paso, University of Texas at San Antonio, Pan American
University, University of Puerto Rico, and Prairie View A&amp;m as well as Texas
A&amp;M, with as least half from other institutions. Individual research
projects will be undertaken by the undergraduate students in conjunction with
on-going research programs, and regular activities. Research projects have
included high turbulence intensities on flow, fabrication of thin, silicon
membranes, simulation for electronic manufacturing, and inductive coupled coils
for spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.
