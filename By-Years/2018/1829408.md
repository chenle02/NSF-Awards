1453982&lt;br/&gt;Borazjani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed CAREER project is
focused on the computational investigation of the fluid physics in cases where
fluid flow interacts with the solid in contact with the fluid. This research
area is known as Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI), and it is an area of
vigorous research in the past few years. The goal of this research is to explore
swimming and propulsion in aquatic environments, cardiovascular flows, as well
as energy harvesting with wind turbines, by first developing accurate simulation
techniques and then exploring the conditions that lead to energy efficiency.
Educational activities that promote STEM to students, teachers and the public
are also proposed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to address two issues
in FSI, one is a numerical issue that refers to the rigorous selection of an
appropriate preconditioner for simulating FSI problems, while the second is a
physics issue related to the physics of flow around solids. The discovery of
robust preconditioners, as proposed here, can affect the development of
Computational Fluid Dynamics technologies for other problems, where computations
in parallel are needed. The physics to be investigated are focused on the
hypothesis put forth by the PI that a leading-edge-vortex (LEV) is formed in
aquatic swimming, and that this LEV can be stabilized or controlled. A stable
LEV leads to energy savings. There is also an extensive outreach and education
plan that includes the operation of a YouTube channel, activities for
professional development of local teachers and outreach activities to the
Buffalo Museum of Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
