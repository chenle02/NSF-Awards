Written Language Recognition has great significance not only as a convenient
and natural way of interacting with computers but also as an important challenge
in AI. Its importance as an input interface to computers is comparable to that
of speech in terms of naturalness and convenience of
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Notwithstanding the strong evidence from cognitive
reading theories that suggests that text recognition is an interactive process
that makes efficient use of resources at every stage, traditional handwriting
recognition systems have employed a monotonically cascaded architecture. The
primary goal of this proposed research is to develop a computational model of
handwriting recognition that is grounded in cognitive reading theories. The
model will account for several aspects of handwriting recognition that have not
been addressed in the literature to date. The architecture of the word
recognition model will allow it to actively seek information from earlier
processing stages. Depending on the quality of the image and the difficulty of
the lexicon, the feature extractor will send information on only a subset of
possible features, allowing an internal decision-maker to evaluate the
information and request more if needed. &lt;br/&gt;
