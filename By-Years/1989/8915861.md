This workshop would serve to bring together scientists from government and
industrial laboratories and universities who have interests in the physics of
materials and materials science and to establish a network that will encourage
future collaboration among these scientists. The workshop will also provide a
forum to discuss ways to stimulate minority graduate and undergraduate
participation in materials science, to identify new areas of research, and to
provide information on recent advances in materials science.
