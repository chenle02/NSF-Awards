ABSTRACT DMS - 0204480. PI: C. Robin Graham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will study conformal and CR geometry. Algebraic, analytic,&lt;br/&gt;and
geometric aspects will be considered via the introduction of metrics
in&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensions which are associated to the original conformal or
CR&lt;br/&gt;geometry. Understanding the higher dimensional spaces gives rise to
problems&lt;br/&gt;of independent interest. Motivation is provided by the
AdS/CFT&lt;br/&gt;correspondence in physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conformal
geometry is the study of properties of space which are unchanged&lt;br/&gt;by
transformations which preserve angles but not necessarily
lengths.&lt;br/&gt;Conformal mapping and geometry has found numerous
applications to practical&lt;br/&gt;problems for many years, such as the design
of airplane wings. Conformal&lt;br/&gt;geometry in higher dimensions has
recently been the object of much interest&lt;br/&gt;in so-called holographic
correspondences in physics. This project will&lt;br/&gt;study properties of the
underlying geometric spaces, partially motivated by&lt;br/&gt;the interaction
with the physical theories.&lt;br/&gt;
