The research focusses on development of Field-programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA).
The main objective is to search for generic analog arrays which can be used for
realization of analog circuits and systems. Several configurable analog block
styles with different granularities are considered to arrive at optimal
configurable analog blocks. The research also includes considerations of
architectural and interconnection issues.
