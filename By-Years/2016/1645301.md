This Antarctic Artists and Writers (AAW) project by Coretta Scott King Honor
Award-winning author Greg Neri expands public awareness of the scientific
research taking place on the 7th continent by reaching out to disadvantaged
children and teens who make up his readership. Neri will spend seven weeks at
McMurdo Station and surrounding locations while observing and engaging Antarctic
scientists to discover what drives them in their pursuit of knowledge, and how
this knowledge can be applied to benefit our planet's future. Neri has written
numerous books for young people of color, including non-readers, and at-risk
youth who typically lack access to science and nature, as well as meaningful
role models who inspire them to pursue careers in science. Neri's planned middle
grade novel about the interconnecting lives of an Antarctic scientist of color
and a Creole teen in post-Katrina Louisiana will provide insight and inspiration
to his readers in an accessible format, while exploring the natural and social
challenges of climate change and the answers Antarctica holds for our future.

During his visit, Neri will interview and interact with a variety of scientists,
including those who study the effects of global warming on micro-organisms (such
as Foraminifera), animals and the surrounding environment, in order to collect
relevant information and personal narratives for his book. In addition, Neri
will begin his educational mission while on location through live classroom
sessions and podcasts designed for students in urban schools around the country.
Neri will facilitate access to real Antarctic scientists and offer insights into
their ongoing studies. The author has a commitment from Houghton Mifflin
Harcourt to publish his proposed book. The publisher will also support a
national school book tour where the author will continue to inspire
underprivileged youth to follow their own dreams and careers in science. This
unique AAW project aligns well with NSF's priority of broadening participation.
