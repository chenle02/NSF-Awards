This individual investigator award will provide support for a project that will
investigate the effect of adding magnetic moments to semiconductors. Amorphous
Si, Ge, and C doped with magnetic ions such as rare earth elements and Mn will
be prepared and their electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, and structural
properties measured. The influence of the phonon stiffness and the semiconductor
band gap on these properties will be determined. The interaction between these
added local moments and the spontaneous moments formed at the Metal-Insulator
transition as electrons localize will be studied. The research will provide a
phenomenological underpinning for a microscopic model for the three dimensional
Metal-Insulator transition, and an understanding of the effect on both transport
and magnetic properties of introducing local magnetic moments into a
semiconductor. The project will provide research training and education for two
graduate students and an estimated 5-6 undergraduates, including exposure to
industry through the PI's connections with the Center for Magnetic Recording
Research at UCSD and to two National Labs, the National High Magnetic Field Lab
and Los Alamos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic moments play a crucial role in
many materials (e.g. the high Tc superconductors and the colossal
magnetoresistance manganites). It is known that adding magnetic moments to
semiconductors produces effects that are extremely large, but these effects are
not well understood. In particular the change in the electrical resistance when
such a material is placed in a magnetic field (magnetoresistance) can be
enormous. This project will investigate the effect of adding magnetic moments to
semiconductors. Samples of amorphous Si, Ge, and C doped with magnetic ions such
as rare earth elements and Mn will be prepared. Their electronic, magnetic,
thermodynamic, and structural properties will be measured over a wide range of
temperature, magnetic field, and doping levels. The research will attempt to
determine the principles governing the large effect of magnetic moments in
amorphous semiconductors. An increased understanding of these effects may point
the way to making the very large magnetoresistance of use to the developing spin
electronics technology. In addition this research may increase our understanding
of why magnetic moments play such a crucial role in other materials of current
interest. The project will provide research training and education for two
graduate students and an estimated 5-6 undergraduates, including providing them
with an exposure to industry and to the national labs through the PI's
collaborations. Thus, they will be well prepared for future careers in academia,
or industrial or government laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;
