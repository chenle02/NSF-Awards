The primary goal of this project is to make a realistic estimate of antarctic
climate change through a quantitative trend assessment of observed surface
temperatures in Antarctica. While antarctic temperature changes have potentially
major consequences for the global system, the highly heterogeneous network of
surface stations in Antarctica has limited quantitative studies and has led to a
confusing mix of results reported to the public. The first objective of the
proposed project is an Antarctic temperature trend assessment that (1) makes
optimum use of the available information, (2) is technically justified by
demonstrable properties of the data, and (3) can be clearly conveyed to
nonscientists. The trends will be interpolated spatially in accordance with the
correlation length scales deduced from data obtained by automated weather
stations and conventional stations. The spatial, seasonal, and temporal
sensitivities of the trends will be thoroughly documented and an alternative
approach to Antarctic-wide trend determinations, based on empirical orthogonal
function reconstructions of monthly temperature anomaly fields will be explored.
A second objective is the synthesis of climate model simulations of Antarctic
changes against which recent and ongoing variations of Antarctic climate can be
compared. This synthesis will draw upon the output of five state-of-the-art
global models, all forced by the same moderate scenario of greenhouse gas and
aerosol concentrations. A web-based archive, suitable for use by non-scientists,
will contain spatial and seasonal depictions of projected changes of Antarctic
temperature, precipitation, pressure and sea ice in several time slices of the
20th and 21st centuries. ***
