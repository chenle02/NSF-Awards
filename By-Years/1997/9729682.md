Columbia College requested support from NSF to connect three remote campus sites
to the Internet. These campus sites are located in Lake County, IL, Kansas City,
MO and Aurora, CO. The sites will be connected through the Missouri Research and
Education Network (MOREnet). Combined, these campuses have an enrollment of over
1000 students. The campuses needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the faculty, staff students of these
institutions as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
