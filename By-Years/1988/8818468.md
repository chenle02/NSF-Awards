The objective of this project is to conduct research on a novel water treatment
process that offers promise in accomplishing a disinfection effect without
producing halogenated hydrocarbons which have been determined to be
carcinorganic. The project involves determination of the ability of selected
chemical nucleophiles, especially sulfites to decompose mutagenic or
carcinogenic chlorination byproducts, to evaluate the degree to which additional
chlorination byproducts form upon rechlorination following electrophilic
decomposition, and to identify some of the degradation products of these
halogenated compounds. The identification and recovery of specific compounds
will be achieved by liquid/liquid extraction and closed loop stripping in
conjunction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Such information will
be combined with health-effects data from on-going research elsewhere to provide
an overall evaluation of the potential of nucleophilic decomposition for
drinking water treatment. This research may lead to the development of a full-
scale application of nucleophiles in the form of dechlorinating agents or
anionic resins. The single most significant contribution of drinking water
treatment to public health in the US has been the widespread use of
chlorination. Since its general acceptance in the US in the early part of this
century, water borne diseases have been effectively controlled, and in some
cases virtually eliminated. Now, concerns over organic chlorination byproducts
are threatening to remove chlorination from consideration for many raw waters.
This research may lead to concepts that will continue to permit use of chlorine
for disinfection without production of potentially harmful by products.
