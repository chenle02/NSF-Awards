The Multimedia Math Project (MMP) will create a versatile multimedia video
product which motivates students, directly links the basic math principles they
are learning to real world applications, and gives educators insight into the
teaching methods of Jaime Escalante and two other super teachers. It will
consist of multiple vignettes addressing approximately 20 math concepts, and
targeted at prealgebra courses. These vignettes will help teachers answer the
questions of "what is this math good for?". As does Futures, the MMP will
feature numerous positive examples of minorities and women whose professional
success has resulted from their math skills. The target grade levels are grades
7-9, focusing on prealgebra mathematics instruction.
