This RUI activity consists of three projects involving atomic physics. The first
project involves cold atom guiding ina hollow core photonic bandgap fiber. This
fiber can transport both light and cold atoms in single optical and atomic de
Broglie modes. The second project is the development of a black hole trap. Cold
atoms will be produced using a magneto-optical trap and then will be transferred
to another atomic state and captured by a black hole at the trap center. This
black hole trap should allow production of very high atomic densities. The last
project is a new technique for the measurement of atomic lifetimes using mode
locked lasers. This technique will be used for improved measurement of lifetimes
for excited states in atomic cesium. The broader impact involves the education
of undergraduate students and the applications to sensors.
