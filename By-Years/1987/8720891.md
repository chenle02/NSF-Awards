This award will provide one-half of the funds required to acquire a basic four-
wheel drive truck for use in gathering geophysical data in southern California
and northern Baja California. The truck will be used to collect magnetotelluric
data from eighteen field stations located in remote areas of this region.
Maintenance of the vehicle will be the responsibility of the San Diego State
University. The magnetotelluric data will be used to interpret geothermal
activity in the Salton Sea and Cerro Prieto geothermal fields.
