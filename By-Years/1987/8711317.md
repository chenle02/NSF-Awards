Polymerization of clathrin on the cytoplasmic side of translocating membranes
causes the formation of coated pits and coated vesicles which are involved in
receptor.mediated endocytosis, lysosomal assembly, secretion, transcytosis, and
membrane recycling events. The clathrin molecule is composed of three heavy
chains (180 kDa) and three light chains (35kDa) of two types. The goal of the
proposed studies is to understand the molecular basis for the structural and
functional differences displayed by the different clathrin light chains, and to
analyze their role in the function of the clathrin molecule as a whole. The
experimental approach involves production of monoclonal antibodies reacting with
a series of determinants spanning the sequence of the known clathrin light chain
forms, and correlation of light chain sequences with known biochemical
functions. The monoclonal antibodies will also be used to examine the light
chain distribution on native, triskelions, coated vesicles and within cells and
tissues. These studies will allow correlation of the different forms of clathrin
with specicalized intracellular and tissue.specific functions.
