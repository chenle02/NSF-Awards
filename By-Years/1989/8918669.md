To understand the transport of energy throughout the middle atmosphere requires
observations around the globe. Many observational programs are currently in
place providing such information at middle and high latitudes. This project is
to continue studies of the equatorial mesosphere using meteor echo returns on
VHF profilers on Christmas Island. These data will be analyzed for mean wind and
tidal climatologies as well as the structure and evolution of large-scale wave
motions and how they relate to the mesospheric semiannual oscillation and
tropospheric wave patterns. Additional meteor echo detection and collection
systems will be built and installed on VHF radars located in Pohnpei, Indonesia
and Peru. These additional stations will allow study of mesospheric dynamics in
four different tropospheric climatic regions. ***
