This three year project, sponsored by The University of Chicago, will offer
teachers each summer courses in ecology and earth science. Each course will
enroll 25 teachers. The ecology course emphasizes the study of natural history
based upon the concepts of population biology and environmental adaptation. The
teachers will learn how to use visual media and Chicago's science resources (The
Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium and the Lincoln Park Zoo) to help their
students understand basic principle of ecology. The earth science course is
structured around the geology of nearby important geological sites. The teachers
will learn the key geological principles illustrated by each locale. From this
experience they will be able to conduct field trips with their students and
provide them with tangible examples of geologic processes. In addition to the
summer programs, there will be follow up activities during the academic year,
which include a series of on-campus Saturday seminars as well as classroom
visits. The matching funds from the University and the Chicago School District
amount to 13% of the NSF grant.
