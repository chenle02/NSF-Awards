9633603 SUN Degradation rate constants for several planktonic lipid compound
will be investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Activity of benthic
animals was the most likely factor causing the difference observed between rate
constants oxic and anoxic sediments profiles measured in the field. Animals can
alter oxic/anoxic versus anoxic conditions in remineralization efficiency and
formation of intermediate products show that degradation follows different
pathways. Research will specially consider the effects on degradation between
oxic and anoxic conditions caused by benthic animals. Radiolabelled tracers
degradation rates and pathways under various influences of benthic animals.
Further intensive study of the structure of metabolites produced during
incubation experiments will provide a more detailed picture of the degradation
of these important compounds.
