The primary objective of this proposal is to: (1) Complete the characterization
of the process whereby the phycocyanobilin prosthetic group is attached to the
alpha subunit of C-phycocyanin. Genetic evidence indicates that the products of
genes cpcE and cpcF play a role in the addition of bilin to the alpha subunit
apopolypeptide. We have expressed the two proteins encoded by these genes, CpcE
and CpcF, in E. coli and are now in a position to examine the biochemical role
of these proteins in the bilin attachment process. (2) Complete the
characterization of bilin- bearing linker polypeptide associated with the major
phycoerythrin of marine synechococcus sp. WH8020. No previous complete structure
of bilin-bearing linker polypeptide has been elucidated. This information on the
number, type and location of bilins attached to such linker polypeptides is
central to the understanding of the pathways of energy transfer in the
phycobilisome. %%% Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a widely distributed
group of bacteria which carry out oxygen-evolving photosynthesis similar to that
characteristic of higher plants. Recently, marine unicellular cyanobacteria were
discovered to contribute ten to twenty percent of the primary productivity in
the oceans. The studies to be performed are directed at achieving a detailed
understanding at the molecular level of the structure and biosynthesis of the
photosynthetic apparatus in these organisms which are adapted for optimum
utilization of the blue-green light which predominates below the surface of the
open ocean.
