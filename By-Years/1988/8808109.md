The function of conspicuous coloration displayed by breeding males of many
different species has been a topic of much speculation in biology, but little
solid evidence has yet been obtained. Dr. Kodric-Brown will perform experiments
to investigate the function of the bright blue breeding coloration of male
pupfish. Only males with breeding territories develop this coloration and
reproduce. The blue breeding coloration may serve two functions: (1) facilitate
acquisition and defense of a breeding territory through competition with other
males, and (2) attract females to a male's territory. Dr. Kodric-Brown will
introduce already-breeding males with well- developed breeding coloration and
non-breeding males lacking this coloration into large tanks. She will
experimentally manipulate (a) material on the bottom of the tank, to determine
the importance of suitable breeding substrate for the development of breeding
coloration, (b) competitive interactions among males, to determine the
importance of dominance in the development of breeding coloration, and (c)
female spawning behavior, to determine how male breeding coloration influences
female choice of particular males. Also, the appearance of males will be
experimentally altered by dyeing them with a blue dye. This study will provide
insights into the types of traits important in mate recognition and male
dominance, and the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for their
development. Such traits act as important social signals and are virtually
ubiquitous in sexually reproducing organisms. They are especially important in
preventing hybridization, thus maintaining the integrity of species in our
rapidly deteriorating aquatic environments.
