This three year project, sponsored by the Council for Basic Education, will
provide each year 100 summer fellowships for outstanding middle school and high
school teachers (Grades 6-12). The Fellows will carry-out individual summer
research projects under the supervision of mentors from colleges and
universities chosen by the Fellows. The topics chosen must relate to the
interconnectedness between the sciences and the humanities. The Fellow, after
the summer study is over, will prepare a report on the summer activities and
will work with a colleague in humanities to apply the results of the study in an
appropriate way to the school curriculum. The Council for Basic Education is
providing matching funds in the amount equivalent to 106% of the NSF grant.
