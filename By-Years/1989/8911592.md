The development of coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation models for the tropical
Pacific is a major goal of the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program.
This proposal requests funds to accomplish three tasks related to development of
models for this region: 1) to compare the output of wind fields from 5 different
GCMs which have been forced by prescribed sea surface temperatures; 2) to
compare the output of wind fields from three coupled ocean-atmosphere
circulation models; and 3) to use the wind and precipitation fields to force an
active thermodynamic and salinity model. These analyses will provide an
important evaluation of model accuracy and reliability, and will help to guide
future model development.
