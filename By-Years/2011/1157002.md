This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the
University of Arkansas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program offers ten
undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in publishable-quality research
projects with scientists working at the forefront of astronomy, planetary
science, and space science. Students are supported at the Arkansas Center for
Space and Planetary Science for 10 weeks during the summer. Mentors are selected
from the scientific staff of the center, progress within the program is
monitored through weekly meetings, a mid-term 10 minute oral presentation, and a
final poster presentation with a two-page abstract. Program participants will
also take part in five field trip to nearby research facilities to illustrate
research in a variety of environments. Students are recruited from a variety of
locations with a strong emphasis on the recruitment of students from HBCU,
Tribal schools, and school with limited research opportunities.
