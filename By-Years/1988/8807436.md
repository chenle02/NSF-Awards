This project will involve three researchers studying the economic and social
behavior of a foraging society of northern Tanzania. The investigators will
conduct quantitative behavioral observations on foraging and hunting activities
as well as observe and record information about child care, group size, food
sharing, and time allocation across tasks during the day. The project is
important because it will help us understand the economic choices that foragers
make, how these choices and their behavior are related to the environment they
live in, and how their economic behavior is related to their evolutionary
adaptations. This project will provide a valuable case study to compare with the
much more studied Kung Bushmen of the Kalahari desert. The comparison will help
us understand foraging band behavior, which is essential in order to understand
our own evolutionary past.
