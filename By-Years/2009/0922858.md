With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Michael
T. Crimmins, Maurice S. Brookhart, Michel R. Gagne, Gary J. Pielak and Marcey
Waters in the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill will acquire a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with a cryogenic probe for
use in the development of new and efficient methods of synthesis of complex
organic molecules such as the asymmetric synthesis of polyketides and medium
ring ethers. It will be used to advance research projects in bio-organic
synthesis, organic and inorganic catalysis, and molecular
recognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of
the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential for chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research.
