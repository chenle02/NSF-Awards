This grant will continue the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
program for 15 interns for the next three years at the Geophysical Institute.
The program will be patterned after the successful 1987 summer program conducted
at the Geophysical Institute. The purpose of the program is to give
undergraduates majoring in physics and closely related areas experience in
fields of research that are conducted at the Geophysical Institute. In this
program interns are assigned to work with individual principal investigators who
assign the specific projects. In addition there will be a series of weekly
lectures and additional field trips exposing the interns to other fields of
research. Questionnaires filled out by the interns and exit interviews conducted
at the end of the summer indicate the program had positive impact in directing
them toward graduate school and pursuing a career in the physical sciences.
