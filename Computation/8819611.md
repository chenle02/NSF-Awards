This project involves research to be done by Drs. David Chudnovsky and Gregory
Chudnovsky in a wide variety of mathematical and computer-science fields:
approximations to functions and numbers aimed at revealing arithmetic properties
of classical constants, solution of Diophantine problems, and applications of
number theory to mathematical physics and computer science. One of the most
surprising phenomena in the past ten years' developments in mathematics is the
unification that has taken place, with connections being discovered among
branches of the field that would have been thought absolutely unrelated ten
years ago. This research, which brings the theory of whole numbers and its
methods to bear on physics, differential equations, and computer science, is
very much in this unifying spirit.
