The objective of the research is the theoretical treatment of the formation and
destruction of negative ions due to electromagnetic fields, the collisions of
Rydberg atoms with ground state alkali-metal atoms and inelastic collisions of
low energy electrons with molecules. Both stable and unstable negative ions will
be investigated using integral equation techniques, semi-classical approaches
and the Faddeev formulation. For the ab-initio electron-molecule calculations,
the R-matrix method developed by Schneider and Burke, is invoked.
