The primary objective of this US-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Mihaly Bartok, University of Szeged and George Olah, University of Southern
California is to carry out systematic studies on the transformations in
superacids of diols and cyclic ethers, two important groups of oxygen-containing
organic compounds. The proposed research will include the studies of
stereoisomers and deuterium-labelled compounds with the aim of getting
information on the mechanism of the transformations taking place. Based on these
observations selective synthesis of certain compounds (carbonyl compounds,
unsaturated alcohols, dienes) can be expected. The results will contribute to
the chemistry of carbocations. Funds for the project are awarded through the
U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest in accordance with established guidelines.
