GER-9553475 Kowel UAH has created a multidisciplinary doctoral program in
Optical Science and Engineering which admitted its first students in the Fall,
1993. This program addresses the growing national need for advance training in
basic and applied optics. The trend of strong integration of optical components
with electronics is the basis of a vast new technology. Our program was
developed to prepare students to contribute across the broad boundaries of
traditional optics including photonics. The unique strengths of our program
derive from the support of the base disciplines, physics, electrical
engineering, computer engineering, materials science, and mechanical
engineering, as well as the strong technology transfer activities focused in the
Center for Applied Optics. A common facility for research and teaching, together
with the shared doctoral degree, provide an unusual concentration of resources
for our students. We are working to strengthen the cooperative nature of the
program, involving the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with particular
focus on biomedical applications, as well as Alabama A&amp;M University (a
HBCU), with a focus on nonlinear optics and optical materials. We are requesting
five NSF Graduate Research Traineeships to support students for the first two
years of their studies in the program.
