Recent studies on the origin and development of continental rifts have clearly
been hampered by our lack of knowledge on the deep structure of the East African
Rift. This classic rift is the standard by which all others are measured. This
grant is one of six collaborative grants which support U.S. participation in an
international effort to conduct a cooperative study of the Kenyan, Federal
Republic of Germany and the European Economic Community, with additional
participation by France, Holland, Spain and Ireland, as well as Kenya. This
award provides travel, per diem and miscellaneous expenses support for personnel
from the U. S. Geological Survey which has a major role. A preliminary
experiment was completed in 1985. The results of this experiment suggest that
the deep structure of the Kenya Rift is different than anticipated and that the
major phase of the project is both scientifically valid and logistically
feasible. The major seismic experiment is aimed at determining lithospheric
structure in the rift and in adjacent areas. Structure of the sub-Moho
lithosphere along the rift, detailed structure in the axial area of the rift,
and the transition zones between the rift and adjacent areas are the prime areas
of emphasis.
