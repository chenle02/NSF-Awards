This award provides 43% of the funds required to acquire two workstations, tape
drive, and related computing hardware that will be installed and operated in the
Department of Geophysics at Stanford University. Stanford University has
committed the remaining funds necessary for the computer system upgrade. The
equipment will be used primarily for data analysis by the Crustal Geophysics
Group at Stanford who carry out fundamental research into the structure,
tectonics, composition and evolution of Earth's lithosphere.
