This research investigates a class of pebble games developed by Moschovakis and
Aczel, by studying the behavior of these games. There is much current interest
in the intersection of logic and complexity theory, and pebble games have been
used to because of their expressibility and their intuitive appeal. These games
will be applied to two kinds of problems. First, there are some queries that
might not be expressed in certain logics, e.g., it is conjectured that the graph
distance relation dist(x,y) &gt; dist(u,v) cannot be expressed in the fragment
of least fixed point logic (without successor) that admits only finitely many
alternations. Second, there are some problems in random graph theory that might
best be addressed with pebble game techniques.
