Wetland plants absorb and assimilate large amounts of nutrients during their
growth. They also obtain large amounts of energy through photosynthesis. While
wetland plants are alive, little of the nutrients and energy stored within the
plants is consumed by other organisms. Instead, much of this energy and
nutrients is passed on only after plant senescence and death. Thus, plant litter
decomposition is an important characteristic for determining a wetland's ability
to retain and transform nutrients (i.e., purify water) and its ability to
sustain higher trophic levels, including wildlife. Microorganisms growing on
dead plants are strongly involved in the decomposition process. Our research
will measure the importance of three major types of microorganisms (bacteria,
fungi, and algae) associated with emergent plant decay, and investigate how
their potential interactions affect overall plant litter decomposition and
nutrient cycling in wetlands. Better understanding of plant decomposition could
lead to new management strategies for wetlands.
