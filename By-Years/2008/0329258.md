Speaker-characteristic information is encoded in multiple levels in the speech
signal, including low-level acoustic features of the speech spectrum, prosodic
patterns, distinctive pronunciation and word usage, and even an unusual laugh or
other idiosyncratic vocal gestures. Yet most speaker recognition systems today
rely exclusively on the lowest-level features, breaking the speech stream into a
series of 10-20 msec frames modeled essentially as independent events. This
project explores higher-level sources of speaker-distinctive information via two
feature discovery tracks: one building on existing linguistic constructs and
guided by insights from psycholinguistics and human performance studies; the
other a purely data-driven approach, seeking idiosyncratic "vocal performances"
-- spectro-temporal patterns with high speaker-characterizing power, independent
of linguistic constraints. Supplementing this core feature discovery program,
project efforts include work in feature selection and combination, work to
encode these information sources into more effective speaker models, and
evaluation of these models primarily for speaker recognition, but also in other
speech technology applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the theoretical side,
this work should lead to a better understanding of what makes a speaker's voice
and speech behaviors unique, what constitutes normal within-speaker variation,
and what dimensions are important for modeling speaking style. Further, the
resulting speaker models should have numerous practical applications: improving
speaker recognition systems, providing more speaker-focused models for automatic
transcription, facilitating analysis of speaker behavior, and supporting more
personalized human-computer interaction. In addition, this work will make
resources available to the broader research community through the dissemination
of feature datasets and through educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;
