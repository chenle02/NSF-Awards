The theorem prover Rewrite Rule Laboratory, RRL, and the proof management
system Tecton are enhanced to make them useful for applications, especially
where analysis of specifications and well-founded ordering play a crucial role
in these applications, and large complex proofs often have to be constructed.
RRL is a theorem prover based on rewriting techniques and completion which
provides support for equational and inductive reasoning. Tecton is a management
system, and it provides a menu-driven interface to the theorem prover and
emphasized visualization of proofs. Tecton is extended to support a proof
command language which a user control over proof construction and structuring.
Tecton is useful for instructional purposes, for teaching theorem proving,
methods for constructing proofs and verification. RRL is extended to enhance its
theorem proving capabilities for proving properties by induction. The cover set
induction method which has proved quite effective in automating proofs by
induction, is further refined. Semantic methods for showing of rewrite systems
of recursively defined functions, especially those arising in the specification
of algorithms and data structures, are studied and further developed. Heuristics
for checking the completeness of a cover set designed from a function definition
are investigated. Heuristics for automatic lemma generation in RRL are expanded.
