This proposal describes research to develop an object oriented simulation system
using RESQUE as its foundation, and to integrate the simulation system with a
knowledge based expert system for construction process planning. RESQUE is a
simulation system specifically designed to model complex resource interactions
in construction processes. However, its resource representation is limited and
model definition is input-intensive. The new integrated knowledge based expert
simulation system extends RESQUE's modeling methodology into the object oriented
paradigm where resources and operations are "encapsulated" units - each with its
own knowledge, such as resource properties and interaction rules. Therefore,
model definition will only involve selecting operations and resources from the
system's construction processing knowledge base. With the built- in processing
knowledge, the system will also be capable of giving advice on process design
and process performance analysis. The formalization of process knowledge will
contribute to construction basic research, and the proposed system will broaden
and simplify construction simulation.
