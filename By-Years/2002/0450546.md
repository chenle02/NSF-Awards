This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project
addresses the development of a novel real-time bio-aerosol machine for detecting
and identifying harmful bio-aerosols present in the environment. The system will
use the time of flight method to determine the aerodynamic size, and the
Multiphoton Laser Induced Fluorescence (MLIF) method for the identification of
the fluorescence spectrums. The novelty of the detection machine lies in the use
of in-line, non-invasive techniques to measure these two important parameters.
The system will consist of a compact laser source, a laser diode, a
spectrometer, fiber optics couplings, a series of lenses and filters, pumps,
flowmeters and pressure transducers. The sensor will be driven by two printed
circuit boards and by computer software both uniquely designed for the proposed
detector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for the proposed instrument is of high
priority in current times due to the extreme concerns about air quality issues
and the high probability of terrorist attacks in large urban settings. The
initial target markets for this product are "first emergency response" civilian
agencies, medium to large size hospitals, and the armed forces. &lt;br/&gt;
