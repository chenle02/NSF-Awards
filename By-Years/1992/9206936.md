Klimek will continue his study of noncommutative geometry and the theory of
infinite dimensional spaces. Of particular interest will be the construction of
quantum Riemann surfaces and other noncommutative spaces, and application of the
constructive field theory methods to analysis on infinite dimensional manifolds.
Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth
century. It is founded firmly in the last century's attempt to address the
microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a
distance, electro-magnetism, and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations
for these developments, collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from
detailed analysis of Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of
particles, to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known
forces into a single theory.
