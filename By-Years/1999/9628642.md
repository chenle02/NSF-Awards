This project involves the design and analysis of communication receivers for
direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple-access (CDMA) in an environment
consisting of multiple user interference where each signal is received at
possibly different strengths and in narrowband interference (NBI) of unknown
forms. This work differs from the work of many other researchers in that the
initial focus here is put on the problem of parameter estimation (i.e.
synchronization) rather than data detection. Traditionally synchronization has
been the most difficult aspect in the design of communication receivers. An
asymptotically maximum likelihood parameter estimation scheme will be used which
is based on colored noise model rather than the usual white noise. This makes
the proposed estimation scheme nicely suited for dealing with NBI. Once the
parameter estimation problem has been thoroughly studied, the focus will turn to
the problem of multiuser receiver design in the presence of NBI. The optimum
receiver for such an environment has been formulated and will be investigated.
Suboptimal structures that are robust to errors in needed side information will
also be studied. Finally the project will address the problem of multiuser
receiver design when the form of the transmitted signal is not precisely known,
as when in CDMA overlay a spread transmitter may have to distort its own signal
in order to avoid interfering with a nearby narrowband system..
