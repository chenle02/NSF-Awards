Carnegie Mellon University is developing an intensive faculty development and
capacity building program in the critical area of Information Assurance (IA).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the program are: &lt;br/&gt;Help build new
capacity or expand existing capacity to offer IA courses and programs at
institutions not currently designated as Centers of Academic Excellence
by&lt;br/&gt; -Enabling participating faculty members from non-CAE institutions
to develop/expand their knowledge and expertise in the area of Information
Assurance&lt;br/&gt;- Providing the opportunity for participants to develop the
curriculum and course materials to return to their home institutions and teach
an introductory, upper-level, undergraduate course in Information
Assurance&lt;br/&gt;- Enabling participants to integrate security topic and
issues into courses already offered.&lt;br/&gt;Expand the number of PhD-level
researchers in the IA area by&lt;br/&gt;- Enabling participants to identify
links between their current areas of research and IA&lt;br/&gt;- Provide expert
guidance and mentoring to help participants begin research projects in IA that
are related to their areas of expertise and active
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon is a partner with three
institutions serving underrepresented minorities, and the first cohort to go
through the program is comprised eight faculty members from Howard University,
Morgan State University (both HBCUs), and the University of Texas at El Paso (an
HSI). This program results in the creation or expansion of IA programs at these
three institutions, and thereby significantly increase the national capacity for
research and education in IA. It also enables partnering institutions to
increase participation of underrepresented minorities in this critical area.
