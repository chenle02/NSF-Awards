Process models of ecological system directly represent how a system functions.
They can be used to generate new ecological theory, and sometimes, can be used
to predict the consequences of environmental management. A new method, the
Pareto Optimal Model Assessment Cycle (POMAC) for developing and assessing
process models is explored and contrasted with the more traditional technique of
least squares fitting. POMAC uses evolutionary computation to seek parameters of
the model that can simulate different outputs of process models. The model that
can be developed using POMAC will be compared using the standard method of least
squares fitting and also the Akaike Information Criterion, designed to produce
parsimonious models. Developing POMAC should lead to a more effective method for
model development and assessment. Saying that a model accounts for a particular
amount of the total sums of squares of the data does not provide an adequate
assessment-we need to know how it has achieved that. POMAC permits many
different types of data to be used simultaneously, giving greater potential use
of ecological and environmental data.
