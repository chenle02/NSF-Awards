The objective of this research is the development of scattering theory to
describe the interaction between electromagnetic waves of millimeter wave-length
and ice-phase hydrometeors in the atmosphere. The work is motivated by the
development of new millimeter radars (3.2, 8.6, mm) designed to investigate the
structure and physics of clouds. The work will be guided by measurements taken
with these new devices as well as conventional meteorological radars at NCAR or
NOAA.
