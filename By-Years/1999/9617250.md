ABSTRACT CTS-9617250 The purpose of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
(SGER) is to prepare, characterize, and demonstrate photoactivity of a novel
mesostructured tatanium dioxide. The reaction studied is the oxidation of
2-propanol to acetone. The material is produced by the method develop last year
by the Ying group at MIT. If this demonstration of photoactivity is successful,
it will form the basis for a large study of photooxidation processes with these
materials for both waste disposal and chemical manufacturing.
