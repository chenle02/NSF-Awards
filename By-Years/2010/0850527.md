Infants show rapid, robust learning during a "sensitive period". The classic
example of sensitive period learning is imprinting where newly hatched chicks
rapidly learn about their mother. Researchers on the present project have a
mammalian model of imprinting, where infant rat pups rapidly learn to attach to
their mother, that shows pups increase their ability to learn preferences but
decrease their ability to learn avoidance. Infant rats learn to prefer their
mother's odor, which controls nipple attachment and orientation to the mother.
Previous work from this lab has identified unique brain areas used for sensitive
period learning. The present project contains experiments designed to explain
how the sensitive period ends and adult learning emerges. This is important
because special periods of learning occur throughout life in humans and most
other species (mother-infant attachment, language acquisition, maternal
behavior). This project extends previously funded NSF research that showed
increases in corticosterone (CORT, the stress hormone) levels during development
terminate the sensitive period. Specifically, high CORT enables brain areas
(i.e. amygdala) to participate in learning, which in turn enables pups to learn
behaviors such as avoidance required for life outside the nest. Recent work from
this lab suggests that sensitive period learning still exists in these older
pups but the mother must be present for it to be used. Thus, these older pups
appear to have two learning systems available (infant and adult). The
experiments in this project will explore the mother's effect on CORT levels and
determine how this "switches" between infant learning and adult learning in the
brain. This research provides training opportunities for undergraduates and
graduates students. The PI is also involved in educational outreach as organizer
for the Brain Awareness Week at the Ominplex Science Museum (~4 years), giving
science presentations (schools, Scouts, 4H) and began an Intel affiliated
Science Fair last year.&lt;br/&gt;
