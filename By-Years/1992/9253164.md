This three year project sponsored by Eastern Illinois University will provide
25 teachers of high school psychology a four-week summer program to acquaint
them with the use of hands-on modules for use in demonstrations and experiments
illustrating the scientific aspects of psychology. In the first year well-
prepared teachers will learn about the modules, use them in the schools and
revise them as needed. The revised modules will be evaluated by an outside
evaluator and/or used in the second year with a less-well-prepared group of
teachers. In the third year the implementation and dissemination phase of the
project will take place. Matching funds from the school and the University
constitute 14% of the NSF award.
