Mitochondria are the intricate power generators of the cell providing the energy
needed for most biochemical pathways that regulate cell fate and function.
Currently few imaging methods are available to non-invasively detect metabolic
changes and track mitochondria simultaneously. This project aims to develop an
imaging platform that has a fast orbital tracking technique to follow
mitochondria with nanometer precision and, at the same time, non-invasively
measure metabolic changes at the local environment in cancer cells. The PI will
develop educational and outreach activities that will give students the
opportunity to develop their leadership, teaching and training skills that will
promote STEM research, and help bridge closer networks with community college
STEM program coordinators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A light-based technology will
provide biophysical information regarding focal adhesion dynamics with changes
in matrix density and at invading structures within tumor cells called
invadopodia using fluorescence biosensors and an optogenetic protein. The
information obtained from organoid tumor models will deepen the understanding of
the molecular mechanisms that make some tumor cells more aggressive than others
as they respond to local environmental cues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
