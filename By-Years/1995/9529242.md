AST 95-29242 Jane Charlton Dwarf Galaxies and Their Formation: A Study in the
Compact Group Environment. Knowledge of the numbers and properties of dwarf
galaxies in various environments is an essential element for devising the
overall scenario for galaxy formation. The luminosity function of dwarfs is
determined by a synthesis of the initial density fluctuation spectrum with
evolutionary processes acting to create or destroy existing galaxies. The goal
of this observational program is to discover the formation mechanism for dwarf
galaxies and to explore the consequences for galaxy formation in general. In
particular this program has the following three objectives: (1) To provide the
most complete determination of the luminosity function in compact groups,
extending well into the regime of the dwarf population; (2) To study the physics
of star formation and dwarf galaxy formation in the tidal debris of interacting
giants in compact groups; and (3) To determine the overall importance of tidal
dwarfs for galaxy formation.
