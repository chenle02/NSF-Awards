Fermentation technology can be used to convert hydrocarbons, wastes, and
renewable materials (e.g., crops and trees) into complex organic materials, such
as antibiotics and enzymes, and to single-cell protein, an alternate food
source. To help make these processes economically competitive, this study
focuses on two problems: as product concentration increases in a fermentation
reactor, microbial activity is inhibited and the product can be degraded. This
process attempts to avoid these problems by continuously removing product from
the reaction mixture. This is accomplished by adsorbing the product as it is
formed onto a solid polymeric adsorbent which is introduced directly in to the
mixture. The physio-chemical and biochemical behavior of a model fermentation
process in the presence of such an additional non-aqueous phase will then be
analyzed.
