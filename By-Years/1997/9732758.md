William Miller, University of California Berkeley, is supported by a grant from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on
theoretical gas-phase chemical dynamics. He will develop rigorous quantum
methods for reaction rate constant calculations and semiclassical methods for
simulations of complex dynamical processes. The quantum methodology will employ
direct techniques that result in rate constants without all of the state-to-
state details. Miller also will develop the semiclassical initial-value-
representation method as a potentially universal treatment of molecular
dynamics, including quantum effects, tunneling, and electronically non-adiabatic
effects. Novel applications of these new methods will also be performed, e.g.,
resonance tunneling in the vinylidene/acetylene rearrangement. The goal of this
research is to develop the theoretical concepts and methodologies that can
provide a quantitative description of chemical dynamics, a kind of ab initio
chemical dynamics akin to the ab initio quantum chemistry of electronic
structure theory. This research is directed at the most fundamental level of
chemistry, i.e., the chemical reaction taking place in the gas phase between two
colliding molecules. This very basic, yet highly complex, process is the
simplest chemical reaction to which theory can be rigorously applied, and forms
the basis for understanding all other more complex chemical processes.
