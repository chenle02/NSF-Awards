The project goal is the development of a controller design for systems with
unknown nonlinear dynamics. The method differs from current methods including
adaptive control, variable structure control, and learning control. For this
concept, at each sampling time the system response (position, velocity, and
acceleration) is observed and used directly to modify controller actions rather
than to adjust the controller gains as is the case for the other methods.
Preliminary investigations indicate that the proposed concept has promise. The
project formulates the fundamentel concept, examines stability, and also the
hardware implementation of the controller. The concept is tested on a robot
manipulator at the MIT Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity.
