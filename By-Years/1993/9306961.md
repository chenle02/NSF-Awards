James Rusling Abstract The goal of this project is an understanding of the
dynamics of surfactant microstructures adsorbed on electrodes from
microemulsions and their influence on rates of mediated reactions.
Electrochemical kinetic studies are used to relate surfactant and reactant
adsorption-desorption dynamics on electrodes to chemical reaction rates. Surface
dynamics are measured by time-resolved flow voltammetry and by simplified
electrochemical microscopy. the adsorption dymanics and reactivity of mediators
on electrodes are also obtained. Using a stirred, batch, electrochemical
reactor, the rates of mediated syntheses, measured by voltammetry, and of bulk
electrolysis in microemulsions and in isotropic solutions are compared and
correlations with adsorption dynamics are sought. Reactions selected for study
include carbon-carbon bond formation, functional group deprotection, and
production of olefins. Mediators include transition-metal corrins and
phthalocyanine an their derivatives. Mediated electrochemical reactions
(reactions involving an intermediate or catalyst that carries the electron (or
hole) from the electrode to the substrate of interest) are enhanced by
surfactants adsorbed on electrodes. Microemulsions offer an attractive way to
introduce and control these processes. This approach can provide clean,
efficient, cost-effective processes for producing high-value-added chemical
products such as drugs and dyes.
