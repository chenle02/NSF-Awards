Axonal elongation and directional growth are affected by both stimulatory and
inhibitory factors. Previous work has shown that axonal contact with inhibitory
factors results in collapse of the growth cone. To further study mechanisms
involved in the action of inhibitory factors, an in vitro bioassay consisting of
gradients of inhibitory activity contained in agarose gel will be established
and characterized. This bioassay will be used with chick dorsal root ganglion
neurons to determine whether inhibitory factors that cause growth cone collapse
also have effects on directional growth of axons. In addition, the effects of
growth cone collapse on specific components of the cytoskeleton labeled with
antibodies will be studied using time- lapse video microscopy and transmission
electron microscopy. These studies are fundamental to identifying molecules
involved in axonal guidance.
