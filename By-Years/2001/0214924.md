This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop enabling
technology for construction of a small, low cost fiber optic switch. The switch
will be based upon vertical cavity surface emitting laser arrays and PIN
photodiode arrays, both coupled directly to a silicon switching/interfacing
integrated circuit. The switch design and fabrication processes will be enabled
by new interconnect technologies using direct-write of both organic materials
and liquid metals using ink jet printing technology. Collimating or focusing
polymer microlenses will be printed directly onto the vertical cavity surface
emitting laser arrays with photolithographic accuracy, coupling the output of
the vertical cavity surface emitting lasers directly into arrays of multimode
optical fibers. The same will be true for coupling into detector arrays. Solder-
Jet technology will be used to electrically interconnect the active optical
elements to the silicon integrated circuit with practically zero interconnect
distance, drastically decreasing parasitic effects&lt;br/&gt; The optical and
electrical interconnect methods developed in this project will have commercial
applications far broader than the fiber optic switch. Some of the other
applications include: fiber optic transceivers, imaging sensors, read/write
heads, laser sources for printers, optical sensors for medical diagnostics,
micro-assembly, micro-electromechanical machines packaging and
3D-packaging.&lt;br/&gt;
