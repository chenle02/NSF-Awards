This CAREER award will support research to develop the use of Nd isotopes in
fossil fish teeth and apply this tool as a paleo- watermass tracer of North
Atlantic Deep Water and variations in Mediterranean weathering during the last
glacial/interglacial cycle. Two graduate students will be involved in the
research. Educational activities include helping to develop a curriculum in
Earth Systems Science which will feature WWW sites with course notes and lab
exercises.
