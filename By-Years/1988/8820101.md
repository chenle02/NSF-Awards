Technological advances in many fields are increasingly dependent on high-speed
image generation and interpretation. This need is being recognized in the
funding priorities of industry and government. The higher funding priority opens
the possibility that a regional Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
on High-Speed Image/Signal Processing may be feasible and viable. This project
is funding an Industry Planning Meeting to study the feasibility and viability
of a regional Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on High-Speed
Image/Signal Processing to be operated by the University of California, Irvine,
University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Southern
California. The universities have drafted a prospectus of the Center's research
and operations that will provide a basis for study at the planning meeting to
occur in October, 1988. The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues are
recognized experts in their fields and have the necessary industrial
interactions to run this meeting. This project was coordinated with Drs. J.
Lehman (MIP) and Y.T. Chien (IRI). The Program Manager recommends the University
of California, Irvine be awarded $8,990 for one (1) year for this planning
meeting.
