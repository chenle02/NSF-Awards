This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address
material innovations required to successfully take spin-transfer torque (STT)
switching phenomenon from a research environment to commercialization. The goal
of this Phase II project is to deliver Dual Magnetic Tunnel Junction (DMTJ)
technology at three progressively smaller technology nodes, and to develop a
package of data on DMTJ devices, including materials structure, read and write
performance, and reliability characteristics, that can be transferred to
licensees for commercialization.

The outcome of this project will be STT based Random Access memory (STT-RAM), a
fast, high density, low power, nonvolatile universal memory solution that has
the potential to displace mainstream semiconductor memories such as Static RAM,
Dynamic RAM and Flash in both embedded and standalone memory markets, and create
entirely new sectors in the semiconductor industry. Not only can STT-RAM replace
each of these memories individually, but from a system perspective, STT-RAM
offers the potential to revolutionize electronic system architectures in a way
that can significantly reduce power, component count, area and cost, while
dramatically improving system functionality and performance.
