Early to Late Silurian limestones from the Heceta Formation record the earliest
occurrence of widespread carbonate deposition in the region and represent the
earliest foundation for shallow water platform development within the arc. The
excellent preservation of shallow to deep subtidal deposits within the Alexander
arc contrasts with the poor preservation of many marine sediments that
originated within other island arcs. Hence, these limestones provide important
insights into the styles, processes and bathymetry of carbonate deposition in
tectonically active areas. Although previously described as having a shallow
marine origin, the limestones from the Heceta Formation can be differentiated
into shallow water platform, platform margin, and slope facies. Renewal support
will enable PI to pursue topics that relate to: (1) the dynamics of reef
sedimentation and carbonate platform development within the Alexander arc; (2)
physical and biologic controls on stromatolite distribution within the arc; and
(3) regional biogeographic correlations. The proposed research will involve
field work and laboratory analyses during a two-year period and will generate a
model for carbonate platform and reef evolution within a tectonic framework.
Results of the proposed research will refine our understanding of Silurian reef
evolution and decline in different tectonic settings, factors affecting
Phanerozoic stromatolite development, and the paleogeography of the Alexander
terrane.
