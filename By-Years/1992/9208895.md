This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Scott Gronert at San Francisco State University. Ab initio theoretical methods
will be used to characterize the transition states of several fundamental
organic reactions. Gaussian 90 will be used to examine the mechanisms and
energetics of proton transfer, E2, and SN2 reactions. Bader electron density
analysis will be used to examine how the molecular electron density responds
during chemical transformations and how it shifts to stabilize transition
states. %%% Theoretical calculations will be undertaken in order to determine
the changes in energy during an organic reaction and to determine the three
dimensional structure of any intermediates formed on the way to product. The
calculations will be performed on small molecules in order to limit the number
of assumptions that must be made. These reactions, however, can serve as models
for more complicated systems and the theoretical results will give new insights
into the factors that affect these important reactions. These calculations refer
to the gas phase and will either confirm or question conclusions obtained from
gas phase experimental studies.
