Axler and Shapiro will continue their study of the connection between classical
function theory and operator theory. Of particular interest will be the
association between function theoretic properties of an analytic mapping and
operator theoretic properties of the corresponding composition, Toeplitz, and
Hankel operators. Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the
infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted
to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties,
and thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problems in operator theory
is to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space.
Operator theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
