This research is studying the role of pyrophosphate as an alternative (to ATP)
energy source and phosphate donor in higher plants. Research is concentrating on
measurements of the pyrophosphate content of plant tissues and the variations
that occur between tissues that serve as sources and sinks for carbohydrate
metabolism. The pyrophosphate-utilizing enzyme, pyrophosphatase, will be
purified and used to generate antibodies against the protein for use in cellular
localization studies. The role of pyrophosphate in ethylene production is to be
ascertained by correlating pyrophosphate measurements with the production of
ethylene during the climacteric response in ripening banana.%%% The regulation
of carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants is integral to the processes by
which plants grow and develop. This research is looking at the role of a
specific high energy compound, pyrophosphate, as both an energy source and
regulatory molecule in higher plants. Studies will focus on attempts to purify a
major enzyme associated with pyrophosphate metabolism and ultimately determine
its cellular site of action. In addition work is being carried out on the
contributions of pyrophosphate in the fruit ripening response in banana.***//
