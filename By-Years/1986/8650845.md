The Computer Based Physics Laboratory project will result in a model laboratory
program for general physics courses, in which students, Apple IIe micro-
computers, interfaced measurement modules, and specially developed software will
interact to achieve a unique and improved laboratory experience. A series of 30
laboratory software packages, stored on magnetic disk, will assist and direct
student procedures, monitor and verify student measurements, aid in analysis,
and help eliminate certain traditional laboratory difficulties. Apple IIe
computers, printers and measurement modules will also perform as powerful data
acquisition and analysis devices. The project will implement a substantially
improved curriculum and a model laboratory program, and will have replication
value since the software disk series will be available to other institutions.
