A thorough integration is being conducted of the study of mathematics with
courses in physics, chemistry, geology, biology, social science, economics, art,
music, philosophy, computer science, architecture, medicine, engineering, and
literature. Engaged in the project are faculty representing these disciplines at
a large number of institutions. Materials are being developed that will be
designed for use in conjunction with other texts, as independent reference
materials, and as basis for interdisciplinary courses. Support materials for
faculty, including documented software, online materials, and videotapes, are
being developed. The project is expected to result in fundamental changes at the
institutions in the project. In addition, through the materials being developed
and a series of intensive summer workshops, the project will benefit faculty and
institutions other than those directly involved in the project.
