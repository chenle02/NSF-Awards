The main goal of the work described in this proposal is to introduce and perform
a thorough theoretical and numerical analysis of the class of beta random matrix
ensembles. The investigators will generalize and extend to any postive beta the
classical real, complex, and quaternion random matrix ensembles which correspond
to the cases 1, 2, 4, respectively. Already many results in infinite random
matrix theory and a few results in finite random matrix theory suggest that the
use of beta as a continuous parameter is reasonable. The key new concept in this
proposal is the notion of a beta-random variable, an object which, for all
practical purposes behaves as a beta-dimensional algebra over the reals. To
develop the theory the PIs use the notions of "ghosts" and "shadows". A "ghost"
is a beta-dimensional random variable and a "shadow" is a derived real or
complex quantity that can be sampled. Along with the derivation of theoretical
results, a major goal of this project is to provide algorithms for computation
with these random matrix ensembles.

A vast number of practical application ranging from bioinformatics, and
genomics (population classification) to wireless communications (network
capacity optimization) and military applications (automatic target
classification) rely on the methods of multivariate statistics and in turn on
random matrix theory. The proposed research will provide new algorithmic and
theoretical tools for these applications as well as enable new applications and
research directions in these fields.
