This is a proposal to characterize a protein, histone from nuclear chromatin of
the alfalfa plant. Because the structure and function of chromatin is highly
dependant on the intracellular environment, plant chromatin may be significantly
affected by salts in plants grown under saline conditions. Alfalfa contains
multiple histone variants and high levels of histone acetylation, depending on
growth conditions. Cellular, biochemical and molecular techniques will be used
to characterize the histones. These studies, which have been few in plants, will
significantly increase our knowledge of plant histone variants and postsynthetic
modifications. A good characterization of histones should contribute to our
understanding of the proteins' role in providing dynamic balance for a stable
packaging of DNA, for interaction sites with regulatory components and for the
localized and selective unpacking of gene sequences for transcription.
