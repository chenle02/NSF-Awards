The investigator, with his collaborators, studies geometric optimization
problems like finding minimum-energy shapes for surfaces and knots in space.
They extend their recent classification of embedded constant-mean-curvature
surfaces with three ends to the more general case of surfaces with any number of
coplanar ends, and also investigate in detail surfaces with truncated ends. In
addition, the investigator computes these surfaces numerically, in order, for
instance, to create interactive computer graphics. This project uses Willmore's
elastic bending energy, and its gradient flow, to discover new minimal surfaces
in euclidean and spherical space. The Willmore flow has been recently shown to
have short-time solutions, but the investigator considers whether it can fail to
have long-time solutions. This project also studies configurations for knots
which minimize ropelength, giving new lower bounds for the ropelength of small
knots, and new asymptotic bounds on the growth of ropelength with crossing
number. Finally, the investigator uses his experience with numerical modeling of
curves and surfaces to give new understanding of geometrically natural
discretizations for quantities related to curvature.

Many real-world problems can be cast in the form of optimizing some feature of
a shape; mathematically, these become variational problems for geometric
energies. For instance, thin films, like those in foams, usually minimize their
area and thus are constant-mean curvature surfaces. Cell membranes are more
complicated bilayer surfaces which minimize an elastic bending energy known
mathematically as the Willmore energy. Knotted curves achieve an optimal shape
when a rope is pulled tight, or if a charged knotted wire repels itself
electrostatically; understanding such configurations helps explain the behavior
of biological molecules like DNA. This project explores such phsically natural
problems, which remain challenging from both theoretical and computational
standpoints.
