This project supports participation by 8 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-India
workshop to identify specific areas in wind engineering research where joint
projects can be developed. In addition to a keynote speech, plans call for 16
technical papers, a field trip, group discussions, and definition of possible
areas of joint research. Topics will cover instrumentation and field
measurements, analysis of data and characterization of wind behavior, and wind
tunnel model studies. In addition to the preprints containing the technical
papers, proceedings will be published containing summaries and recommendations
on research areas. This project will encourage scientists from both countries to
exchange information and to develop research activities in areas of importance
to the two countries such as the area of wind effect on structures.
