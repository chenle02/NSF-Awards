The BD Hubs foster regional networks of stakeholders and cooperate nationally on
US priorities of importance to a region and to the nation. The activities of the
BD Hubs contribute to a vibrant national data innovation ecosystem. The South
Big Data Regional Innovation Hub nucleates community across organizations. It
does this through stimulating new activities and provides continuity and a
neutral place for activities to advance. It works in the context of regional and
national data science priorities. The South Big Data Regional Innovation Hub
will serve the critical national need to educate new, and retrain current, work-
force in data science, and increase data literacy. It will achieve this by
tapping into the collective expertise of its member universities, create a
clearinghouse for resources, materials, and collaborations, engage with industry
for training and placement of individuals, assist non-research intensive
universities and community colleges develop data science curriculum, and promote
collaborative team science approaches to research and project
execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial priority areas of the South Big Data
Regional Innovation Hub are in data science cyberinfrastructure; health
analytics for mitigating health disparities that largely impact the South;
geospatial mapping for assessment of environmental hazards such as flooding
along the Gulf coasts; data science for advanced materials and manufacturing to
integrate and enhance the materials-manufacturing value chain; digital modeling
as well as data-driven policies for smart cities; and education and workforce
training in data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
