This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants
in the conference "Applications of Model Theory to Operator Algebras" that will
be held from July 31 - August 4, 2017, on the campus of the University of
Houston, Houston, Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on
important recent developments in the use of model theory of operator algebras
and the applications of mathematical logic to classification problems in
operator algebras. The goals of this conference are to inform non-experts and
young researchers of the fundamental concepts of this version of model theory
and to update experts who work in other areas of operator algebras of the latest
advances. This will be accomplished by a series of five featured lectures by
Israel Farah and other plenary research talks presented by a mixture of
experienced and junior researchers. The featured lectures will be accessible to
all graduate students and non-experts with a basic knowledge of functional
analysis and operator algebras. This meeting will provide a special opportunity
for early career mathematicians to learn about these recent developments at the
interface of logic and set theory and operator algebras. Special attention will
be given to ensure the participation of members of underrepresented groups in
the conference. The conference will have significant impact on the future of the
field of operator algebras and to will broaden and influence the work of junior
investigators in this area.
