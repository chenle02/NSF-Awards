This project introduces electronic measurement and manipulation of data through
the construction and implementation of a measurement network in freshman
chemistry laboratory programs for science and engineering majors. The result is
a major revision of the laboratory curriculum that takes advantage of the
capabilities of the network. The connectivity it provides facilitates
cooperative learning activities. Learning groups of students function in a true
team mode, sharing their efforts in experimental measurement and, most
significantly, in the preliminary interpretation of data while still in the
laboratory. Occasional multi-session projects can be undertaken, in which the
members of learning groups study related aspects of a problem and combine their
efforts to produce more meaningful results and conclusions. The students learn,
through concrete examples, that today's chemists carry out measurements and data
manipulation electronically, work cooperatively on extended projects as members
of a team, and spend a great deal of time interpreting data. A small prototype
network system has been constructed and tested with students. This project will
finalize the design of this prototype and construct and install it in the
laboratories, concurrent with revision of the laboratory curriculum.
Installation and implementation of the system in stages over a 1-year period
allows direct comparison of student learning with and without the network. This
can be assessed through common laboratory examinations. The clientele in the
laboratory program are being carefully monitored and their attitudes and
perceptions assessed through regular surveys.
