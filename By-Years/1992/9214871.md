This project seeks to develop technology that will bypass the need for genomic
walking over long map distances in those cases where the gene to be cloned has
been mapped between two restriction fragment markers in an RFLP map of the
organism. The size limit of the clonable region will not be determined by the
usual limitations of in vitro cloning because the procedure will involove
targeted in vivo genetic recombination between Arabidopsis chromosomes and
specialized Yeast Artifical Chromosome (YAC) vectors. The central idea is to
clone a defined genetic interval of large physical size in a single step into a
YAC vector by cell fusion and in vivo homologous recombination. %%% The
development of this technology will enhance the ability of scientists using
Arabidopsis as a model to clone the entire genome in much less time than is now
predicted.
