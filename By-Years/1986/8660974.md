The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a nondestructive instrument
to identify the levels of metallic wear particles in circulating oils in
industrial machinery. The technique is based on transmission of low-energy
x-rays through a fixed path of length of lubricating medium. Metallic wear
particles can be distinguished, since the attenuation by the metallic particles
is an order of magnitude larger than the hydrocarbon medium. On-line measurement
of wear particles in lubricant systems has a great economic benefit. The
proposed technique is novel. The PI and the company have an excellent track
record. An award is recommended.
