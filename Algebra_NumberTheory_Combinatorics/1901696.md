An exciting aspect of any scientific research, in particular in mathematics, is
the opportunity to merge a priori disparate phenomena into a unified theory.
Such unification makes research more efficient overall, reduces duplication, and
fosters creativity. The transposition of technical methods from one field to
another, in potentially unexpected ways, not only strengthens research but often
inspires new ideas that lead to breakthroughs. This project is concerned with
such a unification, known as "Tensor-Triangular Geometry," that merges aspects
of topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory and of other areas of
mathematics under a single umbrella. In this project, Tensor-Triangular Geometry
will be deployed at the interface of modular representation theory of finite
groups and the theory of motives in number theory. The explicit nature of the
former enhances our understanding of the latter, providing classification
results among other applications. Graduate students will be trained through the
research. The specific objectives of this project are the classifications of
objects that appear in two categories in two distinct areas. On one hand, one
can consider Artin-Tate motives over various ground fields in Voevodsky's
derived category of motives, and on the other one can consider complexes of
filtered representations over pro-finite groups, typically the absolute Galois
groups of the above fields. Thanks to tensor-triangular geometry, such
classifications are equivalent to the computation of a space (the spectrum)
associated to the categories in question. The proposed methods involve etale
extensions in tensor-triangular geometry. These extensions are a new development
that have incarnations in both settings, as finite extensions of the ground
field in the motivic case and as the corresponding restriction to finite-index
subgroups in the equivariant case. Understanding Artin-Tate motives via filtered
representations in turn sheds new light on the classification of objects in the
larger and more mysterious category of motives, which is a long-term goal of
researchers in the field.
