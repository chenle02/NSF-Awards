This project involves customer discovery for a technology that provides the
sensation of touch on an electronic device, generating feedback to the user. The
technology has the potential to be used for virtual reality applications, remote
human-human interaction, and natural human-machine interfaces. It also has the
potential to transform many industries, ranging from industrial platforms to
consumer products. The diversity of applications presents a challenge for
translation to the marketplace for a small team. The proposed technology, based
on ultrasound phased array and predictive/learning based algorithms, creates
high resolution air pressure fields that can be sensed by human touch sensors to
enable users of VR systems to interact and sense virtual objects. The proposed
solution uses a high-density array of Piezo-electric transducers to create high-
resolution ultrasonic patterns to create 3D objects. The transducer array and
algorithm enables complex high-resolution patterns while using less power and
footprint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of introducing sense of touch to
daily lives of people can be significant. Sense of touch is an extremely
important sense in human life. Because of the large size of target market, the
variety of applications (gaming, entertainment, social interaction, etc.), and
the need for seamless sense of touch in VR scenarios, this project's solution
can have a marked commercial impact in the fast growing Virtual Reality areas.
The proposed work will use the lean startup methodology to investigate and
prioritize potential commercial applications of an electronic device providing
the sensation of touch. Through an accelerated customer discovery process, this
I-Corps team plans to rapidly create business model hypotheses, validate them
through interviews, and iterate to develop an integrated business model.
Participation in the I-Corps program will allow this team to efficiently develop
a business model that can develop rapid traction in the marketplace.
