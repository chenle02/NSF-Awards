Professor Barry K. Lavine and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Clarkson University are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. During the summer of 1991, eight
undergraduate students will spend eight weeks actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Many of the projects are concerned with colloid chemistry,
such as investigation of the stability of lyophobic colloids or plasma
modification of fine particles, but projects are also available in
chromatography, spectroscopy, and other areas. During the first week of the
program, students will be introduced to research techniques and instrumentation.
Students will prepare a progress report and a final report on their research and
will give an oral presentation on their results.
