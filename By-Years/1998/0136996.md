EIA-0136996&lt;br/&gt;Francioni, Joan&lt;br/&gt;Computing Research
Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managing the Academic Career for Women Faculty
at Undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering
Institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the Computing Research
Association (CRA), provides funds to support a workshop entitled "Managing the
Academic Career for Women Faculty at Undergraduate Computer Science and
Engineering Institutions". The workshop will be co-located with the ACM's
conference on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE 2002) and will be organized by
the CRA's Committee on the Status of Women in Computer Science and Engineering
(CRA-W). The workshop is planned to provide faculty members in undergraduate
education information and tools to build successful academic careers. Further,
the workshop will provide mentoring activities targeting women in undergraduate
teaching and research who face particular challenges in pursuing and maintaining
academic careers at primarily undergraduate teaching institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
