The role of melamine-formaldehyde as a bonding agent of paper fibers will be
studied in detail. The results will be used to formulate property requirements
for alternate bonding agents. The location of the binder within the fibers and
within the composite will be determined and correlated with the nature of the
chemical bonds between fiber and binder and with the mechanical properties of
the paper.
