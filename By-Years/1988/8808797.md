Under this "Research Opportunities Award" project, Dr. Penland will apply a
Principal Oscillation Pattern (POP) analysis method to upper air data from the
Northern Hemisphere in order to delineate major atmospheric teleconnection
patterns. The analysis would not only find spatial structures but also determine
whether these are standing or travelling waves, or simply exponentially decaying
structures. This project would provide useful information from which the
geographical and temporal properties of driving forces can be calculated. Thus,
this work may enhance our capability to model important intraseasonal
atmospheric processes.
