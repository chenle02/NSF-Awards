9404052 Middleton This study will use Be and b isotopes as tracers of the
Sediment input into active margin volcanism. Concentrations of 10-Be can be
compared between incoming (subducted) sediment and the volcanic, and used to
determine the proportions of sediment accreted, subducted and recycled. The
partitioning can then be used to determine mass fluxes at margins, to be
compared with estimates derived from seismic imaging.
