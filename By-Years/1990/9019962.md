The bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus is likely the most extensively
studied small cetacean, yet very little is know about their physiological
ecology. Virtually all studies concerning the energetic expenditures of
Odontocete cetaceans have been performed either on captive animals or on trained
animals doing open-ocean respirometry. Thus far there have been no direct field
studies of the energy requirements of any free- ranging cetacean. This project
represents the next phase in a continuing program designed to elucidate the
metabolic and behavioral adjustments which occur during normal seasonal cycles
in dolphins. Over the previous 3 years, measurements have been made of the
changes in the insulative blubber stores of dolphins in Sarasota Bay, FL, as
well as measurements of metabolism and water and energy flux in captive
dolphins. The next phase is to measure the free-ranging foraging energetics of
these animals. The Sarasota Bay dolphin community iis ideal for these studies as
it is possible to repeatedly recapture known individual dolphins. This
capability allows one to correlate seasonal changes in energy expenditure,
measured using the double-labelled water technique, with changes in the animals
insulative capability and foraging costs. In previous research, blubber
thickness was found to vary seasonally. However, it has not been possible to
separate whether these changes in blubber thickness were related solely to
seasonal changes in the animals energy stores (i.e., are they responding to
changes in prey availability and composition) or whether these changes are in
response to variations in the ambient water temperature. In addition, data
derived from this study will provide the first direct measurement of the at-sea
metabolic rate of a small cetacean. Measurement of cetacean foraging energetics
will increase our understanding of the costs and efficiencies of various
foraging modes in the marine environment.
