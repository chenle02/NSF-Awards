This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will combine lighter weight and quiet piezoelectric
technology into an innovative Multi-Grip Prosthetic Hand. Current prosthetic
hands are too heavy for many wearers, require expensive cosmetic shells and
gloves which are damaged in rugged work environments, and are limited in
orientation and gripping capabilities. This project will develop a quiet and
lighter weight actuation system and integrate it into a new prosthetic hand
design that will be rugged and water resistant, increasing function with a two-
position thumb for greater gripping capabilities, and a flexible wrist to
enhance orientation abilities and reduce shock loads transmitted to the wearer's
remnant limb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that
it will result in a Multi-Grip Prosthetic Hand, with water-proof housings and
connectors, light-weight motor drive, and two-position thumb design. This hand
will offer a type of hand never available before in the prosthetic marketplace.
Because of its innovative features, it will open up vocations and working
opportunities that were closed to prosthetic hand wearers heretofore. "Return to
Work", the goal of Worker's Rehabilitation programs worldwide, will be given a
tremendous boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
