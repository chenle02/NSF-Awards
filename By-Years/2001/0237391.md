Proposal ID: AST-0237391&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;PI: Levenson, Nancy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Nancy Levenson
is awarded a CAREER grant at the University of Kentucky for an integrated
program of research and education to study the obscuration by dust and resulting
reprocessing of energy in active galaxies, ultimately revealing the intrinsic
accretion power of their central engines. She and her students will observe
nearby samples of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) with three specific
objectives: (1) to measure the local physical conditions and distribution of
material in the obscuring regions; (2) to identify reliable signatures of AGN,
even when they are strongly obscured; and (3) to reveal the connection between
circumnuclear starbursts and AGN. This work will use spectroscopy and imaging at
X-ray and infrared energies, specifically considering the effects of strong
obscuration and intense star formation, which can alter the net emission
significantly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The related educational program will
enhance the undergraduate astronomy concentration at the University of Kentucky,
improve the education of non-scientists, and develop students' abilities through
research. Dr. Levenson will increase the effectiveness of the astronomy
concentration by creating an intermediate-level astrophysics course, increasing
student involvement in research, and producing new publicity about the program.
In teaching both science and non-science majors, she will apply effective
pedagogies that emphasize active learning, such as collaborative learning, peer
instruction, and assigned writing. Finally, Dr. Levenson will mentor
undergraduate and graduate students, directing their work in the research
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
