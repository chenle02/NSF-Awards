Funds are provided to support the investigator's ongoing efforts to study the
response of planktonic foraminifera to oceanic upwelling. This study area is
strongly influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in the strength of
the California Current, resulting in pronounced periods of Ekman- induced
upwelling. The study will result in an (1) increased understanding of the
ecology of planktonic foraminifera which live in a highly unstable but
productive seasonal upwelling habitat; (2) documentation of the seasonal
succession and assemblage composition of these species: (3) identification of
species that respond to periods of upwelling and/or phytoplankton bloom
conditions; (4) identification of upwelling signals recorded in the stable
isotopic composition of foraminiferal tests; (5) an composition of foraminiferal
seasonal abundance/distribution patterns and isotopic composition to sedimentary
assemblages in both bioturbated and non-bioturbated sediments.
