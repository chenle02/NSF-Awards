The University of Texas at Dallas, Collin County Community College, and Richland
College of the Dallas County Community College District are establishing a joint
effort, the Dallas STEM Gateways Collaborative, to increase significantly
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) student learning and
the number of undergraduates receiving STEM degrees at the three institutions.
Building on previous collaborative activities, taking advantage of the
concentration of high tech businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area,
and using documented best-practice methods, the program is making use of a
combination of strengthened recruitment, student mentoring and professional
development, internships, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty
development, and curricular alignment and enhancement to produce over a five-
year period a cultural change that will lead to sustained high productivity of
undergraduate STEM degrees at these institutions. The Dallas STEM Gateways
Collaborative program is enhancing the number, quality, and diversity of
undergraduates successfully earning STEM degrees. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the program lies in the comprehensive set of activities focusing on the
gateway experiences during the first two years of undergraduate STEM programs.
The activities are based on previous successful collaborations, documented best
practices, a proven curricular alignment tool, and attention to all STEM fields,
coupled with an extensive evaluation and assessment plan designed to give
continuous feedback about the progress of the program. The broader impacts
include creating a sustained cultural change in STEM education at the three
institutions, making a significant impact on STEM students in the North Texas
area and its scientifically trained workforce by means of a collaborative
program that can serve as a national model of cooperation between a research
university and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;
