9634768 Ullman This grant provides funding for the development of metrics usable
by practicing engineers and managers to evaluate and improve the product
development process. These metrics will measure the current process, point to
potential process inefficiencies, and assist in the evaluation of new best
practices. The metrics will be based on characterizing the information evolution
and decision structure used during product development. The concept of design
process robustness will be developed as a foundation for the measures. When non-
robust processes are identified, guidelines developed during this research will
provide opportunities for improvement and the ability to document the potential
for increased design process efficiency. Product-based industries are under
continuous pressure to design and produce new, and increasingly higher quality,
products in less time and with fewer resources. With this pressure has come the
realization of the importance of a known and managed product development
process. Many large companies have spent considerable time and effort
documenting their development process. Integrated within the process are many
industry-wide best practices (for example, quality function deployment,
functional modeling, design of experiments, design for assembly). Many small
companies have only just begun to identify and attempt to control the processes
that determine the evolution of their products. Both large and small companies
need better tools for measuring the product design process Standards, like
ISO-9000, require a product development process but give no guidance on how to
develop, measure and ensure the usefulness of such a process. This research will
result in tools usable by industry for self assessment and guidance to improve
their product design process.
