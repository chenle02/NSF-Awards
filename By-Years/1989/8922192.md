The investigator proposes to determine the relationship between market
structure (concentration, costs, entry barriers and product differentiation) and
economic performance (profits, prices, efficiency, growth and welfare) in U.S.
food industries. The research will address the shortcomings of existing market
behavior studies by initiating time-series analysies of specific food
industries. The planning stages will be limited to the potato industry but it
will expand to two additional food industries in the expanded proposal. This
planning grant is intended to generate resources for collecting data, developing
appropriate research methods and identifying food industries with meaningful
databases. These activities will be facilitated by collaboration with a recently
formed Northeast-165 regional committee, Private Strategies, Public Policies and
Food System performance. It is expected that significant changes in the amount
of concentration (structure) and contracting (organization) in the potato
industry should provide meaningful data for testing theories which predict
different relationships between structure and performance. Further, available
data on firms performance by size should allow for testing the role of strategic
groups within industries.
