Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a set of valid
and reliable alternative assessments for general chemistry called Creative
Exercises (CEs), which provide the stem of a problem but not the question, and
then ask the student to generate as many independent correct statements about
the problem as possible. The student therefore determines what statements are
related to the original prompt, that are correct and distinct, and that are also
relevant to the material presented in general chemistry. CEs hold the potential
to engage students in alternative forms of assessment that may promote learning
retention and mitigate test anxiety, and to provide instructors with additional
measures of how students represent their understanding of chemistry. The CEs are
being integrated into exams in general chemistry courses at five different
colleges and universities in Georgia, with two iterations of studying and
improving the items, their implementation, and how to score them reliably. The
research includes the study of validity, reliability and bias in assessing
student learning via CEs in general chemistry. Additionally, the project is
investigating potential benefits of the use of CEs. To better understand how the
CEs measure students' understanding, the project is also conducting a parallel
investigation of the associations between student understanding as measured by
the CEs and how students represent their understanding using concept maps, to
probe students' schemata assuming a cognitive constructivist model. The
resources being developed include a psychometrically sound set of assessments
and rubrics for scoring them. These resources are being shared with educators
through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at professional meetings, and
online databases that feature materials for chemistry instruction. The project
is also offering workshops for STEM faculty presenting alternative assessments
at each of the five collaborating institutions during the summer of the third
year of the project.
