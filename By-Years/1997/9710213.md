This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, focuses on three areas
involving selective extractions and potentiometric sensors based on molecular
recognition. Professor Weber and his students at the University Pittsburgh will
use a combinatorial approach to find mixtures of medium molecular weight
polyfunctional phosphate triesters that selectively extract target analytes.
Novel artificial receptors for anionic dicarboxylates will be developed for
application in potentiometric sensors and the further development of a capillary
electrophoresis device for micro-extraction will be pursued. This work will find
use in industrial chemistry, medicine, environmental chemistry, and agricultural
and food science. There are few practical sensors for anions which are
negatively charged species. The need for such sensors spans applications in many
areas of science including the environment, agriculture, medicine, and chemical
industry. This project aims to develop several strategies for directly
quantifying and for extracting such species from real sample matrices by
developing new compounds and mixtures of compounds that selectively bind to
anions via molecular recognition. Direct sensors that function by measuring
potentials that are related to analyte concentration and extraction procedures
that can be implemented for very small sample volumes will be developed.
