The primary objective of this US-Hungary Project Development Visit by Dr. Susan
Glenn of the University of Oklahoma is to support development of a proposal to
study succession and restoration ecology. The US researcher proposes to visit
Hungary 1) to review and to identify study sites in Hungary; 2) to become more
familiar with research being conducted by Hungarian scientists; 3) to
collaborate in designing experiments; 4) to better acquaint the Hungarian
scientists with western-style proposals; and 5) to visit the Institute of
Ecology and Botany. The researchers will plan the investigation of the effects
of small manipulations on successional pathways. The researchers plan to set up
a series of parallel experiments in restoration in Oklahoma, Kansas and Hungary
and to analyze successional and non-successional community dynamics on Konza
Prairie. The results of such research may aid in devising methods to increase
the rate of succession and to direct the successional pathway. This project in
the field of ecology fulfills the program objective of facilitating scientific
contact for the purpose of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
