This is an SBIR Phase I award for a design study of a collective ion
accelerator. This includes optimization of the acceleration process, and the
cost, size and shielding. This type of accelerator may be an economical
alternative to cyclotrons for production of short-lived isotopes for positron
emission tomography. It can produce higher currents than a cyclotron, for lower
cost. The development of a commercial collective ion accelerator for positron
emission tomography (PET) will lead to significant expansion of the use of PET
in smaller medical facilities. This will produce health benefits, since this
powerful diagnostic technique will be made more widely available.
