This is a laboratory study involving experiments to understand changes in modes
of speech perception and language understanding as a function of aging. The
experiments compare the performance of adults across the lifespan in speech
perception faced with multiple sources of information. Young adults are compared
with middle-aged adults and elderly persons in their identification of samples
of speech composed of single or multiple sources of information. Their
performance will be used to test how aging influences the relative value of each
source of information about speech and the processing of each type of
information. There are three lines of inquiry. The first involves the
contribution of visible speech to speech perception. As acuity of hearing
diminishes, individuals may compensate by paying close attention to
configuration and movement of the lips. The second assesses the evaluation and
integration of a variety of bottom-up sources of information in speech
perception (audible and visible characteristics of speech). The third focuses on
top-down sources such as phonological, lexical, semantic, and semantic
constraints. Older adults have less information about some sources, but not
about others. The experiments will determine to what extent elderly individuals
have less information in communication and to what extent they process the
information they have more or less efficiently than young adults. These
measurements of how speech perception and language communication change with
aging are necessary before it can be determined how any deficits might be
compensated for in day-to-day communication.
