With the advent of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC), optically more
efficient light valves (compared to TNLC technology) for projection LCD displays
are now feasible, as polarizers are not needed for light modulation. The same
benefits cannot be achieved for direct-view displays as the diffuse backlight
cannot be modulated by scattering with the same efficiency as the highly
collimated beam used in projection displays. Dye has to be added to the PDLC
formulation in order to achieve an acceptable contrast. However, by adding the
dye to the PDLC formulation, the optical efficiency of such a display becomes
comparable to a standard TNLC display. In order to improve the optical
efficiency of direct-view displays, a new concept of micro-projection has been
conceived wherein each pixel becomes a miniaturized projector. This display
system can use a PDLC without a dye. Additional improvement is achieved by
almost full utilization of the available collimated light which can be steered
by a microlens array to pass by the opaque structures on the active matrix
substrate (AM circuitry) and color filter (black matrix). Significantly brighter
direct-view displays with a contrast ratio of 100:1 should be achievable.
