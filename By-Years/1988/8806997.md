The Alexandria Archaeology Center holds over 2 million archaeological artifacts
from over 112 excavations. These irreplaceable systematic collections are
invaluable for urban archaeological research because they offer a unique
opportunity to compare and contrast archaeological materials from various
community contexts. In order to insure the collections' safety and its use in
future research projects, the staff will install high-density shelving, conduct
a conservation and environmental assessment survey, and complete a collections
inventory. This work will provide a stable environment for the collections,
eliminate overcrowding, and ensure the long-term care and conservation of the
collections.
