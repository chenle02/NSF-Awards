Biological Sciences (61) Advances in imaging technology have made the light
microscope one of the most powerful tools of this century to study cell
function. We are no longer limited to descriptive studies of dead specimens; we
can image live cells carrying out the fundamental processes required for life.
The objective of this project is to incorporate modern light microscopic
techniques, including fluorescence imaging, into laboratory exercises designed
for an undergraduate cell biology course. The microscopes are equipped with
video cameras and computers for students to record their results in a digital
format. This cell biology course has a highly interactive computer-based
component. For all laboratory exercises, pairs of students perform variations of
a central experimental theme and post their results on a course web page. The
web site not only provides an interactive forum for students to discuss and
evaluate a variety of data, but also serves as a resource for faculty at other
colleges and universities who would like to incorporate this advanced imaging
technology into their courses. This course provides an excellent testing ground
for these lab exercises, and those which prove amenable to larger enrollment
courses are being adapted for more general cell biology courses. The project is
an adaptation of similar programs at Kent State University, Texas A&M
University, Davidson College and Haverford College.
