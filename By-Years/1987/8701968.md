Research will be carried out to find syntheses for and to study the properties
of materials that provide a helical conduction path for electrons. No such
material was known until this program yielded the first, an optically active
helical metallocene oligomer consisting of as many as 36 hydrocarbon rings and
three metal atoms, under NSF grant DMR-8213794. Ideas are presented for
constructing such materials in a number of different ways. These include plans
for capping conjugated helical hydrocarbons with groups that attract one another
and allow electrons to pass between them. (Tetracyanoquino-dimethanes are the
best known examples.) Others would terminate the helices with carbonyl groups
and then bond them either by interactions with aromatic amines or with metal
ions. Still others elaborate the scheme used to prepare the first helical
metallocene. After oxidation or reduction, electrons should be able to
delocalize throughout, allowing the materials to conduct electricity. The
spiralling motion of their electrons should make the structures molecular
solenoids, examples of which are unknown. Their optical, magnetic, and
conductive properties should be unique.
