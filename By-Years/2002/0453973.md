Abstract: This award provides renewed funding for an REU Site at the Marine
Environmental Science Consortium, which is located on Dauphin Island, AL. The
site will support seven students during a twelve-week summer program each year.
Research themes will focus on marine biology, biogeochemistry of coastal and
nearshore systems of the Gulf of Mexico. The program includes a multi-day
orientation session, field trips, scientific seminars, mini-workshops and panels
on subjects such as ethics in science, scientific writing, careers, graduate
school options, and presentation of scientific results. Students are also
encouraged to participate in field-work with their faculty mentor and in
extended research cruises when the option is available. They are required to
present results of their research at a mini-conference at the end of the summer
and are encouraged to attend scientific conferences and submit a paper for
publication following the REU experience.
