Many of the major NMR-active nuclei of the elements abundant in biology are
quadrupolar. A fundamental problem in interpreting the NMR spectra of these
nuclei from tissue is that usually a portion of the signal is not detected in
routine single quantum spectral acquisitions; this is the so-called "NMR-
invisibility". Dr. Springer plans to use some modern 2D NMR spectral technique
to attack this problem. This application of 2D NMR techniques to such high-spin
nuclei is new. A number of preliminary experiments have been conducted on model
systems and tissue samples and the results are encouraging. The preliminary
experiments presented in this proposal describe the NMR behavior of the
quadrupolar ions in different model systems, and suggest that the techniques
being developed will have broad applicability for the study of biological
systems.***
