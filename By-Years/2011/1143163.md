This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to
demonstrate technical feasibility of producing low-cost, high-quality and large-
area graphene films. The approach is to grow uniform graphene films over
continuous tapes of electropolished catalytic copper foil in a roll-to-roll
process. This project is expected to address critical challenges that limit
industrial manufacture of graphene films including, (1) the need for high vacuum
and high temperature, resulting in high cost; and (2) the limitation of graphene
film size by the furnace dimension.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide
high-quality wafer-scale graphene material in industrial quantities. The
technology will have advantages of cost, quality, and design flexibility over
competing concepts. Large-area graphene films can be used for industrial
applications including flexible, transparent electrode, Radio-Frequency
electronics, Field-Effect-Transistor-based chemical sensors, near infrared
detectors, as well as academic applications such as novel sample supports for
ultra-high resolution transmission electron microscopy.
