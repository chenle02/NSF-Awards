Software failures in server applications are a significant problem for
preserving system availability. In the absence of perfect software, this
research focuses on tolerating and recovering from errors by exploiting software
elasticity: the ability of regular code to recover from certain failures when
low-level faults are masked by the operating system or appropriate
instrumentation. Software elasticity is exploited by introducing rescue points,
locations in application code for handling programmer-anticipated failures,
which are automatically repurposed and tested for safely enabling fault recovery
from a larger class of unanticipated faults. Rescue points recover software from
unknown faults while maintaining system integrity and availability by mimicking
system behavior under known error conditions. They are identified using fuzzing,
created using a checkpoint-restart mechanism, and tested then injected into
production code using binary patching. This approach masks failures to permit
continued program execution while minimizing undesirable side-effects, enabling
application recovery and software self-healing.
