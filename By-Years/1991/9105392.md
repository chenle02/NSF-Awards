Nodulin genes are plant genes which are specifically induced during the
formation of nitrogen-fixing root- stem nodules on leguminous plants. Early
nodulin (Enod) genes are expressed within 10 days after inoculation and play a
role in the rhizobial infection process and nodule ontogeny. Enod genes are not
only symbiotically induced and developmentally controlled, but are also
expressed in a tissue specific manner. The Enod2 gene is symbiotically activated
in the nodule parenchyma cells and encodes a hydroxyproline rich protein, which
probably is targeted to the plant cell wall, where it may be involved in
creating an oxygen diffusion barrier. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate
the signal transduction pathway involved in the expression of the Enod2 gene
from the tropical stem-nodulated legume, Sesbania rostrata (SrEnod2). The
SrEnod2 gene can be induced rapidly and specifically by physiologically
significant concentrations of cytokinins. This gene is therefore not only an
ideal candidate to study nodule-specific plant gene expression, but also serves
as a unique model to study plant gene induction be cytokinin. The ability to
manipulate the bacterial "inducer" offers a powerful experimental approach to
study the process of plant cell division and differentiation.
