This program focuses on the investigation of low-energy atomic interaction
phenomena and their role in coherent matter wave optics. Emphasis is placed on
ground-state resonance and threshold phenomena, ultracold atom-dimer
interactions, and interactions involving multiple atomic species. A new method
to irreversibly produce translationally ultracold, trapped rubidium dimers in
very high bound states will also be explored, and the connection between Bose
condensates and atomic optics will be studied.
