Research is proposed unifying denotational semantics of programming languages
with a branch of abstract model theory devoted to the study of absolute logics.
Specific topics include: The construction of absolute versions of denotational
semantics of Prolog- and Lisp- like programming languages Hoare-style inference
systems, the comparative study of program verification methods, domain theory
for absolute denotational semantics the verifying power of the "n times"
temporal logics. One of the main impacts of the proposed research is the ability
to characterize the absolute and relative program verifying power and price
(expressed in the strength of the needed theorem prover subprogram) of program
verification methods for Prolog- and Lisp- like programming languages as well as
the construction of new program verification methods.
