Funding is being provided to facilitate participant travel to the American
Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics, 66th Annual DFD Meeting 2013 in
Pittsburg, PA, November 24-26, 2013. This is the largest international annual
meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 2,500 anticipated attendees. The
meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years. The priorities of the
travel grant program are to partially fund students, young scientists, and, in
general, scientists from under-represented groups. The APS DFD Executive
Committee plans to contribute $15,000 and the American Institute for Physics
plans to contribute $10,000 to the overall budget for travel awards. This total
amount expected is $45,000 to facilitate travel subsidies and registration fee
coverage for about 65 participants. The chief intellectual merit of this
conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting
edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually
every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase
participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able
to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Preference is
given: (i) to those presenting talks at the meeting, (ii) to students, (iii) to
those who have not received such an award in the past, and (iv) to no more than
one applicant from a given research adviser. Since the awards are meant to
supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee
takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort
is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in
engineering, including women and members of minority groups.
