Since its introduction in the early 1980's, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has
grown to become an essential tool for high resolution separations of biological
macromolecules. Continuing method development has extended applications to a
wide variety of charged and neutral compounds of all sizes. To be prepared for
future employment and advanced schooling, students should have more than
textbook knowledge of this instrumental method. To provide this experience,
experiments that involve use of a CE system are being developed for three upper-
level chemistry laboratories. Students in instrumental analysis are analyzing a
commercial cold/sinus remedy using both reversed-phase liquid chromatography and
capillary electrophoresis. They are observing the differences in the two
separation methods and the importance of eluent character and pH. Students in
the standard physical chemistry laboratory are measuring several physical
parameters fundamental to the electrophoresis process. A new physical chemistry
laboratory, emphasizing the properties of biological and synthetic
macromolecules is being offered as an alternate to the standard course. Students
who choose that option use CE to follow the kinetics of an enzyme-catalyzed
reaction.
