9421238 Astrow During the development of the neuromuscular system, the processes
of nerve cells initially make numerous contacts (synapses) with muscle cells,
many of which are later eliminated. The mechanisms that underlie this
elimination of exuberant contacts are largely unknown. This research will use a
novel model system to determine whether this elimination is caused by changes in
the nerve cells, in the muscle cells, or whether changes in both elements
contribute to synaptic remodelling. The elimination of redundant synapses is a
process that is an important part of development both in the neuromuscular
system and in the central nervous system. The definition of the factors that
control this process will address a question of fundamental importance in
Developmental Neuroscience.
