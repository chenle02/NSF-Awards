The researchers propose projects that use experimental or quasi-experimental
methods to study discrimination. In prior work, they sent out resumes in
response to help-wanted ads and experimentally varied name (distinctively
African-American or White) and skills to measure discrimination. The first
project expands on this study and uses a much larger set of African-American,
Hispanic and White names that are matched by parental education. It tests
whether discrimination persists even when holding constant the social background
implied by the name. The second project refines this methodology by exploiting
the fact that resumes in India tend to include standardized test scores. This
allows a more careful examination of how caste or religion affects employers'
interpretation of skills. Caste is also often explicitly stated on the resume so
the order of caste revelation can be experimentally manipulated (early or late
in the resume), allowing a test of whether order affects the extent of
discrimination and the interpretation of skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other
three projects investigate how well various remedies for discrimination work in
practice. One studies the affirmative action system in Indian colleges, where
caste-specific test score thresholds determine admission. Because students
barely above and below the thresholds are effectively randomly assigned college
admission, a regression discontinuity design can be used to estimate the returns
to schooling for all castes and measure the program's private benefits and
costs. Outcomes for younger siblings of threshold students provide a way to also
measure role-model effects. Another project examines whether contact reduces
discrimination. It focuses on an MIT program where volunteers tutor poorer high
school students over several months. Importantly, volunteers are randomly
assigned to students, meaning that some tutors have intense contact with African
Americans while others do not. The goal is to survey past tutors and measure
their explicit race attitudes and implicit discrimination level. The final
project draws on the de-biasing literature in psychology to understand whether
different decision making rules can affect the extent of discrimination. It
builds on a relationship with a bank in South Africa that wants to
experimentally manipulate how its branch managers make loan decisions. The goal
is to measure changes in who gets loans and in the profitability of these loans.
