In May, 2007 there will be an one week conference at Columbia University in
response to recent breakthroughs in several areas of number theory, automorphic
representation, and arithemetic geometry. The conference will focus on the
following major themes and their interconnections: 1) Subconvexity bound and
multiple Dirichlet L-series; 2) Langlands program and Sato-Tate conjecture; 3)
Special cycles on Shimura varieties and Gross-Zagier formula.

The participants of the conference involve not only leading experts in these
fields, but also junior researchers and graduate students. It will be an ideal
catalyst for cross-fertilization between areas of analytic number theory,
automorphic representation, and arithmetic algebraic geometry. Postdocs and
graduate students will benefit greatly in talking to, exchange ideas with
experts and learning about the recent results on major problems.
