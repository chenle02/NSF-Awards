&lt;br/&gt;Chong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Synchroscalar,
Exploiting Synchronized Clock Domains for Energy&lt;br/&gt;Efficient Multirate
Embedded Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ubiquitous
computation and communication devices will dominate the social and economic
landscape of the new millennium. As the functionality of these devices evolve,
current microprocessor designs cannot keep up with the battery life and the
performance requirements. We propose to address this problem with a novel
microprocessor design that uses a combination of two approaches. First, we break
the work into many parallel pieces to increase performance. Second, to save
power, we run each piece at the minimal speed necessary to achieve the quality
of communication desired. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we propose the
Synchroscalar architecture, a two-dimensional mesh of processing tiles in which
each column forms a separate clock and voltage domain. Clock frequencies are
related by a rational factor, which will be exploited to schedule data transfers
between different clock domains without incurring the overhead of asynchronous
communication between clock boundaries, yet retaining the benefits of optimal
clocking for each column. This organization gives us the many of the energy
advantages of asynchronous systems while maintaining the simplicity of a
synchronous system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of these approaches will
significantly increase the impact of information technology on the nation,
enabling many "wired" applications to become wireless and
mobile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
