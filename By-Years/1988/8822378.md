A key factor in the generation of quality compilers is creation of the primary
data structures that a compiler and run-time machine use: the symbol table and
primary storage, respectively. Earlier research on single-threading and stack
single-threading properties of lambda- calculus expressions shows how to detect,
extract, and implement these data structures. A major portion of this research
will be the integration of the single-threading techniques into a working
compiler synthesis system. The role of data flow analysis algorithms in
improvement of static semantics processing and target code generation in
synthesized compilers will be investigated. In particular, flow analysis of a
language's definition should yield information that directs transformation of
the definition's semantic algebras into more efficient representations.
