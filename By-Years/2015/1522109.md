This travel award will enable US scientists and engineers (including two
graduate students) from the Biochemical Technology Division (BIOT) of the
American Chemical Society (ACS) to participate in the 3rd European Congress of
Applied Biotechnology (ECAB3). ECAB3 will be held in conjunction with the 10th
European Congress of Chemical Engineering (ECCE10) in Nice, France from
September 27 - Oct 1, 2015. ECAB3/ECCE10 will also be held in conjunction with
the 5th European Process Intensification Conference (EPIC5). The global theme
for the conference is "Chemical and biochemical engineering for a new
sustainable process industry in Europe".

A goal for ECAB3 is to have BIOT partner with the European Section of
Biochemical Engineering Science to provide an integrated program featuring US
and European speakers in three important technical areas: Downstream Processing,
Biopharmaceutical Production and Biocatalysis/Biotransformation. An additional
goal is to create a student program that involves European students as well as
US students. The cross-cultivation of scientific ideas from US to Europe will
form a basis for dialogue and potential collaboration to expedite the
advancement of biotechnology processes and products.
