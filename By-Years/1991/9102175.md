Lavas exposed by the Blanco Trough provide an opportunity to constrain the
dynamic nature of magmatic systems beneath mid-ocean ridge propagating rifts.
This project will complete trace element analyses of a suite of lavas collected
from the Blanco Trough during cruises in 1987 and 1989. In addition, the
principal investigator will participate on a 30-day French Nautile dive program
in the Blanco Trough. Petrologic data from these lavas will be used to model the
melting and crystalization history that has occurred at the spreading center
during different stages in the evolution of the magmatic systems associated with
a propagating rift.
