With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science
Foundation, Dr. Sally Hoskins will continue her innovative work on the molecular
mechanisms regulating neuronal differentiation. She will focus her research on
two aspects of the development of the nervous system: the initial
differentiation of neurons during embryogenesis, and the formation of
connections between neurons at later developmental stages. Dr. Hoskins will
capitalize on her striking finding that thyroid hormones can induce the
development of a new and specific axonal projection of the retinotectal system.
Using powerful molecular techniques. She will isolate hormone-activated genes
related to axonal pathfinding and 2) the thyroid hormone receptor. These data
will help elucidate the mechanism(s) which ensure that neurons connect properly
with appropriate targets, a profoundly important yet little-understood aspect of
neuronal development.
