This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program will use
computational methods to carry out large scale electronic structure calculations
in order to quantify the effects of relativity on molecular structure.
Properties such as defects and vacancies in large clusters of metal atoms, as
well as the mechanism of chemisorption, will be studied. This will enhance our
basic knowledge of heterogeneous catalysis. Dr. Ermler is well known for his
expertise in the development of methods to incorporate relativistic effects into
electronic structure studies. The Stevens Institute of Technology is a leader in
the application of computers to scientific investigations. This grant is for
supercomputer time at NSF-supported supercomputer centers.
