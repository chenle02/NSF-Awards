This award will support a program whose aim is to enable geoscientists to make
full use of the next generation synchrotron radiation source currently being
constructed at Argonne National Laboratory. The extremely great brightness, the
high energies, and the large energy range of synchrotron radiation make it
possible to study and analyze the chemistry, structure, and phase relations of
materials, many of which could not be analyzed precisely before synchrotron
radiation techniques became available. Geoscientists want to be able to quickly
seize upon research opportunities that will exist when the synchrotron radiation
source at the Argonne Laboratory becomes operational. This award will be used to
fund continued planning activities required for detailed design and development
of beamlines and experimental stations to be used by earth scientists at the
Argonne National Laboratory. The award will also support a hands-on workshop to
train a new generation of earth science investigators in synchrotron radiation
techniques.
