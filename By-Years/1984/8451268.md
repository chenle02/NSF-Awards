In this research effort, attention is focused on individual structures in the
auditory system using the techniques of signal processing to identify possible
mechanisms of the characteristics of sound production. Emphasis is on the
application of artificial intelligence to speech recognition, the investigation
of single-unit neural responses in the auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus, and
on the area of VLSI circuit architecture for signal processing of real-time
speech recognition systems.
