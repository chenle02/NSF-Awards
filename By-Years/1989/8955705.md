The University of Montana will initiate a three-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in field sciences for 20 students in the 12th grade. This
project provides a program focused on stimulating the interest of promising high
school students in careers in field biology, field geology, and computer
science. The program features 11 field courses, 30 hours of computer science
instruction, lectures and discussions on research methodology and ethics in
science, as well as career counseling by University of Montana faculty members
and staff. A key objective of the program is to establish significant mentor
relationships between students and program faculty, which will last well beyond
the residential summer session. The integration of computer technology in field
research is a special feature of the program.
