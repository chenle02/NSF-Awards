9317996 Salamon The New York Academy of Medicine has a longstanding mission to
improve the health of the public by acting on broad medical issues ranging from
basic biomedical research, through those issues bearing on clinical
investigation, clinical medicine, health care delivery, public health activities
and health policy matters. The Academy devotes special attention to defining and
working toward solutions of urban health problems. In order to continue to
develop useful and important new programs, the Academy must be able to provide
its research and education community with access to communications and
information resources. Therefore, The New York Academy of Medicine requests
$30,000 for a two-year grant to establish a connection to the NSFNET. This
connection will integrate the Academy's LAN into the NSFNET, and thereby provide
access for all of the Academy's researchers, program developers and staff. In
addition, The New York Academy of Medicine Library, a research library of
national importance, would make its catalog holdings and staff expertise
accessible through the Internet. The Academy Library serves as a Regional
Medical Library in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. In this role,
the Academy would use the NSFNET connection to further its training and
information retrieval services to 900 health science libraries in the region
covering New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The connection would
also make possible a project enabling ten health science libraries in the region
to obtain Internet access via LIFENET. ***
