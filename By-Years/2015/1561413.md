Scientific evidence is a critical consideration in the process of creating
regulatory policies and laws that promote technological innovation while
protecting against unintended adverse consequences. The proposed conference will
convene researchers from the social sciences, business and legal worlds, and
government regulators to identify how scientific evidence can and should support
government regulation and policymaking. The workshop will chart a research
course that facilitates science based regulatory approaches to scientific
innovation, respecting the importance of differing values within a pluralistic
democratic society.

The one-day workshop focuses on the technical domains of nanoscale materials
innovation and commercialization; innovation in healthcare, and; environmental
regulation for both ecosystem integrity and human health. Topics considered
include the regulation of emerging technologies; identifying authoritative
science for policy and regulatory decisions, and; identifying the appropriate
loci of regulatory enforcement in multi-level governance systems. The excepted
outcome is to stimulate joint research in regulatory science and to coordinate
efforts of scholars in diverse disciplines with practitioners and policymakers
across the United States.
