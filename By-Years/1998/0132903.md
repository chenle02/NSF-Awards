Pratt&lt;br/&gt;0132903&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-layer dynamics of sill flows
will be studied with analytic and numerical techniques. Particular issues to be
addressed include the nature of hydraulic transitions and upstream influence,
effects of separation of the interface from side-walls, transport relationships,
special features such as hydraulic jumps and recirculations, and procedures for
assessing flow criticality. Interest will be focused more on the inflow and
throughflow regions, rather than on the effluent plume that sinks at the
outflow. &lt;br/&gt;
