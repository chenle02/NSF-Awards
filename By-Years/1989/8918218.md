In this project development workshop in robot intelligence in manufacturing
between Harold Liebowitz, George Washington University, and V. Milacic,
University of Belgrade, the participants will review topics in robotics research
with the twin objectives of developing cooperative research projects between the
U.S. and Yugoslavia and identifying research gaps in the field. The workshop's
agenda includes "current" topics such as cognitive and neural structure of
robotic intelligence, autonomous and distributed robotic systems, intelligent
sensor systems, robots for non-structured assembly tasks, telerobotics, computer
hardware and software for robotized manufacturing systems, and multi-hand,
multi-effector robotic structures. Workshop participation is balanced. U.S. and
Yugoslav research interests and expertise are complementary and the university
and industrial communities in both countries are well-represented. This project
was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and will be jointly support by NSF, under the SDC and ENG programs,
and the U.S.-Yugoslavia Joint Fund, which consists of matching funds from both
governments. The U.S. contribution to the Joint Fund is provided annually by the
Department of State.
