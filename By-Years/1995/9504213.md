9504213 COHN, JOSHUA This a high-vacuum, pulsed lase deposition (PLD) apparatus
will be used in the development of a vigorous basic research program
investigating the transport and magnetic properties of perovskite-like films
displaying giant magnetoresistance. The study of spin wave dispersion in
magnetic oxides will be carried out using layered structures composed of
magnetic and superconducting oxide films. This award also supports the
acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer for ex situ structural characterization
of specimens. The use of the pulsed laser for patterning microstructures in
discussed as a promising means of developing a complete materials engineering
facility. The proposed research involves materials physics issues with direct
bearing on potential applications in magnetic information storage and microwave
technologies. Physical properties investigations will included measurements of
transport and tunneling phenomena, magnetic susceptibility, ferromagnetic
resonance and microwave transmission. This instrumentation will enable us to
meet our educational goals of training Ph.D. candidates and undergraduate
students in frontier areas of research involving advanced materials, their
characterization, and processing. The knowledge and skills developed through use
of the instrumentation will enhance their prospects in tomorrow's technological
marketplace.
