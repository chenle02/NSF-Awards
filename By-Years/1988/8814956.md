The two most common features of stars are red dwarf characteristics and multiple
formation. The luminosity function of stars is known to drop off substantially
in the range below one-quarter solar mass. In addition, the frequency of binary
stars diminishes in this mass bracket. Thus, data on the abundances,
luminosities, and masses of these stars are difficult to obtain, and not as
plentiful or as accurate as desired. The 61 centimeter refractor telescope at
the observatory at Swarthmore College, under the directorship of Dr. Wulff
Heintz, is devoted to the study of the distances of dwarf stars and binary stars
and the determination of the orbits of binary stars. These data result in more
accurate estimates of the luminosities and masses of these stars. In the past
Dr. Heintz has relied on traditional instrumentation and techniques for these
measurements. With this grant, Dr. Heintz will begin the transition to modern
methods and state of the art instruments, which should provide more reliable and
more accurate data. This award is made under the auspices of the Research at
Undergraduate Institutions program at the National Science Foundation.
