This project focuses on the production of cold atoms of antihydrogen and the
ultimate high-precision spectroscopy measurement of the 1S-2S transition
frequency. The experiments utilize a nested Penning trap in which cold positrons
and antiprotons can be allowed to combine, and the resulting atoms of hydrogen
then trapped within the same magnetic structure, where they can be
spectroscopically analyzed. The experiments will be performed at the Antiproton
Decelerator (AD) facility at CERN as part of an international collaboration that
will involve research groups from Harvard University and NIST in the United
States, from the Max Planck Institut fur Quantenoptik, the Institut fur
Kernphysik, and the University of Bonn in Germany, and from the University of
Amsterdam in Holland. Funding for the AD construction is provided through a
Japanese contribution and through CERN. It is expected that the technical
difficulties associated with the experiment will prompt the development of new
tools and techniques that can find utilization in a number of areas in physics
and chemistry, and partial support is provided by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) in the Directorate for Mathematical and
Physical Sciences.
