Fundamental thermodynamic properties such as gas solubility are measured at
pressures up to 1000 psia for both components in several gas/polymer binary
mixtures. The systems to be studied are either important in engineering
applications or have been chosen for their specific physical properties to
determine the effects of size and polarity on polymer-penetrant interactions.
Typical systems may include carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, nitrogen,
polycarbonate, polysulfone, and silicone rubber. Direct determination of both
gas uptake and volume dilation of a penetrant-laden polymer sample are performed
using equipment previouly developed. The equipment allows actual measurement of
changes in film sample dimensions in all three coordinate directions as a
function of gas pressure. A video-assisted micrometry system is used to measure
the changes in the film thickness, while a precision cathetometer system
provides the measurements of the length and width dimensional changes.
