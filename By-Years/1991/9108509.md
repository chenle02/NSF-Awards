This is an award to support exploratory research on an innovative method of
designing a fixed-bed adsorption column for removing organic pollutants from
aqueous solution. Conventional engineering design results in placement of the
adsorbing media in a cylindrical configuration. In this research, the
investigator plans to experimentally evaluate the alternative of placing the
adsorbent (activated carbon) in a conical, tapered-bed configuration as an
alternative to batch reactors, continuous-flow stirred tank reactors and columns
of fixed, fluidized or moving beds. This proposal was submitted under conditions
listed in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory (SGER). It addresses the
problem resulting when organic pollutants are present in surface and
groundwaters or are produced during the treatment process for polluted waters
and must be removed to bring the water to acceptable standards for commercial,
industrial and domestic use. Results are expected to improve the process by
which engineers approach the design of adsorption processes in treatment of
water and wastewater.
