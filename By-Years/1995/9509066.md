This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project aims to create a
(Praseodymium Yttrium Lithium Flouride (Pr:YLF) laser with the characteristics
that make a breadboard extended pulse separation holographic interferometry
(E.P.S.H.I.) prototype camera field operational. The characteristics of the
laser could be 10 pulses per second, 100 millijoules per pulse, and a coherence
length of 30 cm to many meters. Laboratory testing on suitable test objects will
also be undertaken to further characterize the excitation and pulse separation
requirements for successful interferometric testing of large structures. A novel
method for pumping Pr:YLF will also be developed and evaluated. Phase I of this
project proved that Pr:YLF has unique capabilities for pulsed laser holography.
Significant industrial applications in the area of nondestructive testing of
bridges, nuclear power plant components storage tanks, and off-shore oil
platforms can become possible with an E.P.S.H.I camera.
