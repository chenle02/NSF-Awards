The proposal is funded to reconstruct SSTs from ODP Hole 1002C in the Cariaco
Basin Which has already yielded a number of important insights into climate
variability because of =its location and the very high sedimentationrates and
periodic lack of bioturbation. The PI will extend the present SST (alkenone
based) which is now 0-24 ka to orbital time scale back to 450 kyrs ujsing
primarily Mg/Ca SST proxies in the planktonic foraminifer G. rubber.
