AST-0407138&lt;br/&gt;Charlton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore
the evolution of galaxies during the intermediate epoch of the history of the
universe, an important time when star formation is near its peak level and
significant evolution in the ionizing radiation field is happening. The probe of
this era is quasar absorption lines, which provide detailed information about
kinematics, chemical content, and ionization conditions of the multiple phases
of gas in and around galaxies. Much of the data and all of the tools are already
in hand, so that analysis will begin immediately. Themes of this study include
the evolution of galaxy coronae, of the high velocity cloud population, of the
interstellar medium of galaxies, and of absorption produced by superwinds. Over
half of the systems to be studied are small single-cloud, weak absorbers, a
rather mysterious but abundant population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
will continue to involve students, including as authors on resultant
publications (a significant prior strength of this team). This project also
supports continued ambitious astronomy outreach at Pennsylvania State
University. Reaching over 10,000 K-12 students, adults and educators each year,
these activities culminate in the Astrofest, a four-night summer festival of
astronomy conceived by undergraduates and sustained by more than 50 faculty and
student volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;
