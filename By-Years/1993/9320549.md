9320549 Cleary Studies of the cellular basis of learning and memory support the
idea that learning involves changes in the properties of individual neurons in
the brain. There is already evidence that learning involves dynamic changes in
the strength of the connections between nerve cells but it is thought that the
structural connectivity between neurons remains stable. This proposal addresses
a very important question - the relationship between changes in the cell's
physiological properties and changes in the structure of the cells. This will be
examined in sensory neurons of the marine mollusc Aplysia. These neurons are
involved in the changes that occur when the snail learns not to respond to a
noxious stimulus that is given over and over with little consequence, much in
the same way that a human jumps in response to a loud noise but learns not to
jump when that same sound is heard again and again. The experiments look at the
structural changes in the neurons that occur with learning and how these
structural changes are affected by chemicals that are known to interrupt the
changes that occur in these neurons with learning. The results of this study
will help us to understand the way that the cells in the brain change during
learning and memory.
