The high level of coordination shown by social insect colonies is of both
economic and theoretical interest: The social events in honey bee colonies
underlie bees' usefulness as pollinators and honey producers, and our ability to
manage them successfully. At the same time, this coordination presents a special
puzzle to evolutionary theory, since intra-colony conflict is expected in some
circumstances. Genetic differences between individuals in colonies mean that any
particular way of dividing the colony's resources among the reproductives will
produce different genetic payoffs for different individuals, leading to
conflicting interests between them. This study examines the production of swarms
by honey bee colonies, with particular attention to the piping behavior of queen
bees, a phenomenon long observed but never adequately explained. The study tests
a hypothesis that worker bees, by manipulating the options available, redirect
the interests of newly-reared queen bees into alignment with the workers' own
interests. This turns a situation of conflicting benefits to different
individuals into one of common, though lesser, benefits. The study tests the
role of queen piping as communication of the factors that direct this
realignment of interests. The research will contribute to a general theory of
social behavior by testing how selection at the level of individuals can lead to
traits at the level of groups, and how the barriers to evolution of highly
cooperative behavior may be crossed. It will increase our understanding of honey
bee reproductive behavior, which forms the basis for genetic management of bees.
