This dissertation research project will support a student's field research in
Madagascar for a period of a year on how primitive agriculturalists change their
physical environment, which is a rain forest. The student will work with local
experts to study the farming and marketing activities of two communities to
understand the reasons for the farmers' decisions which impact the rain forest
environment. Methods will include participant- observation, interviewing, and
formal surveys. A computerized spatial database is being used to relate the
motive forces of farmers to place-specific, documented environmental changes.
This research is important because the degradation of the rain forest
environment is one of the most significant ecological facts of life in the
modern world, with implications for societies far removed from the specific
forest locations. Any increase in our understanding of how and why the forests
are destroyed, and how humans interact with the changing forest, can help us
control this destruction in the future.
