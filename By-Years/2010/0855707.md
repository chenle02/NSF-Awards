&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sequential game is a mathematical model of the
interaction of multiple self-interested players in dynamic stochastic
environments with limited information. The long-term goal of this research
project is to design and implement specialized algorithmic tools for the
computation of the main solution concept for these games, namely Nash
equilibria. The initial phase of the project will concentrate on two-person
zero-sum sequential games. The Nash equilibria formulation for this special
class of sequential games can be stated as a highly structured saddle-point
problem and is amenable to modern smoothing and interior-point techniques for
convex optimization. Advanced phases of the project will tackle the more
challenging problems of computing equilibria for games with more than two
players as well as refinements of Nash equilibria such as sequential, perfect
and quasi-perfect equilibria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithmic advances of
this research project have immediate application in the design of automatic game
players, which is a topic of major interest in artificial intelligence. At a
more fundamental level, the availability of algorithmic technology for
equilibria computation will provide new tools for rational decision making in
complex dynamic environments such as those encountered in financial markets,
multi-user computing networks, political negotiations, and military operations.
