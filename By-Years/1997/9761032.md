*** 9761032 Haynes This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
detail a method to fabricate structurally strong materials where the stiffness
of the material can be varied electrically. If this innovative new type of
material is used to build structures, then changing the stiffness of the
material changes the vibrational characteristics of the structures. By
continually changing the stiffness of key structural components, vibrations will
never be able to build up at any resonance frequency because the resonance
frequencies will continually change. Current active damping systems use
actuators and advanced control theory to actively interfere with vibrations. A
fundamental problem with these systems is that they can add energy to the
system, and can go unstable. They are based on some level of prediction of the
noise characteristics and/or a model of the structure being controlled, and can
increase instead of decrease vibrations when the predictions or models do not
correctly represent the current situation. In this approach, the fundamental
advantage is that energy cannot be added to the system, and thus it cannot go
unstable. In addition there are practical advantages of requiring no actuators
and requiring far less power than conventional systems. A technology to minimize
vibrations would have commercial value in aircraft, cars, space structures, and
high precision manufacturing equipment such as machine tools or lithography
machines. An investor has been identified who is interested in funding an
application of this technology, if the research is successful, to scanning probe
microscopes where vibration precludes using these manometer resolution
instruments on the factory floor for in-process control. ***
