Increasingly, a robust cyberinfrastructure (CI) is the foundation for advanced
research opportunities. Investment in personnel resources is no less important,
and the role of cyberinfrastructure engineer (CIE) is a critical component in
ensuring a comprehensive approach to providing research support services and
advancing the research agenda. The addition of the CIE role at the Colorado
School of Mines is a key element in efforts to provide comprehensive support
services through an integrative approach to the Mines research community. The
CIE serves as partner, architect, integrator, and catalyst to advance efforts in
scientific inquiry. Positioning the CIE within the central IT organization
provides opportunities for strong collaboration and partnership between
operational units that implement and support the various components of CI and
faculty researchers. Direct engagement by the CIE in specific activities with
researchers, the library, and students through multiple approaches (such as
providing resources to manage data as an institutional asset) will have a
positive impact on scientific inquiry at Mines. This approach will facilitate
increased utilization of existing cyberinfrastructure as well as ensure a strong
focus on researcher needs when designing the next generation of CI. Impacts
include increased partnership between researchers and cyberinfrastructure
architects and implementers that advances scientific inquiry within the
institution and across the scientific community, as well as learning
opportunities for the next generation of STEM researchers. Additionally, by
sharing the experiences and successes of the inaugural CIE, Mines will
contribute at the regional and national level to the growing professional
community of cyberinfrastructure engineers.
