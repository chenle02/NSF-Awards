Intellectual Merit: Chloroplasts are the organelles within plant cells that are
responsible for the synthesis of organic molecules from the energy contained in
sunlight. This process of photosynthesis is the ultimate source of all food
available on the planet. In order for chloroplasts to function they must be able
to take up proteins needed for their biosynthesis and homeostasis from the
cytoplasm, and this requires the input of metabolic energy. The molecular
machinery responsible for the input of energy into the chloroplast protein
import process is the subject of this research. Specifically, the synergistic
interaction of two different molecular chaperones in powering chloroplast
protein import will be examined, both in isolation and in the chloroplast
itself. Elucidation of the details of this relationship is expected to inform
future choices for modifications designed to improve the energy use efficiency
of chloroplast biosynthesis and maintenance pathways.

Broader impact: During the course of this research a number of young scientists
will be trained in various disciplines of biological sciences. This will include
a senior researcher, a graduate student and numerous undergraduates. These are
the individuals who will be tasked with carrying forward biological research
into the coming decades, including designing strategies for feeding the ever
increasing world population. A number of the undergraduates will be drawn from
the UC-Davis Biology Undergraduates Scholars Program, which serves students from
economically depressed circumstances or underrepresented ethnic groups, thereby
leading to greater diversity in our future scientific leaders.
