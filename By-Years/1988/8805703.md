Molecular-beam mass spectrometry through the wafer surface is used for the
first time in plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), giving
identification and measurement of stable species, free radicals, and ions. The
PECVD reactor effectively resembles commercial reactors used to fabricate
microelectronic films, but it must be specially designed to accommodate this
unique instrumentation. Such measurements will identify and quantify key
reactive species, information that is critically needed to determine the
chemical mechanisms of PECVD. Currently, mechanisms are being developed from
sparse literature data and from theoretical predictions. Data from this
apparatus then will contribute to more accurate models. Initial systems of
interest are SiH4 plasmas depositing amorphous Si, and SiH4/O2 plasmas
depositing SiO2.
