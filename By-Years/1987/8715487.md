This research is concerned with the representation of finite groups and related
rings. Special emphasis will be placed on Clifford Theory, group-graded rings
and characters of solvable groups. This research is in the general area of group
theory. The project will focus on the representation of finite groups and
related rings. This is currently an active area of mathematics. The results will
be of interest to many people in the mathematical community.
