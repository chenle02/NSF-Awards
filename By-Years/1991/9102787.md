This award involves providing support from the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory's Center for Environmental Monitoring and Assessment to the U.S.
Antarctic Program (USAP) in the area of antarctic environmental measurements.
The amendment is necessary to: 1) fully implement NSF's Special 5-Year
Initiative for Antarctic Safety, Environment and Health (a critical part of
which is the development of baselines for a wide variety of antarctic
environmental parameters) and the conduct of projects for monitoring of
potential environmental contaminants near USAP's antarctic installations; 2)
assure that environmental measurements are reliable and repeatable, and provide
sound bases for environment-related actions undertaken by USAP managers and
decisionmakers; and 3) provide guidance on and conduct environmental
measurements to other performers involved in USAP's developing environmental
measurements, assessment, management, and protection programs; and, 4) provide
similar support to basic science researchers supported by the Division of Polar
Programs whose work includes measurement of antarctic environmental parameters.
The Program Manager recommends award for Fiscal Year 1991 funds of $225,000.
