An international symposium is to be partially supported. The topic is
"Nonlinear Stability of Non-Parallel Flow", the location is Clarkson University,
and the dates are July 26- 28, 1993. Support is also being provided for a
bilateral workshop immediately following the symposium, on the same topic, with
selected participants form the US and the FSU. The workshop objective is to
explore opportunities and mechanisms for cooperative research in this topic.
Non-linear stability of non-parallel flows is a specialty area in the transition
between laminar and turbulent flows, and because of its complexity it has not
receives attention commensurate to its importance in a broad range of
engineering applications involving turbulence.
