The IUCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) site at the University of
Washington (UW) proposes renewal for Phase II operation. CAFS and its sites
address the problems and opportunities facing forestry that bridge disciplinary
and regional boundaries, and require a broader and interdisciplinary approach
that is the hallmark of universities. The center and its sites approach research
questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular,
cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. The UW site will advance
research in Phase II consistent with member needs such as it has done in Phase I
in areas including 1) regional fertilization response of Douglas-fir, 2) growth
and yield of improved Douglas-fir stock, and 3) use remote sensing to describe
leaf area and root biomass of Douglas-fir plantations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forests are vital to global ecological, social, and
economic health. The research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of
forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple
temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend
traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. Student training
continues to be an important feature in Center research and technology transfer.
These students are unique in the forestry sciences because of their problem-
solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales.
Recruiting for students among under-represented groups will be conducted,
increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this
traditionally diversity-deficient discipline.
