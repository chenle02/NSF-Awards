Technology limitations, emerging applications, and changing usability trends are
ushering in a new era in multi-core computer systems. A key problem for both
application and microprocessor design is that applications are largely evolving
independently from the architectural development of microprocessors. This is a
problem for architectural research because developing efficient architectural
solutions requires realistic characterization of the next generation
applications. From a system design perspective, understanding application
behavior is crucial for building an efficient system, since they must be
optimized to exploit mechanisms provided in the architecture. This proposal
seeks to re-think next generation multi-core systems - both software and
hardware architectures using state-of-the-art quantitative design tools.

The two key ideas explored in this research are the following. First, is a
hybrid task-level/data-level parallelism execution model for emerging
applications that have abundant but not synchronization-free parallelism.
Second, is the development of new highly accurate and efficient quantitative
models to evaluate architecture and application design alternatives, at scale
and over a wide range of application workloads. The project seeks to provide a
suite of quantitative tools to close the development loop of design, evaluation
and analysis of software's behavior on hardware, allowing the tuning of both
software and hardware. This project takes real-time graphics as a challenge
application and derives a full system, called Copernicus, for future real-time
graphics that can provide significantly higher image qualities. The project will
also integrate these quantitative models in the curriculum and disseminate to
the research community.

The innovations proposed in this research have the potential for significantly
aiding microprocessor and application development for future systems. The
development of a full system specification for ray-tracing can trigger an
inflection in the evolution of both programmable processors and specialized
graphics processors.
