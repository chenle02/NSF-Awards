This project will support an observational survey to find lowest mass objects
formed in areas of recent star formation. A principal goal is to uncover the
initial mass function (IMF), which is the distribution of stellar/substellar
objects over mass. This will be done through analysis of optical and infrared
photometry from wide-field surveys and followup spectroscopy of candidate
substellar objects (brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects) identified in those
data.

The project is expected to (1) test theories of star formation, which make
different predictions for the minimum mass of the IMF and its dependence on
star-forming conditions; (2) constrain the possible mechanisms for the formation
of planetary-mass companions; and (3) enable estimates of the frequency of giant
planets that have been ejected from planetary systems based on microlensing
detections of free-floating Jupiter-mass bodies.
