Very little scientific research has been conducted on the nature of female
involvement in drug selling in the United States. And, the limited amount of
research conducted to date reveals striking inconsistencies regarding the nature
and extent of female drug selling. This study seeks to advance basic knowledge
about female drug selling, and address womens' roles within and between the
formal and informal labor markets operating in inner cities. Focusing on two,
inner city neighborhoods in New York City, the project explores the type of
organizations they participate in, what they earn from participation, the role
the drug economy plays with respect to individual and family resources, the
nature and extent of dealing-related violence and victimization, and how selling
fits into larger careers and lifestyles. To do this, the investigators conduct
qualitative interviews with 150 female drug dealers. Purposive sampling is used
to select and interview: 40 women who are active drug dealers in the community
and have little criminal justice system contact; 30 recently arrested female
drug dealers; 40 women in jail on drug convictions; and 40 women in state prison
for drug sales. The life histories generated from these interviews and their
contextualization in urban neighborhoods provide rich data on the adaptive
strategies used by some marginalized women to gain economic footholds, and
whether economic opportunities presented by drug selling are diverting women
from the formal labor market. As such, this study represents the first
systematic effort to explore the consequences of women's participation in drug
dealing for family economics and other aspects of family life. Equally
important, it provides an explanation of women's pathways into drug dealing
based on the combination of situational factors (e.g., involvement in other
crime networks) and structural factors (e.g., inner city labor market).
