One of the major recent advances in reconstructing past plate configurations was
the recognition that the Precordillera Terrane of Argentina was derived (rifted
from) the Ouachita embayment of present day North America, thus providing a rare
example of knowing exactly where an exotic terrane came from. However, the
timing of the rifting and the timing of the subsequent collision with Gondwana,
critical to Paleozoic reconstructions is problematic. Previously the timing of
the collision was thought to Middle to Late Ordovician based on when the
carbonate platform drowned, presumably by close approach and subduction of the
continental margin. However, more recent work suggests that the drowning of the
carbonate platform was due to rift-related subsidence, and if correct, dates the
rifting from North America, not the subsequent collision with Gondwana. This
project aims to date the collision by radiometric methods from rocks in the
exposed suture zone, including magmatic bodies that intruded during and after
the several phases or pulses of collision-related deformation. Results will
clarify the arrival time of the Precordillera, data that will be critical in
establishing a Paleozoic plate position history.
