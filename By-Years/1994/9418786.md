9418786 Dymond This project will analyze an existing suite of both sediment trap
and ocean bottom samples from the Ross Sea for barium and other refractory
elements (aluminum, sodium, vanadium, iron, thorium, and tin), and evaluate
barium as a proxy for biological productivity and carbon export to the seafloor
of the Ross Sea. These analyses bear directly on the question of how much and
how quickly anthropogenic carbon dioxide is distributed among the various global
carbon reservoirs. If the "new" atmospheric carbon is sequestered in non-
atmospheric reservoirs within a relatively brief period, then the expected
global warming will be reduced; however it is also possible that any global
warming enhances the flux of carbon (and other greenhouse gases) from non-
atmospheric reservoirs to the atmosphere, enhancing the expected global warming.
While little is currently known about the planetary response, it is thought that
oceanic processes, particularly changes in ocean fertility and interactions
between ocean fertility and circulation, are defining factors in these
questions. Time changes in the oceanic carbon reservoir are related to ocean
productivity, and must be inferred from proxy observations. The disadvantage of
the most widely used proxies -- organic carbon, calcium carbonate, and opal
(silicon dioxide) -- is that they cannot distinguish between variable
preservation rates and variable productivity rates. This project will link these
proxies with the flux of barium through the water column and in the sediment,
and constrain the extent of barium recycling with the refractory element data.
This analysis will additionally help define the strength and source of lateral
carbon input to the Ross Sea. Results from this study will be integrated with
other continuing studies to produce a better understanding of biogeochemical
cycling in the Ross Sea and in the Southern Ocean in general. ***
