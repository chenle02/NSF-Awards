0111403&lt;br/&gt;Feng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides three-years
partial salary support for an Phase I Ph.D. level technician to work for the
Watershed Studies Program at Dartmouth College. This program, a collaborative
effort between PIs Carl Renshaw and Xiahong Feng, emphasizes an
interdisciplinary approach to understanding the mechanisms of contaminant
transport through watersheds. The principal duties of the technician will be to
work with the PIs to oversee and manage the technical requirements of the
Watershed Studies analytical chemistry laboratories. Specific duties include:
the assembly and testing of new instruments for high resolution monitoring of
fluid and contaminant transport in heterogeneous media, including snow, soils,
and streambeds; assisting the PIs with a series of pilot studies of new methods
and ideas related to understanding fluid and contaminant transport through
heterogeneous media; assisting the PIs in related collaborations with
researchers outside of Dartmouth; and to oversee the operation, maintenance, and
student training for our analytical instruments including an ICP-OES, an IC, a
TOC analyzer, and isotopic extraction lines.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
