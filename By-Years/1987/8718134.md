Deployable - collapsible structures have many potential applications, ranging
from emergency shelters and facilities, through relocatable, semi-permanent
structures, to space-station components. A new concept of self-supported/self-
stabilizied "clicking" structures - featuring stable, stress-free states in both
deployed and collapsed forms - shows even higher promises. Basic research will
be conducted to establish sound design principles for these structures, which
includes modeling of the behavior during articulation. Engineering research
dealing with detailing, articulation mechanisms, effects of imperfections and
friction and using the developed modeling techniques is needed to make designs
work in the real word. Moderate scale structures will be built to test both the
modeling technique and the design engineering. The results of this project will
be proof of feasibility of large size "clicking" structures, and a set of
methodologies and tools for their design and detailing.
