Libgober 9503616 The proposed research lies in the interface of complex
differential geometry and algebraic geometry. The investigator poses a number of
problems on the phenomenon of mirror symmetry. This includes a study of the
hypergeometric differential equations that are satisfied by the periods of
families of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The mirror symmetry conjecture, first observed
by physicists, asserts that each Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a 'mirror' (also a
Calabi-Yau 3-fold) and that certain structures of a Calabi-Yau manifold are
tightly related to seemingly very different structures of its mirror manifold.
The phenomenon of mirror symmetry relates qualitatively different structures
arising in theoretical physics, geometry and algebra. The rough idea is that
there are structures in theoretical physics which are mirrored in structures in
pure mathematics. This entire phenomenon, verified in special cases, remains an
intriguing mathematical puzzle.
