This award provides partial support for participants for a conference which
will be convened at the Institute of Tropical Meteorology. The conference will
focus on the problems associated with the incorporation of satellite information
on three- dimensional moisture distribution into atmospheric analyses,
particularly in the tropical regions. Improvement of such analyses is important
for a variety of research and operational weather forecasting purposes and is
especially critical for the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)
objectives. NOAA, NASA, and ONR are also providing support for the conference in
separate awards.
