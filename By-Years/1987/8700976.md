During the last decade Riemannian geometry has undergone a revolution following
the introducton of new techniques from the theory of minimal surfaces. In recent
joint work with M.Micallef, the principal investigator has been at the forefront
of these developments. In this work they strengthened the Klingenberg- Berger
sphere theorem. This involved use of Morse theory for minimal two-spheres. John
Moore proposes to continue applying these innovative techniques to find further
relationships between curvature and topology for Riemannian manifolds. He will
also be studying submanifolds of low codimension in Euclidean space. The
proposed problems are both interesting and difficult. Not only would their
solution be of significance, but the development of these new techniques is of
great importance.
