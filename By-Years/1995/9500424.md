9500424 French Digital data acquisition and control equipment will be purchased
to replace the current system which is based on an early version Micro Vax II
computer (vintage 1986). Funds are being used to upgrade the servovalves on the
existing hydraulic actuators. Specific projects for which the equipment will be
used included: NSF Precast Seismic Structural systems (PRESSS) project regarding
the evaluation of ductile precast frame connections; NSF Faculty Award for Women
investigation of real-time large scale earthquake simulation tests (effective
force test method); NSF Research Initiation Award (RIA) to investigate the
nonlinear cyclic behavior of concrete-filled tube beam-columns; Minnesota
Department of Transportation (MnDOT) study of the effects of thermal and
mechanical cyclic loading on the bond between fiber reinforced plastic (FRP)
reinforcement and concrete; MnDOT investigation to characterize the material
properties of asphalt mixtures; and the development of an accelerated load test
platform for concrete pavement research.
