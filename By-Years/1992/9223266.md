This workshop will consider how two complex ecosystems function, in particular
how they fluctuate in response to change, and how interactions between these
systems vary over time as a result of such fluctuations in the individual
systems. The systems to be addressed will be (1) high-latitude forest/river
ecosystems and (2) coastal upwelling systems. Interactions between these systems
and arid zones will also be examined on a preliminary basis. The workshop will
focus on regions where these systems exist along the west coasts of North and
South America. Preliminary comparisons will also be made with analogous
ecosystems in the Southwest Pacific. The primary system functions to be analyzed
will be biodiversity and biogeochemistry. Special attention will be paid to
human impact on these functions, as well as on the overall ecosystems. The
results of the workshop will provide input to ongoing development of a
scientific agenda for the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research
(IAI).
