Abstract DMR-94 14268 This research will focus on the rapid and large-scale
formation of polymer-containing layered composites by exfoliation-adsorption and
colloid-emulsion reactions. Properties to be explored using techniques that
include electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and scanning tunneling
microscopy are those that are governed by the polymer functionality and
conformation which include the ionic conduction and thermal behavior of these
unique polymer-containing nanocomposites. %%% The development of new synthetic
methods to build the capability for designing materials with specific properties
is a high priority in materials research. This approach is aimed at
understanding processes that control nanoscale structures, designing and
synthesizing into materials novel properties or unusual combinations of
properties, and structural, thermal chemical, and electrical characterization.
