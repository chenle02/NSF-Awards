This project investigates three research topics in hyperbolic balance law with
dissipation. First, we plan to establish the large time behavior and the
stability of elementary waves for general physical dissipative systems,
including Euler equations with damping, Euler equations with relaxation, and
Euler-Poisson systems in one dimension. Previous results are available for the
small smooth solutions; the proposed research will concentrate on problems for
large solutions and strong waves. Second, we intend to establish BV theory for a
class of dissipative hyperbolic balance laws including damped p-system, p-system
with relaxation, and Euler-Poisson equations. Last, we will study the three
dimensional compressible Euler equations with damping with initial data near a
planar diffusive wave or on a bounded domain. The results of the research will
lead to a better understanding of the behavior of basic equations in nonlinear
hyperbolic PDEs.

The object of this research is to investigate several open problems for
dissipative hyperbolic balance laws. Hyperbolic balance laws are important
partial differential equations modeling the motion of fluids, gas, and waves.
The research will concentrate on problems for large solutions, strong waves, and
realistic models in multiple spatial dimensions. These situations often involve
complicated but interesting phenomena resulting from nonlinearity and resonance.
The results are expected to have application to dynamics of compressible fluids,
elastic material mechanics, traffic control systems, semi-conductor devices
modeling, porous medium flows, and geophysical dynamics. The proposed research
will be helpful in the design of effective numerical schemes for scientific
computation.
