9424339 Flynn We explore and control the magnetic behavior of rare-earth
nanostructures. These are synthesized from rare-earth metals as stacks of
sheets, tailored in thickness and content by molecular beam epitaxy. Bulk rare
earths exhibit a rich variety of unusal magnetic behavior, including unique
helimagnetism and large magnetostriction. The proposed research includes studies
of structure, magnetism, magnetic microstructure, and magnetotransport in these
novel materials configurations. Use is made of neutron scattering, x-ray
scattering with synchrotron radiation, SQUID magnetometry, and transport
measurements on lithographically processed structures. Of special interest are:
control of magnetic phase stability and thin film microstructure; chemical
synthesis of new magnetic nanostructures; prediction of magnetic couplings near
interfaces; and transformation dynamics including fluctuation and inelastic
processes. %%% We focus on the synthesis and properties of magnetic
nanostructures made from rare-earth metals by molecular beam surface layer
deposition. This controlled process assembles thin films layer by layer on a
crystalline substrate, from selected element metals, in the form of high quality
single crystals, with a designed chemical sequence of successive layers. The
focus on rare-earth metals is driven by technical and scientific interest in
their magnetic behavior. Our abiliity to tailor selected structures allows us to
explore the interactions among the atomic magnetic moments that cause a rich
variety of magnetic structures. The surface layer deposition process has a
controlling influence on magnetism through the clamping of the film to the
substrate, and through the resulting strain and thin film geometry. The ability
to control magnetic behavior of these materials is of interest in connection
with applications to the storage, switching, and manipulation of information
using thin film magnetic devices. ***
