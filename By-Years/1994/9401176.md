9401176 Speh/Barbasch Speh will continue her joint work with Rohlfs on cuspidal
cohomology. She also will investigate the analytic torsion of locally symmetric
spaces. In joint work the PI's will study the residual spectrum of the split
orthogonal and symplectic group. Barbasch will continue his research on
unipotent representations for real groups, in particular their character theory
and unitarity. He also will study spherical unitary dual for split p- adic
groups. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician
Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.
As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system,
the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon
mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics. ***
