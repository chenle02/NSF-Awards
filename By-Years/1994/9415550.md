ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9415550 P.I.: Sadoway The PI is making a presentation
of his work at a showcase conference. The meeting is called the International
Conference on Cleaning, Contamination Control and the Environment for Industry,
University and Government and is known colloquially as the "Mr. Clean"
Conference. This will be the 18th such conference which draws participants from
domestic industry, government, NGO's, and universities. The purpose of the
presentation is to publicize the work that has been done at MIT under NSF
sponsorship. Potential benefits include (1) attracting industrial co-sponsorship
of the research thereby leveraging the initial investment by NSF, (2) technology
transfer, and (3) enhancing NSF's stature in the environmental industries.
