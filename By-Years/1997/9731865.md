*** 9731865 This activity will support a "Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU)" Program to involve undergraduates in experiments at CERN
(in Switzerland) during the summer months. There are many research groups eager
to have a student working with them for the summer, however, we expect that most
students will join an experimental team associated with the very strong U.S.
involvement in the LHC program, and in the ATLAS and CMS experiments in
particular. After an orientation week in the U.S., students will be sent to CERN
where they will join the highly successful CERN Summer Student Program which has
been available to European students each summer for many years. This program
involves not only membership of an active research team, but also a series of
lectures on a variety of science topics - in particular both theoretical and
experimental particle physics and particle detection techniques. The special
environment offered by CERN will allow the students to experience an
international social and cultural dimension to their education in addition to
the more formal physics research experience. ***
