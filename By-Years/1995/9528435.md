95-28435 Kulkarni Dr. Kulkarni's research program includes the application of
supercomputers to pulsar searches and an aggressive multi- wavelength
observational program, emphasizing radio observations followed by ground-based
optical and IR, as well as X-ray observations from satellites. The observational
thrusts are: sensitive searches for pulsars in supernova remnants, large blind
searches with sensitivity to sub-millisecond pulsars, targeted observations of
promising pulsar candidates identified by continuum radio observations, deep
searches of globular clusters for millisecond pulsars, sensitive optical/IR
observations of binary pulsar systems, multi- wavelength studies of soft gamma-
ray repeaters. and attempts to detect radio emission from gamma-ray burst
sources. ***
