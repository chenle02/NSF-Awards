The goal of this research is to explore the novel use of fluidized bed
technology for biomass generation, specifically for the production of microbial
starter cultures. Liquid fluidized bed reactors will be used for the production
of lactic acid starter cultures which may be used in ensiling, food and feed
preservation, and as nutritive aids. Fungal starter cultures, using the
cellulolytic molds, Chaetomium cellulolyticum and Trichoderma reesei will be
prepared in gas fluidized bed reactors by attaching spores to agricultural
carriers and study conditions for optimal germination.
