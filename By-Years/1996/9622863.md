Abstract Mirkovic The main project: geometry of the loop Grassmannian and
applications to representation theory: (i) geometric Langlands conjectures and
(ii) modular representations. Here (i) is based on our minor role in the
completion of Drinfelds project of constructing the dual reductive group
geometricaly, and (ii) on our observation that the loop Grassmannian is the
geometric setting for the localization of algebraic representations of split
reductive groups over arbitrary commutative rings. Related projects: (a) study
of intersection homology sheaves and characteristic cycles via the p-transversal
stratifications and (b) the role of the hyperkahler structure in representation
theory. A long term goal of the above work is to relate certain highly developed
parts of abstract mathematics (geometry and number theory) with the ideas
developed recently by theoretical physicist (particle theory). Both of these
developments share common mathematical language of representation theory and
certain parts of algebraic geometry. The exdpected unification should
dramaticaly increase our understanding of both fields.
