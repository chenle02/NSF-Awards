The Great Lakes Geometry Conference (GLGC) will be held March 13-15, 2015 at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The GLGCs are a well-established
international conference series held annually in the Great Lakes region,
rotating among different universities. The aim of the next GLGC is to bring in
distinguished speakers in geometry and physics to celebrate the fruitful union
of 4-manifolds and gauge theory for the last 30 years. One primary goal of this
program is to expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to some
of the most important new developments in these areas. In addition, we hope that
the intermingling of the subject matter will encourage collaborations between
researchers in different areas. We will also highlight the connections with
mathematical physics which will hopefully foster interdisciplinary
collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coupling of the 4-manifold topology
and gauge theory from physics was one of the major creations in the new era of
the interactions between mathematics and physics in the 1980's. Since then we
have witnessed tremendous progresses such as the invention of Donaldson theory,
Seiberg-Witten theory and various Floer homology theories. In addition to
celebrating these achievements in the conference, we aim to assess the current
developments and look into the future of the subject.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A
conference website has been set up to inform the community of the
opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masmak/greatlakes2015
