9409715 Feron The two most useful properties of a good control system design are
robustness and performance. Performance is the ability for a control system to
satisfy a number of specifications, usually based on some inputs and outputs.
Robustness is the property that a system perform well even in the presence of
uncertainties. This research will develop a method that combines the theory of
stability multipliers with numerical convex optimization to handle the problem
of robust performance for control systems analysis and synthesis. Preliminary
investigations suggest that this technique should perform considerably better
than existing analysis and synthesis methods for robust control by solving a
much wider class of problems. The use of interior-point optimization techniques
combined with the newly developed concept of Linear Matrix Inequality may lead
to small amounts of computations, especially suitable for fast, interactive
design tools. ***
