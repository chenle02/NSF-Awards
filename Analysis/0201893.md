ABSTRACT

This is a project in the conformal mapping subfield of complex analysis and
stochastic processes. Its goal is to solve several well-known problems
concerning conformal maps and their applications. The main topics of the study
are the following: (i) conformal welding, (ii) universal spectrum of harmonic
measure, (iii) diffusion-limited aggregation and other processes with critical
behavior.

Conformal mapping theory is a classical area of complex analysis; it is an
important tool in the study of geometric invariants. The phenomenon of conformal
invariance is manifest in many mathematical structures as well as in certain
physical theories (conformal field theory and statistical mechanics). The
project deals with metric and universality properties of some key conformal
invariants, and with conformally invariant probabilities and processes.
