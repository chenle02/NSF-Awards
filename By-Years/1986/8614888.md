The proposal addresses three major topics. The first one is that of modeling
inter fitting circles or cylinders by random fields. This is necessary since the
success of the operation of machines involving such components depends on the
smoothness of the surfaces that are finer than what can be achieved by the
manufacturing processes. The stochastic geometry and analysis of such spaces
will be investigated. The second topic of the reliability and maintenance of
complex devices will be investigated under the assumed dependence of the
components, which will make the resulting theories more practical and
applicable. The third topic will extend the idea of markovian dependence to one
with infinite but exponentially fading memory.
