Membrane filtration is a major separation technology for particles and materials
in the submicron- and micron- size range (roughly one- millionth of a meter).
One of the major problems in the widespread use of this technology has been the
fouling of membrane surface (and hence the decline in the effectiveness of the
membrane) due to the deposition of the particles. This is a complex phenomenon
and requires a reasonable understanding of how the particles are carried from
the bulk to the surface, how a cake at the surface forms and compacts, and how
these affect performance. This research aims at a comprehensive (experimental
and theoretical) study of fouling.
