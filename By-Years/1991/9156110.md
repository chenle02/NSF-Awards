Four faculty of the Willamette University Chemistry Department have created a
core first semester course that stresses the concepts central to modern
chemistry. They will develop a case-study approach for the second semester that
examines in detail the material from the first semester by using specific
phenomena to illustrate chemical principles. The case-studies will be selected
on the basis of student interest and societal relevance. Students in the present
Introductory Chemistry course and in the new, innovative one will be surveyed to
assess the effectiveness of the new approach. Although this case-study approach
will be tailored to meet the needs of students in the Chemistry Program at
Willamette University, it can easily be adapted for effective use in
introductory chemistry courses elsewhere.
