The proposal seeks to disseminate the Systemic Initiatives (SI) study results
via hosting two distinctive activities: an Invitational SI Workshop and an SI
Study Forum. The SI Invitational Workshop of urban school data managers,
internal evaluators, and project directors as well as selected urban study
members will be held March 14 - 16, 2002 in Orlando, Florida. The proposed SI
Study Forum website will further disseminate results of more than 30 studies
supported by the National Science Foundation. The website will be ongoing past
the end of the grant period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is to be
funded by The Division of Educational System Reform (ESR) in collaboration with
the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication REC).&lt;br/&gt;
