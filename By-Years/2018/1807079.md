During the past twenty years, there has been a great deal of interaction between
mathematics and physics. Various models from physics have had great impact on
mathematics. One of these models is the gauged linear sigma model. This project
includes a comprehensive program to study the mathematical theory of the gauged
linear sigma model and its applications. The project is interdisciplinary in
nature, and both physical and mathematical ideas play essential roles. It adds
to the current trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. The project
will also enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well
as postdoctoral fellows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the PI's initial
success on algebraic geometric theory of gauged linear sigma model, this project
will construct log gauged linear sigma model moduli space. The new theory has a
range of applications including some well-known problems such as the computation
of the higher genus Gromov-Witten theory of compact Calabi-Yau
3-folds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
