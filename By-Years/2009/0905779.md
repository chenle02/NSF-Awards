Physical phenomena such as wave propagation are often represented mathematically
by nonlinear equations. Such equations can describe large amplitude behavior and
large amplitude wave motion. While it is difficult to find solutions to most
nonlinear equations, there is a subclass of equations that have deep
mathematical structure and admit an important set of special wave solutions
termed "solitons." Solitons are localized, stable waves that are of keen
interest to physicists and engineers. They arise in diverse fields such as
nonlinear optics, fluid dynamics, Bose-Einstein condensation, magnetic systems,
and plasma physics, amongst many others. In this project new solutions and
properties of a class of physically important nonlinear soliton equations will
be investigated. The research will study new solutions and properties of
multidimensional equations, including multi-lump solutions to the Kadomtsev-
Petviashvili equation; investigate nonlinear equations that can be expressed in
terms of modular forms, including new reductions of the self-dual Yang-Mills
system; investigate boundary value problems for continuous and discrete scalar
and vector nonlinear Schrodinger equations; and study dispersive shock wave
phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensation and nonlinear optics.

Recent experimental and theoretical research in Bose-Einstein condensation and
nonlinear optics has demonstrated novel wave phenomena. Under suitable
conditions a narrow soliton wave front with an associated modulated wave train
are observed. The experiments illustrate what is termed dispersive blast waves
or dispersive shock waves. This wave phenomenon is the dispersive, non-
dissipative, wave equivalent of well-known atmospheric blast waves which are
dissipative in nature. In this project a number of new and fundamental research
directions associated with dispersive shock waves will be studied, including
interactions of dispersive shock waves and dispersive rarefaction waves.
