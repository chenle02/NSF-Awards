How do collegial courts make law? This question is central to the study of
judicial politics. For example, without knowing how collegial courts decide
cases and issue legal rules, scholars cannot understand how judiciaries interact
with legislative and executive branches in separation of powers systems, we
cannot understand hierarchical relationships between higher courts and lower
courts, and we cannot understand how and why the law changes over time. This
workshop brings together a small group of foremost scholars actively involved in
the study of collegial court decision-making. The goal of the workshop is to
help push forward a burgeoning research agenda focused on identifying how the
formation and implementation of legal rules is distinct from other forms of
policymaking. The workshop examines four sets of questions implicated in this
line of inquiry. First, how do collegial courts rule on cases (both the
disposition and the declared rules justifying that disposition), and what role
do concurrences play in this process? Second, the conference examines the
empirical tools available to test these more nuanced theories of judicial
decision making. Third, what do rules actually look like (e.g. why choose rules
versus standards)? Fourth, what are the consequences of the placement of rules
and the form rules take for future application of the law both in terms of how
future litigants and how lower courts will behave. For example, the workshop
examines how the shape of a legal rule, and the process of decision-making on
the Supreme Court, affects the decisions of lower courts. Given that legal
opinions are the product of group decision-making, and the weight of that
opinion as law depend on the willingness of other justices to "sign on," how
should a lower court respond to a majority opinion and (potentially) concurring
view expressed by other justices in the majority?
