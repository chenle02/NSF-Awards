This award supports the continuation of the REU program in physics at the
University of Arizona. Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront
physics activities, under the direction of senior faculty members from the
Department of Physics at the University of Arizona, or also from in research
groups located in several other university academic units including Astronomy,
Chemistry, Optical Sciences, Lunar and Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric
Sciences. The primary source of participants is students who have completed the
equivalent of the first or second year curriculum in science or engineering at
Pima Community College, in preparation for transfer to a 4-year degree program
(although all undergraduate students are eligible to apply). Graduate Teaching
Assistants from the physics department serve as mentors for the participants.
Special orientation and skills activities are individually tailored to enable
the students to make significant contributions to the research
projects.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are trained for research in an
intensive training camp for 1.5 weeks at the start of the REU. Here they learn
essential lab skills such as machining, digital electronics and computer
interfacing, taught by trained faculty and graduate mentors; they take part in
team-building exercises such as scientific speaking and a catapult competition;
and they tour the various research labs offering summer REU work. Participants
are matched to research labs according to student preferences and skills, for a
research experience lasting 8.5 weeks, culminating in a half-day REU symposium.
Strong connections to past REU alumni are a priority throughout; the REU
website, Facebook page and "REUnion barbecue" event strengthen bonds among past
and present students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
