It is the purpose of this research to determine defect symmetry information,
from an experiment observing the uniaxial stress splitting for stresses applied
along different crystallographic directions. Researchers will investigate
defects in irradiated silicon for which stress EPR or optical experiments have
been performed. The energy levels of a number of neutron-produced defects of
this type will be determined and correlated with known EPR defect structures.
This DLTS stress work will be extended to other materials which contain a wealth
of interesting defects for which often no symmetry information exists. There are
many native defects in GaAs in addition to irradiation-induced defects. A
careful study of the properties of defects under stress in this material will be
extremely useful, even in those cases where the specific chemical nature of the
defect cannot be discerned.
