The P.I. proposes exploratory experiments, using a new and potentially very
powerful measurement technique, to elucidate the phenomenon of macroscopic
quantum tunneling. The role of many- body effects and the influence of an
external magnetic field will be explored. The system to be studied comprises a
layer of electrons suspended above a surface of liquid helium. A modest electric
field applied perpendicularly to the electron sheet forms an energy barrier that
leaves an electron in a metastable state from which it can escape by activation
over the barrier or by tunneling through it. The wide range of control over
experimental parameters that is here available makes this an ideal system for
study. To monitor the tunneling rates, some new techniques will be tried,
allowing direct measurement of the electron temperature and density, and of the
external perturbations such as electric field and excitations of the He surface
("ripplons").
