9701065 Sin This award provides funding for a research project that lies at the
intersection of three areas, modular representations of finite groups, finite
projective geometry and the theory of designs and their codes. Under this
project, Sin will try to on the one hand build a general framework in which
techniques of representation theory and group cohomology can be applied to
attack combinatorial problems about codes and geometries, while on the other
hand he will study how the latter areas may provide a more geometric viewpoint
in representation theory. The successful outcome of this research should lead to
new methods and results in all three theories and, above all, to a cross-
fertilization of ideas among them. This research is in the general area of
Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of
studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of
discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example,
the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and
the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
and this makes use of combinatorial research.
