Professor Theodore Cohen in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Pittsburgh is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
his research on lithium-ene cyclizations. The project will investigate the scope
and stereoselectivity of these ring-forming reactions; in addition, enolate-
directed lithiations and the cyclopolymerization of dienes via titanium-ene
intermediates will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Theodore Cohen is
developing new, efficient methods for forming cyclic organic compounds. These
new methods for synthesizing cyclic compounds are most likely to find
applications in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. New techniques
for preparing polymers consisting of a series of rings in an ordered, controlled
manner are also being investigated. Variation of the polymerization procedures
should result in new materials with novel physical properties.
