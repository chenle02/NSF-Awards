The goals of this project are to develop techniques for the detection and
prediction of low-dimensional features in high-dimensional, spatially extended
systems, to investigate how coherent structures within the system affect
predictability, to test control strategies for high-dimensional, spatially
extended systems, and to improve understanding of uncertainty as a function of
spatial scale in such systems. One motivation for the work is the desire to
develop better state estimation techniques for complex environmental systems.
The model system for this work is that of shallow thermal convection. The
project combines laboratory experiment with theory and modeling. As well as
being a good model system, convection is important in many environmental systems
in the atmosphere, ocean and interior of the Earth, and in industrial settings.
Thermal convection exhibits multi-scale spatial and temporal complexity and
laboratory convection experiments provide plentiful, high quality, observational
data under relatively well-controlled conditions. The laboratory experiments use
carbon dioxide as the convecting medium in a shallow cell. Specific spiral-
defect chaos flow patterns can be initiated using a computer-steered laser
system that selectively heats parts of the fluid. The primary theoretical tool
is a state estimation technique in which a local ensemble Kalman filter is
applied to a numerical Navier-Stokes solver. This will be applied to a range of
flow patterns of increasing complexity exhibited by the convection cell as the
Rayleigh number is increased. The data to be assimilated will be taken from
shadowgraph images of the convection. Later stages of the project will include
experiments in control of the convection using selective heating guided by
output from the state estimation system. It is anticipated that the results of
this work will be applicable to other spatially-extended complex systems.
