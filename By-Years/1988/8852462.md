Currently digital logic design is taught to approximately 600 students from a
variety of disciplines. The primary objective is to incorporate state-of-the-art
design methodologies and technologies into the undergraduate electrical and
computer engineering curricula. The laboratory will include Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) tools for design, simulation, and programming of several VLSI
digital logic technologies. High-speed logic analyzers and oscilloscopes will be
used to test and characterize circuit performance. Implementation of this
program will enable the undergraduate digital logic design laboratory to provide
students with systematic design experience for circuits ranging from elementary
logic functions to microprogrammed computer architectures.
