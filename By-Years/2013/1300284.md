This research is about the bottom-up development of advanced lubricant coatings
that are inspired by natural lubricating systems. Specifically, the project will
develop new poly(ionic liquid) coatings and investigate their rolling and
sliding frictional properties in contact with a swelling ionic liquid solvent.
This system offers charged, comb-like polymer chains within a bound/mobile
medium, much like natural lubricants, and a liquid with tailorable viscosity and
swelling properties to fine tune the tribological performance. The approach of
the research will be to employ surface-initiated ring opening metathesis
polymerization to grow the lubricant coatings from both planar silicon (oxide)
surfaces and silica microparticles. This method enables rapid polymer growth and
the ability to tailor the ionic liquid side chain length, composition, and
counter ion to investigate molecular-scale effects on the lubricating
performance of the coatings. The most promising lubrication systems, based on
sliding results, will be employed for the rolling lubrication of silica
microspheres confined in both microchannels and hemispherical polymeric
cavities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to new
types of lubricated systems improving sliding and rolling lubrication systems.
This will lead to greatly reduced friction and wear in microfabricated systems.
Outreach will include the development of case studies from this research that
will impact undergraduate classes, undergraduate research, and a week-long
specialty course for gifted eight graders through the Vanderbilt Summer Academy.
Students will learn to assemble coatings, measure their surface and tribological
properties and connect these properties to basic intermolecular interactions.
The research will also create a better understanding in high school by allowing
a local high school teacher to participate in this research through a Research
Experience for Teachers program.
