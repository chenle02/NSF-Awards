John Baldeschweiler is supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the MPS Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities to develop chemically derivatized Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe tips. The
goals of this research are to: 1) to attach high-aspect adducts to the tip; and
2) to attach specific chemical moieties. At the present time users who want
near-atomic resolution depend essentially on luck to produce good tips. The
ability to attach high-aspect adducts will make it possible to obtain near-
atomic resolution reliably and reproducibly. The ability to attach specific
chemical moieties would lead to a mechanism for chemical contrast. Preliminary
calculations indicate that an AFM has sufficient sensitivity to detect an
interaction weaker than a single hydrogen bond. The development of
nanotechnology requires the ability to create and analyze structures with atomic
precision. However, in order for nanotechnology to become a reality, the ability
to image and analyze materials on the atomic scale is essential. STM and AFM
have already generated striking results in material science, chemistry and
biology. The ability to image the effects of nanomanipulation reliably will
depend on the development of reproducibly high-aspect tips, and the development
of chemical contrast mechanisms.
