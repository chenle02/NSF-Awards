The calculus curriculum is being reformed by adapting the materials produced by
Duke University's ProjectCALC. Duke's materials embody a radical revision of the
calculus curriculum, building the course around (I) selected problem areas in
the sciences that motivate the introduction of calculus techniques, (2) a
discovery-based computer laboratory, conducted in much the same way as a
laboratory for a science course, and (3) writing assignments which place the
major emphasis of the course on conceptual understanding not solely
computational skills.
