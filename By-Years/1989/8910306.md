The research has three basic goals: 1. to examine what information can be
obtained from both successful and unsuccessful tests, and how that information
can be used in debugging; 2. to integrate the use of the information identified
into a debugger equipped with traditional functions such as breakpointing and
single- stepping; and 3. to perform tests to determine the effectiveness of this
method and its suitability for production use, and to enhance the mechanism
based on this evaluation. This debugger would apply pruning information
automatically to software being debugged, and make suggestions to the user as to
where the fault under examination might be.
