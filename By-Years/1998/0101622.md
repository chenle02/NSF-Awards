This project is infusing applied geospatial technology into both the
geosciences curricula and into other curricula within the Natural Sciences,
Physical Education and Technology Division at Gainesville College (GC), and the
College of Arts and Sciences at the State University of West Georgia (UWG).
Curricula is being articulated between the two institutions to ensure that
available transfer and "reverse transfer" opportunities work smoothly for
students in both institutions. The effort contributes toward articulated
Bachelors of Science and Associate of Science degree programs in geographic
information science, remote sensing, and global positioning systems at the two
institutions.

The project has three major elements:

(1) University of West Georgia is including a new technology course in their
core curriculum for mathematics, science, and technology - such courses are
required for all undergraduate students. The course is being modeled after the
Geographic Information Science course at Gainesville College.

(2) Faculty members (GC science program, UWG geoscience program) are integrating
remote sensing into the core course described above. This program is being used
in faculty development workshops (Introduction to Geospatial Data Analysis for
Research and Classroom Applications) and in undergraduate courses. Faculty from
other regional institutions are also participating in these workshops.

(3) Faculty from both institutions are working together to ensure course
compatibility across the two institutions.
