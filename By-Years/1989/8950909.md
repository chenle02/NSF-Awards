This award to the University of Rochester is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, a
program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate instructional
equipment. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire an
X-ray diffraction system for mineralogical analysis of geological materials. The
University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The
instrumentation will be used to enhance the undergraduate geology curriculum and
to enable students to acquire experience in the use of modern analytical
instrumentation.
