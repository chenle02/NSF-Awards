This awards support participation of US-based mathematicians in the conference
"Gauge Theory and Topology", which will take place at the Clay Mathematics
Institute, Oxford, UK, on July 24-28, 2023.The conference will bring experts
from around the world together to discuss issues of current interest in geometry
and topology, focusing on the areas of Floer homology, low-dimensional topology,
and gauge theory. A broad range of topics within the field will be covered,
creating opportunities for interaction of researchers at different career stages
and those working in different subfields. The breadth of conference topics will
present an excellent training opportunity for young researchers, who would be
exposed to a wealth of current knowledge and a range of long-standing and newly
accessible problems in the field. The funding will primarily be used to support
graduate students and young researchers, with priority given to qualified
participants from underrepresented groups.

Beginning with the discovery of Donaldson theory, Seiberg-Witten theory, and
Floer homology several decades ago, extracting geometrical and topological
meaning from equations on manifolds has been a powerful tool that led to many
breakthroughs in the area, often in combination with the more classical
topological techniques. These areas of mathematics, as well as newer subfields
such as Heegaard Floer theory, continue to thrive, but each has grown to become
a separate field, with somewhat limited interaction between them. The meeting
will encompass a broad range of topics to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas
and connections and collaborations of experts in different subfields. Topics of
particular current interest include new developments in gauge theory and
geometric partial differential equations, including instanton invariants and the
family Seiberg-Witten invariants; the topology of 4-manifolds, including
advances in topological 4-manifolds and the study of embedded surfaces; and
Floer homology for 3-manifolds, including equivariant Floer homology, knot
detection and the relations between instanton and monopole homology. The
conference will focus on recent achievements and new developments in gauge
theory and topology. It is expected to give rise to new questions, opening the
door to further progress in the area.
