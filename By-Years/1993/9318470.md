*** 9318740 Schuller This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is
designed to develop a reliable and inexpensive method for obtaining insitu
measurements of the state of compressive stresses and deformation properties of
masonry buildings. Such measurements are essential elements in the evaluation of
the structural integrity of existing masonry buildings. Currently these
measurements are made using flatjacks (bladders using thin metal sheets welded
together at the edges and with inlet and outlet ports). Present flatjack
technology has some serious limitations which reduce the accuracy of
measurements, limit the types of masonry that can be evaluated and may result in
visual damage to the structure. Phase I research surveyed candidate materials
that could be used to fabricate a flexible flatjack, designed and fabricated
prototypes of flexible flatjacks, and tested the prototypes for applicability to
masonry walls. In Phase II, prototype designs will be further developed to
improve performance, increase service life and decrease manufacturing costs.
Incorporation of deformation sensors will be accomplished and full scale
evaluations will also be conducted. Recommendations for modifying existing
testing standards, both domestic and foreign, will also be developed as part of
the Phase II effort. The need for a new flatjack technology is driven by
requirements to rehabilitate existing masonry structures to meet new, more
stringent seismic loadings and for use in renovating such structures for
changing uses. The large number of existing masonry buildings in the U. S. and
the rest of the world and the demonstrated need for evaluation as a basis for
retrofit portend a high level of use for a successful new flatjack technology.
