The research is a combined experimental-analytical-computational effort to study
high temperature deformation mechanisms in nickel-base superalloy single
crystals. Special attention will be paid to two-phase nature of the material,
the effects of non- Schmid shear stresses and latent hardening on viscoplastic
deformation behavior. Three dimensional constitutive relations will be developed
that will facilitate the analysis and design of structural components made from
single crystals.//
