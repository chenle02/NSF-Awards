Lay Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between nerve cells serves as
the basis of all brain activity. One of the fundamental steps involved in signal
transmission between the nerve cells, is the conversion of a chemical signal
liberated at the end of one nerve cell, into an electrical signal at the second
nerve cell. This step is mediated by a class of membrane bound proteins known as
neurotransmitter receptors. An important member of this family is the glutamate
receptor, which is the focus of this study. These receptors bind to the chemical
signaling molecule glutamate (ligand) and generate an electrical signal through
the formation of transmembrane ion channels. Dr. Jayaraman's laboratory has used
vibrational spectroscopy to identify specific interactions between the glutamate
receptor protein and ligands such as glutamate. Since, the vibrations of these
chemical moieties are controlled by their atomic-level environment, probing
these by infrared light has provided insight into the interaction between the
protein and the ligand. Dr. Jayaraman will investigate the identified
ligand:protein interactions in a time-resolved manner. For these investigations
glutamate will be photolytically released in the microsecond timescale using
caged glutamate and the kinetic evolution of the vibrational spectral signatures
of the ligand and protein will be investigated as the protein evolves from the
unligated to the ligated states. These high-resolution structural and kinetic
studies are required for a basic understanding of interactions that control
protein-ligand recognition and will eventually allow the design of drugs that
can alter the behavior of glutamate receptors. Such drugs may be useful in the
treatment of traumatic head injury, and memory problems.&lt;br/&gt;
