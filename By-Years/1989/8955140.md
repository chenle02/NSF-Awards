This four-year project will broaden the mathematics content knowledge and
pedagogical strategies of mathematics supervisors and middle grades teachers
from nine school districts in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The top-down
approach includes beginning with the instruction of mathematics supervisors, and
a small cadre of experienced mathematics teacher leaders. In a combination of
summer and academic year inservice, the supervisors and project staff will work
with classroom teachers. The set of classroom teachers will be expanded each
year, culminating during the fourth year with the involvement of approximately
54 teacher leaders. The project relies on a constructivist model and will
produce a set of written and videotape materials for use in other mathematics
teacher enhancement settings. The project approach is to foster independence and
confidence among the supervisors and teacher leaders, so that by the fourth year
the project is moving toward being self-sustaining. Cost sharing is provided by
Georgia State University and school districts as 73% of the NSF award.
