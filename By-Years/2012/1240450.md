This project supports US faculty members and graduate students to attend USA -
Sino Summer School in Vision, Learning, Pattern Recognition (VLPR2012). The VLPR
summer school has become a mutually beneficial annual event for computer vision
researchers and students from both US and China. The impact and reputation of
VLPR summer school sequence grows rapidly and VLPR 2012 continues this positive
trend by focusing on Computer Vision in Biomedical Image Applications: from
Micro to Macro. This topic complements the methodology-centered VLPRs in the
past with an application-oriented and human-centered focus on life forms in
drastically different scales: from human and animals (macro) to cells (micro).
VLPR 2012 aims to illustrate a cross-sectional state of the art computer vision
and machine learning methodologies, to broaden the horizon for innovations and
creativities, and to address some fundamental issues of high throughput
computing on multi-modality, high-dimensional, and high volume image data (Big
Data).

The theme of this summer school reflects the growing international trend of
interdisciplinary research in biomedical image and smart health, and facilitates
collaborative efforts between science and technology, computer science and
medicine/biology, and US and China. In addition, this summer school offers a
great opportunity for intellectual and cultural exchanges between a group of
world-class computer vision researchers and motivated students from the two
countries to converse and mingle with each other in an exciting, culturally rich
environment during a week-long period.
