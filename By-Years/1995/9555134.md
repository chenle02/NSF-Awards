Theory and Continuous Symmetry in the Undergraduate Curriculum Project Summary:
Although the idea of symmetry, which is embodied formally in the mathematical
concept of group, has been a major driving force in mathematics and physics
during the past century, it is so far only meagerly represented in the
undergraduate curriculum. Group theory usually appears as part of a course in
abstract algebra, and the main groups considered are finite groups. On the other
hand, the main groups which affect our lives and the structure of the universe
are continuous groups (Lie groups). This project begins to remedy this situation
by creating a course which exhibits the unifying nature of continuous symmetry.
The course will begin by discussing symmetries which are directly related to
concepts of physical space: dilations, rigid motions, similarities. It will then
introduce the basic concepts of linear algebra, and discuss geometric issues in
2, 3 and 4 dimensions, culminating in the special theory of relativity. Examples
and applications will be emphasized throughout. The course will emphasize
interactive teaching, and will include extended projects with possibilities for
group activities. An important project component will involve working with
PIMMS, the leading mathematics and science education effort in the State of
Connecticut. Through this effort the project will impact the pre-service teacher
population. A text is planned along with computer laboratory materials. The
overall goal of this work is to put students in touch with a major direction of
intellectual advance in mathematics over the past century, and to take the ideas
of mathematics education reform f urther into the undergraduate curriculum. In
particular, the proposed course will be an attractive alternative to the usual
sophomore-level linear algebra course.
