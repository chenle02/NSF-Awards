AST-9619186 Submillimeter Polarimetry. Instrumentation recently developed by Dr.
Roger Hildebrand at the University of Chicago has made it possible to observe
the polarization of the submillimeter wavelength emission from interstellar
clouds at more points and with better precision and spatial resolution than has
been possible before. Dr. Hildebrand will now exploit this capability by using
the instrumentation at the California Institute of Technology Submillimeter
Observatory in Hawaii to make maps of polarization in several types of
interstellar clouds. The primary goal is to infer the shapes of the magnetic
fields in these objects. A secondary goal is to investigate the mechanism that
aligns the dust grains responsible for the polarized emission.
