This grant to the University of Iowa supports the research of Professor Edwin
Norbeck in the study of intermediate mass fragmentation resulting from the
collisions of high-energy heavy-ion projectiles with massive targets. The grant
also supports the development of a specialized forward angle detector array to
be used in conjunction with 4Pi detector array at the National Superconducting
Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. This detector will be vital
to the fragmentation research and for other experiments as well.
