Analysis of remotely sensed data, both CZCS and AVHRR will be used to describe
the eddy field in the wake of Barbados Island. These analyses will be combined
with in-situ physical oceanographic data to investigate the dynamics of the
island- generated eddies. Finally this information will be combined with
concurrently collected samples of the reef fish to investigate mechanisms for
retention near the island.
