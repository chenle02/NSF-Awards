Electricity, magnetism, light, and therefore information propagates by means of
wave motion. While basic aspects of wave propagation were understood about three
hundred years ago, technology and science demand methods to analyze more and
more sophisticated phenomena relating to waves. For example, information for the
internet is passed along glass fiber cables in the form of light as well as via
satellites in space through electromagnetic waves. Cell phone technology
operates essentially the same way. The dramatic increase in speed in internet
communication today as compared to the mid 1990s, for example, is due to a
complete and radical change in the design of glass fiber cables. Instead of
using the same material for hundreds or thousands of miles, the current design
alternates between different materials thus allowing for subtle nonlinear
effects to come into play. This revolutionary design is the result of
interactions between engineers, applied mathematicians, and material scientists.
Advanced mathematics very closely related to the subject matter of this project
played a decisive role in the process. Mathematicians working in partial
differential equations are cognizant of the importance of training students in
the sciences in order to meet the high demands of industry and government.

This project aims at understanding the long-term dynamics of solutions to
various systems of nonlinear partial differential equation of wave type. This
typically means hyperbolic equations, but it can also refer to the Schroedinger
equation. While much progress has been made on the defocusing case, where waves
exist for all times and scatter to the vacuum state, focusing equations are much
less studied. This type of equation can exhibit finite time blowup as well as
small data scattering. The main goal is to determine whether or not global
solutions scatter to a stationary solution also known as a soliton. The latter
seems likely if basic invariances of the equations, such those given by dilation
and translation symmetries, are excluded. This is precisely the case for Klein-
Gordon equations in the radial setting.
