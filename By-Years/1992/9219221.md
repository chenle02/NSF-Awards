The project will investigate the cores of galaxies, with the aim of searching
for supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies by looking for large
central gradients in rotation velocities and velocity dispersions. In another
area, an atlas of photographs of dust distributions in early-type galaxies will
be published. There will also be a study of scalling laws for dark matter halos
of galaxies. The Principal Investigator is an expert in this research area.
