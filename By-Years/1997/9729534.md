The Imaging Core Facility at the University of Texas Southwestern MedicalCenter
at Dallas will be upgraded and expanded. This will allow for increased and more
efficient use of the facility and also for the acquisition of powerful new
technologies such as micro-FRAP and micro-CALl. Among the many systems and
problems that will be studied using this facility are: the regulation and
function of kinase pathways; the assembly of peroxisome organelles; the
regulation of contractile and motile function in smooth and non-muscle cells;
and the role of and constraints on diffussion of cellular components in cellular
reactions.
