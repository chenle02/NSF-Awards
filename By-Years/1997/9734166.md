The use of proprietary designs (reusable cores) as part of VLSI systems on a
chip depends on having reliable and efficient techniques for intellectual
property (IP) protection. This research investigates techniques for such
protection. It includes a watermarking (signature hiding) approach for
protecting CAD tools, reusable cores, and embedded software. Also being explored
is a fingerprinting scheme, and a covert channel-based technique for the
efficient detection of misappropriated (stolen) IP. The watermarking approach is
the addition of design and/or timing constraints in the design specification
which encode the author's signature. Fingerprinting techniques are meant to
deter people from illegally distributing IP by enabling the author of the IP to
uniquely identify the original buyer of a resold copy. The concept of covert
channels is the basis for techniques which convey to the author information
without alerting an illegal owner of IP. The effectiveness of the proposed
techniques and algorithms will be demonstrated on industrial strength designs.
The educational plan includes the development and use of watermarking techniques
and video games for teaching IP protection techniques and other material.
