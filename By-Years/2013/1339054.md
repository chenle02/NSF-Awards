The potential for further development of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) single
crystals will be explored. Single crystals of hBN are potentially transformative
materials because of their unique properties and applications as a graphene
substrate, a neutron detector, and as UV-LED semiconductors. Some of the unique
properties of hBN include its ability to emit deep-UV light (as low as 215 nm),
its large thermal neutron capture cross section (due to the strong interaction
between thermal neutrons (~25 meV) and the 20% naturally occurring boron-10
isotope), and a crystal structure that is similar to graphene (including the
smallest known lattice mismatch of only +1.7%), making it an excellent substrate
for graphene. However, electronic and optoelectronic device applications
exploiting these properties have been hampered by the small size, poor crystal
quality, and high impurity content commercially available hBN.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hBN single crystals produced in this project could
enable the development of new types of devices exploiting its properties
including deep-UV emitters (for non-thermal sterilization and water
purification), solid state neutron detectors (for homeland security, first
responders, and treaty verification), and as an excellent electrically
insulating substrate for grapheme integrated electronics and sensors. This
project will explore the widespread use and practical application opportunities
afforded by these hBN single crystals with the goal of manufacturing the
crystals on a large scale.
