0433527&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to
optimally interact and guide a process towards its specified goals depends upon
the capacity to observe, model and manipulate the process dynamics as reliably
as possible. The nonlinear nature of most chemical processes presents
challenging operational problems, frequently compounded by uncertainties in
dynamics and errors in measurements. In stochastic nonlinear systems, the
determination of a probability density function of the state of a process is
central for operations tasks. Linear and linearized techniques of modeling pose
limitations for nonlinear systems required to operate over wide ranging
conditions. Therefore, most existing probabilistic methods assume linearized
dynamics and simple Gaussian density functions, which tend to have poor
predictive capability. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
will focus on developing methods that build discrete-time finite-state Markov
chain models, from trajectory models in continuous space, which will accurately
models the temporal evolution of any type of density due to any type of
nonlinearity. The approach is based on cell-to-cell mapping and measure
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to develop new means to model
the probabilistic features of nonlinear dynamic systems, which should aid in
solving Bayesian problems in systems engineering. While generalized Bayesian
solutions have been available for a long time, they are seldom amenable for
implementation in nonlinear systems due to the lack of probabilistic
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad
societal impact lies in the potential for improving the efficiency of US process
industry through a better understanding of nonlinear processes.&lt;br/&gt;
