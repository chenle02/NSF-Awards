*** 9727332 Spence The Joint Planning Office for the Global Climate Observing
System (JPO/GCOS) will advance and promote coordination of planning for and
development of the three major observing systems which support global change
research -- the GCOS and the Global Ocean and Terrestrial Observing Systems
(GOOS and GTOS) -- but especially the GTOS. The JPO/GCOS will base this
coordination on its comprehensive approach to identifying (a) the scientific
requirements for observations of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and
cryosphere, using both in situ and space-based observing systems, and (b) the
needs for and development of plans for a comprehensive data management system in
support of the three observing systems. The JPO/GCOS will develop protocols to
integrate data obtained from both networks; identify ecological sites for joint
observations; identify river observing sites as an initial hydrological cycle
observing system; develop demonstration/ pilot projects (possibly on soil
carbon) to test the ability of the observing systems to make observations and
deliver collected data rapidly and effectively; and promote further development
of an integrated data management system for terrestrial observations. ***
