9451516 Stripeik We will develop a new laboratory curriculum for an introductory
physics class that serves Pre-medical, Physical Therapy, and Allied Health
Professions majors. The experiments will show how basic physics is applied and
used by people in the medical professions. Major equipment in the laboratory
will include computers, data acquisition hardware, and specialized pieces of
equipment to perform experiments dealing with sight, sound and hearing, stress
and strains on objects such as bones, and fluid flow as in the circulatory
system. In addition the equipment will be used to demonstrate the experiments
developed during the annual Physics Teacher Conference and Physics Contest held
at Saint Louis University.
