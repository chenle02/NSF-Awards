Complexity theory deals with how hard problems are. Recently various researchers
have looked at the number of queries which must be made to an oracle in order to
solve a problem as a measure of that problem's difficulty. A set is cheatable if
membership of 2k strings can be determined by querying only k strings. We
investigate structure, closure properties, complexity, and naturalness of both
cheatable and terse sets. We also compare these notions to other concepts such
as polynomial size circuits, near-testability, and-selectivity.
