The proposed U.S.-Brazil planning visit and workshop will support U.S. PI Dr.
Bin Hu from the University of Tennessee Knoxville to travel to Brazil to
coordinate possible research activities with Professors Carlos Graeff from the
Universidade Estadual Paulista and Ivo A. Hümmelgen at the Universidade Federal
do Paraná. Dr. Hu would like to pursue collaborative research in magnetic field
effects in organic semiconductors. The intent is to submit a full research
proposal to the NSF as a result of this visit and to explore in detail how to
combine three-types of unique research facilities: (i) measurement of intra-
molecular and intermolecular magnetic interactions in Prof. Graeff's group; (ii)
time-resolved magneto-current in Prof. Hümmelgen's; and (iii) measurement of
magnetic field effects of excited states in Prof. Hu's group to enhance the
research of magnetic field effects in organic semiconductors.
