Theories of primate social structure argue that patterns of food availability
have a profound impact on social organization. For instance, if food resources
are dispersed in small, scattered clumps, competition among group-living
individuals will increase and limit the number of animals that can feed and move
together; this will constrain group size. This study aims to gather data to test
such ideas, particularly the proposition that food may be a limiting factor only
at times of seasonal food shortages. The study species, the mona monkey, occurs
in a range of forest habitats in West Africa, but has never been the subject of
a long-term field study. Studies of related species suggest that much of its
diet is ripe fruit and insects, food items likely to fluctuate greatly in their
seasonal abundance. Research on the behavior of the mona monkey, and on the
ecology of its habitat, will take place in the Lama Forest of Benin, which has a
long dry season. Lama is the largest surviving remnant of the original dry
forest vegetation of the Dahomey Gap, an area thought to have played a major
role in the evolution of West African mammal species. This research will
contribute to the better conservation of this threatened ecosystem.
