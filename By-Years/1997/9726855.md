9726855 Roth An understanding of the evolutionary relationships of rodents, and
of squirrels (family Sciruidae) in particular, is fundamental to reconstructing
the course of mammalian evolution. Rodents constitute nearly half the extant
species of mammals, and morphologically, sciurids are relatively primitive,
which renders their relationships to other families of rodents of key importance
in determining the evolutionary history of the Rodentia. The squirrel family is
well circumscribed; diverse in its ecology, it ranges widely in body size, and
is thus a rich source of evolutionary patterns. Its good fossil record and wide
geographic distribution further permit evolutionary patterns to be placed in
temporal and geographic contexts. Phylogenetic relationships of flying
squirrels, pygmy squirrels, tree squirrels, and ground squirrels had never
before been evaluated together using a single data set. In this research by V.
Louise Roth and John M. Mercer, DNA sequence data will be used to reconstruct
the geneaology of the squirrel family. Preliminary studies suggest that the
relationships among squirrels are, in many fundamental ways, different from what
has previously been assumed by systematic biologists. This work should provide a
new framework for interpreting variation in this group of rodents, clarifying
evolutionary history in a major component of mammalian diversity.
