Work to be done on this project is a continuation of mathematical analysis of
inverse problems having roots in several applications to the physical world. The
fundamental problem, known in the engineering literature as electrical impedance
imaging or impedance computed tomography, is that of determining the unknown
conductivity inside a body from knowledge of steady state direct current
measurements at the boundary. Its successful resolution will provide a valuable
diagnostic tool for both the medical and biological sciences. There are,
however, serious mathematical as well as experimental difficulties. The fact
that the boundary measurements contain sufficient information to distinguish any
isotropic conductivity was only recently established for three dimensional
bodies. In two- dimensions, the global uniqueness question - an essential first
step - is still unresolved. There are related and more difficult questions still
to be pursued in three dimensions. In particular, the problem of continuous
dependence of solutions on the boundary values is only partially understood. To
date, the bounds measuring continuity are weak (logarithmic) and require further
study. Work will also be done on reconstruction of solutions and a
characterization of the class of functions which can act as conductivity
potentials. This research has natural relationships with other inverse problems
such as multi-dimensional scattering and d-bar methods from several complex
variables. Finally, it should be noted that the important anisotropic case will
have to play a role in constructive approaches to the isotropic and will force
researchers to understand more about this more general problem area.
