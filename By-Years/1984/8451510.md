This research program focuses on system-level fault diagnosis and VLSI circuit
layout. This study further extends the graph-theoretic approaches to develop
unified algorithms for the diagnosability problem of various models. It also
investigates an adaptive system diagnosis approach and develops self-testing
techniques for large-scale systems. In the area of Very Large Scale Integrated
(VLSI) circuit layout, a linear time algorithm is being developed for planarity
testing of a partially oriented graph which models the circuit. The efficient
implementation of the algorithm is due to the extended PQ-tree data structure.
Based on this data structure, this research further develops algorithms for
drawing the actual circuit in the plane and for the two- or multilayer circuit
layout problems.
