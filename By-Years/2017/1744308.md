The CISE Research Infrastructure program drives discovery and learning in the
computing disciplines by supporting the creation and enhancement of world-class
computing research infrastructure. In 2014 NSF launched Phase I of the NSFCloud
Mid-scale Research Infrastructure program to enable the academic research
community to develop and experiment with novel cloud computing architectures and
address emerging research challenges. Two distinct computing cloud
infrastructure projects -- Chameleon and CloudLab -- were initiated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original NSF Cloud solicitation (NSF 13-602)
anticipated two phases of the NSFCloud program, and recommended an external
evaluation of the projects near the completion of Phase I. The objective of this
proposed activity is to undertake that evaluation based on the goals of the
NSFCloud program, as well as specific metrics outlined in each original NSFCloud
proposal. This evaluation considers four main areas of focus: outreach and
community, nature of the platform research, technical details of each project,
&lt;br/&gt;and efforts/approaches towards sustaining each project. Upon
completion of the evaluation a written report will detail findings and offer
concrete recommendations for advancing each system under Phase II of the
program.
