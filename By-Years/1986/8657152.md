Dr. Eberhardt intends to pursue the development of new algorithms suitable for
such important problems as scramjet propulsion, aerothermodynamic heating during
assent, and reentry. In particular, he intends to extend and improve my fluid
dynamic codes which are designed to handle both chemical equilibrium and
nonequilibrium effects and thermal nonequilibrium. These codes provide a unique
capability of being able to capture all physical discontinuities within a flow,
such as shock waves and slip surfaces, while maintaining strong conservation.
The immediate extensions will expand them to multi-dimensions and to include
diffusion effects which will allow heat transfer calculations. Code verification
with existing shock tunnel data will also be an important aspect of the
research. The ultimate goal is to produce a robust, reliable, efficient code for
determining the complete aerothermal environment of hypervelocity vehicle
designs.
