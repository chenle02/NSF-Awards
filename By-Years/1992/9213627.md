Recent increases in VLSI processor speeds have not been matched by proportionate
increase in the number of I/O pins that connect processors to off-chip memory.
Bandwidth between processor and off-chip memory has become the primary
constraint to VLSI system performance. A compression scheme know as Dynamic Base
Register Caching (DBRC) has been developed that reduces address pin requirements
by a factor of two without incurring a significant performance penalty or
implementation cost. This work will be extended along several fronts to further
reduce bandwidth requirements between processor and memory. (1) Schemes that
have the potential to achieve even higher levels of compression by exploiting
successor information to predict address references will be explored. (2)
Analogous compression schemes for data will be investigated. (Preliminary
measurements show that data, like address information, is highly redundant, so a
simple compression scheme may be possible.) (3) Finally, trace data will be
analyzed to establish tight upper and lower bounds on the information content of
address and data reference streams. Accurate bounds will indicate how much
compression is possible, as well as how much schemes can be improved.
