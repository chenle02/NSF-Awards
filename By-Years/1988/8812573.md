Title: Isolation and Characterization of Spore-Forming Bacteria From Salt
Marshes; A Study of Prodaryotic Adaptation to Salt Marsh Conditions This is a
Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant to study the sporulation and
germination of bacteria. The investigator will use the B. subtilis strain
because it is easily cultivated and offers opportunities for biochemical and
genetic analysis. In addition, the study will allow comparisons of these
processes in other species. The planning period will provide time and support
for the investigator to grow and characterize several bacterial strains and
establish contacts with established laboratories working in this area.
