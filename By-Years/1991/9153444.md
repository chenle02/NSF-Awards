Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), in collaboration with the Boston
Housing Authority (BHA-Public Safety Division), Federated Dorchester
Neighborhood Association, and the eastern zone Boston pubic elementary schools
is developing a model program, the Summer/Winter Camp in Applied Technology. The
purpose of the program is to stimulate the curiosity and interest of elementary
school age (grade 3 and 4) minority students in mathematics, science and
technology. Studies have shown that the time to influence young people's career
choices is in elementary school. WIT is conducting a program that demonstrates
the practical application of mathematics and science by clarifying the part
these subjects play in preparing for careers in applied technology. The camp
curriculum encourages hand-on participation through laboratory projects in
manufacturing technology, computer science, mechanical engineering and civil
engineering/building construction. The underlying theme of the camp curriculum
is how things break, how things work, how things are built , and how people
solve problems. The curriculum is based on the mathematics and science
objectives of the targeted school district. The technical components of the camp
are balanced by a sports program that enables students to learn about the
importance of good health, positive release of stress and team efforts. The
pilot for this program was held during July 1991, and was funded by the
Massachusetts Board of Regents under the Eisenhower Program as well as the
Alfred P. Sloane Foundation and local Boston industry.//
