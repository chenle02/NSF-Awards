This award supports Professor Eric Hellstrom and a junior colleague and graduate
student of the University of Wisconsin to collaborate in materials research with
Dr. P Majewski and his group at the Institute for Non-Metallic Inorganic
Materials of the University of Stuttgart. The objective of their research is to
increase the flux pinning in bismuth-based high temperature superconductors.
Their approach will be to create flux pinning centers in silver sheathed
bismuth-based tape by manipulating the chemistry of the bismuth-based
superconductor and varying the thermal processing. The collaboration brings
together the expertise of the U.S. group in the scientific issues involved in
fabricating, processing and characterizing long lengths of silver-sheathed high
temperature superconductors, with the detailed knowledge of phase relations in
the bismuth-based system generated at the University of Stuttgart. Increased
flux pinning will raise the current density that these superconductors can carry
at thirty degrees Kelvin to a level that will greatly expand the applications in
which they can be used. The complementary expertise of the U.S. and German
groups creates a uniquely qualified collaboration to pursue this valuable
objective.
