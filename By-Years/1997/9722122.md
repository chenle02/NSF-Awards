I will conduct theoretical research in the field of intermediate and low-energy
nuclear physics. The projects share, in the main, the methods and models of the
few-body problem, attention to the successful phenomenology of the strong
interaction at the hadronic and at the quark level, and use of the
electromagnetic interaction as a probe of properties of systems bound by the
strong interaction. I will continue a study of the spin structure of $^6$Li
because it is being used as a target of polarized neutrons for high-energy
experiments which seek to understand the quark-gluon structure of the nucleon.
Other projects in medium energy physics include pion production at threshold in
nucleon-nucleon collisions, and pion photo- and electroproduction from nucleons
at threshold. I will continue to study meson mixing related to the charge
asymmetry in the nuclear force, and attempt to extract low energy Lambda-neutron
scattering parameters from radiative kaon capture on the deuteron. The projects
are intended develop our understanding of the strong interaction, especially as
it manifests itself in few nucleon systems, and to support current experimental
work being done in Europe and North America.
