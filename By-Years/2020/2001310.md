The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project will be to advance space industrialization, exploration
and colonization. The Moon has mineral deposits in its soil, and extraction is
difficult. The proposed project will advance the analysis of the potential to
extract breathable oxygen, metallurgical grade metals, and semiconductor quality
silicon. This analysis extends the understanding of ultra-efficient processes
for refining materials, particularly toward advanced operations in space.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance the translation of molten regolith
electrolysis to refine lunar soil. The proposed project will: determine the
operating conditions allowing uninterruptible electrolysis, develop preliminary
designs of a molten regolith electrolysis facility, and conduct computer models
of a system to refine lunar regolith in the lunar environment.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
