Abstract C. Grigoropoulos - CTS 9710502 The principal investigators propose to
study the thermal transport in the laser heating of glass surfacrs. The foxus is
on understanding and predicting the heat transfer and surface deformations
associated with pulsed infrared laster heating. Temperatures will be measured
using time resolved pyrometry and interferometry to resolve the nature of
thermal transport at small length scales. Surface deformations will be measured
using beam deflection and will form the basis for future modeling of the
mechanial behavior of glasses at high temperatures and in radiative fields.
