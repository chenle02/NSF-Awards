The chemistry department at Susquehanna University introduces undergraduate
students to "hands-on" use of modern instruments throughout their four-year
program. Recently the department has begun interfacing major laboratory
instrumentation to computers. Currently, students use nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometry primarily for identification and characterization of organic
compounds in the sophomore organic course. This project will extend students'
experience with NMR to include computer interfacing and sophisticated
applications in physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, instrumental analysis,
biochemistry, advanced organic chemistry, and undergraduate research. Students
will use a computerized data base of NMR spectra for direct comparison of known
spectra with spectra measured in their experiments. In addition, they will have
direct experience with the advantage of multiple scans and computer enhancement
of instrument signals. This project will give the students more complete
knowledge of the varied applications of NMR spectrometry and prepare them to use
modern computer-controlled instruments in industry and postgraduate research.
