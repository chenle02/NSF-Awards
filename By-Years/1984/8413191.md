The overall aim of this study is to quantify the effects of molecular
configuration and charge on the transport of macromolecules in normal and tumor
capillary-beds. These molecules include well characterized dextrans,
immunoglobulins, and monoclonal antibodies, all tagged with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC). Experimental methods involve growing normal (mature
granulation) and tumor (VX2 Carcinoma) tissues in a transparent rabbit ear
chamber prepared routinely in the CMU laboratory. Once the tissue preparation is
mature, FITC tagged molecules are injected into the animal's circulation.
Resulting extravasation of molecules is video recorded for up to three hours
using an intravital fluorescene microscopy technique developed in the
laboratory. Since the intensity of the photo-signal is very low (i.e. 10-6 ft-
candle), a highly sensitive video camera will be purchased. Increased
sensitivity and camera resolution enable transport over a small segment of a
blood vessel to be monitored..
