DMS-0314311&lt;br/&gt;Paul Goerss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award defrays travel
costs for younger US-based participants to &lt;br/&gt;attend the Applied
Homotopy Theory Program at the University of &lt;br/&gt;Western Ontario in
September 2003. The program will consist of a &lt;br/&gt;one-week workshop for a
large range of paricipants and, for the &lt;br/&gt;remainder of the month, a
series of mini-courses to be given by &lt;br/&gt;five senior algebraic
topologists from the US and Europe. The support &lt;br/&gt;in this award will be
used excusively to support the participation &lt;br/&gt;of US based advanced
graduate students, mathematicians in post-doctoral &lt;br/&gt;positions, and a
few selected tenure-track mathematicians. Further &lt;br/&gt;information about
the conference may be found at &lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.uwo.ca/homotopy/.
