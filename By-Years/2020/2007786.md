The project will perform a deep exploration of a new category of wireless
systems -- systems that actively use wireless signals to heat objects of
interest. While there has been much work on using wireless signals to sense the
environment, the ability of wireless signals to influence the environment --
i.e., wireless actuation -- has been relatively less explored. Perhaps the most
common wireless actuation equipment is the microwave oven, which heats food
using radio waves, yet lacks the ability to precisely and programmatically cook
food according to pre-specified patterns of heating. Through this project, we
aim to develop a mechanism to effectively control wireless signals to heat
objects-of-interest at a significantly finer granularity. Beyond cooking, the
proposed work targets applications in manufacturing and control of soft robots.
The proposed work has a detailed integrated education and outreach program
including curriculum development and summer workshops for K-12 students from
underrepresented communities in Greater Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work will lead to the following intellectual contributions: (1) The
design of microwave-safe equipment to sense and modify wireless signals within a
chamber; (2) The development of algorithms and system design that actively heat
the object-of-interest according to the desired pattern in 3-D space both with
and without physical movement; (3) An end-to-end implementation of the system
and evaluation of performance for diverse tasks, including cooking,
programmatically applying heat for 3-D fabrication and design of heat-based soft
robotic systems. The proposed work will more broadly impact multiple disciplines
including wireless systems, robotics, manufacturing, and human-computer
interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
