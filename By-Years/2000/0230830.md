The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using computers to
help students learn effective problem solving skills for solving physics
problems. This is accomplished by constructing a set of computer tutorials to
help students improve their problem solving performance. The tutorial design
draws on prior research on teaching students effective problem solving skills
and using computers to provide students with individualized guidance and
feedback. These tutorials:&lt;br/&gt;(1) are highly interactive,&lt;br/&gt;(2)
make explicit the thought processes necessary for effective problem
solving,&lt;br/&gt;(3) use a modified reciprocal-teaching strategy to give
students practice in the basic cognitive functions necessary for effective
problem solving (i.e., deciding on an action, implementing that action, and
assessing the result),&lt;br/&gt;(4) provide students with individualized
guidance and feedback based on careful instructional design&lt;br/&gt;(5) be
flexible enough to accommodate the multiple solutions paths different students
might choose for solving a problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
demonstrates how technology can be used to improve education by providing
students with (1) more interactive and individualized instruction, (2)
opportunities to receive effective instruction outside the classroom, and (3)
access to alternative forms of instruction. This can be especially important to
students for whom standard instruction is insufficient.&lt;br/&gt;
