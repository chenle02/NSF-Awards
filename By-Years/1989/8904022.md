Transform faulting and plate boundary extension in the Gulf of California were
not well-established until early Pliocene time, however, earlier extensional
structures attest to consid- erable extension prior to the modern Gulf. This
extension has been attributed either to Basin and Range extension, which was
unrelated to motion along the Pacific-North American plate boundary, or to an
earlier phase of Pacific-North America defor- mation within the Gulf of
California region. To distinguish between these possibilities, this project will
study the detailed kinematics of both Miocene and Pliocene extensional faulting
near the Gulf, in the Puertecitos volcanic province of NE Baja California. Tuffs
in the area will provide stratigraphic markers and timing constraints for fault
displacement determinations. The results will help determine the amount and
timing of exten- sion, constrain the structural configuration of the normal
faults controlling the margin of the extensional province and evaluate the
evidence for a change in extension direction related to the imitation of more
rapid spreading in the Gulf of California in latest Miocene time.
