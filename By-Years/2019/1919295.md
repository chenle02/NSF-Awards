The acquisition of a flow cytometer/cell sorter will enable a multi-disciplinary
group of researchers and students at Lamar University to perform analyses that
involve quantitative single cell biological analysis and sorting. The instrument
will facilitate research associated with Alzheimer's disease therapeutic
screening and identification, high throughput drug screening, identification of
unique cancer types and markers, and analysis of environmental toxins. The
availability of this equipment will increase interdisciplinary and
interdepartmental collaborative research opportunities within Lamar University
as well as with other organizations, and it will enrich the training of graduate
and undergraduate students. Graduate and undergraduate students in microbiology,
biochemistry, chemical engineering, and civil and environmental engineering
classes will have access to this instrument, thereby strengthening curriculum
content at the undergraduate and graduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flow
cytometry/cell sorting is a technique for doing high level qualitative and
quantitative analysis on a per cell basis for large cell populations in a high-
throughput manner. The acquisition of a flow cytometer/cell sorter will generate
the capability to perform high population count, quantitative single cell
biological analysis and sorting. The availability of this instrument, therefore,
will facilitate research related to drug discovery, biofuels, environmental
impact, aging, and cancer characterization. Such work will lead to significantly
improved research related to in vitro studies, including high throughput drug
screening, the identification of unique cancer types and markers, and the
determination of environmental toxins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
