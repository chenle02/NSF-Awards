It is proposed to continue the observations of ionospheric plasma turbulence by
radar back-scatter. Observations in 1990 and 1991 greatly increased the
understanding of ionospheric Langmuir turbulence generated by a radio wave
reflected in the F-region. In the proposed observations spectra of Langmuir
turbulence will be obtained at 150 m height intervals every ms. Preliminary
results of this type obtained in August 1991 show the temporal development and
decay of the spectrum of Langmuir turbulence for 10 heights 150 m apart, for
pulsed HF transmissions of 10 ms duration at 1 ms time intervals. It is also
proposed to conduct theoretical investigations using an analytical model of
Langmuir turbulence. In that model the free Langmuir mode is considered as the
untrapped part of long wavelength plasma turbulence excited by the modulational
instability. A generalization of the existing analytical model for the case of a
finite magnetic field appropriate for the ionospheric experiments is also
proposed.
