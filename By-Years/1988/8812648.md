This project extends a test program currently in progress to include the repair
and retesting of welded steel moment connections which have been subjected to
large cyclic loads. In this manner, current techniques for repairing steel
moment frames which have experienced strong earthquake ground motion can be
critically evaluated. The current series of tests is investigating the behavior
of large scale beam to welded box column connection. They are being conducted in
concert with the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and the
Structural Engineers Association of Southern California (SEAOSC). This
investigation will help, among other things, to evaluate current field repair
procedure and the behavior of the assembly in the repaired condition.
