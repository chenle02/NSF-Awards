Transport and mixing play central roles in the circulation of the atmosphere and
oceans, the spreading of environmental pollutants, the ventilation in buildings,
the mixing of chemical substances, and many other phenomena in natural and
engineered systems. The questions of what velocity fields effectively enhance or
prevent transport and mixing, or steer quantities (such as mass concentration or
density distribution) to a desired distribution, have attracted increasing
attention. This project aims to use modern techniques from optimal control
theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, and nonconvex and nonsmooth
optimization to address these questions. The project will foster
interdisciplinary collaboration and education efforts among different research
groups and will also help train advanced undergraduate and graduate students
across fields including mathematics, mechanical engineering, and chemical
engineering to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing,
flow control, and computational methods. The objective of this research is to
establish an innovative and rigorous mathematical framework for achieving
optimal transport and mixing via active control of fluid flows. The project
focuses on (1) optimizing transport and mixing via control of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations, with internal (distributed) and boundary control
designs employed for different physical applications; (2) investigating the
transport behavior of non-dissipative scalars, both passive and active, governed
by the transport equations and addressing active transport through buoyancy-
driven flows, modeled by the 2D Boussinesq approximation; and (3) applying non-
smooth regularization to improve the sparsity of the controls. Investigation of
the existence of an optimal control, differentiability of the coupled nonlinear
system, and derivation of optimality conditions promises to launch new
directions in nonlinear control, nonconvex optimization, and nonsmooth analysis
of semi-dissipative systems. It will also contribute to the development of
effective computational methods. The optimal control synthesis developed in this
project will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in other complex
flows, such as mass transfer in electrically conducting fluids, heat exchange in
compressible flows, and double diffusion in oceanography, that are of great
interest to a broad range of scientists and engineers.
