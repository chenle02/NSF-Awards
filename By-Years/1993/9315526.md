9315526 Cummins Depolarized light scattering is used to investigate dynamical
aspects of the glass transition in a number of glass formers, including CKN,
salol, ZnCl2 and glycerol. A major objective of the research is to compare the
experimental data with the mode coupling theory (MCT) of Professor W. Gotze,
Technical University of Munich, a collaborator in the project. The researchers
will also carry out dielectric response, neutron scattering, ultrasonic, and
high-pressure measurements in collaboration with other groups in an effort to
reach a fully integrated picture of the structural relaxation processes in
supercooled liquids and to clarify their role in the glass transition. %%%
Despite much investigation, the fundamental nature of the molecular structure of
a liquid as it supercools to form a rigid glass is not understood. This project
will use a number of techniques, particularly light scattering to investigate
the glass transition and to use the results to test a recent theory of the glass
transition. ***
