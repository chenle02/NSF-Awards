This project will bring eleven students to Utah State University for an eight
week period in the summer of 1993 to work on ongoing research projects in the
Computer Science Department in the area of parallel processing. The program will
combine formal instruction in parallelism with the research work. The major
research topics which will be emphasized are partitioning programs for parallel
execution, optimization which combine fine grain parallelism with coarse grain
parallelism, and fault tolerant software systems.
