9411161 Crowley The patterns of organismal growth, development, and survival
form in the context of ecological communities. But especially for animals with
complex life cycles, causal linkages between life stages of the organism - and
among organisms within populations and communities - are often difficult to
establish and understand. In particular, the effects of predators feeding on
both other predators and their prey (omnivory), and the role of intraspecific
predation (cannibalism) clearly require additional attention. The objectives of
this proof of concept award are to (1) develop and evaluate laboratory and
semifield methods for the Epitheca cynosura system, (2) construct the quonset
array to assess feasibility of experiments, (3) initiate laboratory culture and
develop semifield methods for the Ischnura verticalis system, and (4) locate
pond systems for surveys of population dynamics. %%% This project will directly
contribute to development of life-history theory and to empirical testing of
theory in an integrated, mutually stimulatory way. The proposed work will
substantially enhance understanding of life history dynamics and its effects on
population and community structure. Finally, this research will provide insight
into how complex life cycles respond to their community context.
