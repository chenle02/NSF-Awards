Cell-cell recognition is a fundamental biological process which underlies many
critical developmental events. An example of a process which relies heavily on
cell-cell interactions is fertilization in higher plants. The research described
in this proposal is designed to contribute to our understanding of the
mechanisms which are involved in these cell-cell interactions, as well as to
increase our knowledge of how these interactions act to regulate the
fertilization process. A genetic approach will be used to identify mutations in
Arabidopsis thaliana which disrupt the process of fertilization and these
mutations will be characterized to determine which are involved in cell-cell
interactions. The genes identified by the mutations will be cloned using a
combination of RFLP mapping and "chromosome walking". The cloned genes will then
be used to characterized the expression patterns and products of the genes. In a
parallel project, a small family of Arabidopsis genes showing sequence
similarity to those involved in self-recognition during fertilization in
Brassica oleracea will be characterized to determine if any members of the
family play a role in other recognition events during fertilization. By
identifying and characterizing gene products which are part of the interaction
process we will learn about the molecular mechanisms of these interactions.
