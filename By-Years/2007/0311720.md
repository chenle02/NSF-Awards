This project is focused on efficient algorithms for performing
trusted&lt;br/&gt;computations in a networked environment, with applications
to&lt;br/&gt;cyber-security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following topics will be
investigated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Authenticated data structures and
algorithms. We will study methods&lt;br/&gt; for authenticating the results of
data structures and algorithms,&lt;br/&gt; even when those computations are
performed by an untrusted third&lt;br/&gt; party on behalf of a trusted
source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Audited algorithms. Bringing together recent
research on program&lt;br/&gt; checking and space-efficient computations for
streaming data, the&lt;br/&gt; project will explore a new computational
framework in which&lt;br/&gt; computations are performed by a community of
untrusted users and are&lt;br/&gt; checked by an external auditor with limited
computational resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is directed at a subject area of
critical importance to&lt;br/&gt;society -- methods for efficiently maintaining
the security of&lt;br/&gt;computations and computational resources, including
the networks that&lt;br/&gt;communicate vital data.&lt;br/&gt;
