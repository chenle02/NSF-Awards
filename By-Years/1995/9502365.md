This is an award under the Grants for Improving Dissertation Research Program.
This study is concerned with the environmental movement's bases of action,
composition, and organizational character. It appraises competing theories of
social movements--grievance-based, resource mobilization, and identity-based.
The research is based on face to face interviews and a mailed survey, and survey
results will be compared to a similar study conducted in 1979. %%% The research
will contribute to sociological understanding of social movements and to the
factors leading to continuity and change in the environmental movement. It will
be useful to formulating policies designed to encourage citizen participation in
efforts to protect the environment. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes
to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the
next generation of social scientists.
