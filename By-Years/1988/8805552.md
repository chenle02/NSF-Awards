The purpose of this research is to develop new and accurate analysis procedures
for solving a difficult class of static and dynamic problems in nonlinear solid
mechanics, i.e. contact problems in elasticity and plasticity with and without
friction. The two year research project involves the development of reliable
a-posteriori error estimates of problems described by variational inequalities,
development of adaptative strategies based on these error estimates and finally
an algorithm development based on the developed strategies. If an efficient
method is developed, it will enhance the quality of numerical simulation of
manufacturing processes and structural responses.
