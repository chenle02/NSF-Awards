9405310 Dyar This research seeks to examine the interrelationships among Fe3+,
H+, and bulk composition of coexisting mantle minerals from within a carefully-
constrained geologic context. Samples will be selected from Rio Grande rift and
Colorado Plateau localities which will be the sites of A U.S.G.S.
multidisciplinary transect planned for 1995. We plan to characterize Fe3+/ Fe
ratios and H+ of all coexisting minerals in mantle xenoliths collected from the
chosen localities, in order to determine regional variations in mantle redox
conditions along the transect. We will also study metasomatic redox processes in
composite mantle xenoliths with emphasis on observing redox differences and
similarities between cryptic and patent metasomatism. H+ contents of all
coexisting minerals in both unmetasomatized and composite metasomatized
xenoliths will be measured; when possible, D/H ratios will also be determined in
order to better understand the role of H+ in mantle redox processes.
