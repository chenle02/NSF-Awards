This advanced instrument for particle enumeration and sizing represents a
shared used instrument for Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institute's Department of
Biology. The roles of small, unicellular microorganisms in the sea have been
seen in recent years to be even more important than previously thought; the
smallest of size fractions, nanoplankton and ultraplankton have been found to be
far more numerous and widely occurring. The microbial processes involving these
organisms are of crucial importance in the ocean's trophic pathways and in the
decomposition of biogenic materials in the seas. Advanced counting and sizing
instruments are now essential to allow rapid quantification of the distribution,
abundance, biomass, and categorization of unicellular forms.
