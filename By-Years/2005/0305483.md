This project will operate the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies
(MACCS). These magnetometers provide important infrastructure for studying
ionospheric currents at high altitudes where energy is coupled to the ionosphere
from the magnetosphere and solar wind. In addition to the continued operation of
the MACCS magnetometers, this project will enhance the system by providing for
satellite-based communications from the magnetometer sites to the Augsburg
College computer system where the preliminary data processing is done. A web
site will also be maintained to provide free access to the data to the space
physics community. Research topics that will be undertaken include studies of
the response of ionospheric convection to changes in the interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF), traveling convection vortices, and a variety of Ultra-Low-Frequency
(ULF) wave and pulsation phenomena.
