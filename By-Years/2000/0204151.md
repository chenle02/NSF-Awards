This research focuses on the development of symbolic formulations for timing and
reliability analysis that can handle a wide range of custom-designed, complex
circuits in an efficient, cost-effective manner. This symbolic approach enables
handling of any arbitrary circuit structure and allows for an efficient means of
incorporating information on the functional operation of the circuit into the
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two areas are being explored: (1) Symbolic
algorithms are being developed to analyze electrical noise problems due to such
things as leakage currents and charge sharing. To improve accuracy, the analysis
is constrained by timing and input conditions. Based on the results of this
analysis, circuits may be flagged for design violations or automatically re-
designed to improve electrical reliability. (2) Symbolic formulations to
calculate the delay through a channel-connected region (CCR) of CMOS devices are
be developed. These formulations will handle nearly all commonly-used digital
circuit families, as well as handle multiple inputs transitioning and accept
arbitrary input-exclusivity constraints. The goal of this work is to develop an
efficient means to identify problem circuits for further analysis while avoiding
the need to verify many non-realizable worst-case conditions with other more
costly simulation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
