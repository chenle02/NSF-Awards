9407030 Hou This project will support research on several problems in the areas
of fluid mechanics and materials science. Specifically, three-dimensional
subharmonic instability of three-dimensional Stokes waves, three-dimensional
weak water-wave turbulence, singularity formation in fluid interfaces strongly
mediated by surface tension, reconnection of fluid interfaces, and interaction
of ocean free surfaces with moving objects will be studied. Investigations will
be conducted on fundamentally difficult fluid dynamical and materials problems
by developing and applying robust, efficient computational tools, including
novel time integration schemes allowing large time-steps, spectrally accurate
spatial discretizations, fast summation techniques and the level set formulation
which can effectively compute flows undergoing topological changes. Large-scale
computation and computational mathematics are now primary tools in studying
physical processes characterized by randomness and strong nonlinearity. Such
processes include complex pattern formation and growth problems in diffusion
dominated systems, and wave interactions on the ocean's free surface. Closely
related are problems with singular or near singular behavior, such as flows
undergoing changes in topological type, or the breaking of water waves. These
fluid dynamical and materials problems will be studied by developing and
applying state-of-the-art numerical methods to large-scale computation, and
through analytical, numerical and modeling studies of important constituent
processes. The research will promote inter-disciplinary interactions among
applied mathematicians, physicists and material scientists and should have a
potential impact in application areas such as high performance computation,
interfacial fluid dynamics, and materials science. The work on water waves would
have application to the study of radar scattering from free surfaces. The work
on Ostwald ripening provides more detailed inf ormation on the state of
materials whose manufacture depends on phase transitions.
