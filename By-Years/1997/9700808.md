9700808 Satija This grant will support the work of a female theorist who has a
research program of international recognition with a strong participation of
undergraduate students. The research involves properties of systems with
competing length scales. One of the important aspects of these systems is the
existence of an exotic phase with fractal characteristics. The conceptual
linkage through much of this work is the relationship between localization (and
many phenomena related to localization) and the universal Fractal fluctuations.
The proposed systems under investigation include quantum chaos models exhibiting
dynamical localization and classical driven oscillators with strange non-chaotic
attractors. These systems will be studied by using a renormalization methodology
developed recently by the PI and her collaborators. The possible applications
include a microscopic model of friction and magnetic properties of superlattices
exhibiting giant magnetoresistance. %%% This grant supports theoretical research
of a female PI. The research on nonlinear dynamical systems involves
sophisticated mathematical techniques with active participation by undergraduate
and graduate students. It is part of an internationally recognized program with
long- standing collaborations with colleagues from around the world. Her work
has applications to several currently active areas in materials; including
microscopic models of friction and properties of magnetic superlattices. ***
