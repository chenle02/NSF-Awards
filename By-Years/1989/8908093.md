The purpose of this proposal is to acquire a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectrometer capable of structural analyses of biological macromolecules.
With a combination of isotopic labeling techniques and this very high field NMR
spectrometer, it is the goal of the user group to extend the molecular weight
range of the molecules which can be analyzed (15-40 kilodalton range).
Researchers from the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell
Biology, the Department of Chemistry and the Medical School have initiated a
structural biology research program which this proposal will support. The
research to be supported by this high field instrument is centered in five
areas. These are: (1) Mechanisms and dynamics of proteins; (2) Antitumor agents
and carcinogenesis; (3) Complexes with DNA and enzyme inhibitors; (4)
Respiratory enzymes and photosynthesis; (5) Membrane signaling and receptors.
The investigators in this user group require the higher dispersion and
sensitivity of this spectrometer.
