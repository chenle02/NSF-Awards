With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University in Newark will
acquire a dual non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) system for
ultrafast electron transfer studies. This equipment will enhance research in the
following areas: a) ultrafast long-distance electron injection in dye-sensitized
solar cells; b) conformationally gated electron transfer in bio-mimetic peptide
systems; c) ultrafast fragmentation reactions of carbenes; and d) photoinduced
electron transfer in host-guest assemblies and at interfaces.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation will be shared by faculty at the
Newark and New Brunswick campuses of Rutgers University. Several of the projects
have direct implications for the design of new hybrid solar energy conversion
materials. &lt;br/&gt;
