The Grid-Connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES) IUCRC proposes
renewal as a two-site I/UCRC, comprising personnel and facilities at the
University of Arkansas (lead) and the University of South Carolina with a focus
on developing the new knowledge, tools, hardware, software, and personnel that
are required to pervasively insert power electronics into the 21st century power
grid in ways that will strengthen and modernize the grid. GRAPES makes use of an
already-developed facility for design, development, &lt;br/&gt;test, evaluation,
and standardization of distribution-level grid-connected power electronic
equipment. This enables validation of research findings, and accelerated
insertion of new solid-state equipment into the power grid at both source and
load ends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power electronics in grid applications are
essential to achieving efficient power systems of high reliability and
resiliency. The I/UCRC in Phase II will train students and practicing engineers
who will become qualified to develop and manage the next generation of power
systems, thereby helping to mitigate the forecasted shortage of power engineers.
GRAPES will establish new courses that will integrate research with education to
make our students highly competitive in their ownership of unique skills and
knowledge.
