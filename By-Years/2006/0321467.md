In 2001, maize became the number one production crop in the world, and current
US maize production is almost four times wheat and rice production combined.
Maize (or corn) is also the single most diverse crop species, containing
tremendous variation in morphological and physiological traits and extensive
polymorphism in its DNA sequences. This exceptional diversity allows maize to be
cultivated in a range of environments including parts of Africa, the Amazonian
rainforest, Arizona deserts, the Gaspe peninsula in Canada, and the Andes
Mountains at heights above 3500 m elevation. The challenges for modern
biologists are to describe the genes that control the diverse phenotypes and
adaptation of maize, to identify the useful variants (alleles) at these genes,
and to establish a high-throughput, high-resolution platform for finding and
evaluating allelic variation throughout the genome and the breadth of the gene
pool. This project will meet these challenges. First, the project will perform
marker discovery for 1000 genes in diverse maize inbred and teosinte lines to
identify an unbiased set of markers for molecular diversity analysis. Second,
the project will analyze the sequences of 4,000 genes in diverse types of maize
and wild maize (teosinte). This data will provide a direct measure of the amount
and distribution of molecular variation in the maize genome and enable the
identification of genes that have been selected by humans over the past 10,000
years to adapt maize to diverse environments and to improve the agronomic
performance of maize. Third, the project will include functional assays of 750
genes in order to determine which traits they control and at which alleles these
genes confer the best agronomic qualities.

This work will produce two major resources: (1) a large database of validated
molecular polymorphisms throughout the genome, and (2) a set of maize and
teosinte lines that can be used for gene mapping for almost any trait. These
results and products will be made available to a wide range of researchers
through public depositories such as the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center
(http://www.ag.uiuc.edu/maize-coop), North Central Regional Plant Introduction
Station (http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/MidWest/Ames/), Gramene
(http://www.gramene.org) and Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/).
Additionally, the project will make this research accessible to a wide range of
people through outreach programs. The project will focus on transmitting the
excitement of science and knowledge of maize to students in rural schools and
through mentoring programs, with an emphasis on broadening participation.
