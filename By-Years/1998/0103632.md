NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0103632&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences:
Analytical Approaches to Singular &lt;br/&gt;Perturbation Problems of
Significance in Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0103632&lt;br/&gt;O'Malley&lt;
br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop asymptotic methods to solve
&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear singularly perturbed boundary value problems &lt;br/&gt;for
both ordinary and partial differential equations. A &lt;br/&gt;special emphasis
will be the systematic development of &lt;br/&gt;renormalization methods, which
theoretical physicists &lt;br/&gt;have proposed as a unified tool for asymptotic
analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Another will be continued investigation of metastable
&lt;br/&gt;dynamics for algebraic, as well as exponential,
&lt;br/&gt;asymptotics. The problems are related since they both &lt;br/&gt;deal
with long-time asymptotics and the classical method &lt;br/&gt;of multiple
scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asymptotic methods, like computation, provide an
&lt;br/&gt;important way to find approximate solutions to nonlinear
&lt;br/&gt;problems arising in significant applications. This work
&lt;br/&gt;seeks to further develop such analytical techniques and &lt;br/&gt;to
apply them in engineering and the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
