9402170 Dolan, Charles W. This project is a three year study to evaluate the
sustained load capacity of available fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) tendons for
application as reinforcement is reinforced and prestressed concrete structures.
The proposal addresses the following major areas: - The creep-rupture
characteristics of FRP reinforcement. - The long term characteristics of FRP
reinforcement. - Compare the creep-rupture behavior of FRP reinforcement in air
and in concrete structure. - The strain reserve of FRP reinforcement at the end
of 30 months of extended environmental exposure in a concrete - structure. ***
