Opportunities for enhancing undergraduate education in geosciences via a range
of computer-based technologies are growing extremely rapidly. These
opportunities include models and visualizations of processes that take place at
large space and/or time scales, maps and satellite imagery, digitizers, large
data bases, and software for data analysis. The objective of this proposal is to
significantly improve the education we provide by increasing our capabilities to
incorporate these opportunities in courses for our general education students
and undergraduate majors in geology, hydrology, earth sciences, earth sciences
teaching, and ultimately an emerging marine sciences curriculum. To accomplish
this, we are seeking funding for the purchase of 16 personal computers that
would be installed in a computer classroom and linked into the department and
University networks and the Internet, along with basic software that will allow
us to run the applications we have identified.
