A computer-interfaced Differential Scanning Calorimeter is being used in the
polymer chemistry laboratory course for advanced undergraduates in chemistry and
textile chemistry at Southeastern Massachusetts University. A class project
orientation is used in which students prepare a series of liquid crystal
polymers with different structures. Characterization data is obtained using the
calorimeter and students pool their results to reach conclusions on
structure/property relationships.
