The research involves empirical and theoretical inquiry into techniques for
combining simple oscillators to produce new and more complex robot behaviors
from existing simpler ones. Previously funded work in the PI's laboratory has
already demonstrated that simple oscillators can be used to confer upon a robot
superlative but narrow dynamical dexterity. The present study attempts to
demonstrate that effective coupling techniques for such existing behavioral
mechanisms can confer a much broader range of behavior. The empirical project
addresses a robotic manipulation scenario termed ``Sensor Driven Dynamical Pick
and Place.'' In this scenario, the robot uses a flat paddle to acquire balls
thrown into the workspace; balance or bat them as required through a clutter;
loft them into an out-of-reach destination receptacle; and resistunanticipated
perturbations along the way. The recourse to oscillators reflects an almost
exclusive theoretical focus on event driven manipulation. Such a commitment to
feedback control addresses the fact that failures in machine reliability
frequently occur because of events which are not intrinsically unrecoverable but
which violate our models dramatically and cannot be anticipated. The focus on
error detection and recovery in a dynamical setting brings into correspondence
the concerns of the decade old (and still vigorously developing) fine motion
planning literature and certain concepts and analytical tools from the century
old (and still vigorously developing) dynamical systems literature that have
proven useful in the PI's previously funded work.
