CTS-9220196 University of Massachusetts Ka M. Ng ABSTRACT Research in this
project focuses on establishing basic steps for the separation of two- and
three-solute mixtures by crystallization. Tetrahedral phase diagrams for a
three-solute system include 3 vertices for the pure solute compositions and a
fourth for the solvent. These diagrams can be used to design separations
processes based on crystallization in which eutectic surfaces are crossed by
solvent addition, removal, or stream combination. Experimental work on model and
industrially important systems is to confirm new separation schemes, determine
optimum operating conditions, and establish guidelines for solvent selection.
Combination of extractive crystallization with other techniques will also be
explored. Half or more of the cost of producing pharmaceutical drugs and other
important chemicals is often attributed to separation and purification. New
strategies for crystallization can improve product quality and lower cost for
the consumer. 196 University of Massachusetts Ka M. Ng ABSTRACT Research in this
