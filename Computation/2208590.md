Transport in porous media occurs in a broad range of real world problems, e.g.,
CO2 sequestration and delivery of therapy agents to tumor sites. This project
aims at development of robust and efficient numerical simulation toolboxes for
such multi-scale multi-physics processes. This will enhance our understanding of
these complicated phenomena and accordingly have further impact on better use of
natural resources and cures for diseases. The project will also provide hands-on
training opportunities for students.

The focus of this project is on design, analysis, implementation, and
applications of a family of novel numerical methods for subdiffusive transport
in poroelastic media. Novel finite element methods will be developed for
approximating solid displacement, fluid pressure, and concentration of substance
being transported. Conditions for stable coupling of sub-problem solvers will be
investigated. These methods will be applied to simulations of drug delivery,
tissue engineering, and reservoir engineering, and other similar multi-physics
processes. These novel solvers will be implemented as C++ and Matlab code
modules that are openly accessible to the scientific computing community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
