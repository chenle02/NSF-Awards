Fan-shaped features (fans) in the southern Blue Ridge province are essentially
mantled pediments. The mantles, ranging in thickness from 1 to 30 m, consist of
diamictons (probably debris flows) and alluvium, and commonly is separated from
underlying metamorphic bedrock by a layer of saprolite. Rather than the
depositional mechanisms that have been the focus of previous studies of Blue
Ridge fans, the thrust of this study is to understand these landforms in the
light of previous research on pediments in arid and semiarid regions. Fans in
five areas will be mapped using aerial photographs and soil properties to
delineate terraces of different ages; standard soil-development indices will be
used to estimate ages of the terraces. Seismic refraction and reflection as well
as drilling will be used to determine sediment and saprolite thickness and
subsurface relief on terraces of different ages. In order to ascertain factors
necessary for fan formation, areas with fans will be compared with other areas
in the Blue Ridge lacking fans with respect to piedmont and basin morphometry,
lithology, soils, and maximum clast size. A hypothesis to be tested is that fans
occur only where uplands occur only where uplands supply great numbers of large
boulders to the mountain piedmont.
