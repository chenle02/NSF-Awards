In the course of empirical research or policy analysis, economists typically
estimate sophisticated high-dimensional models. There are a set of standard
estimation methods developed for these purposes, and these estimators share the
property that they have approximate normal distributions. However, it is well
known that normally-distributed estimators can be improved (have reduced risk)
if they are shrunk towards a pre-specified point in the parameter space (a
restriction or simpler model of interest). This suggests that common econometric
estimators can be improved by shrinkage towards restricted estimators.

This proposal suggests that this insight can be made rigorous. The PI develops
general shrinkage estimators whose risk (the statistical expected loss) is
smaller than conventional estimators. These new estimators are efficient,
meaning that their risk is the lowest possible among all feasible estimators.
This project proposes efficient methods for both parametric models (those
defined by a finite set of parameters) and semiparametric models (when some
features of the model are treated as nonparametric or high dimensional).

Closely related to the question of efficient estimation is the technique of
model selection and combination. These issues are particularly relevant for
economic forecasting, where forecast combination is routinely applied, yet
little theoretical guidance exists for selection of the combination weights.
This proposal focuses on developing rigorous criteria for selection of
combination weights in the context of multi-step forecasts. Multi-step forecasts
are critical for policy analysis, yet have particular technical challenges. This
project investigates methods for direct forecasts, iterated forecasts, and
forecast intervals.

The econometric methods developed in this proposal are expected to have broad
application in applied economic analysis, policy analysis, and economic
forecasting. It is expected that the theory and methods uncovered by this
research will find productive use by applied economists, statisticians, and
other social scientists both in academics and the public sector.
