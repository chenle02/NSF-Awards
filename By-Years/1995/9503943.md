9503943 Doherty The long range objectives of this program are to develop a
deeper understanding of the evolution of the microstructure in metallic alloys
during processing. Such understanding will provide important clues for
developing new alloys and processing methods with improved properties. The
specific objective of this project is to develop a better understanding of the
thermo-mechanical deformation behavior of a class of metals typified by
Multiphase (MP) Alloys of which MP35N (35 % Co, 35 % Ni, 10 % Mo, 20 % Cr) is an
example. This materials has high strength, high ductility, high fracture
toughness, high corrosion resistance, and retains its room temperature strength
to 6000C. ***
