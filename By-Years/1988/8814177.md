Mathematicians at Ithaca College plan to develop a problem-based mainstream
calculus curriculum. These complex problems will require a minimum of several
weeks to solve. The structure of the problems will vary from "case study" to
"open-ended". Groups of students working together will solve problems which
develop essential parts of the calculus, and use calculator/computers where
relevant. In-depth interviews with twenty-five faculty members from accounting,
biology, chemistry, economics, finance, management, politics, psychology,
physics will identify realistic problems. Two experimental courses sections of
Calculus I will be taught in the Fall of 1989. In the Spring of 1989 a one-day
conference on the "Future of Calculus" will be held at Ithaca College. Ithaca
College will share 45% of the cost of the project.
