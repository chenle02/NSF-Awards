Chain and sheet silicates are important minerals in metamorphic rocks because of
their common occurence and their usefulness in isotopic dating. Most radiometric
mineral dates record the times which the minerals cooled through their blocking
temperatures for isotopic diffusion and these differ for the various isotopes
and the various chain and sheet silicates. Geologists exploit this variability
to delineate the "temperature versus time" histories of metamorphic terranes.
The calculated blocking temperatures for many minerals, however, such as for
argon in hornblende and micas, is poorly constrained unless one assumes a
diffusion geometry reflecting the anisotropy of these silicate lattices, and a
diffusion dimension (or radius) reflecting their microtextural homogeneity. By
measuring the argon spatial distribution in both natural and hydrothermally
treated samples of hornblende, biotite, and muscovite with the laser microprobe,
it is planned to estimate these properties. These estimates will be further
tested by observing microtextures of the minerals with the transmission electron
microscope (TEM). Results from the controlled heating experiments will also
facilitate interpretation of the spatial information being derived from
40Ar/39Ar laser microprobes.
