The principal investigator's research will consist of two separate lines of
study. The first is a study of characterizations of what are called "phase type"
distributions. These are natural extensions of the classic Erlang distributions
and have usefulness in areas such as reliability, queueing or computer
performance analysis. The second part of this study will extend the notion of
phase type distributions to phase type processes.
