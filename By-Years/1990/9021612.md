Nerve cells undergo dynamic changes during development as well as after
reaching maturity. During development the establishment of specific
interconnected neural networks is accomplished, in part, by the removal of
extraneous or inappropriate connections ("synapses"). Similar structural changes
in synapses ("plasticity") can also occur in the mature nervous system following
appropriate environmental stimuli including those associated with learning and
memory. The research technique involves the use of a simple culture system of
nerve cells isolated from the marine invertebrate, Aplysia. Using this model
system one can examine whether common mechanisms are responsible for synapse
elimination during development and synapse plasticity under conditions which
simulate learning and memory in the adult. One important advantage of this model
system is that changes in the same set of connections can be compared during
development and in the mature nervous system. An understanding of these
mechanisms may provide insight into process of development of the nervous system
and abnormalities which may occur in adults.
