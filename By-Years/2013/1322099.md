The PIs develop and test the theory and algorithms for a new sampling and
reconstruction framework that combines spatial samples of an initial state
together with the early time samples of an evolving state to reconstruct the
initial distribution and the possibly unknown evolution operator. Using the
evolutionary nature of a signal, the PIs aim to recover an initial distribution
at a fine resolution from multiple coarse snapshots obtained at appropriate time
intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most important aspects of
the proposed research is to provide the means to detect potential threats to
society (such as chemical, nuclear or biological hazards) using a network of
distributed sensors such as the smartphones people carry, rapidly gather and
process the information about the threats source location and its distribution
and evolution in time, and generate alerts so that appropriate measures are
taken to safeguard life and infrastructure. The same ideas can be used in other
industrial or biomedical applications in which the time-dependency between
samples permits reduction in the number of expensive instruments via the
increase of their usage frequency.
