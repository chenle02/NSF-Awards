Funds are requested for an investigation of the polypeptide content of the
shells of Recent, Pleistocene, and Pliocene brachiopod genera in an attempt to
assess the potential and limitations of serotaxonomy and polypeptide analysis in
extant and fossil shells of varying age. We plan to use immunological methods to
see if differences in cross-reactivity can be detected between these brachiopod
genera, and between their superfamilies. Preliminary work shows that these
brachiopods have amino acids present as peptides within their shell material. It
is proposed to investigate these remnant macromolecules in the shells of
brachiopods of different ages. Amino acids from the fossil shells will be
analysed for enantiomorphy as a test for recent contamination. Work on extant
material will serve to fine-tune our methods, and work on Pleistocene and
Pliocene samples should help us measure the increasing effect of time and
diagenesis in the anticipated destruction of shell protein, and should show
whether similar work on increasingly older fossil shells is likely to prove
worthwhile.
