The Department of Meteorology at University of Utah requests matching funds to
assist in the building of a meteorological computation and visualization
laboratory for undergraduate education and scientific research. Funds requested
would be used to purchase four workstations that will complement additional
hardware acquired by the University. The improvements enabled by the University
upgrades and the Unidata equipment award will allow the department to continue
it role as an archived data acquisition site for the Unidata community and,
coupled with the vBNS, become a real-time data distribution site for the Unidata
network.
