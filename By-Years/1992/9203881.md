Several times a year, usually in the months from May to September, a mesoscale
vortex called the "Catalina Eddy" interrupts the prevailing fair weather
patterns of coastal southern California and imposes a dramatically different
wind, cloud and temperature regime for up to a week at a time including
pollutant transport patterns that radically depart from the usual. From
observational analyses, researchers have identified three factors that might
have a strong influence on the formation of the eddy. These are topographic
relief, strong northerly airflow and diurnal surface heating. Under this
Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Principal investigator will
use a numerical model to simulate the Catalina Eddy for the purpose of better
understanding of the influence of these three factors.
