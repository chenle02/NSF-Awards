This project develops proof-of-concept examples for a novel graph visualization
technique named Link Free Graph Visualization (LFGV). The research addresses
problems in existing graph visualization techniques: (1) becoming cluttered when
visualizing large graphs; (2) having limited applicability to complex graphs,
such as graphs with high dimensional node attributes and time evolving graphs;
(3) misleading users due to the information loss caused by 2D or 3D node layouts
and efforts toward increasing scalability.

The research leads to new graph visualization techniques with better
scalability, better applicability to complex graphs, and less misleading
insights than NLDs. LFGV first projects a graph to a multidimensional space
while preserving major graph topology information. LFGV then uses extended
multidimensional visualization techniques to visualize the projection for
exploring graph topology and other information carried by the graph, such as
multidimensional node attributes. This project develops a working LFGV prototype
for plain/multivariate graphs and conducts evaluations to prove that LFGV is
viable. It also develops a weblog visual analysis approach to provide a test bed
and an application example for LFGV.

Graph visualization is widely used in lots of applications, such as social
network analysis, bioinformatics, and web information exploration. LFGV impacts
the application fields where large complex graphs need to be analyzed. The
weblog visual analysis approach has a direct impact on online information
browsing, retrieval, and analysis. The project publishes software for research
and educational purposes.
