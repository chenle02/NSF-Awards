Specialized upper-division laboratories in fields of contemporary interest are
an important component of a vital physics curriculum. This Occidental College
Physics Department project is developing two such laboratories in the areas of
solid state and plasma physics. These laboratories, to be taken concurrently
with lecture courses already offered by the department, complement the lecture
presentation of particular topics as well as broaden the scope of these courses
by introducing students to experimental techniques of the type used in current
scientific research.In the solid state laboratory, students investigate
important condensed matter phenomena such as resistivity, the polarity of charge
carriers, the crystalline bandgap, electron-hole recombination, impurity doping
of a semiconductor, and semiconductor statistics. The experiments familiarize
students with cryogenic techniques and introduce state-of-the-art
instrumentation such as a lock-in amplifier, scanning monochromator and
digitizing oscilloscope. Many of the experiments involve computer-controlled
data acquisition and sophisticated data analysis schemes (e.g., boxcar
correlator).The plasma laboratory, the first of its kind at a small liberal arts
college, is based on two custom made plasma-containment machines: the double
plasma and the pure electron plasma devices. Through seven experiments, students
explore single particle drifts, plasma wave dispersion and damping, plasma
stability, and transport. Additionally, students become acquainted with vacuum
technology and computer- controlled data acquisition/analysis techniques.NSF
grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
