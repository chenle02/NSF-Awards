Theoretical Studies and Interstellar Matter. Dr. Dalgarno will direct
theoretical studies of photon-dominated regions of interstellar matter,
incorporating the photodestruction of molecular ions. The ionization structure
of such regions will be calculated. The photodissociation of molecular nitrogen
will be included in a study of nitrogen chemistry. Regions subjected to intense
X-ray fluxes will be investigated, and the infrared response of molecular
hydrogen will be obtained. The thermal and chemical structure of supernova
remnant SN 1987A will be investigated. Calculations of charge transfer of
ionized helium will be performed.
