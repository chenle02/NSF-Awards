Public, online harassment takes many forms, but at its core are posts that are
offensive, threatening, and intimidating. It is not an isolated problem. The Pew
Research Center found 73% of people had witnessed harassment online, and a full
40% of people had experienced harassment directly. This research develops a
method for analyzing the things people post online, and automatically detecting
which posts fall into the category of severe public online harassment --
messages posted simply to disrupt, offend, or threaten others. This helps
websites better limit what messages are posted and reduce the amount of
harassment people experience online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers
develop a corpus of online comments from a number of media outlets and social
media platforms where each post is labeled as harassing or non-harassing. Then,
they apply a set of computational linguistic techniques that describe features
of the message, including types of words and language structure, which is passed
to rule-based and machine learning artificial intelligence systems for
classification. The goal is to develop models that can automatically detect the
public online harassment messages with high accuracy.
