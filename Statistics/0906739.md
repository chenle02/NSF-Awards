This research project aims to develop robust estimation methods for various non-
and semiparametric frontier models using the efficient polynomial spline
quantile smoothing method. More specifically, the objectives of the proposed
research include: to propose an easy-to-use robust estimation procedure for non-
and semi-parametric frontier models; to develop an innovative penalized
polynomial spline quantile regression for variable selection and efficient
estimation of non- and semi-parametric frontier models; to study the asymptotic
properties and develop efficient numerical algorithms of the proposed methods.
The P.I. also plans to investigate polynomial spline estimations of flexible
semiparametric ARCH models and formulate a nonparametric likelihood ratio test
based on polynomial spline estimation to make inferences of the coefficient
functions in the semiparametric ARCH model.

The proposed research generates new methods and theories of curve fitting. The
results of the proposed research are very useful for researchers in a wide range
of fields. For example, it can be used to enhance the understanding of the
impact of the macro economic variables on the stock prices and benefit
investment banks to help improve risk management. Furthermore, the proposed
research will be incorporated into teaching activities through development of a
graduate course on nonparametric methods and time series analysis, which
promotes involvement of students in the research of current sciences.
