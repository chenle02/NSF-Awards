To be useful in warehouses, homes, and other environments from schools to retail
stores, robots will need to learn how to robustly manipulate a wide variety of
objects. For instance, to enhance the productivity of human workers, service and
factory robots could keep specified surfaces clear by identifying, grasping, and
relocating objects to appropriate locations. Pre-programming robots to perform
such complex manipulation tasks is not feasible; instead this project will
investigate scalable robot manipulation, where multiple robots collaboratively
learn from multiple humans. The project will contribute new models, algorithms,
software, and experimental data to advance the state-of-the-art in deep
learning, human-robot interaction, and cloud robotics. To broadly convey the
results of this research to students and the public, the project will create a
book and video with the Lawrence Hall of Science and the African Robotics
Network.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Two primary gaps in current understanding of co-
robotic Learning from Demonstration (LfD) are: 1) the absence of a theoretical
framework that encompasses humans and robots to produce cooperative learning
behaviors as optimal solutions; and 2) the lack of research linking LfD with
deep learning, hierarchical planning, and human-robot interaction. The project
addresses those gaps with a unified theoretical framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning and game-theoretic models of communication between humans
and robots, treating LfD as a scalable co-robotic process in which multiple
humans and multiple networked robots work in a distributed set of environments
to maximize a collective set of reward functions and humans learn how to become
more effective demonstrators for robots. The research can be applied to almost
any context where robots can learn from human demonstrations and will be
evaluated in "surface decluttering" benchmarks of increasing complexity over the
course of the project.
