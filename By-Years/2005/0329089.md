Increasingly, users of information appliances -- cell phones, personal digital
assistants, and the like -- are using them to communicate textual information,
and finding them difficult to interact with. The properties that make the
devices useful in the first place (size, mobility, embeddedness) are exactly the
properties that make inputting text difficult. The principal investigator is
developing ways to make use of the intrinsic redundancy of natural language to
dramatically improve the efficiency with which natural language text can be
entered into such devices. This redundancy accounts, for instance, for our
ability to read compressed text such as "Cn u rd ths?". If information
appliances could also read such highly abbreviated text with high reliability,
abbreviated text could be used to speed up text
input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing systems to decode text compressed in such
a "human-centered" manner requires advances in modeling of the compression
method and in user interface techniques that allow interactive correction of any
mistakes in the computer's understanding of the compressed text. This research
addresses the required advances by exploiting statistical language modeling
techniques to address the challenges involved in minimizing cognitive load on
the user. Such an ability would dramatically simplify and expand the process of
communicating with and through computer and telecommunications system using
text, and expand the base of potential environments where text input could occur
and users who could participate. Similarly, benefits would accrue to disabled
users and others operating under degraded conditions.&lt;br/&gt;
