This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Robert H. Klenke, will work with Dr. James
Aylor on problems involving automatic test generation using parallel computers.
The research will be to generate automatic test patterns for VLSI devices using
parallel computers. Current state-of-the-art test pattern generation algorithms
are primarily implemented on single processor computers. Because VLSI devices
are increasingly being incorporated into products and because the size of recent
devices requires long running times on even high speed serial computers, it is
important to make use of the new generation of parallel computers. This
postdoctoral associate will be developing a complete parallel automatic test
pattern generation and fault simulation system.
