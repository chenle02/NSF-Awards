Leaves of seed plants are formed from the flanks of apical meristems. Therefore,
an inherent positional relationship exists between them: organ primordia have an
adaxial side adjacent to the meristem, and an abaxial one away from the
meristem. Surgical and genetic studies suggest that a morphogenetic gradient,
whose source is the meristem, converts the inherent polarity into a functional
one. Once an adaxial-abaxial axis of polarity is established within organ
primordia, it provides cues for proper lamina growth and asymmetric development.
Several key players involved in this process were identified recently, and
analyses of these genes support and refine our views of axis formation in
plants. Members of two gene families, the KANADIs and YABBYs, promote abaxial
fates, and their expression is confined top the abaxial domains of developing
lateral organs. When adaxial factors are active abaxially, the expression of the
abaxial factors is eliminated, and vice versa. Thus, the adaxial and abaxial
factors are expressed in mutually exclusive domains. The aim of this proposal is
the characterization of the KANADIs, focusing on the role of the KANADIs in
repressing adaxial factors, and the role of the KANADIs in promoting lamina
expansion through the activity of the YABBYs. Experiments are proposed to
address whether the interaction between the KANADIs and the adaxial factors and
the YABBYs is direct or indirect and whether KANADI dependent lamina expansion
is mediated via YABBY activity. Finally, experiments to integrate hypotheses
based on classical meristem dissection experiments with genes identified via
genetics are proposed. The basic research proposed should provide a foundation
of knowledge to facilitate the modification of plant architecture. Since leaves
provide the source of the majority of photosynthate, modification of their
structure to maximize this process has the potential to increase agricultural
productivity in many crop species.
