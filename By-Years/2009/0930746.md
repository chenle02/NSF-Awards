CPS: Small: Design of Networked Control Systems for Chemical
Processes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of the proposed research program is to develop, for the first time,
the theory and methods needed for the design of networked control systems for
chemical processes and demonstrate their application and effectiveness in the
context of process systems of industrial importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed approach to achieving this objective involves the development of a
novel mathematical framework based on nonlinear asynchronous systems to model
the sensor and actuator network behavior accounting explicitly for the effect of
asynchronous and delayed measurements, network communication and actuation.
Within the proposed asynchronous systems framework, novel control methods will
be developed for the design of nonlinear networked control systems that improve
closed-loop stability, performance and robustness. The controller design methods
will be based on nonlinear and predictive control theory and will have provable
closed-loop properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development and implementation
of networked control methods which take advantage of sensor and actuator
networks is expected to significantly improve the operation and performance of
chemical processes, increase process safety and reliability, and minimize the
negative economic impact of process failures, thereby impacting directly the US
economy. The integration of the research results into advanced-level classes in
process control and the writing of a new book on ``Networked Process Control''
will benefit students and researchers in the field. The development of software,
short courses and workshops and the on-going interaction of the PIs with an
industrial consortium will be the means for transferring the results of this
research into the industrial sector. Furthermore, the involvement of a diverse
group of undergraduate and graduate students in the research will be pursued.
