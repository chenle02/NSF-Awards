This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Closs at the University of Chicago. The results of this research will
be of central importance in the areas of physical organic chemistry and
biophysics. Intramolecular electron transfer and energy transfer processes will
be studied in rigid molecules. Individual factors that govern these processes
can then be determined. Dr. Closs proposes to effect intramolecular electron
transfer by means of pulse radiolysis in rigid molecules. By this means the
effects of free energy of reaction, distance over which electron transfer
occurs, stereochemistry, solvent effects, and temperature effects may be
analyzed. In these rigid molecules, it is expected that these effects may be
analyzed by the examination of the structure of the molecule. In a similar
manner, triplet energy transfer will be studied. Short-lived biradicals in
solution will be examined by a newly developed EPR technique in a related study.
