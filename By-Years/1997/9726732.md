This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
at the development of high performance magnets. The collaboration involves the
research groups of William J. James at the University of Missouri at Rolla and
Philippe l'Heritier of the Ecole Normale Superieure de Physique, Grenoble,
France. The investigators will focus on the synthesis and characterization of
rare earth transition metal alloys. Nitrogen, carbon and boron will be inserted
interstitially and the resulting compounds will be analyzed and characterized by
magnetic, thermal and x-ray measurement. The US investigators will employ
neutron diffraction to provide site-specific information and information about
magnetic structure. The French investigators will carry out the thermal analysis
using x-ray diffraction. The US investigators bring to this collaboration
expertise in magnetic characterization and neutron diffraction techniques. This
is complemented by French expertise in chemical and thermal analyses and in low
temperature x-ray studies. The project will advance understanding of the
magnetic structure needed for the development of high energy magnets.
