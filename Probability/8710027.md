The investigator will study Markov processes with random times of birth and
death. Such processes have connections with perturbation theory and Kuznetsov
processes. The investigator will find new applications of these processes and
compare different versions of processes such as quasi-Markov processes, Markov
processes with "creation and annihilation" and Kuznetsov processes. The
comparison will begin by linking all these processes to Meyer's "energy
functional". Some work has been done in this area already by the investigator as
well as other researchers. This research will look at the remaining problems.
