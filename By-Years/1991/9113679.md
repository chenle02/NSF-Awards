This research examines the fragmentation of dendrites during solidification and
their subsequent effects on refining the cast microstructure. Possible
mechanisms of dendrite fracture in the semi-liquid/semi-solid state are examined
to determine effects of electromagnetic-induced fluid flow and/or mechanical-
driven flow on the process. Modeling of the flow behavior for simple and more
complex geometries is planned. Cast geometries are employed that permit
calculation of the interdendritic flow imposed by the force field. Optimum
methods for dendrite breakup are expected to result from the research. %%% This
research has potential future application in the casting of metal alloys with
refined microstructures. Fine grained castings are expected to have improved
mechanical properties over conventional castings.
