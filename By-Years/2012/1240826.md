This award, in the amount $10,000, is to enable students to attend The 56th
International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and
Nanofabrication, 2012, to be held at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, Waikoloa,
Hawaii, May 29 to June 1, 2012. In the fields of nanofabrication, electron and
ion-beam lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam optics,
and forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent.
The requested travel aid will enable students to present their research to a
high level international scientific community. They will observe how scientists
and engineers exchange innovative ideas and other information at conferences,
and they?ll hear first-hand presentations of up-todate research results in
nanotechnology.

Learning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information
to other is an important element of a student?s education. Also important is
leaning how to present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s
research. The requested support will help to accomplish these ends. At the
conference, students will make important personal contacts and learn of
employment opportunities. At a special student breakfast, the conference
organizers will describe to the students optimal techniques for presenting
scientific information and how the conference program is put together.
