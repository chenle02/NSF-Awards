This action funds Matthew David Harmon of the University of Connecticut to
conduct a research project, entitled "Developing a novel polymer design for
human spine regeneration,", during the summer of 2012 at the University of Otago
Chrsitchurch in Christchurch City, Canterbury, New Zealand. The host scientist's
name is Dr. Timothy Woodfield.

The intellectual merit of this proposal addresses the delicate balance of
material mechanical performance and biological performance by the design of a
polymer scaffold for human spine tissue engineering. By combining a previously
optimized polymer gel with a novel polymer rubber the research attempts to
create an original scaffold design which meets both mechanical and biological
cellular requirements.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
