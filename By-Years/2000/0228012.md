Proposal : IIS-0228012&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jamie Callan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal requests travel expenses for US researchers to participate in a US-
EU/DELOS working group on "Personalisation and Recommender Systems in Digital
Libraries." The working group will meet over the next year to discuss and
evaluate fruitful joint activities and research paths for collaborative
activities in this general topical area.&lt;br/&gt;This working group continues
the planning and research agenda initiated by an earlier workshop , the Joint
DELOS-NSF Workshop on Personalisation and Recommender Systems in Digital
Libraries held at Dublin City University, Ireland, June 18-20, 2001.
http://la.lti.cs.cmu.edu/callan/Workshops/delos01/cfp2.html. Prior research on
personalisation and recommender systems was primarily in the context of
commercial environments with a limited set of goals. This planning activity is
meant to help develop a broader research agenda in environments such as academic
and research libraries with the goal of broadening the overall beneficial impact
of these technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
