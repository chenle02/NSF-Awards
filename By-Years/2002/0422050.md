This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate
the ability to selectively condense and recover deposits rich in a valuable
element from the gas-cooling regions of integrated gasification combined cycle
(IGCC) plants. Deposits plugging gas-cooling heat exchangers in commercial coal
IGCC systems are rich in a valuable element. The work will involve the design
and construction of a pilot-scale on-line metalloid recovery (OMR) system that
will be tested at bench scale on simulated synthesis gas, and on slipstreams
from small-scale gasifiers. Phase II work will determine the effects of
particulate matter and pressurized systems on the ability to concentrate and
remove the valuable element from the gas stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The on-
line recovery of deposits rich in a valuable element will have two distinct
commercial benefits. The first benefit is the cost savings associated with
eliminating down time required for cleaning. By eliminating one cleaning outage,
a gasification plant could save $4.9 million. The second benefit is the creation
of an additional revenue stream from the recovery of these deposits, which can
be sold to a recycler.
