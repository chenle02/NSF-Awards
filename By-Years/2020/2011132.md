The International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) comprises
53 national operations research societies arranged in four regional groups
(North America, Latin America, Asia/Pacific, and Europe). IFORS' purpose is “the
development of operational research as a unified science and its advancement in
all nations of the world.” IFORS sponsors a triennial conference held at
different locations across the globe. These conferences draw a worldwide
audience and provide an important venue to highlight developments in operations
research, particularly in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 22nd
IFORS conference is to be held from June 21-26, 2020, in Seoul, South Korea.

engineering, and mathematical fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
