This project will implement an interactive video laboratory based on IBM and
Macintosh computers, CD-ROM and laserdisc players and videodisc for use in
undergraduate science education. It focuses on increasing scientific literacy
and sophistication among undergraduates, including significant numbers of non-
traditional, women and minority students who are typically underrepresented
these fields. Faculty will incorporate interactive video technology into
teaching in the following areas: biology, chemistry, and physics. The equipment
will give students, including elementary and secondary teachers and non-science
majors who need to meet science requirements for certification and degree-
completion, the opportunity to focus on critical thinking as it relates to
scientific study: formulating and testing hypotheses; solving problems; making
decisions. Because of the ability of the technology to replicate experiments
which faculty could not otherwise do, the equipment will enable students to have
a wider variety of laboratory experiences and multiple opportunities to
hypothesize, test and revise than conventional laboratory experiments would
allow. It would constitute a more "user- friendly" approach to science because
it would alleviate fears about working in a laboratory and, particularly for
future teachers, it would model for them active learning strategies and use of
technology which is becoming widely available in the Kansas City school
districts.
