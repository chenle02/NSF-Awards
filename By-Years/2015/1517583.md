Cheskidov&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1517583&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies
several fundamental open questions concerning the equations governing the motion
of fluids, such as liquids or gases. These equations can explain and predict the
pattern of circulation of the oceans, atmosphere, or blood in the cardiovascular
system; predict changes in weather; describe the motion of a boat or an
aircraft. They were introduced almost two centuries ago but are still not well
understood mathematically. Even though the equations are broadly used by
physicists and engineers for real-life applications, the existence and
uniqueness of solutions are still not known. A mathematical proof of existence
of solutions would justify the equations definitively. A mathematical proof of a
loss of uniqueness of solutions would identify limitations of the equations. The
project is also expected to shed light on certain fundamental issues related to
turbulence. Turbulence, sometimes referred to as the last unsolved problem in
classical physics, is a crucial phenomenon occurring in many fluid flows, for
instance those around airplane bodies, vehicles, ships, and blades of turbines.
A better mathematical understanding of turbulence would lead to improvements in
the design of these objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Eighty years ago, Leray
suggested that turbulence was due to formation of singularities in the flow and
introduced a notion of weak solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations. The notion became a basic concept in the theory of partial
differential equations. The aim of this proposal is to study regularity
properties of weak solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
and their relation to turbulence. One direction of this work is to construct
weak solutions with various abnormal behaviors, such as norm inflation,
discontinuity, or norm discontinuity. Such phenomena may be a result of an
instantaneous blow-up from the right, which is much easier to control than a
blow-up of a smooth solution. When the forcing term in the equations is large,
the long-time behavior of solutions to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations becomes very complicated and often chaotic. For fluid flows this
phenomenon is known as turbulence. Even when a velocity field in a turbulent
flow is chaotic, experimental and numerical evidence show that the averaged
velocity still displays some regular structure. The investigator studies Leray-
Hopf weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and proves some of the
empirical laws of turbulence, using the Littlewood-Paley and atomic
decompositions of the velocity vector field.
