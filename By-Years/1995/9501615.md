This research is on synthesis techniques for micro-electronics- based "embedded
systems". An embedded system is one designed for a specific functionality under
stringent constraints on its timing performance and cost. Design automation
techniques are being developed for use in a framework where the designer can
assess tradeoffs between various embedded system architectures and designs. The
main capabilities of this framework are: (a) timing analysis for both execution
delay and rate constraints; (b) embeddable software and runtime system
generation under timing constrains; (c) software size-performance tradeoffs; (d)
cost- performance analysis of architectural alternatives, such as pre- fetch and
forward hardware. This work is exploreing system partitioning and transformation
techniques to build system implementations that "guarantee" constraint
satisfaction while optimizing system development cost.
