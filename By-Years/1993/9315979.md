9315979 Wali The 4th International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology
will be held on the campus of Syracuse University under the auspices of the
Physics Department from May 19-24, 1994. Interdisciplinary in nature, the
symposium will cover wide ranging topics of interest to both theorists and
experimentalists and will attempt to provide as complete a picture as possible
of the current status of Particle Physics, String Theories, and Cosmology. The
interactions which will occur at the symposium are very important to progress in
the field. ***
