The analysis of seismic reflection and refraction data requires modern state-
of-the-art data processing equipment. This proposal from the Department of
Geophysics at Stanford University describes a cost-effective upgrade of their
data processing system which will be funded mainly (62%) from private sources.
The remaining costs (38%) are being requested from NSF for the acquisition of an
I/O processor, a tape drive controller, a disk drive, a rasterizer, and two
plotter switches. This combination of hardware is necessary for running the
comprehensive seismic reflection/refraction processing packages that will be
used to study geologic structures related to the evolution of the earth's crust.
