This award provides for procurement of a general purpose neurocomputer and data
acquisition units to support several experimental engineering research projects.
The projects include (1) neural network controller design for real time force
control of rigid or flexible robot manipulators and more general control-
structure interaction problems, and (2) implementation of hierarchical
intelligent controllers. These neural network based controllers require a
massively parallel computer architecture and high communication bandwidth
between its processing elements. The equipment purchased has these
characteristics.
