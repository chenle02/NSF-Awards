1) critically examine current pipe installation practice, 2) evaluate the
implications of installation practices on pipe performance to assess the
benefits of new methods, 3) determine the basis for representing the influence
of adjacent methods 3) determine the basis for representing the influence of
adjacent undisturbed soil conditions, 4) define bedding alternatives and their
effect on performance, and 5) develop improved compaction specifications for
more efficient construction. Because these subjects have a very important
influence on pipe performance, and because the early work is out of date as a
result of changes in engineering and construction technologies over the years,
the proposed new research is critically needed. Laboratory tests will be used to
investigate compatibility of backfill soil, to study soil behavior in the
important haunch zone and to investigate stresses and deflections induced during
compaction of the backfill. Field tests will be performed to investigate the
nature of bedding and installation methods under realistic conditions. Computer
analyses will be used to interpret the experimental conditions and extend the
applicability to conditions not tested.
