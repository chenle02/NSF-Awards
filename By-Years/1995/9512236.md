9512236 James This award is to provide for the purchase of scientific
instruments that will strengthen and unify the research and research training
activities of the institution's Orthopedic Research Group. The equipment
obtained through this award will provide enhanced capability to the twelve
faculty of the Group who are conducting research on polymers for total human
joint replacements, analysis of retrieved orthopedic implants, new designs and
materials for external fixation pin technology, fracture repair with calcium
phosphate bone cement, and other related projects. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted in response to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 94-156, Academic
Research Infrastructure Program. Results of this program are expected to improve
the accessibility of modern research instrumentation for use by the
institution's faculty in conducting research on important topics of significance
to progress in biomedical engineering, particularly in the area of improved
prostheses for human use. ***
