During the last decade improvements in observations have demonstrated that a
substantial fraction of young stellar objects (particularly the T Tauri stars
and mysterious Herbig-Haro objects) expel oppositely directed jets of material.
In this two-year renewal award, the Principal Investigator and his collaborator,
Dr. Noriega-Cresbo, will observe the jets in several of these objects in both
directions on the sky. They will use the radiative transfer techniques they have
developed in their last award to study the two dimensional structure of the jets
and also construct computer models simulating the evolution of the condensations
they have observed along these jets. This work is the primary observational
evidence of "bow shocks" being created from stellar ejections into the ambient
circumstellar medium. Such structures are also observed in active galaxies. It
is to be expected that this work will affect our understanding of the creation
of jets both from stars and the nuclei of galaxies.
