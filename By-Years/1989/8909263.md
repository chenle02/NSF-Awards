Developing countries exhibit wide differences in their fiscal and monetary
policies, particularly with regard to inflation and fiscal deficits. The purpose
this project is to explain these differences by formulating and testing
alternative theories of fiscal and monetary policies. One of the major questions
to be address is whether the observed policies are in accord with optimal
government behavior. Preliminary empirical results suggest that, for most part,
developing countries adopt policies which are far from optimum. The main focus
of this research is to develop and analyze alternative explanations for why
different countries deviate from optimal policy behavior in the way they do. A
political model of reputation that associates the effectiveness of reputational
incentives to observable characteristics of the political system will be
developed and tested. In addition, a political theory of tax reform will also
constructed and tested. This project is important because it may suggest
opportunities for institutional reform and how international organizations
should deal with developing countries.
