This proposal aims to continue a research program on quantum transport of ultra-
cold atoms. The PI will investigate quantum structure and dynamics of ultra-cold
atoms in optical billiards and to measure quantum transport of ultra-cold atoms
and condensates in two-dimensional optical lattices, with the focus on the
transport in real space. In addition, experiments will be performed on the
extraction of single atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate with very high
fidelity, with the atoms remaining in the ground state of a potential well (a
quantum tweezer). Finally the project will implement multi-particle
interferometry with atoms. On the broader impact of the research, the
preparation of single atoms in a specified quantum state is the basis for
several different schemes for quantum computation and quantum information
processing.
