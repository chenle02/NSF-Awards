Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Conference on Water
Purification and Reuse, in Potsdam, Germany, June 9-13, 2003&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
Number: CTS-02043362&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ralph
Yang&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide travel grant
awards to U.S. speakers, authors of&lt;br/&gt;papers, and young academic
participants to the Conference on Water Purification and Reuse, to be held in
Potsdam, Germany, on June 9-13, 2003. The purpose of the Conference is to
discuss the latest advancements of the important technologies for purifying
industrial and municipal wastewater for reuse and the latest developments of
process design and integration methods for water treatment. The researchers in
the water purification field have diverse background, mainly in chemical
engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, and environmental engineering. It is
important to provide a needed forum through this conference to bring researchers
with different backgrounds and from different countries together for
disseminating and exchanging the latest scientific information. It will provide
an opportunity for developing international collaboration for solving the global
problem of water purification and reuse. Moreover, plans are being made to
publish a proceeding in the form of a book for dissemination of the state-of-
the-art information on water purification and reuse. The proposed budget will
provide for 15-20 partial travel grant awards to U.S. speakers, authors of
papers, and young academic participants at the
Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
