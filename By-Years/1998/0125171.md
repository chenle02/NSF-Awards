The Bell Museum of Natural History is seeking a planning grant to begin the
exhibit development process for a national traveling exhibit on nature in urban
settings. "Nature in the City" will be designed to encourage the exploration of
diversity of life in the city in the same way ecologist study ecosystems. The
overall goal of the exhibit is to improve the public's understanding of ecology
and biodiversity, and the relevance of these concepts to their lives in creating
healthier and ecologically sustainable communities. The project will include
front-end evaluation, identification of key themes and take-home messages, and a
survey of potential host sites. The target audience assessment will examine
interest, knowledge and attitudes about nature and the environment among urban
audiences. Methodology will include interviews with community members, focus
groups and surveys, all conducted in collaboration with museum staff and
community groups. The results will be applied to the design of the 3000 sq. ft.
"Nature in the City" traveling exhibit, mini-kiosks and supporting programs.
