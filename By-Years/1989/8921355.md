Under the direction of Dr. E. Charles Adams, Ms. Lisa Young will analyze
materials from two archaeological sites located within Homolovi Ruins State
Park, near Winslow, Arizona. These will provide the basis for her doctoral
dissertation. The sites, a pithouse village labeled HP-36 and a nearby pueblo
Homolovi II, span the period between ca. 700 A.D. - 1350 A.D. and document the
development of a Native American settled way of life in the southwestern United
States. Analyses will be conducted on the abundant faunal and floral remains
recovered from the sites. Detailed examination of the associated lithic
assemblages will provide insight into stone tool use. The data, taken together,
will allow Ms. Young to determine when within this period the shift to a settled
lifestyle occurred. Archaeologists working in the Southwest have long believed
that the construction of semi-underground dwellings, given the amount of labor
involved, indicate a sedentary way of life and have used such dwellings as an
indicator of an agricultural mode of subsistence and sign of increased cultural
complexity. Recently, however, other archaeologists have suggested that such is
not the case and the builders of such houses may still follow a hunting and
gathering way of life. Through examination of lithic, faunal, and floral remains
Ms. Young will directly evaluate this hypothesis. This research is important for
several reasons. It will increase our understanding of how complex societies
such as our own emerge. It will also aid in the development of analytic
techniques which can be applied to a variety of sites in many parts of the
world. The project will increase our understanding of Native American prehistory
and also assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.
