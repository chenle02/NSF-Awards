9625485 Muthukumar Theoretical studies will be done on the following: (1)
thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions; (2) relaxation and transport of
polyelectrolytes and liquid crystals in random environments; (3) topological
frustrations associated with pattern formation and complexations; (4) phase
separation kinetics in liquid crystalline systems. Full mathematical expressions
will be derived to describe the nonuniversal features of (1) the fast and slow
dynamics accompanying the `ordinary-extrordinary' transition in polyelectrolyte
solutions; (2) pattern recognition and transport of polyelectrolytes in random
media; and (3) phase separation kinetics and defect dynamics of polymer
dispersed liquid crystals. This theoretical research complements many
experimental investigations which are being actively pursued in laboratories
worldwide. The results of this theoretical research are relevant to numerous
applied areas such as separation techniques like chromatography and
electrophoresis; preparation and processing of molecular composites and light
shutters for devices; and controlled fabrication of nanoscale structures and
artificial enzymes. %%% This grant supports theoretical research on polymers and
complex fluids. A wide variety of problems will be addressed. The fundamental
issues which will be investigated have ramifications in many applications. ***
