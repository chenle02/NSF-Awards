The goal of this Research Planning Grant (RPG) is to examine the temporal
pattern of endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in the
bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. Ranid flogs are highly unique in that they are the
only tetrapods known to date to display a true physiological preference for
continuous, rather than pulsatile, GnRH input for the maintenance of
gonadotropin secretion. Based on this observation, it is hypothesized that
unlike mammals and birds, reproduction in ranid frogs is driven by continuous
release of endogenous GnRH. This hypothesis will be tested directly in this
Research Planning Grant by investigating the temporal pattern of GnRH release
from bullfrog hypothalamic slices using an in vitro perfusion system. The RPG
results will provide the physiological basis for future investigations into the
mechanisms by which continuous GnRH stimulation supports the overall
reproductive functions. In addition, these data will facilitate the
understanding of the dynamics of a potentially very novel hypothalamic-pituitary
system.
