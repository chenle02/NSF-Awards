ABSTRACT CTS-9457083 Northwestern University P.I.: Wesley Burghardt The central
theme of research in my group at Northwestern in the relationship between flow-
induced microscopic structural changes in complex fluids, the resulting
mechanical rheological behavior behavior, and further, the consequences of
nonlinear rheology in more complex fluid mechanical problems. Under NYI support,
we will pursue three projects, (i) Flow-induced alignment in block copolymer
solutions. Ordered block copolymers are characterized by complexity at two
structural levels. Molecular relaxations are reflected in viscoelastic behavior.
However, the self-assembly of the polymers into ordered microstructures (such as
lamellae) renders both structure and rheological properties highly anisotropic.
We will use flow birefringence to study the development of macroscopic alignment
under flow, coupled with mechanical testing to study how bulk rheological
behavior is affected by the average orientation state. (ii) Constitutive
instabilities in highly entangled polymers. We will investigate two classes of
materials where the constitutive behavior has been proposed to be subject to an
unstable nonmonotonic dependence of stress on deformation. Highly entangled
polymer solutions will be studied in step strain, while so called living
polymers (micellar surfactant solutions) will be studied in steady shear flow.
In both cases, we will utilize optical approaches developed in our laboratory
for studying the complete stress tensor using the stress-optical rule. (iii)
Non-newtonian fluid mechanics. Experimental studies will be conducted on well-
characterized viscoelastic polymer solutions in complex geometries. These
efforts are directed towards developing an experimental database with which to
test numerical simulations of viscoelastic flow, and discriminate among
competing constitutive models.
