9616255 Geil Research over the last several years suggests that the confined
thin film melt polymerization (CTFMP) technique is of general applicability for
the growth of lamellar single crystals of condensation polymers, liquid
crystalline (LCPs) and flexible polymers that are near ideal for electron
diffraction (ED) studies of crystal structure.They are generally on the order of
100 thick, extended chain in nature, with the molecular axes normal to the
lamellae. The research under this grant has the goal of exploiting CTFMP and
related sample preparation techniques, utilizing ED and a number of supplemental
techniqes, in a number of areas of significant interest including liquid-
crystalline polymers, crystal-to-mesophase transitions, and crystal structure
detepminations. %%%% This research will help to provide the underlying knowledge
of the structure and phase transitions of important polymeric materials. ***
