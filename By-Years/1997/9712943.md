9712943 Woods This proposal is the joint effort of the Southwestern Oklahoma
State University, the Putnam City Schools, The Tulsa Public Schools and the
Consortium for the Advancement of Science and Mathematics Education in Oklahoma.
Rural areas of Oklahoma contain one of the largest and most diverse populations
of American Indians in the world. Over 35 tribal groups have their own education
officers and special education support systems, and most American Indian
Students in Oklahoma attend public schools. Rural Oklahoma also has a
significant, growing population of Hispanics and a significant concentration of
African Americans. The proposal has linked to broad-based partnerships and plans
to develop coherent linkages with existing programs to target systemic reform in
Oklahoma. The primary focus will be the establishment of a foundation for
implementation of systemic reform in science, mathematics and technology
education throughout the state, including the development of an implementation
proposal to NSF.
