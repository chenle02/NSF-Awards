Professor Geoghegan will investigate two kinds of problems on the borderline
between topology and algebra. The first set of problems concerns developments of
his recent work with A. Nicas on one-parameter fixed point theory. They recently
found a "higher trace" in Hochschild homology which faithfully detects the
primary obstruction to removing circles of fixed points from a homotopy. They
will now investigate the algebra surrounding the remaining geometric
obstructions, as well as related matters. The second set of problems concerns
higher order end theory of groups. He will investigate various topological end
invariants of a group which should detect interesting properties of the group
itself.
