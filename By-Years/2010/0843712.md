How do females choose a mate? Female mate selection promotes population
divergence and biodiversity, yet our understanding of how reproductive
physiology affects mate selection and ultimately biodiversity is very limited.
In this project, cichlid fishes from the East African Great Lakes will be used
to unravel the behavioral, physiological and molecular underpinnings of the
female reproductive cycle. Cichlids provide a unique opportunity to integrate
the molecular and neural basis of female sexuality with the function of mate
choice. The research will focus on the cichlid species Astatotilapia burtoni,
which has become a major model system to study the physiological, molecular and
genomic basis of social behavior, as well as the genus Xenotilapia, which
exhibits an extraordinary diversity of mating systems in very closely related
species. The three aims will (i) analyze the association of female sexual
behavior with hormonal, morphological, and transcriptional changes throughout
the reproductive cycle; (ii) test which transcriptional events in the forebrain
are associated with mate choice decisions; and (iii) determine the effects of
reproductive hormones on mate choice. By combining and integrating multiple
levels of investigation and exploiting the spectacular biodiversity of cichlid
fishes this project provides an exceptional opportunity to explain mate choice
in pharmacological, neuroanatomical, physiological, molecular and genomic terms.
This project will provide outstanding educational benefits to urban high school
students, undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, including
members of underrepresented groups.
