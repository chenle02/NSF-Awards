The goal of this project is to design an ethics education program for science
and engineering that incorporates ethics research and international/indigenous
perspectives. Cooperating institutions include public, private, religiously
affiliated, tribal colleges, and a university in Bolivia serving indigenous
populations. The approach is to form a Science and Engineering Ethics Corps
(SEE-Corps) that will collaborate to conduct research and education projects.
Three workshops will be held to shape the research approach and design the core
course and a tool box to assist faculty in incorporating ethics across the
curriculum. The course will be piloted and assessed at participating
institutions and results will be shared at an Inter-Institutional conference.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses proven qualitative research methods and
a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, and multi-cultural team to design a
new, more inclusive model for a core course in ethics for upper-level
undergraduate and graduate students in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) disciplines as the student body and faculty become
increasingly more diverse. The broader impacts will extend beyond the
participating institutions to graduate education in general.
