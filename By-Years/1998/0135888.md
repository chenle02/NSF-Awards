In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Emile Schweikert and his coworkers at Texas A&amp;M University are developing
new methods for mass spectrometry of surfaces.The research focuses on extracting
more information from the ejecta generated when bombarding surfaces with keV
mono and polyatomic projectiles. One objective is to achieve nanophase
characterization via the detection of coincidentally emitted secondary ions. The
approach relies on the novel concept of "mass separated time-of-flight mass
spectrometry". A second objective is to advance detection sensitivity, which
translates into the requirement of detecting neutrals. The approach is to
collisionally cool the desorbed neutrals at ambient pressure, collect them into
a supersonic molecular beam and subject them to efficient hyperthermal
ionization for subsequent identification by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In
addition to enhanced detection sensitivity, the procedure should be useful for
surfaces not readily amenable to examination in
vacuum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project deals with advancing chemical analysis
expertise for examining surfaces. Progress in surface science and technology
with emphasis on nanostructures requires the detection of vanishingly small
amounts of molecules. The research aims to enhance our capabilities for
identifying the chemical makeup of nanostructures and for detecting small
numbers of molecules dispersed on a surface. The work will focus on two novel
methods of mass spectrometry. One based on "mass-separated time-of-flight mass
spectrometry" is expected to enable chemical analysis of nanodomains as small as
~ 30 nm. The other involves "ambient pressure secondary neutral mass
spectrometry" with the goal of detecting molecules when they are randomly
distributed on a surface (rather than assembled in a nanostructure) and when
they are present in amounts which cannot be detected with current
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
