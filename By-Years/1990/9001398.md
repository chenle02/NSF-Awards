This award provides support to The University of Minnesota to continue the
summer program of undergraduate research experiences in the behavioral sciences
established in 1987. The ten-week program emphasizes student participation in
the research activities of faculty affiliated with the Center of Liberal Arts.
Eleven undergraduates will participate, two-thirds from private liberal arts
colleges in the state of Minnesota and one-third from the University; they will
be expected to have completed their junior year. Student's will: (1) assist with
a faculty member's research including opportunities to work as a member of a
research team, (2) complete a research project, the final product of which will
be a written report and a presentation to peers and participating faculty, and
(3) participate in a multidisciplinary seminar. Seminar activities include
presentations by program faculty and faculty in related areas campus wide,
laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools and design. The program will
therefore include opportunities for the students to learn specific research
methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own research, and to
examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relating to psychology and
the cognitive sciences. Participation in social/cultural events as well as
common housing in a University dorm will help foster a strong community of
students.
