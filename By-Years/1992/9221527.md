Most major United States metropolitan areas possess a large inventory of
unreinforced masonry (URM) building structures. In seismic prone regions, such
buildings represent serious threats to the public safety. The main objective of
this project is to study the effectiveness and special problems of using post-
tensioned steel braces for the purpose of upgrading URM building structures for
seismic hazard mitigation. Such a technique overcomes a lot of problems
associated with traditional bracing schemes and holds much promise for broad
applications in seismic rehabilitation. One major obstacle in the development of
seismic rehabilitation techniques is the lack of a consensus analytical
procedure for evaluating the seismic resistance of URM building structures.
Currently a unified methodology using the so-called "Strut-Analogy" method
development will be used as a tool for the analytical modeling for the URM
buildings. The combined URM and post-tensioned system will then be analyzed to
assess this technique's effectiveness. This project is supported under the NSF
Research Initiative No. 92-28 on "Repair and Rehabilitation Research for Seismic
Resistance of Structures."
