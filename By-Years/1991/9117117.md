In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Charles Parmenter of Indiana University will study crossed-beam
bimolecular energy transfer, intramolecular vibrational redistribution, and
vibrational predissociation in van der Waals molecules. The aim is to reveal the
state-resolved characteristics of vibrational energy flow in polyatomic
molecules, both intramolecular and collisional. There will be a synergism
between this experimental work and theoretical treatments by collaborating
theoretical chemists. %%% When excess energy is deposited into vibrational modes
of polyatomic molecules, that is, those composed of several atoms, that energy
can dissipate internally by redistributing among the other vibrations in the
molecule, or it may be given up to other atoms or molecules with which the
excited molecule collides. This project aims at studying the ways and time
scales on which such excess vibrational energy flows out of the initially
excited parts of a molecule.
