This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will exploit novel
photocatalysts for air pollution control using solar energy. Emissions controls
are needed which are cost effective, use energy efficiently, are suitable for
remote locations, and produce no hazardous by-products. Ideally, the technology
could be rapidly commercialized to meet an increasingly pressing need.
Photocatalysis potentially has these characteristics, employing ultraviolet (UV)
light to destroy contaminants at ambient temperatures. Photocatalysis would be
particularly attractive if an efficient solar technology were available,
exploiting inexpensive and abundant UV radiation from the sun. KSE, Inc. has
developed novel photocatalyst formulations which are over 50 times as active as
conventional titania photocatalysts. The efficiency of use of solar radiation in
the UV spectrum should be greatly increased by such photocatalysts. In the
proposed Phase II program, the research and development is to be completed by
exploiting these unique photocatalyst formulations to capture the potential of
solar radiation for the destruction of environmentally hazardous gaseous
emissions in air. The performance of the photocatalysts to be developed will
enable effective utilization of solar UV radiation and efficient scale-up to
capacities of relevance to practical applications. The Phase II program will
address selected volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants, focused on
specific market opportunities. Solar photocatalytic units will be used to
control air emissions from soil and groundwater remediation, industrial
emissions control and indoor air quality maintenance.
