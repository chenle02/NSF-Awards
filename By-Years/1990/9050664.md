Polarizing microscopes and thin sectioning equipment are being incorporated into
several geology courses. The instruments will be used to improve instruction in
five upper division courses including mineralogy, petrology, economic geology,
and optical mineralogy, as well as independent undergraduate research projects.
Students can now get "hands-on" experience from sample preparation to their
identification, with the use of thin sectioning equipment. This will be aided by
the department's personal computers using mineral identification software. The
university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
