9304035 Khomami An investigation is to be carried out on the interfacial
stability and dynamic deformation of multilayer polymeric fluids subjected to
shear and extensional deformation. The approach is a mix of modeling and
experiments. The modeling component consists of theoretical stability analysis,
including three dimensional and finite amplitude instability modes. The
experiments will use various polymer melts in straight and converging channels
to simulate a co-extrusion environment. Theoretical and experimental findings
regarding layer deformation and stability will be compared. Multilayer
coextrusion and coating is an important process in the formation of polymeric
composite materials. Under certain processing conditions, instabilities can
arise, and these cannot at present be reliably predicted. ***
