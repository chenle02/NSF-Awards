Dynamic mobile sensor networks are a distributed collection of mobile robots,
each of which has sensing, computation, wireless communication and mobility
capabilities. In a traditional wireless sensor network, although mobile robots
are being used as sensor nodes, their dynamics and mobility are not fully
exploited to improve the quality of collaborative sensing. This project explores
research challenges in learning-based robotic wireless sensor networks by
exploiting techniques in multi-robot research and wireless sensor networks with
mobility taken into consideration. The proposed research aims to develop
distributed learning algorithms and adaptive sensing coordination strategies for
monitoring properties of mobile wireless sensor networks and adjusting locations
of mobile sensor nodes to achieve better quality of collaborative sensing and
environmental inference. The impact of this research lies in the novelty and
synergism among networking, machine learning, signal processing and control to
adaptively control the network structure, data routing, and signal processing in
the mobile robotic sensor network to achieve better collaborative sensing.
Expected results from this research will find applications in homeland security,
environmental monitoring and sampling, and autonomous mobile robots for better
collaborative sensing and information processing. The proposed project will
serve as an excellent vehicle to recruit graduate students, especially those
from underrepresented populations, to pursue their doctoral degree, and to
recruit high-school students and encourage them to select engineering/computer
science for their choice of career.
