Tromba will carry out research into the theory of minimal surfaces combining
methods from the theory of variational calculus and non-linear analysis. His
attention will be focussed mainly on questions related to Plateau's problem
which is connected with finding minimal surfaces with a given boundary. In
particular he will investigate how extensive a Morse theory can hold for the
Plateau problem in Euclidean three space. In its original form Morse theory is
concerned with the relationships between the critical points of a smooth
function on a compact manifold and the topology of that manifold. Also, for
higher genus surfaces, an investigation of index theory will be carried out.
