The project is devoted to the study of long-term behavior of a class of
dynamical systems, called parabolic, which display sub-exponential (polynomial)
divergence of nearby orbits. In contrast with hyperbolic dynamical systems,
which display exponential divergence of orbits, parabolic systems are much less
understood. Hyperbolic systems will also be studied insofar they appear as
auxiliary tools in the study of parabolic ones, which are the main focus. The
research will emphasize quantitative aspects that are relevant for applications.
The project aims to advance our fundamental knowledge of dynamical systems and
to develop new ideas and new methods of mathematical investigation with
potential applications to geometry and number theory and thus indirectly to
other scientific subjects. Also, since parabolic behavior appears in Hamiltonian
mechanics, the project can directly advance our understanding of simple
mathematical models of classical physical systems (billiards in polygons,
statistical mechanics, planetary motions). Research training and mentoring of
students and postdocs is an important goal of the project, with particular
attention to members of underrepresented groups.

The investigator will carry out research in several directions (effective weak
mixing of translation flows, Ruelle asymptotics, dynamics on character
varieties) and will continue work on longstanding open questions such as on
effective ergodicity for non-horospherical unipotent flows (effective Ratner
theory), optimal bounds on Weyl sums for higher degree polynomials, the ergodic
theory of geodesic flows on flat surfaces and of billiards in non-rational
polygons, as well as the ergodic and spectral theory of smooth parabolic flows.
An important approach to parabolic systems, often called renormalization
approach, replaces the direct studies of the parabolic dynamics with that of an
auxiliary hyperbolic system, which is easier to understand by methods of
hyperbolic theory (invariant manifolds, Lyapunov exponents). Motivated by recent
interest in the relation between parabolic and hyperbolic dynamics via
renormalization, the investigator has broadened his research with work on
exponential decay of correlations and Ruelle asymptotics for hyperbolic systems
from the point of view of the effective (polynomial) equidistribution of
unstable foliations, and will further pursue research on the interplay between
effective equidistribution in parabolic dynamics and effective mixing in
hyperbolic dynamics.
