This research concerns use of liquid clathrates as mass separating agents for
hydrocarbon mixtures. Preliminary work shows high selectivity in
aromatic/aliphatic and single- ring/multi-ring systems. Parameters necessary for
selection of a liquid clathrate system for continuous separation process will be
determined by experiment. Energy efficient sorption/desorption cycles will be
investigated as the basis for a continuous, multi stage process. Separation
processes are an important component of U.S. industry. Many processes are
complex and/or energy intensive. Recent studies of opportunities in separations
science have identified development of a new generation of highly selective,
regenerable mass separating agents as a needed technology. This project is
possibly a partial solution of this problem.
