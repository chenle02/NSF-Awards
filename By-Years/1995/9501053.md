Aktosun DMS-9501053 It is proposed to investigate the inverse scattering
problems arising in quantum mechanics and wave propagation by studying the
Schroedinger equation when the potential is independent of energy and when the
potential is proportional to energy. The inverse problem consists of the
determination of the potential when the scattering operator is known. By
formulating this as a Riemann-Hilbert problem in the momentum space, it is
proposed to study the solvability of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, the
characterization of the scattering data, the role of the bound states, and the
stability of the inversion. The solution of the inverse scattering problem with
energy-independent potentials corresponds to the determination of molecular,
atomic, and nuclear forces in terms of the scattering data obtained in collision
experiments; the determination of these forces is not only important in quantum
mechanics but it is also one of the fundamental problems in physics. The inverse
scattering problem with energy-dependent potentials arises in wave propagation
in a nonhomogeneous medium, and it is equivalent to determining the properties
of the medium by analyzing the waves scattered from the medium. This problem has
many important applications in acoustics, seismology, nondestructive testing,
oil exploration, atmospheric profile inversion, and other areas where the
measurements taken outside the medium are used to predict the properties of the
medium.
