Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supporting a
workshop to identify specific activities that the American Society for
Engineering Education (ASEE) should undertake or expand in order to support
transformational engineering faculty development for instructional excellence.
The workshop is bringing together varied stakeholders in engineering education
to identify, analyze, and summarize existing knowledge and practices that
contribute to effective engineering faculty development for instructional
excellence focusing on what ASEE currently does and should be doing. The output
of the workshop will be a report and a set of consensus recommendations. This is
the beginning of a larger process that will then use the report as a framework
for new and expanded ASEE initiatives to support and encourage instructional
excellence in the nation's engineering education programs. &lt;br/&gt;
