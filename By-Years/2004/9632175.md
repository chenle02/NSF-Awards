The eighth grade is an important point in a girl's education, particularly in
deciding whether or not to follow a science and mathematics track. In order to
promote interest and aptitude in science and engineering, we propose an
innovated program that involves eighth grade girls with their mentors
(preferable the mother or a female teacher from their school). They will be part
of an engineering team that includes a Tufts faculty member, a Tufts
undergraduate, a Tufts staff member, and a staff member from the Acton Discovery
Museum. Five teams will work on developing actual hands-on science-museum
exhibits. Each exhibit will focus on a specific science/engineering principle
that will be explored during the initial phase of the project in a supportive
and fun learning environment. The exhibits will link together with other
exhibits following a thematic approach, and will use discovery learning
activity-based learning to teach people about science and engineering
principles. These exhibits will be displayed at the Acton Discovery Museum and
classes will be especially invited. The students will be the facilitators of the
activities around the exhibits during these events. The fact that these museum
exhibits were developed by girls and women of the surrounding communities will
be emphasized in the displays. Successful completion of this project may provide
a model for collaboration among schools, universities, and museums nationwide in
enhancing learning experiences of girls and young women.
