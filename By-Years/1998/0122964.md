0122964&lt;br/&gt;Yan&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Mingdi Yan and students from
Portland State University in a collaboration with Olof Ramstrom of the
Department of Organic Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm, Sweden. The project will focus on the difficult tasks of synthesis
and use of in aqueous solutions of tailor-made polymeric receptors that are
capable of selectively recognizing small differences in ligand structure. New
chemistry and fabrication techniques will be applied to molecular imprinting in
order to meet the challenge, which is of utmost importance in biological
applications. The imprinting chemistry employs reversible, but stable bonds that
survive the water environment. The technique of micromoulding in capillary will
be used for the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers. The same technique
will make it possible to accomplish the synthesis of libraries of such polymers
that can be screened for optimal imprinting chemistry as well as for biological
assays. The long-term goals of the project are to integrate the synthesis and
analysis of combinatorial molecularly imprinted polymers on a single chip and to
construct multi-analyte sensors based on the microfabricated arrays.&lt;br/&gt;
