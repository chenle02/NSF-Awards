9707382 Raghavan This work focuses on one of the major players of the cellular
antigen processing machinery, the transporters associated with antigen
processing (TAP). The TAP proteins are members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC)
family of transmembrane transporters. The long term goal of this research is to
gain insight into the mechanisms involved in substrate transport by ABC
transporters. The TAP proteins will be investigated as the prototype
transporter. Recombinant TAP proteins will be purified from insect cell
membranes and reconstituted into artificial membranes to measure transport
activities under strictly controlled conditions. The coupling between peptide
and nucleotide binding by TAP will also be studied. Finally, soluble TAP
fragments will be obtained for structural studies. A family of proteins called
ABC transporters use the energy from ATP to transport various substances across
cell membranes. This project uses biochemical and biophysical studies to
understand the mechanism by which these transporters function.
