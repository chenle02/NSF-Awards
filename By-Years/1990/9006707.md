The grant is for a high resolution contact mask aligner for use in fabricating
binary phase diffractive optical elements. the instrument will greatly expand
the on-going research efforts to: 1) improve basic knowledge of binary phase
grating performance, 2) apply them in optical interconnect systems, and 3)
design and test diffractive elements for use in magneto-optic data storage head
assemblies. The requested mask aligner will extend mask alignment resolution
capability to less than 0.4 micrometers, and is necessary for making the complex
elements needed for the above applications. Successful demonstration of binary
phase micro- optical components will have a major impact on the performance and
realization of these systems. In addition to supporting these specific research
projects, the equipment will be used to train students to fabricate binary phase
gratings. This would satisfy a growing educational need expressed by several
collaborating industrial and government laboratories.
