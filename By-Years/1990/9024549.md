Harnessing supercomputer power for computational engineering and science will
require massive software systems that support very high level, applications-
oriented problem solving environments (PSEs). Such PSEs will be constructed from
software systems from four areas (Numerical Analysis, Symbolic Computing,
Computational Geometry and Artificial Intelligence) which interact currently in
a very limited way. A symbiotic integration of ideas and software from these
areas is essential for creating the PSEs required in the future. The purpose of
this project is to hold a workshop consisting of 15-20 people from these areas
for a two day intensive study of what has been accomplished so far and to
explore the potential for research developments over the next 4-8 years. A
report on the discussions and conclusions will be prepared.
