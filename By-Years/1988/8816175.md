A one-day conference, concerning Two-Point Closure Models for Turbulent Flow, is
planned for November 19, 1988 at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
The purpose of the conference is to review the background, status, and prospects
of these models. They are more complex than the more conventional one-point
closure models, and contain the potential for more realistic predictions.
However, they also need a rational modeling base. The outlook for this is the
main issue to be addressed at this conference, support for which will mainly go
to invited speaker expenses.
