The basic assumption upon which Dr. Winner bases this research is that, in an
age characterized by rapid, pervasive technological change, the traditional
concerns of political thought must expand to included choices that may seem to
be merely technical ones. He argues that the building of new systems in
production, transportation, information, communications, and the like involves
not only matters of efficiency, productivity, reliability and the like, but also
questions about freedom membership, authority, community, and the distribution
of social power. One point at which these issues might be fruitfully addressed
is at the design stage of technological development. Under this grant, Dr.
Winner is examining three aspects of design in technological development. First,
he is examining a variety of historical examples to show how the design of
technological systems can have political consequences. Second, he is comparing
three traditions of design- -political theory, architecture, and industrial
engineering--to see what they have to say about the relationship of form and
content in the structures they ponder. Third, he is attempting to develop a
political theory of design, one that can offer advice on value choices to be
made about the shape of evolving technological systems. He will apply this
theory to a number of currently evolving sociotechnical fields, including the
designs of digital bank card systems and their implications for issues of
privacy and individual freedom.
