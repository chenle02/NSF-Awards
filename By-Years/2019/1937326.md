The project will address fundamental questions about the evolution of the
relationship between structure and function in cells. All cells share a set of
activities, many of which involve interactions with their environment. The
subject of this proposal is the pathways that allow cells to take up particles
from their environment, which can be carried to a compartment where they are
digested. Alternatively, such ingested particles can be transported to other
compartments and integrated into cellular metabolism. The research will
determine if different cells are relying on the same mechanisms, or whether,
over time, have evolved diverse mechanisms to achieve similar tasks. The
research will also address how cells control the transport of ingested particles
by implementing experiments which test the hypothesis that the various possible
outcomes are in competition with one another, and that a cell can precisely
regulate the “flow” down different pathways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project
will be pursued in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and will focus on
pathways in the ‘endolysosomal’ network. Tetrahymena ingests bacteria by a
phagocytosis-dependent pathway, and then digests those bacteria in
phagolysosomes whose activity depends on delivery of hydrolytic enzymes. The
research will define the pathways involved in delivery of proteins to
phagolysosomes and ask whether they are the same or different as the pathways
used in mammalian cells. In Tetrahymena, hydrolytic enzymes are also delivered
to generate a specific secretory compartment. Experiments in the project will
test the hypothesis that competition between molecular tethering complexes in
the CORVET family determines the relative flux of key hydrolytic enzymes to
secretory organelles vs phagolysosomes, depending on cellular conditions. The
experiments will be based on natural and induced fluctuations in the abundance
of specific CORVET subunits. The experiments will also take advantage of the
fact that CORVET tethers are recruited by Rab GTPases, so that manipulation of
Rab activities can be used to indirectly influence CORVET function. The project
will provide an environment to introduce undergraduates to research, and for the
training of one PhD student and one postdoctoral
fellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
