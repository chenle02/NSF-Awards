The ecology of host-vector-pathogen interactions and tick borne disease risk

There is growing recognition that changes in host community ecology and
interactions in the food chain can contribute to the emergence of infectious
diseases. Many diseases cycle within a single species or area, but are
transmitted to humans from their wildlife host either by direct contact, or more
often by an arthropod vector. Because most infectious pathogens which can be
transmitted across species are harbored by wildlife that occupy low levels in
the food chain (particularly rodents), predation of these hosts may be critical
to disease suppression. However, this is not well understood. A familiar case of
disease emergence that is driven by changes in the host community is Lyme
disease-the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America. The increases
in Lyme disease in the northeastern and midwestern USA over the past three
decades coincide with a range-wide decline of a key small mammal predator, the
red fox, likely due to expansion of coyote populations. This research explores
the hypothesis that changes in predator community structure have facilitated the
emergence of Lyme disease by sampling the abundance and infection prevalence of
the vector and host community in fox-dominated and coyote-dominated sites and by
incorporating predation and vertebrate community structure into disease models.

The postdoctoral fellow will develop expertise in laboratory techniques to assay
vector and hosts for pathogen infection, as well as statistical and analytical
techniques for modeling the ecological drivers of infectious disease. The
results of this research may have profound policy implications regarding how
wildlife is managed while accounting for public health considerations.
