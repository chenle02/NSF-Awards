This proposal requests funds to provide travel grants for underrepresented
undergraduate students from REU sites to present a poster contribution or an
oral paper at ER97 (ERF97 is the Estuarine Research Federation meeting in
Providence, RI in October, 1997). The PI plans to support 15 students in this
program, with the overall objective of engaging these underrepresented students
in the estuarine research community.
