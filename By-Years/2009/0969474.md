This STEP Type 2 project is a research study of engineering undergraduate
students intended to provide new knowledge about transfer of these students
between two year and four year colleges. The project is studying how transfer
students differ from native students in demographics, outcomes, and
trajectories. It explores the contribution of transfer students to the size and
diversity of graduating classes, and searches for explanations for observed
outcomes. The research team is studying the degree to which engineering students
transfer across institutions and pursue undergraduate engineering studies using
a longitudinal database of over 700,000 student records that have been
previously assembled by the investigators. The qualitative component of this
study relies on interviews and focus groups of transfer students to explore the
factors that motivated them to transfer out of their institutions, exploring GPA
and time-to-degree of engineering students for transfer and native students. The
project is expected to contribute to published literature about student
progression through the academic cycle and to provide information useful to
administrators of colleges and universities for making policy changes about
student participation and degree awards.
