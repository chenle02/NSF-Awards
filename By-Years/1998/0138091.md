Aaron Kuppermann of the California Institute of Technology is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to use theoretical quantum
reaction dynamics and associated ab initio reactive scattering calculations to
understand bimolecular reactions in triatomic, tetraatomic, and larger
polyatomic systems, including electronically nonadiabatic effects. Dynamic
resonances will be located and explored, along with other significant properties
of this benchmark reactive system. Also, a new hybrid quantum-classical approach
will be combined with a Bohmian quantum-corrected force field to create a hybrid
methodology with potential capabilities for describing complex three- or four-
center chemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elementary chemical reactions
are the basic building blocks for designing and understanding complex
technologically important systems, such as combustion processes, atmospheric
chemistry, chemical lasers, and behavior in plasma reactors. Continuing
improvements in high performance computing resources will enable new molecular
level understanding of important gas phase chemical reactions.
