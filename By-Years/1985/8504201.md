The experimental wedge-shaped hopper of the gamma ray densitometer is
reconfigured to permit measurements of the bulk density of flowing material in
the neighborhood of the discharge slot. The data set assembled from measurements
of a commercial standpipe are compared with the theoretical predictions from an
improved model of the vestical standpipe. Combined analytical and experimental
research continues on standpipe flow, hopper discharge, and rheological
characterization of granular materials.
