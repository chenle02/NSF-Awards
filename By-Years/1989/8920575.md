This Science in Developing Countries (SDC) Program award will support Professor
Robert Speed of Northwestern University in a research collaboration with
Professor Keith Rowley of the University of the West Indies in St. Augustine,
Trinidad. The investigators intend to study the structural and tectonic
evolution of the schist belt that forms the Northern Range of Trinidad. Their
work will focus on (1) the sequence of structures in the schist belt, (2) their
kinematics, mechanisms, and conditions of formation, (3) the kinematics of
emplacement of the schist belt at its present position, (4) the structure of its
southern margin, and (5) the ages of protolith deposition, metamorphism,
unroofing, and final emplacement. The problems Drs. Speed and Rowley will be
working on constitute some of the most significant unknowns in the Cenozoic
evolution of the Caribbean-South American plate boundary. An improved
understanding of the Northern Range should throw new light on (1) the most
applicable of current models of late Cenozoic southeastern Caribbean plate
boundary kinematics; (2) the evolution of regional structures, basins, and
hydrocarbons of onland and offshore Trinidad; and (3) faulting in the Trinidad
region, including the question whether Venezuela's El Pilar fault extends to
Trinidad or not and the origin of Trinidadian seismicity and its hazard
potential.
