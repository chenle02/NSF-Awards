The research focus is on investigation of high speed roll coating systems, and
stability analysis of liquid sheets and jets. A first objective is to increase
the coating speed, reduce the coating thickness, and facilitate the recycling of
coated paper products. Secondly, the stability analysis will be applied to
sheets, jets, in combustion of hazardous liquids, and high-fiber concentration
forming of paper and board.
