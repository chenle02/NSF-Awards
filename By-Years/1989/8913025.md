This action funds air travel and accommodations for 10 U.S. scientists to
participate in a Jacques Monod Conference on "Intracellular Redox Control in
Animals, Plants and Microorganisms by the Thioredoxin and Glutaredoxin Systems."
The Conference, to be held July 1-6, 1990 in Roscoff, France, also receives
support from Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) to cover
expenses for 30 scientists, including 7 from the U.S., 10 from France, 9 from
other European countries, and 4 from additional countries. This grant enables a
larger number of scientists from the U.S. to attend and benefit from this
international meeting. Each of the scientists supported by NSF are invited
speakers with their names appearing on the final program.***//
