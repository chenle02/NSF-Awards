Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics at Indiana University
will provide twelve undergraduate mathematics majors with a research topic and a
research environment so that they have an active eight week experience involving
mathematical research. The students will face the intellectual challenges of
learning more about a mathematical topic and developing approaches and solutions
for unsolved &lt;br/&gt;questions at a research level. This research experience
will enhance the students' perspective on mathematics and provide impressions of
how mathematical knowledge is evolving. It will also be a valuable
&lt;br/&gt;experience in actively finding results and communicating their work
to their peers.&lt;br/&gt;
