This NYI award will fund research on the basic mechanisms of multisegmental
movement, coordination and control. With the use of a 3-dimensional, 16 degree
of freedom model that the investigator developed, studies of the gait of
cerebral palsied children, methods to control balance and methods to predict
movement patterns will be investigated. Also being investigated are methods of
automating the measurement of musculoskeletal parameters through the use of MRI
and the use of optimal control techniques to coordinate the computer-simulated
models. The NYI Award also will help the investigator develop a new course on
Microcomputer Applications in Bioengineering and author a new textbook on
movement biomechanics.
