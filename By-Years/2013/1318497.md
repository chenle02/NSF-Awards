Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) represent an important computing
infrastructure which must be protected from attackers. They are used in a wide
variety of applications, including networking routers, satellites, military
equipment, and automobiles, among others. The storage of FPGA programming
information in memory external to the device creates a natural security weakness
which, to date, has primarily been addressed via bitstream encryption. Recent
work has shown that bitstream encryption is not impervious to attack and, with
sufficient effort, the logical function of some or all of an FPGA design can be
determined from a bitstream. This work systematically investigates advanced
attacks on FPGA designs and, more importantly, develops sound countermeasures
against FPGA design manipulations by determined attackers. To eliminate
weaknesses, FPGA security is addressed from a new angle: the use of hardware
obfuscation to make the true functionality of an FPGA design nearly
indecipherable even if the entire logic-level design can be determined by
bitstream reverse engineering. These questions are addressed by first developing
a series of search-based computer-aided design tools which can identify security
primitives (e.g. crypto primitives) in FPGA design logic-level netlists. As a
result of this work, a series of automated tools which allow FPGA circuit
designers to obscure the functionality of their subcircuits will be developed.
These tools will make malicious design modification significantly more difficult
or impossible.
