This study develops models of marriage and fertility by examining their links to
variations in women's status. The timing of marriage and of marital fertility
are posited to be the result of a sequential decision-making process that may
differ among cohorts and by social strata. This variability, in turn, may
reflect differences in educational and economic opportunities across
communities. The extent to which women are economically independent, have access
to contemporary knowledge, and live in egalitarian families are specified as
three key measures of women's status. Increases in status in terms of these
dimensions are hypothesized to lead to delays in marriage and to fertility
limitations within marriage. These hypotheses will be tested using data procured
from two groups of women, one aged 25-31 and those the other 40-49, who live in
four geographically, economically, and socially distinct rural subregions of
Colombia and in metropolitan Bogota. These areas were selected to maximize
variability on the key dimensions of women's status. This research is important
in that its findings promise to provide cogent evidence about the effects of
women's status within a community on their fertility.
