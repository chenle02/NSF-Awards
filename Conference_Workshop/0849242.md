Abstract Bisch

This proposal seeks funding for the annual Spring Institute in Noncommutative
Geometry and Operator Algebras (NCGAO) for three years (2009-2011). The aim of
each school/conference is to bring together graduate students, postdocs and
world-class researchers in the areas of emphasis of the school and present
introductory material and recent developments in mini-courses held by leading
experts. Since the number of graduate students and postdocs attending the past
NCGOA spring institutes has been huge, the institute will have an enormous
impact on noncommutative geometry in particular, and on the US mathematics
community in general.

Vanderbilt has hosted six annual Spring Institute in Noncommutative Geometry and
Operator Algebras since May 2003. The annual spring institute is a combination
of spring school and international research conference. It attracts typically
over100participants with more than two thirds students and postdocs. The topics
vary from year to year and cover a broad range of areas within noncommutative
geometry and operator algebras. The annual spring institute in NCGOA is directed
by Alain Connes and organized by the Center for Noncommutative Geometry and
Operator Algebras at Vanderbilt.
