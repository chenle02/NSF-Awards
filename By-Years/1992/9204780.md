Recent rhenium (Re)-osmium (Os) studies on a variety of magmatic products and
source materials illustrate the importance of this system to resolving issues of
magma and crust-mantle evolution. Preliminary results from a pilot Re-Os study
of northwestern U.S. basalts illustrate that combined Re-Os, conventional
isotope, and elemental data can help unravel the complexities of source- versus
process-related effects. This work seeks to expand on the pilot study by
investigating the Re-Os characteristics of well-documented suites of mafic and
silicic extrusive rocks and crustal as well as lithologies from the northwestern
and southwestern United States. The results will help to elucidate the details
of mantle and crustal processes and evolution in the continental setting.
