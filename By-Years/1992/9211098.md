The goal of this research project is to develop efficient methods for
electronic structure calculations, which can be applied to large systems. The
important criterion in this context is the scaling with respect to the size of
the system or with respect to other fundamental parameters such as the nuclear
charge. The attention will be focused both on Density Functional methods and on
Quantum Monte Carlo methods. Density Functional methods are appropriate for
calculations requiring moderate accuracy and the optimum scaling is quadratic in
the size of the systems. One of the goals of this research is to develop methods
that achieve that optimum. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are used where high
precision calculations are required and the key scaling is with respect to the
nuclear charge. Another goal of this research is to utilize pseudo potentials to
reduce the effective nuclear charge. The methods to be developed will be
implemented on parallel computers.
