This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of stable isotopes has become an
important tool in the study of a range of biological and chemical phenomena.
This instrumentation will allow the use of stable isotopes to pursue research
projects ranging from carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry, to food web dynamics,
to paleoecological and forensic analyses. The presence of these instruments on
campus will allow completion of these research projects without sending samples
to outside laboratories and will enhance research and teaching activities in an
almost unlimited range of science disciplines, from physical chemistry to
molecular biology and ecology. All of the projects represent significant
contributions to our understanding of environmental and chemical processes, and
enhance interdisciplinary research at St. Olaf College. The instrumentation will
also be used in classes as part of a growing tradition of research-based
teaching at St. Olaf College. Several current courses will benefit directly,
providing research opportunities for up to 40 students per year. In addition,
this acquisition will lead to the development of a new course in stable isotope
ecology taught by an early career scientist. Expected outcomes of this grant
include data leading to presentations at scientific meetings and research
publications in peer-reviewed journals, as well as the development of curricular
materials that will be disseminated to other science educators through websites
and other internet-based content.
