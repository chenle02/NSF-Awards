A research program in interactive computer modeling is being initiated. This
research concentrates on mathematical techniques for curve and surface
representation and their implementation in geometric modeling systems. Many
theoretical and practical issues are explored, including allowing local shape
parameters, generalizing in higher degree, determining divided-difference
formulas, deriving recurrence relations, developing subdivision techniques, and
designing rendering algorithms. Research in all these topics uses symbolic
computation tools such as Vaxima to handle the formal calculations. This work is
pursued both for its intrinsic mathematical interest and its potential use in
computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design. It is hoped that studying
the mathematical theory in response to the needs of the application area will
engender a better fundamental understanding and provide useful techniques in the
fields of computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design.
