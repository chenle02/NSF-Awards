At the Williams College "SMALL" REU site, for about nine weeks each summer,
about 20 undergraduates (14 supported by the NSF site grant) work in groups of
about three or four on original research with up to 6 faculty. Topics for 2004
include Computational Cartography, Ergodic Theory, Geometry/Minimal Surfaces,
&lt;br/&gt;and Riemannian Geometry of Manifolds of Positive
Curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the SMALL program is to introduce
undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in
mathematics, while naturally learning lots of background. They come to
understand that the ultimate goal of learning is not just to apply what is
known, but to make creative advances which further our understanding of
ourselves and our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our nation needs a wider
appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone
out. We encourage applications from women, minorities, and other
underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see our
