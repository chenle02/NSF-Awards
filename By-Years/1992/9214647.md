This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropological linguist
studying how Japanese people born between 1926 and 1935 talk about modern
history, specifically world war II and the aftermath. The project will use
standard methods of discourse analysis, including the recurrent emotive lexicon,
the use of intensifiers, and the analysis of other forms of speech, to examine
how people incorporate emotional overtones into their stories. Twenty males and
20 females will be audio- taped in extensive interviews on their recollections.
This research is important because Japan is a major world trading partner, and
increases in our understanding of Japanese cultural models of recent modern
history can help us deal with Japanese reactions to current events.
