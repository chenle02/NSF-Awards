Many diverse observations of the interstellar medium have provided evidence for
significant ionization of the diffuse gas which is outside of bright, localized,
well defined regions of ionized hydrogen. Recent reviews on the subject refer to
this warm, ionized gas as one of the four major phases of the interstellar
medium. Dr. Reynolds' observing program at the University of Wisconsin has
become the primary source of information about the warm, ionized phase of the
interstellar medium (ISM). The objective of the project is to investigate the
physical state of the ISM and the mechanisms which ionize and excite the gas
through the study of faint emission lines from the gas. A high resolution Fabry-
Perot spectrometer has been specially developed for this investigation.
