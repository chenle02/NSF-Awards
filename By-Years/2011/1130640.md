The objective of this research is to develop a design methodology with robust
shape and topology optimization (RSTO) that accounts for various forms of
geometric uncertainties in association with imperfections in manufacturing
small-scale structures. The research will provide a level-set based dynamic
topological design model that conveniently captures various forms of local and
global geometric uncertainties. A computational framework for probabilistic
topology design will be developed to integrate high performance uncertainty
propagation techniques with existing deterministic topology optimization
methods. The design testbed addresses the critical demand in sustainable energy
source through the design of optical metamaterials. The seamless integration of
the nano-fabrication and the RSTO methodology that requires no post processing
of geometry boundary offers 'hardware-in-the-loop' validation using fully
functional prototypes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed
research will transform existing techniques in deterministic topology
optimization to new methods for simultaneous shape and topology optimization
under geometric uncertainties. Although the testbed is focused on a nano-
engineered system, the methodology is general and widely applicable to handling
geometric uncertainties at micro, meso, and macro scales where geometric
variations have a large impact on product performance. The fruition of this
research will offer a unique research and educational environment for
multidisciplinary researchers across the fields of design and nano-manufacturing
while training students in an interdisciplinary learning environment. The
metamaterial design applications developed from this research will serve as
excellent examples for promoting engineering awareness in K-12 by illustrating
what is new in engineering and its impact on creating a sustainable environment.
