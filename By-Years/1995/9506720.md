The history of terrane accretion associated with the Appalachian orogen has
recently received renewed interest due to the possible interactions of laurentia
and Gondwanan. Study of the Milton terrane, between North American rocks and
peri-Gondwanan rock to the east has contradicted long-held views concerning the
nature and timing of deformation of the Milton belt. This collaborative project
will involve an integrated structural and isotopic study of the Milton belt to
constraining deformation timing by determination of the crystallization ages of
pre-, syn-, and post- tectonic plutons using high precision U-Pb zircon
geochronology and other isotopic techniques. Results are expected to
significantly revise the history of deformation of the Milton belt and will help
clarify chemical and isotopic affinities to Gondwanan and/or Laurentia.
