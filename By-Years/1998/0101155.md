Foreman's work is in two directions: ergodic theory and combinatorial
set&lt;br/&gt;theory. In ergodic theory he seeks to characterise the complexity
of&lt;br/&gt;various classes of ergodic measure preserving transformations,
using the&lt;br/&gt;tools of descriptive set theory. In combinatorial set theory
he is&lt;br/&gt;continuing a program of applying reflection principles and
Shelah's PCF&lt;br/&gt;theory to study classical problems in infinite
combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foreman investigates the phenomenon of
apparent randomness in physical&lt;br/&gt;systems that are deterministic in
nature. A system can be deterministic in&lt;br/&gt;the sense that the behavior
of any particular individual (particle) in&lt;br/&gt;that system is completely
determined (perhaps by some differential&lt;br/&gt;equations), but on a macro
level, any measurement made shows random&lt;br/&gt;behavior. Many systems in
nature have this kind of paradoxical properties.&lt;br/&gt;Foreman's other line
of research considers difficult combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;problems asked by people
such as Erdos in the 1960's that remain major&lt;br/&gt;questions in the 21st
century.&lt;br/&gt;
