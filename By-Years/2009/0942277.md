Interdisciplinary (99) The use of online social networking to transfer the
collaborative approach from small classes of fifteen to twenty students to large
classes divided into comparable sized groups is being developed and evaluated.
The approach is based on a successful course on scientific problem solving
currently offered to small sections. The course uses puzzles to develop
metacognitive strategies that can be transferred to other STEM courses and to
student research efforts. A problem is presented to the class and then attacked
collectively. The instructor facilitates the discussion with various strategies
designed to encourage metacognition, such as "think alouds", collaborative
drawing, and exchanging notebooks that track students' strategies and thinking
processes. Students find this to be a transformative experience that provides
them with learning models based on how their peers and their instructor
strategize their problem solving. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty students is about
the limit of how many students can productively participate&lt;br/&gt;in
collaborative problem solving in a classroom environment. The challenge being
addressed is to make social networking tools effective for the task of fostering
metacognitive engagement in learning and to develop tools to expand the reach of
the course to larger classes. To this end, the existing course in scientific
problem solving&lt;br/&gt;is augmented with social networking technology in the
form of a structured online notebook that connects to the efforts of peers
working on the same assignments. The existing course addresses problem solving
per se and is independent of any particular content. As such, it provides a
simple platform in which to test the contribution of social networking to the
development of effective problem solving. Student feedback is used to improve
the efficacy of the social networking environment through iterative updates.
