9602125 Goodman This study tests hypotheses concerning long-term consequences of
criminal justice involvement for victims of child sexual abuse. Participation in
criminal prosecutions, especially testifying in court, may results in emotional
harm and negative attitudes. In the proposed prospective-longitudinal study, 218
children and their caretakers will be followed up 10 years after they
participated in criminal prosecutions for which the children were alleged
victims of sex crimes. The original study gathered detailed information about
the abuse, the legal case, courtroom testimony, children's and caretakers'
emotional well being, and children's and caretakers' reactions to the legal
system. In this study, former participants and their caretakers will be
reinterviewed concerning present mental health, victimization, criminal
behavior, memory, and attitudes about the legal system. A matched comparison
group of adolescents and adults with no known history of child abuse or legal
intervention and their caretakers will also be interviewed. Data will be
analyzed in relation to earlier indices of mental health, characteristics of the
sexual assault, and specific legal experiences (e.g., whether or not the child
testified, case outcome). Factors contributing to or mediating negative
psychological consequences will be identified. Results will provide important
scientific information about the impact of laws and legal experience on former
victims of child sexual abuse. %%%%
