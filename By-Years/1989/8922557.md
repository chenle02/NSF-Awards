Professor Conway will investigate several topics in the theory of subnormal
operators and in several variable operator theory. Some of these questions are
related to the recent breakthrough of J.E. Thomson showing that bounded point
evaluations exist in interesting cases. Another question involves finding a
functional calculus for subnormal n-tuples of operators. This research involves
the theory of Hilbert space operators. These operators are essentially infinite
matrices of complex numbers. Such objects have applications in every area of
applied science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an
attempt to classify certain important classes of these operators.
