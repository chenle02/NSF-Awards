The X chromosome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has three specialized
properties: it controls sex determination via the X/A ratio; X-linked genes are
subject to dosage compensation; and it is under independent meiotic control. My
previous work has focused on the relationship of sex determination to dosage
compensation. This proposal describes a molecular study of dpy-26, an autosomal
gene that affects all three of these properties, to understand how the
properties are related. Two other autosomal genes that affect sex determination
and dosage compensation, but not meiosis, will be studied for comparison to
dpy-26. In addition, this proposal outlines a genetic and molecular analysis of
two genes that specifically affect disjunction and recombination of the X
chromosome, with no effect on the autosomes. We will use these genes to
investigate the relationship among exchange, disjunction, and conversion on the
X chromosome. We will also identify new mutations that specifically reduce or
eliminate recombination on the X chromosome. In conjunction with the analysis of
dpy-26, analysis of these genes will likely contribute to the understanding of
both the general mechanisms of meiosis and the chromosome-specific mechanisms of
meiosis.***//
