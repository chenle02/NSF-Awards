Ion channels are large proteins that allow current in the form of ions to pass
across cell membranes. The inter- relationships of a large variety of ion
channels shape the electrical signals of the neuro-muscular system. Single
channels patch clamp recordings provide important information about these
channels. The apparently random character of the recorded currents has led to
the widespread use of stochastic models. We propose to investigate a number of
problems that arise in modeling the stochastic behavior of ion channels and in
the analysis of patch clamp recordings. The flow of electrical charge is
fundamental to the operation of the nervous system and its interaction with the
muscular system. At a microscopic level, charge is conducted through channels in
the cell membrane called ion channels. The pioneering work of Sakmann and Neger,
for which they received the Nobel Prize, allows direct measurement of the
current flow through a single ion channel. The resulting recordings reveal that
the channels open and close in a random fashion and consequently methods of
probability and statistics have played an important role in the analysis of the
recordings. We propose to investigate a number of problems that arise in such
analyses.
