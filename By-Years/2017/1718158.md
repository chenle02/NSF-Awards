Many scientific computing applications in critical areas of research, such as
nanotechnology, astrophysics, climate, bioinformatics, and high-energy physics,
are becoming more data intensive than ever before. The volume of the data and
the pressure on the runtime system capability of supporting data intensive
operations substantially increases over the time. This project introduces and
optimizes data processing capabilities within memory. The project provides a
fundamental change to data management and program optimization, and brings
promising performance and energy benefits. The project will significantly
advance simulation capabilities of scientific applications, especially those
with intensive data processing. The goal of the project is to enable high-
performance, energy-efficient, and flexible processing-in-memory design, which
is adaptive to the irregular, diverse, and changing behaviors among data
intensive scientific applications. To achieve the goal, a heterogeneous
processing-in-memory design, built up with fixed-function processing-in-memory
and general programmable processing-in-memory, is introduced. The project
explores a series of critical questions for building emerging processing-in-
memory, including heterogeneous processing-in-memory architecture, processing-
in-memory programming models, runtime design, and the implications of
processing-in-memory on high performance scientific applications. The project
will significantly advance the knowledge to build processing-in-memory, and pave
the way to integrate it into the existing and future systems.
