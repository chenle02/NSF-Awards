Increased concern about global environmental change has focused attention on
the need to identify critical variables that can be used to monitor shifts in
the world's climate and other physical conditions. Among the variables that
scientists believe will provide accurate, easily updated indices of changing
conditions are measurements of the extent and duration of seasonal snow cover
and of the amounts of ice within glaciers and ice caps. This project will gather
data on these variables from a number of published sources in both the U.S. and
U.S.S.R. Remotely sensed data also will be gathered. Preliminary analyses will
be undertaken to ascertain how these cryospheric variables correlate with other
climatic, topographic, and land-characteristic variables. This research will be
conducted collaboratively between scientists at the University of Colorado-
Boulder and the Institute of Geography of the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R. This project will bring together data about snow cover and glacial
fluctuations in addition to other related variables. These data will provide
valuable new information with which to test hypotheses about the degree to which
cryospheric variables may be used as indices of global environmental change. The
project also will provide tests of new means of gathering data using remote
sensors, and it will foster greater collaboration between American and Soviet
scientists with common research interests.
