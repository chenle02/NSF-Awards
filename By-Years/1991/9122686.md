This project examines a class of social dilemmas in which groups of players are
asked to share a resource pool whose size is not known. Rather, the size is
sampled randomly from a probability distribution which is common knowledge. Each
member of the group requests a share of the resource; individual requests are
granted only if the total group request does not exceed x. Experimental evidence
shows that as the uncertainty about the resource size increases, people increase
their requests thereby increasing the probability that their requests will be
denied. Six experiments will be conducted to study several variables of interest
in such situations including the amount of uncertainty about the resource, the
number of iterations (possible requests from one individual), the value of
public and secret information, and speed of feedback concerning individual
requests. Several situation protocols will be considered. Under one protocol
requests are made independently and simultaneously, under a second protocol
requests are made sequentially, and under third protocol only chronological
information is provided. The experiments are driven by game theoretical models
describing equilibrium solutions and psychological models involving the concept
of focal points. This award is to be supplemented under the Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) Program. This project provides a variety of excellent
research opportunities for for undergraduate students. There are several
components of the research where undergraduates have an opportunity to
contribute to the project and to work closely with the principal investigator.
Specifically, two undergraduate students will be supported. These students will
be involved in design, conduct, and analysis of a series of experiments. The
integration of students into all phases of the project should be of significant
benefit to the students as they plan career goals.
