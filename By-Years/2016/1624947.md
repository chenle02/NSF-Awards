This study seeks to understand the structure and evolution of nocturnal
(nighttime) thunderstorms using data collected from the Plains Elevated
Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign conducted in the summer of 2015. The
research results from this study have the potential to be very relevant to
improving operational forecast models and informing operational weather
forecasters. Societal benefits include improved forecasting and increased lead-
time to warn citizens of the impending dangers from these nighttime
thunderstorms and the associated hazards of high wind, heavy rainfall and
flooding.

The PI plans to conduct very high-resolution (down to 1km grid spacing)
simulations of nocturnal thunderstorms. The underlying science of accurately
forecasting warm season (summer) rainfall over the Great Plains of the United
States remains elusive. This research will focus on the role of the low-level
jet (LLJ), boundary layer processes, and microphysical processes. The PI
proposes to use the WRF and NMMB numerical models to conduct the research, and
to use special observations from the recent PECAN field experiment, along with
routinely available observations, to evaluate the model output.
