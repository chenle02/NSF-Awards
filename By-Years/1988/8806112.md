Little is known of the genetics of spirochetes, an ancient eubacterial division.
In the course of studies of the spirochetal agents of relapsing fever and Lyme
disease, Dr. Barbour found that the members of the genus Borrelia have novel
genetic elements, linear plasmids. These linear plasmids bear the genes for the
major surface proteins of the two species examined in most depth, B. hermsii and
B. burgdorferi. In possessing covalently-closed ends, the Borrelia plasmids
resemble poxviruses and some eukaryotic replicons. The specific aims of this
project are the following: (l) characterization of the structure and function of
the linear plasmids, and (2) development of systems for genetic manipulation of
spirochetes. The project will wed capability in handling these difficult- to-
handle and fastidious organisms with experience in the techniques of molecular
genetics. It is anticipated that the studies outlined in this proposal will
reveal much about the genetics of spirochetes in general as well as the
molecular biology of linear plasmids specifically.
