ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For complex nanocomposite systems, the
modeling and prediction methodology must cover length scale from molecular
(nanometer) to meso and macroscale. The goal of this proposal is to improve and
expand computational mechanics of a nanocomposite system using the
experimentally determined nanomechanical properties and incorporating them into
meso and macroscale models. Specifically, we propose to develop a multiscale
model to simulate mechanical responses of nacre, a biomimetic layered
nanocomposite of organic and an inorganic components. Numerical models using
three-dimensional finite element analysis will be developed for predicting
nonlinear and time dependant response of the nanocomposite. Advanced
computational facilities (NCSA supercomputers) and experimental facilities (high
resolution scanning probe and transmission electron microscopy, vibrational
spectroscopy) will be utilized for this research. Results of this research will
result in potential criteria for practical, simulation-based materials design of
scalable and complex (hybrid) composites containing both a soft and a hard
component using the concepts of both biomimetics and nanotechnology.
