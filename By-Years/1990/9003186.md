The atmospheric chemistry and gas-to-particle conversion phenomena of biogenic
hydrocarbon systems will be investigated in this research project. The goals of
the research are to elucidate the gas-phase photooxidation pathways of key
biogenic hydrocarbons, to identify the aerosol-forming capability of these
hydrocarbons, to further understanding of gas-to-particle conversion phenomena
in atmospheric organic systems, and to evaluate the applicability of nucleation
theories to atmospheric species. Outdoor smog chamber experiments will be
conducted with isoprene/NOx and beta pinene/NOx mixture over a spectrum of
concentration levels. Quantities to be measured include hydrocarbon, O3, NO, NO2
concentrations, aerosol size distributions by differential mobility analyzer,
optical particle counter and epiphianiometer, and aerosol molecular composition
by GC/MS and FTIR analyses. Aerosol species identified will be studied for
nucleation either as single component or binary, with water. Theoretical work
will continue on the development of a kinetic theory of nucleation. Analysis of
the experimental data will involve a description of gas-phase chemical reaction
mechanisms, including the generation of condensable species, the nucleation of
these species, either homomolecular or binary, and the diffusion of these and
additional species to particles.
