Built upon a culture of inclusiveness, Choose Development is a three-year
project through which the Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) aims to
augment the diversity of undergraduate students that enter doctoral (PhD)
programs in their pursuit of research careers in fields related to developmental
biology. This pioneering program emphasizes professional development and
research training under long-term and continuing supervision by expert
developmental biology research faculty. Undergraduates with disabilities and
those belonging to under-represented minority (URM) groups will be selected from
a national applicant pool and matched to research laboratories with trained
faculty mentors committed to enhancing their preparation to enter graduate
programs. Students will be recognized as an elite group of SDB Fellows who will
spend two summers (and possibly an academic year as well) carrying out
independent research in the mentor's laboratory. The Society will ensure
dissemination of their research accomplishments through the students'
participation in SDB regional and/or national meetings, complemented by strong
support and encouragement from members of this scientific community. It is
expected that most, if not all of these SDB Fellows will choose and be accepted
into graduate programs on developmental biology or related areas. This project
will have important implications toward enhancing training strategies that aim
to diversify the population of investigators in the discipline of developmental
biology, as well as that of our future scientific workforce to coincide with the
expected demographic changes in the United States. SDB will also develop and
implement resources to assist other scientific and disciplinary societies that
plan to adopt similar approaches.
