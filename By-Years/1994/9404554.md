9404554 Shelley Large-scale computation and computational mathematics are now
primary tools for studying those physical processes characterized by randomness
and strong nonlinearity. These processes include complex pattern formation and
growth problems in diffusion dominated systems, and wave interactions on the
ocean's free surface. Closely related are problems with singular or nearly
singular behavior, such as flows undergoing changes in topological type, or
water wave breaking. The main objective of this proposal is to investigate such
problems in fluids and materials by developing and applying state-of-the-art
numerical methods to large-scale computation, and understanding important
constituent processes through analysis and modelling. All these problems, while
arising in quite disparate physical settings, are strongly mediated by the
presence of surface tension or energy, and often share mathematical structure.
In this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical analysis,
modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to study certain fundamental
problems in fluid dynamics and materials science. One such problem is
understanding pattern formation in diffusion dominated systems. This has
important implications in the production of metallic alloys. The complex
patterns that are observed to form within the alloys during their production,
strongly affect the bulk properties of the resulting alloys, such as their
strength and toughness. Other problems involve the motions of free surfaces in
fluid flows. Two important instances are the interactions of waves on the
ocean's surface, and the dynamics of flows undergoing changes in topological
type, say as characterized by the production of bubbles through the mixing of
two fluids. All of the above problems are similar in the sense that the relevant
phenomena is heavily influenced by surface tension at the interface (called
"surface energy" in the materials science context). As such, they c an be
studied by some common analytical and computational tools.
