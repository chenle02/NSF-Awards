Barsony 9501788 This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) program. As a CAREER awardee the investigator is
expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to her scientific
research project. Understanding how stars form has great ramifications for
understanding formation of stellar systems at all scales, from planetary system
formation through large-scale structure of the Universe. Barsony will study star
formation from three perspectives -- to determine the initial conditions for
star formation, to characterize the earliest observationally recognizable
protostellar state, and to try to understand the mechanisms leading to molecular
cloud fragmentation and thus the formation of star clusters. These projects rely
on observations over a broad range of wavelengths -- millimeter, submillimeter,
and near infrared. The education plan includes developing new courses:
Astrophysics and Stellar Astronomy for undergraduates and graduate classes
including Radiative Processes in Astrophysics, Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics and
Readings from Current Astrophysics Research. Also an undergraduate physics
computing facility will be set up so that computers can be directly integrated
into the teaching of undergraduate physics classes. ***
