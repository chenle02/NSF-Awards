Approximately one half of the earth is believed to be MgSiO3-perovskite. The
idealized crystal structure of this material consists of 8 silicon octahedra,
each sitting at the corner of a cube with Mg in the center of cube. This
material, examined at room pressure and temperature is slightly distorted, with
small rotations of these octahedra about various axes to yield an orthorhombic
crystal symmetry. Such distortions in other perovskites, however, have lead to
an array of physical properties and temperature dependences of these properties
which drastically differ from those expected in the absence of these rotational
degrees of freedom. It is the aim of this project to investigate some of these
properties with the hope of gaining insight to the behavior of MgSiO3 in the
earth's lower mantle. The PI will obtain several materials with the perovskite
structure to determine properties inherent to the structure and prepare samples
for Brillouin spectroscopy and X-ray studies through phase transitions.
