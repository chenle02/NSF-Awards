This full-scale project is developing and adapting innovative methodologies and
tools to facilitate the design of interactive assessments of student learning
processes that are mediated by technology. Building on previous work, the
project incorporates three components and capabilities into an existing platform
that makes it suitable for implementation in a wide range of learning
environments. The components are authoring tools, crowd-sourcing resources, and
automated support for data abstraction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A team of
researchers and developers from Stanford University lead the effort and are
developing the following products (1) an authoring language to develop
interactive assessments of student learning; (2) a crowd sourcing dashboard to
facilitate validation of measures; and (3) a data abstraction platform to assist
in the collection and analysis of the rich corpus of data associated with these
types of assessments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With an increased interest in the
development and use of a wide range of ways to assess student learning, this
full scale research and development project focuses on the development of an
assessment infrastructure that supports the creation and use of new forms of
assessments and analyses. The main platform is designed to support subsequent
extensions and feature addition in response to the dynamic nature of knowledge
about student learning and new approaches to measuring student outcomes.
