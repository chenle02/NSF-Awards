The proposed research is an investigation of modern Aleut society and culture in
the global geo-political and economic context of the North Pacific commercial
fishing industry. Building on her dissertation research, funded by the Arctic
Social Sciences Program, the PI will investigate the contested nature,
politically, economically and culturally, of the North Pacific southwestern
Alaska fishery called Area M. Through archival research, formal and informal
surveys, interviews, and participant observation, Reedy-Maschner has the
potential to shed light on the adaptive strategies of contemporary indigenous
people, the Aleut, to the contemporary geo-political and economic contexts of
their lives.
