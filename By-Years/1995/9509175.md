This research will focus on optimizing the physical properties of lead
complexes identified in Phase I as safer, more volatile precusors for chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) of ferroelectric materials. These lead CVD precursors
will contain ligands surrounding the lead center carefully selected to optimize
the physical, chemical, and environmental characteristics of the reagents.
Deposition of device quality lead zirconate titanate films will be demonstrated
and large scale synthetic methods will be developed. CVD is the most promising
manufacturing method for lead based ferroelectrics, and these new ferroelectrics
will be specifically designed to meet high purity film growth and current safety
requirements. This makes desirable for numerous electronic devices including
non-volatile memories, electro-optic spatial light modulators, piezoelectric
actuators, and pyroelectric infrared detectors.
