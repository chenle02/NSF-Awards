The large detectors at the Super Collider (SSC) will require scintillating and
wavelength shifting plastic optical fibers. Because of the 100 to 1000 higher
intensity at the SSC, the ambient radiation levels are much greater than
previously encountered at atom smashers. Existing fibers based on polystyrene as
the core plastic tend to degrade in the high radiation fields. This research
will demonstrate the feasibility of producing fibers based on polysiloxane which
will be much more resistant to the damaging effects of radiation. This work is
novel because there will be used an elastomer for the core of the fiber and a
unique blend of copolymer for the cladding, neither of which have ever before
been used in the production of radiation resistant optical fibers. Based on the
existing data these new fibers are expected to be stable in response up to about
10 Megarads.
