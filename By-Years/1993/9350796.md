9350796 Byrd In order to improve undergraduate instruction and enhance student
achievement in freshman and sophomore science and mathematics courses at
Enterprise State Junior College, an interactive computer facility will be
established. More specifically, the goal of the project is to improve
mathematics and science instruction, particularly for women, by allowing
instructors to develop and apply field tested courseware which will enhance
conventional instruction, provide for effective simulations and tutorials, and
enable students to acquire skills in using modern laboratory apparatus and
instrumentation in the context of designing and conducting meaningful scientific
and mathematical inquiries. The project will also add to the body of knowledge
related to effective instruction of undergraduates and serve as a model
demonstration center for other two-year colleges.
