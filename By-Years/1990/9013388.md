This project will analyze and interpret geophysical data collected in the
Barbados Accretionary Complex. The goals and products of the project include:
(1) development of a comprehensive picture of the relation between the 3-D
surface morphology of the accretionary prism and subbottom structures, (2)
further definition of the distribution of heat flow in the Barbados Ridge
accretionary complex, (3) characterization of the fluid flux and fluid expulsion
features in areas that have been surveyed with seismic reflection methods and
measurements of thermal, chemical and pore pressure gradients, (4) determination
of the permeability and thermal properties of sediments taken in cores and
analysis of long-term in site pore- pressure records obtained in 1988 to
determine the in situ poro- elastic properties, and (5) further development of
thermal and hydrological models of accretionary complex development.
