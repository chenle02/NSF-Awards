This is a three year cooperative study proposed by Dr. Sangtae Kim, the
University of Wisconsin, Madison and Professor Huan J. Keh, National Taiwan
University supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science
Program. This project plans to study the microstructures of electrophoresis.
Electrophoresis is one of the most important techniques used in the chemical and
biological sciences. Dr. Kim is a leading U.S. researcher in the area of
computer simulations and two-phrase flows. Professor Huan J. Ken of the National
Taiwan University is a specialist in electrophoresis. Their expertise compliment
well and the collaboration is mutually beneficial. This study has been the
potential to significantly advance our understanding of the microstructures of
electrophoresis.
