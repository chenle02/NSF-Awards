The project will analyze the development of social behavior from birth through
the first year of life, focusing on imitation in newborn babies. This project
aims to enhance the understanding of the development of sociality in infants and
pave the way for future research aimed at identifying infants at risk for
neurodevelopmental disorders. It will expand knowledge about the nature of early
imitation and whether it may be used to predict later social interest,
abilities, and physiology. Furthermore, to further advance research in this
domain, project resources and data will be shared with the broader research
community. A mentoring program designed to increase the research participation
of women and underrepresented minorities will inspire young students to pursue
science careers by introducing them to the scientific method. Finally, this
project integrates research and education across disciplines, linking the
diverse fields of animal behavior and developmental
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using longitudinal designs with behavioral and
physiological measures, this project will explore links between neonatal
imitation and later social development. Neonatal imitation is an early capacity
to match others' actions, such as facial expressions. The findings of earlier
studies have suggested that by measuring imitation in newborn babies, we may
become better able to predict their developmental trajectories. To increase
measurement sensitivity and improve replicability, neonatal imitation of facial
gestures will be assessed using automated facial analysis. Eye tracking will
measure infants' visual attention to social and nonsocial stimuli. Infant saliva
will be collected to track developmental changes in levels of oxytocin, a
neuropeptide associated with social behavior. Infants will participate in semi-
structured assessments of their nonverbal communicative skills. The investigator
will test whether neonatal imitation can be used to better understand individual
differences in early sociability and to predict healthy social development.
