The conference, High Dimensional Probability V (HDPV), will include such topics
as Limit Theorems, Empirical Processes and their Applications, Probability
Inequalities, Infinitely Divisibility (in several contexts), Small Deviations,
Statistical Learning theory, Spin/Glass Methods, Convex Geometry and
Applications as well as Random Matrices and Additive Combinatorics. The meeting
will consist of a mix of formal and informal discussions and presentations. It
is not only intended to present the current state of the art in the field, but
also to point out important open problems and to set new directions for the
field. The conference will bring together mathematicians and statisticians from
several countries (US, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, etc) facilitating their
scientific exchanges and collaboration. Traditionally, there has been strong
participation in HDP conferences of junior faculty, post docs and graduate
students as well as women and minorities. This trend will continue at this
meeting.

The locations of the previous conferences have alternated between European and
US sites in three years intervals. The 2005 meeting took place in Santa Fe, New
Mexico. The 2008 meeting will be held at the Centre International de Rencontres
Mathematiques (CIRM), Luminy, France. This is a very well equipped conference
center that will provide us the opportunity to accommodate a large number of
participants.
