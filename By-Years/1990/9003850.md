This project will provide logistical support for the launch of a long duration
balloon for the study of the isotopic composition of heavy (iron group) cosmic
rays. The project is called MAGPIE: Magnetic Passive Isotope Experiment, and
consists of special plastic sheets that can be etched to reveal tracks made by
energetic cosmic rays. The plastic is mounted in a strong magnetic field that is
produced by a superconducting magnet. The experiment will determine the isotopic
composition with unprecedented accuracy, and will thereby provide information on
the elemental makeup of the galaxy and the stellar processes which produce all
of the heavier elements. Due to the high geomagnetic latitude of Antarctica
these fairly low energy heavy ions will reach the atmosphere in much larger
numbers than they would at mid-latitudes. This, combined with the lack of
diurnal heating and cooling of the balloon, because of the constant sunshine
during the polar summer, makes long duration ballooning in Antarctica for cosmic
ray research very attractive. The funds for the researchers and the launch of
the balloon will be provided by NASA. NSF will provide logistical support and
the recovery of the payload.//
