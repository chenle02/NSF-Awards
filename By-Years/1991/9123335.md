In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Richard J. Saykally of the University of California, Berkeley, will
study hydrogen tunneling dynamics in hydrated proton clusters and in non-
classical ions using the new technique of Direct Laser Absorption Spectroscopy
in Fast Ion Beams. He will also use this technique to study small carbon
clusters to elucidate their structure and dynamics. Tunneling dynamics in
partially solvated metal cations and the far infrared vibration-rotation
tunneling spectra of weakly bound complexes will also be examined. There is also
a theoretical component to the project consisting of the inversion of far
infrared spectra of neutral weakly bound complexes to determine the potential
energy surfaces. %%% Increasing numbers of scientists turn to large-scale
computer modeling of molecular structure and function in order to design new
drugs, catalysts, and artificial enzymes, to name a few applications.
However,incomplete knowledge of the weak interactions of chemistry, such as van
der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, is a serious impediment to acquiring
realistic results from these calculations. Intermolecular potentials are a
critical part of the input required for these computer codes as well as for
models of chemical reactions in liquids, gas-surface interactions, and protein
dynamics. The studies in this project aim at collecting and analyzing data which
will be useful for determining some of these intermolecular potentials.
