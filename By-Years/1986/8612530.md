The impact of live interchange between industrial personnel and engineering
students using television transmission from industrial sites is being
investigated. The study is a cooperative effort of the departments of Mechanical
and Electrical and Computer Engineering. Two first semester, senior-level
courses, one a relatively unstructured project design course and the other a
relatively structured course in very large scale integrated circuit (VLSI)
design, provide the focus for the study. Brief objective surveys are used to
assess student reaction
