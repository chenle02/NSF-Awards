The primary aim of the project is to improve the quality of a new and innovative
chemistry laboratory technician program through the acquisition of a UV-Visible
Diode Array Spectrometer, Gas Chromatograph, Liquid Chromatograph,
Refractometer, and pH meters, as well as computer interfacing equipment. The
instruments are also being used in chemistry courses taught to students who
intend to transfer to four year colleges. Due to the working partnership created
between the college and the chemical industry in developing and running the
program, both are sharing the responsibility for contributing and/or purchasing
equipment as a match to the project. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
