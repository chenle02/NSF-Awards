Abstract

Ecological processes are key to global efforts to maintain biological diversity.
Pollination is an essential ecological process, but widespread habitat
fragmentation is disrupting native plant-pollinator interactions worldwide and
threatens long-term conservation of native communities. Habitat fragmentation
reduces populations, and recent studies have revealed a positive correlation
between population size and plant reproductive success. The major challenge is
to understand the mechanisms underlying this correlation. In the proposed work,
three possible causes of the above correlation will be examined: 1) reduced
pollinator attraction could lower reproductive success in fragments, 2) lower
pollinator diversity in fragments may increase pollinator limitation, and 3)
smaller population sizes may result in greater inbreeding (and concomitant
inbreeding depression). These mechanisms will explored for two species, Geranium
viscosissimum and Asclepias speciosa, using both observational and experimental
approaches.
