Dr. Armstrong is being given the Presidential Young Investigator Award from the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program to support his research into the
molecular-level interactions of proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules. This
work will provide the information required to synthesize the new generation
molecules to be used in agriculture and medicine. The synthesis of modified
polysaccaride is being undertaken to provide a means of controlling the linear
distance between peptides and other substances in water soluble systems. A small
DNA fragment has been synthesized that contains an internal "handle" to provide
a better understanding of the local and global chiral environment of DNA. These
two projects, if successful, will guide further work of the important
interactions that are important in biochemical systems. In addition, the
synthesis of the structurally interesting natural products echinosporin,
calyculin A and carzinophilin are being synthesized. These will improve the
understanding of the important DNA-inactivation processes.
