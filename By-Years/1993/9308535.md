Orailoglu This research is on automatic synthesis of fault-tolerant micro-
architectures. Two areas are being investigated. One is an exploration of
methodologies and CAD tools for synthesis of self-recovering micro-
architectures. The model for self- recovering designs is a flow-graph
representation in which partial results from two copies of the graph are
periodically compared at a checkpoint. Research is on scheduling, allocation,
binding, and checkpoint insertion. The second is an investigation of techniques
automatic synthesis of fault-secure micro-architectures. Salient features of the
research are: algorithms for region delineation so as to ameliorate hardware
bottlenecks, and region scheduling so as to relax and weaken precedence
constraints between regions.
