This is a study of the impact of changes in the spatial distribution of
employment opportunities within urban areas on minority and youth employment
outcomes. The central focus of the study is to study the extent to which the
mismatch between the location and types of jobs and the location and skills of
potential employees helps explain contemporary black/white differences in
employment. The study will use data for census tracts in twelve metropolitan
areas in the United States. This study is an important addition to the
literature on the causes of racial differences in employment rates. The unique
contribution of the study is that it develops direct measures of employment
potentials for small areas (tracts). This in turn makes it possible to assess
empirically whether the so-called spatial mismatch hypothesis is correct. The
spatial mismatch hypothesis suggests that the cause of the low employment rates
for black men in some metropolitan areas in the United States is that they live
in areas where there are no jobs available that match the skills they bring to
the labor market.
