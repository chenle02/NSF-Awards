The purpose of this study is to understand Young Makers in K-12 and how their
knowledge,&lt;br/&gt;skills, and attitudes might prepare them to pursue advanced
STEM education and careers. This&lt;br/&gt;study will advance the currently
limited knowledge of the Young Maker community by&lt;br/&gt;developing theory
characterizing Young Makers and their pathways through the lens of
formal&lt;br/&gt;engineering education. The aim is to establish evidence as to
how Making benefits Young&lt;br/&gt;Makers and affects their pathways to STEM
majors and related careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will
transform the conversation of who Young Makers could become,&lt;br/&gt;linking
Making with engineering in the same way that students who excel in science and
math&lt;br/&gt;are pointed toward engineering by parents and career counselors.
By sharing a diverse (by age,&lt;br/&gt;gender, and ethnicity) set of success
profiles of Young Makers widely in the formal education&lt;br/&gt;system to
students, K-12 school administrators, university leaders, admissions officers,
and to&lt;br/&gt;Young Makers both online and at Young Maker community events,
we aim to illuminate&lt;br/&gt;pathways for Young Makers to become the engineers
of the future. In addition, this study could&lt;br/&gt;inform future innovation
in formal K-12 STEM pedagogy based on successful attributes
of&lt;br/&gt;informal engineering education and tinkering activities.
