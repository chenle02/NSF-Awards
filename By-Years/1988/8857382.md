The objective of this research program is to investigate the performance of new
high-speed three-terminal semiconductor devices, particularly, the high electron
mobility transistor (HEMT), the heterostructure bipolar transistor (HBT), and
the hot electron transistor. The modeling of these devices requires a rigorous
treatment of nonstationary transport phenomena, velocity overshoot, and
ballistic transport, within the context of a two-dimensional Monte Carlo
solution of the semiclassical Boltzmann Transport Equation coupled with the two-
dimensional Poisson equation. The Monte Carlo method rigorously treats from
first principles all of the essential physics of nonstationary transport. The
model has been fully tested and calibrated through a series of "bootstrap"
tests; prediction of bulk velocity-field profiles, two-dimensional mobilities
and real space transfer effects. The NSF super-computer center in Pittsburg will
be used to perform these calculations. Specifically, new pseudomorphic HEMTs and
resonant tunneling emitter, hot electron transistors will be studied. It is
expected that new, optimized geometries for high speed device operation will be
developed.
