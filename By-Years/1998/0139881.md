&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School of Biological Sciences of The University of
Texas at Austin offers a ten-week REU Site Program in Molecular Biology designed
to introduce talented, upper-level undergraduates to intensive, independent
laboratory research. A ten-week summer program, involving ten students each year
for three years, will provide each participant a stipend, room and board, travel
allowance and tuition for the independent research course in which all are
enrolled. We seek participants who have good course work preparation in
molecular biology and are interested in post-graduate study but have not had the
opportunity to do research. Participants will work individually with faculty
mentors matched with the student's interests and background, and they will have
access to all faculty members in the School of Biological Sciences and the
Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology through seminars and lab visits.
Students will be placed in active faculty research labs that deal with such
problems as gene structure and control, cell signaling, developmental genetics
and pathogenic mechanisms, which are being studied in a variety of model
organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants and mammals. In weekly group
meetings, students will discuss current issues in molecular biology, prepare for
the GRE, and learn about graduate school. Each participant will present an oral
progress report to the group and will write an abstract and prepare a research
poster for a closing symposium.&lt;br/&gt;
