We propose to implement a new, multidisciplinary training program in
Environmental Biology at the University of Kentucky, focusing on evolutionary
ecology. Our program will provide a unique blend of integrative training in
modern concepts and methodologies, teaching students to think analytically and
synthetically across levels of study. Our students will learn to utilize both
parts of the "theory/experiment loop" and to integrate them effectively in
answering front-line research questions. Key features of the proposed training
include: (1)an emphasis on collaborations among peers in a highly interactive
research environment; (2)mentoring from both a faculty members and postdoctoral
personnel--and the opportunity to provide some mentoring for undergraduate
researcher; (3)short-course workshops led by distinguished scientist; and
(4)innovative training in research methodology, combining exposure to
contemporary techniques (e.g. molecular methods, quantitative genetics,
field/semi-field experimentation, modeling) with first-year research projects.
Our proposed GRT project represents the culmination of the EPSCOR-initiated
establishment of the Center for Evolutionary Ecology at the University of
Kentucky. The requested support, extensively matched by UK, will allow us to
increase the opportunities for individuals from under-represented groups in our
field and to help meet the nation's need for integratively trained environmental
biologists.
