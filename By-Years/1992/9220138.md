The extreme environment of Antarctica provides a unique opportunity to study
adaptation of organisms to cold as well as dry conditions. This research will
focus on an Antarctic yeast (Leucosporidium sp.) as a model system to study
cellular function and regulation at the molecular level through the isolation of
genes required for cold adaptation. Before genes necessary to examine these
processes will be cloned, a transformational system, including a mechanism for
the recovery of isolated DNA, will be developed for Leucosporidium. Antibiotic
resistance markers on plasmid or cosmid vectors will be utilized to follow the
introduction of exogenous DNA into this system and plasmid or cosmid DNA will be
re-isolated from the transformed yeast to insure replication fidelity after
transformation. This project will lead to the application of the techniques of
RNA subtraction and complementation of induced mutations to isolate those genes
which are either constitutively regulated by life in the cold or variably
regulated for adaptation to a changing cold environment.
