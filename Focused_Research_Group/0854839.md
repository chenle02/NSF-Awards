Algebraic dynamics is the study of problems that occur on the interface of
number theory, algebraic geometry, and discrete dynamical systems. Orbits of
points under iteration of a self-map of a variety correspond to finitely
generated subgroups of abelian varieties, and there are natural (mostly
conjectural) algebraic dynamical analogues of famous theorems in arithmetic
geometry regarding the existence and distribution of rational, integral, and
torsion points on varieties. The investigators will study these algbebraic
dynamical questions using tools drawn from number theory, algebraic geometry,
Diophantine approximation, and model theory. They will also study associated
moduli problems and will investigate geometric and arithmetic properties of
dynamical moduli spaces and dynamical modular curves.

Discrete dynamics studies what happens when a function is repeatedly applied to
an initial point. For some points, the behavior is well-behaved, while for other
points the iterates move around in a chaotic fashion. Algebraic dynamics is an
exciting new area of research that amalgamates dynamical systems with algebra
and number theory. The investigators will study number theoretic properties of
the orbit of iterates when the initial point is an integer or a rational number
and the function is given by polynomials. In particular, they will study (mostly
still conjectural) dynamical analogues of many famous results in number theory
that describe the distribution of integer and rational solutions to systems of
polynomial equations.
