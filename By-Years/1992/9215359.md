This proposed research is to study the air-sea interactions in the warm pool
region in the South Pacific using observations taken during the TOGA COARE
Intensive Observing Period. Air-sea fluxes, their variability, parameterization
and coupling to the ocean and atmosphere will be determined using turbulence-
equipped aircraft. Several unique flight plans are proposed which use 2 or 3 of
the aircraft in highly-coordinated flight patterns to measure the surface
variability of the fluxes, the vertical structure of the boundary layer and the
atmospheric sensible heat, moisture, and momentum budgets. The coupling to the
ocean is emphasized with the patterns centered over the TOGA COARE ships and
buoys. The atmospheric budgets will be determined when possible within the scale
of the larger array of radars and island sounding stations. The aircraft
sensible heat, moisture, and momentum boundary-layer budgets will be compared to
the larger scale budgets estimated from the array of ships and radars to
determine the statistical basis of the larger scale budgets. This research is
important because it serves as one of the studies of the TOGA COARE that link
air-sea interaction processes to the larger scales that impact climate
variability in an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western
Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
