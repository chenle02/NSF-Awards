Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is a process where a digital model
directs the layering of materials to create a three dimensional object of almost
any shape, including industrial parts. From prototyping to distributed
manufacturing, AM has a significant role in the future of advanced manufacturing
in this Nation and preparing a skilled AM workforce is imperative. The project
aims to develop STEM graduates who will demonstrate competencies in AM, so that
employers will experience a positive return with the output of highly skilled
employees. The Manufacturing Original Didactic Experiences in Learning 3D (MODEL
3D) program at Wake Technical Community College (Wake Tech) is training students
and educators using cutting edge 3D rapid prototyping technologies and enhancing
the robust industries related to 3D printing and AM across North Carolina. The
primary goals of this project are to: 1) Strengthen Wake Tech curriculum by
integrating current AM practices in ways that meet diverse learners' needs; 2)
Improve student learning, performance and industry skill acquisition by
incorporating work-based and experiential learning opportunities in STEM
courses; and 3) Collaborate with industry partners for curriculum development
and education partners for dissemination activities. Key activities include
establishment of MODEL 3D AM technology laboratories, creation of an industry
partnership group, integration of AM technology into seven pilot courses, and
professional development for Wake Tech faculty, external community college
faculty, and secondary school educators. MODEL 3D makes innovative AM technology
accessible to STEM students, community college faculty, and secondary educators
by using portable 3D printing machinery, promoting student scholarship and
educator training. The intellectual merit of MODEL 3D is that the design affords
participants multiple opportunities to interact with and learn about design
software and printing equipment and to interface with 3D models, enhancing
learning in STEM courses.
