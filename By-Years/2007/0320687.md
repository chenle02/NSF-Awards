With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Hamilton College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a)
the stereochemistry of bromoallene formation in marine algae; b) investigation
of the chemical ecology of asters and the butterflies that use them as host
plants; c) isolation and structure of bioactive substances from a sponge; d) a
conformational study of synthetic peptides that mimic the minimal active
sequence of alpha fetoprotein; e) the development of synthetic methodology and
mechanistic studies in free radical chemistry; and f) probing the nature of the
nitric oxide oxidation of neurotransmitters.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in marine studies, synthetic organic chemistry and
biochemistry.
