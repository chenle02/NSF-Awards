This RPG in the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor Brazdil of John Carroll
University will address the dynamics of aromatic iodination reactions. This is a
new variation on the traditional methodology which is both more efficient and
more environmentally friendly in that it generates less toxic waste. The
mechanism for this new process is unknown and the PI plans to bring as many
modern techniques as possible to bear on the problem of understanding the
pathway. If successful, the methdology that the PI establishes may well be
applicable to other electrophilic reactions. Electophilic substitution of iodine
for hydrogen on an aromatic nucleus is an important step in the synthesis of
organic compounds which are of interest and use in the medical field. Iodination
is the preferred pathway as chlorination and bromination are more harsh which
results in degradation of substrate. This study will help understand the
reaction parameters which govern the efficiency of the process. Thus, this
investigation should provide scientists with the knowledge to use the procedure
more efficiently and in doing so, reduce the amount of toxic waste products.
