This grant will help support the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend
the International Workshop on Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR). WAFR
is a high-level, single-track, international workshop that brings roboticists
and theoretical computer scientists together. The conference attracts an
international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs,
and funding agency leaders. The meeting environment allows participants to
exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming
scientists, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the
leading edge of robotic technology.
