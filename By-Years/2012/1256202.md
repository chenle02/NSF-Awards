1256202&lt;br/&gt;Khan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Sciences
Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant support acquistion of a portable
hyperspectral camera system (near infrared) to support research and education at
UH. The instruments will augment other digital geologic mapping tools (TLS) at
the University of Houston. The instrument will support research and research
training that would benefit from the capability to spectroscopically
characterize geologic outcrops in support of neotectonic studies with the goals
of mapping the distribution of melt channels beneath ancient mid-ocean rides
(from ophiolite studies), developing 3D fluid flow models, understanding rock
alterations and sulphide mineralization. The requested systems will complement
an extant Terrestrial Laser Scanner for studies of fundamental geological
processes, natural hazard mitigation and energy resource exploration and
processes for TLS and hyperspectral data fusion will be developed. The
instrument will serve graduate students and post-doctoral researchers working
with the PIs and other faculty at UH and support undergraduate eduction through
incorporation into a geology field camps offered by the University of Houston at
Yellowstone Bighorn Research Alliance (YBRA) site in Red Lodge, Montana. UH is
is a minority serving institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
