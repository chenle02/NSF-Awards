9528484 Ribe This grant provides $117,378 as one-half support of the costs of
computer upgrades and purchase of a new high-end IBM RISC 6000 workstation for
use in this group's computationally intensive research in geodynamics, modeling
of active tectonics, seismic imaging of the crust, and theoretical seismology
and paleoclimatology. More specifically, the upgrades will allow this group to
develop more realistic and complex 3-D models for, visualization of mantle
plume-lithosphere interactions, mixing at the interfaces of mantle convection
cells and seismic propagation through the earth's crust as well as to develop
geographic information system databases and regional-scale models for studies in
active tectonics. ***
