This two year project proposes to design, develop, produce and evaluate
instructional materials for incorporation in inservice programs to be delivered
to underprepared middle and junior high school mathematics teachers in Utah via
telecommunications networks. The materials will focus on the specific needs
identified by the Underprepared Math Teacher Assessment Project and will
include: (1) video lecture and discussion presentations enhanced with computer
graphics; (2) videos of model lessons conducted by exemplary middle and junior
high school teachers; (3) videos analyzing problems and situations commonly
confronted by middle and junior high school math teachers; (4) guidebook with
exercises, explanations, and resource information to be used in conjunction with
the videos. These tapes will have open and closed caption for use by hearing
impaired teachers. This Utah State University project involves classroom
teachers, local school districts, Utah Office of Education and national review
boards. There is significant cost sharing by the school districts, the State of
Utah and the university.
