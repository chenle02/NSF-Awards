Professors Sarah Rutan at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Peter Carr
at the University of Minnesota are supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop quantitative aspects
of two-dimensional liquid chromatography, with a focus on applications in
metabolomics. Specifically, this work addresses the optimization of the
separation conditions and exploration of novel means to accelerate both the
second dimension separation and the analysis of the resulting data. The aim is
to transform a time-consuming process that is semi-quantitative at best into a
rapid and efficient method that will provide precise quantitative results for
applications such as biomarker identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the work will provide important new tools for biological scientists
and will contribute towards improved understanding of complex biological
systems. In order to make the concepts of metabolomics more accessible to a
broader audience, a website with online simulators for metabolism and
separations will be developed, along with associated activities designed for use
in the high school classroom.
