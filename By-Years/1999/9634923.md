9634923 William This project is to assess the deterioration of concrete
properties with the aid of ultrasonic wave transmission techniques. To this end
concrete specimens will be subjected to mechanical load-unload-reload histories
in order to initiate stress-induced deterioration processes. The main objective
will be to determine whether ultrasonic measurements lead to quantitative damage
information on concrete materials. The project includes theoretical,
experimental and computational research and development along the following
directions: (a) Ultrasonic Wave Transmission Studies in Concrete Specimens (b)
Characterization of Damage (c) Separation of Elastic Degradation and
Inelasticity The project will clarify the predictive capabilities of ultrasonic
damage assessment in concrete materials. ***
