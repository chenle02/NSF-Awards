Integrating field, molecular and surveillance data to predict and control
wildlife zoonoses

Endemic and newly emerging infectious diseases of wildlife represent important
threats to biodiversity, human health and socio-economic advancement. Management
of wildlife diseases is often limited by high system complexity and sparse data.
Incorporating molecular sequence data into mechanistic models of disease
transmission is one of the most promising avenues to advance understanding of
pathogen persistence and thereby improve prospects for control. This research
will use vampire bat transmitted rabies to develop a statistical framework that
integrates field data from bat colonies in Peru with time series and molecular
sequence data from rabies outbreaks in livestock. Analysis of viral sequence
data will identify geographic predictors of viral diffusion across landscapes.
Data from field surveys and national surveillance programs will inform
spatially-explicit transmission models. Transmission trees generated from these
models will be compared to observed viral phylogenies for parameter refinement
and model selection. Simulation studies will explore the efficacy of alternative
culling or oral vaccination plans.

Maximizing biological inference from diverse datasets is a frontier in disease
ecology that will improve management of a variety of zoonotic diseases. This
project will provide a framework to integrate three types of data that are
increasingly collected in studies that seek mechanistic understanding of
pathogen persistence: longitudinal field surveillance, time series and molecular
sequence data. The research will generate a sophisticated understanding of
rabies epidemiology in vampire bats, a disease responsible for thousands of
domestic animal deaths yearly and increasing human rabies mortality. The tools
developed will inform control programs throughout Latin America and constitute a
first step towards viral elimination, while expanding scientific capacity in a
developing country.
