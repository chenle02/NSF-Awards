The sense of taste involves chemosensory stimuli that usually are complex
mixtures rather than single pure substances. It remains critical to know whether
the taste system treats stimulus mixtures differently from their individually
presented components. This work uses the relatively simple taste system of the
catfish, which is exquisitely sensitive to amino acid stimuli, to understand how
such neural information about mixtures is processed. Electrophysiology on single
nerve cells in the peripheral taste system will be used to see what types of
mixture interactions (suppression or enhancement) are present, whether different
nerves process a mixture differently, and whether the mixture interactions are
predictable based on responses to the individual components of the mixture.
Responses of nerve cells in the brain will reveal how the inputs from different
peripheral fiber types converge, and whether mixture information is processed
differently between periphery and brain. Specific behaviors elicited by
particular amino acids, such as feeding, will be used to determine how well
discrimination can be done by taste alone, and how mixtures affect behavior.
This study using this unique model system will have an impact on neuroscience in
general, by increasing our understanding of how complex sensory information in
general is processed, by providing useful comparisons with other model
chemosensory systems in insects and crustaceans, and by providing useful
analogies to current work in visual and auditory analysis of complex signals. It
also is likely to have an impact on biotechnology, by providing useful
information on how mixtures affect flavor, and by offering the potential for
chemosensory modulation of feeding behavior in aquaculture.
