This award provides partial funding to support a meeting entitled "Eukaryotic
mRNA Processing", to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory August 20-24,
2003. This meeting will be the fourth biennial conference in this series. There
will be about 300 participants. The focus will continue to be on mRNA splicing
and poly-adenylation, but, in line with recent developments, increasing
attention will be paid to RNA transport, the impact of the history of a mRNA
molecule on its fate (as in nonsense-mediated decay), RNAi, and genomic
approaches. The organizers have taken care to ensure the participation of
students, young investigators, and underrepresented minorities. Rather than
having a pre-determined list of invited speakers, all presentations will be
selected entirely on the basis of abstracts submitted. It is expected that, as
in previous years, most of the talks will be given by graduate students, post-
docs and young independent investigators.
