*** 9660860 Seitz This project will evaluate the feasibility of using toughened
polystyrene to prepare high efficiency stationary phases for planar
chromatography. It is based on technology that Fenris Technology Research, Inc.,
has developed to toughen porous polystyrene and control its morphology. It is
anticipated that these materials will lead to planar chromatography phases that
yield both-rapid and highly efficient separations. Furthermore, these materials
can be used over a much wider range of conditions than currently available
reversed phase materials for chromatography, e.g. high pH. The objectives of
Phase I are: (1) to prepare a large number of stationary phases using a variety
of polymer formulations and (2) to characterize the chromatographic properties
of these phases including efficiency, retardation factor, rate of mobile phase
transport and loading capacity. The company will prepare and characterize both
free standing phases and phases covalently bonded to glass substrates. Phase I
feasibility will be established if the company succeeds in preparing stationary
phases that measurably improve on currently available commercial reversed phase
materials for planar chromatography. By improving on current technology with
respect to speed, efficiency and range of possible chromatographic conditions,
these materials will be able to capture a substantial part of the market place
that currently belongs to reversed materials prepared by bonding alkyl groups to
silica. This technology opens up the possibility for a stationary phase material
that can be used for both high efficiency planer and high performance liquid
chromatography. ***
