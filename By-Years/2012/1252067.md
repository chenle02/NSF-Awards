This project is an empirical study of the use of judicial mediation in the
Chinese legal system today. Judicial mediation has become increasingly prevalent
in the past decade in China. Judicial mediation has become a model for resolving
not just legal disputes, but broader, extralegal disputes. About the same time
as judicial mediation returned to prominence in courts, China's party-state has
begun to develop and push for the idea of 'grand mediation' as a mechanism for
redressing administrative and social disputes. This project will analyze
mediation in circumstances likely to occur in daily life, such as personal
injury or family problems. In other contexts, the question has arisen whether
mediation leads to outcomes consistent with legal rules. Therefore, it will
contribute to understanding of the development and implementation of the rule of
law. How does the rule of law develop? What relationship does its development
have to changes in processes on the ground in China?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will rely on observation to study how mediation is carried out in
several base-level courts in different parts of China. Researchers will observe
how judges interact with litigants and persuade them to settle, and will also
interview judges. The project will also analyze why some litigants agree to
negotiate to a settlement and others insist on adjudication.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study promises to get an in-depth, firsthand look at
this practice central to Chinese civil justice. How should one evaluate the rise
of mediation in China? Is it a form of constructive and less adversarial
justice? Or is it a threat to the integrity of adjudication and thereby the
development of the rule of law in China? They will shed light on how Chinese-
style mediation is similar to or different from the communal or court-based
mediation commonly found in the Anglo-American system. The widespread
acknowledgment of the importance of the rule of law in China makes this project
especially important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has substantial broader
impacts because the question of how the rule of law develops is important to
policymakers and the development of transnational business. In addition, the
project will contribute to training students in an area of profound importance.
