The PI will undertake high resolution electron microscope and micro- Raman
studies of quasi one and zero dimensional structures created via growth on in-
situ, focussed ion beam (FIB) patterned substrates in a unique system comprised
of UHV interfaced III-V molecular beam epitaxical growth, FIB patterning and
processing, metallization, and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition for
deposition of isolation and encapsulation dielectrics. The high resolution
electron microscope and micro-Raman facilities at the U.S. Army Electronics and
Device Technology Laboratory, Ft. Monmouth, will be employed to examine the
atomistic structural nature and strain effects at interfaces defining the
laterally confined quantum well structures grown in this unique system.
