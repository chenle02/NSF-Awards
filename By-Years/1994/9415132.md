9415132 Karandikar This project is an assessment of the stat-of-the-art in
engineering design theory and methodology from the perspective of both academe
and industry. It includes an extensive survey of design researchers, both United
States and foreign; and a search of the latest research in the area. This study
makes an independent appraisal of the impact of research which is funded in the
design theory and methodology area. This will help the research community to
take stock of the rapid developments in the field and to disseminate the
findings to a broad audience so that the impact of the developments of the
research efforts can be enhanced.
