9410143 Sastry This is an Engineering Research Deployment Teaching Initiative
award to provide lecture notes and video tapes on rapid solidification
processing and spray deposition of high performance materials to be used for
transferring the university research into industrial manufacturing and
production. The principal objective of this effort is to present in a concise
and effective manner the vast research and development accomplished to date in
these areas. Rapid solidification processing, with accompanying large
undercooling and high cooling rates, originally used for the study of metastable
phase formation, has emerged as a viable commercial method for the production of
a wide range of extended solid solution alloys, dispersion strengthened alloys,
intermetallics, and in-situ composites. Light weight, high strength aluminum
alloys, high strength steels, oxidation-resistant nickel base superalloys, and
high temperature alloys have been successfully produced by rapid solidification
processing. The products that result from this grant will be usable as course
material for senior undergraduate and graduate level students of manufacturing
science in universities, for short courses, and for in-house training of
materials and manufacturing engineers in industry.
