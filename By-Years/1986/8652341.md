This two year urban and rural project will: o design and pilot test an
instrument to collect data to determine middle school teachers' comprehension
about middle school mathematical concepts and to construct mathematical profiles
of these teachers; o use this instrument to conduct the interviews of urban and
rural middle school teachers; o construct in-service mathematics institutes, for
teams of elementary school teachers and principals, based on the teachers'
profiles and the principal investigators research on children's proportional
reasoning and problem solving; o run the newly designed summer institute with
academic year follow-up in the urban and rural settings in which the teachers
were tested. The principal investigators are Professor Thomas Post of the
University of Minnesota and Professor Merlyn Behr of Northern Illinois
University. The PIs will administer two types of written examinations and one
oral interview to teachers from the Minneapolis, Minnesota and DeKalb, Illinois
areas. The examination topics will include concepts of number and arithmetical
operations, rational numbers, proportional reasoning, geometry, probability and
statistics, pre-algebra, problem solving and technology. The PIs will develop
and select those learning activities for the teachers' institute which focus on
higher order thinking skills and understanding processes related to mathematical
teaching. The summer institutes will run during the summer of 1988. The academic
year follow-ups include several on-site visits and mini-conferences.
