Funds are provided for a service project to collect, quality control, analyze
and distribute to all BEST investigators the core chlorophyll-a data. This
project will support one person on each spring cruise. Data will be freely
available on databases at PMEL, NODC, and the Alaska Ocean Observation System
(AOOS). In addition to the service portion of this proposal, the PIs will use
the biological data from this proposal combined with a) physical and chemical
data collected on spring and summer BEST cruises b) data from a September NPCREP
cruise c) data from moorings and from satellite-tracked drifters to address one
hypothesis:&lt;br/&gt;The marked difference between the more pelagic southern
shelf and the more&lt;br/&gt;benthic northern shelf is a result of the position
of the sea-ice edge during the&lt;br/&gt;transition from strong winter winds to
milder summer conditions.&lt;br/&gt;
