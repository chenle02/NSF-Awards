9411952 Calkins This project will provide support for an historian of
international relations to receive one year of training in nuclear engineering,
health physics and radiation protection fundamentals. The investigator will also
undertake collaborative research with a senior nuclear engineer and health
physicist, to enable her to study the radiation protection management strategies
accompanying the worldwide diffusion of non-military nuclear technologies.
Project research will develop along three related lines: i) a study of the role
of radiation protection management features in developing countries' nuclear
technologies acquisition programs since 1955; ii) identification of the
structures and content of formal and informal international regulatory regimes
for assuring exposure risk minimization in the education, health and safety,
materials management, and facilities oversight sectors; and iii) an assessment
of developing countries' past, current, and probable future engagement with
those regulatory regimes. The outcome will be multi-dimensional and technically
specific examinations of the process of nuclear technology development and
accompanying radiation protection regulation outside the advanced industrial
states. It will offer new insights into the utility of various international
regulatory regimes in non-military sectors and into radiation protection and
materials management worldwide. Results will be disseminated broadly through
publications and presentations in academic and policy-making communities, as
well as through university and public presentations. ***
