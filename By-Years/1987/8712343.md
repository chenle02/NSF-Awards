Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solutions. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
of Oregon State University will use an award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program and the Biological Instrumentation Program to help
purchase 250 MHz Fourier Transform NMR spectrometer. The areas of chemistry and
biology that will be enhanced by the acquisition of the instrument include: 1)
Bioorganic Studies of Antibiotics 2) Structural Analysis of Natural Products and
Synthetic Intermediates by NMR 3) The use of NMR in the Synthesis of
Oligonucleotide Analogs and the Morphine Alkaloids 4) Structure Elucidation of
Biomedically Relevant Natural Products from Marine Plants 5) Alkylation of DNA
by Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Metabolites 6) Biophysical Studies on DNA Structures
and Interactions: Application of NMR Techniques
