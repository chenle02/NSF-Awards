0930703&lt;br/&gt;Clarke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support acquisition of a Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) imaging
system and shock wave tube to study the dynamics of simulated volcanic eruptions
in laboratory experiments. Laser-based multi-phase fluid dynamic diagnostic
capabilities will enable simulation of a range of particle laden nonsteady flows
including subaerial volcanic eruptions and hydrothermal black smokers. PI
Amanada Clarke and her students will focus on experimental simulation and
quantitative observation of the fluid dynamics of Vulcanian eruptions, base
surges, lateral blasts, and shock-generating explosions. Laboratory results will
be compared with field observations and numerical eruption models in order to
improve volcanic hazards predictions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
