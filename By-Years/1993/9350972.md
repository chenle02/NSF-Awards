This advanced laboratory for microbiology majors features the integrates the
technology of modern cell and molecular biology into existing laboratory
exercises so that students select for molecular study an organism they have
isolated from nature. They utilize molecular probes to confirm the identities of
their isolates by fluorescence microscopy. They then purify DNA from their
isolates, and apply both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) gene amplification and
Southern blot analyses to the DNA. This integrated approach enables students to
understand isolated techniques in a wider context.
