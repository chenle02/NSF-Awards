The problem of computing the set of irreducible unitary representations of a Lie
group is one of the main unsolved problems in representation theory. The primary
goal of this project is to compute the unitary dual of real and p-adic Lie
groups, by a combination of mathematical and computational techniques. In
particular we plan to develop a set of software packages for computing structure
theory of Lie groups, admissible representations, and unitary representations.

Representation theory has applications to a broad spectrum of mathematical and
scientific disciplines. Of particular significance is the central role it plays
in modern number theory, automorphic forms and the Langlands program. On the
other hand representation theory, in particular the study of unitary
representations, is a very technical subject, and difficult for non-specialists.
A primary goal of this project is to make information about Lie groups and
representation accessible to a wide mathematical and scientific audience.
Everything we do is being documented and made available through our web site,
www.liegroups.org. This includes on-line tools for accessing information about
representation theory. In addition we are developing a software package to do
computations in structure theory, admissible representations, and unitary
representations. This is comparable to the software package LiE for computing
with semisimple Lie algebras, although at a considerably higher level. We
envision this project playing a role in Lie groups comparable to the one the
Atlas of Finite Groups plays in finite group theory.
