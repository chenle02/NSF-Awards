CBET-0827850&lt;br/&gt;Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the
2008 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) to be held May
14-17, 2008 in Paris, France. This symposium is the fifth in a series and is co-
sponsored by two IEEE societies: the Signal Processing Society (SPS) and the
Engineering in Medicine and Biology Science (EMBS). The ISBI is a forum for
researchers particularly interested in the computational and modeling aspects of
biomedical imaging. Methodologies emphasized in the forum could apply to
multiple imaging modalities and to imaging at varying scales. Topics for the
forums include physical, biological and statistical modeling of biological and
anatomical structures, image formation and reconstruction, computational image
analysis, statistical image analysis, visualization, and image quality
assessment. The meeting aims to facilitate cross-fertilization of methodologies
between different imaging modalities and scales, with applications ranging from
the nano, molecular and cellular levels through small-animal imaging and
macroscopic to whole-body clinical systems. This symposium will be the first
occurrence of ISBI outside the United States. This symposium will be of great
educational benefit and be inspiring to junior researchers and students across
many fields.
