9403111 Schultz Dr. Brian E. Schultz has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Schultz's doctoral degree was from Harvard
University under the sponsorship of Professor Richard Holm. Dr. Schultz will
continue research at the California Institute of Technology under the
sponsorship of Professor Sunney Chan. Dr. Schultz's postdoctoral fellowship will
provide him with bio-inorganic training in protein synthesis and purification,
fast kinetics, and advanced spectroscopic skills such as EPR, Resonance Raman
and ENDOR. Longer term, he plans to study the role of redox-active metals in
protein folding and the ramifications on enzyme mechanisms where redox-based
conformational changes are used as allosteric controls or in active ion
transport. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching. ***
