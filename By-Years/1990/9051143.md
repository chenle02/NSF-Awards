Wellesley College is developing an intermediate level undergraduate course on
the interpretation and analysis of archaeological data with a special emphasis
on computer graphics processing of visual records of archaeological data.
Students are introduced to applications such as the computer generation of maps
and line drawings of material culture remains from video images. Students learn
how archaeologists present and manipulate visual depictions of the
archaeological record in order to reconstruct the past and how to present one's
works to an archaeological audience. The school is purchasing a MacIntosh IIx
computer, video camera, color videographics board, software, and peripherial
equipment which allow for the prcessing of visual images that will form the
basis of student projects in the course. The course functions to channel
interested students into already available advanced archaeological seminars, and
is intended to increase the number of students pursuing graduate study in
anthropological archaeology. The college will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
