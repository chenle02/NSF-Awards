The visible reflectance of water clouds depends upon its composition,
particularly the size distribution and concentration of water droplets and the
total liquid water content. In clouds of low droplet concentration, typically
found over the oceans, the addition of a few more cloud condensation nuclei
could significantly alter the cloud's reflectance to visible light. When
averaged over the entire globe this effect could cancel the presumed warning
arising from the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, even if
this global effect is unrealized the physics of aerosol pollution, and cloud
reflectance remains intrinsically interesting.
