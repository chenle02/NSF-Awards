The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Pacific Lutheran
University will establish an artificial intelligence (AI) laboratory as part of
a new AI track in the computer science major. The laboratory will be equipped
with four Tektronix 4405 AI development systems. The laboratory will be used in
three courses: Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, and Expert Systems.
The AI sequence will provide students with a strong background in the rapidly
growing specialty of AI as part of a broader computer science major.
