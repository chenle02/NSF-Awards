This action joins the Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center (HTIRC)
with an existing National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC), the Tree Genetic Engineering Research Cooperative
(TGERC) at Oregon State University. Both centers share the same goal: the study
of technologies to genetically improve trees for use in intensively managed tree
plantations. The objectives, structure, and policies of TGERC are well
established, and similar to those of the HTIRC.

HTIRC is vertically integrated with molecular and classical geneticists, tree
physiologists, silviculturalists, and nursery and regeneration specialists. The
strength is the ability to perform basic, applies, and developmental research so
the genetic knowledge that is created will be delivered to industrial and
private landowners in value-added products rather than knowledge that benefits
only the scientific community.
