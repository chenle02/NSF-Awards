The goal of this project is to (1) develop theoretical foundations and
analytical tools for the analysis and control of a class of nonlinear dynamical
systems such as power systems, and (2) achieve valuable and practical results
for power systems by making use of the structure inherent in the systems and
these developed tools. The characterization of power system stability by
examining the controlling unstable equilibrium point is a first step goal, to be
achieved by fully developing the theoretical considerations.
