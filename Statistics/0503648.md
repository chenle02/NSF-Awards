ABSTRACT

Prop ID: DMS-0503648 PI: Hobert, James P. NSF Program: STATISTICS Institution:
University of Florida Title: Exact and Approximate Markov Chain Sampling
Algorithms

The disadvantages of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (relative to
classical Monte Carlo techniques) can sometimes be overcome via perfect
sampling, which is a method of converting the underlying Markov chain into an
algorithm that produces independent and identically distributed samples from its
stationary distribution. Unfortunately, perfect sampling algorithms have not
lived up to their expectations for handling intractable distributions whose
support is unbounded and continuous. The investigator develops a wide-ranging
perfect sampling algorithm that is particularly well-suited to such
distributions. The basic idea is to exploit a mixture representation of the a
stationary distribution. The investigator also studies techniques for Bayesian
analysis of the market model, which is a multivariate regression model used by
financial economists to analyze data on asset returns. Empirical evidence and
theoretical arguments suggest that the errors in this model should be from a
heavy-tailed, elliptically symmetric distribution. However, the Bayesian
methodology that has been developed for making inferences via the market model
is based on the assumption of multivariate normal errors. This disconnect is
presumably due to the fact that the posterior distributions corresponding to the
heavy-tailed alternatives are highly intractable. The PI develops and analyzes
Monte Carlo and MCMC methods for exploring such posterior distributions.

Bayesian statistical methods of analyzing data often require the user to deal
with intractable probability distributions. The investigator develops sampling
algorithms that facilitate the use of such Bayesian methods. These algorithms
enhance infrastructure for research and education by providing scientists from
many different disciplines with better techniques for making inferences from
their data.
