Refined Languages (Refined Fortran, Refined C, etc.) are extensions of their
parent languages in which it is possible to express parallelism, but impossible
to create races. Where strictly deterministic behavior is desired, multiple
executions of a Refined Fortran program with the same input data can be
guaranteed to either compute the same results or terminate with the same run-
time errors regardless of differences in scheduling. Where asynchronous behavior
is desired, freedom from races can be guaranteed. The Refined Languages approach
achieves its goal by extending sequential imperative programming languages with
data- (rather than control-) oriented terms. Specification of Refined ANSI
Fortran `77, and construction of an interprocedural Fortran `77 code analysis
tool are complete. This award is to modify the specification to Fortran `8X,
extend the analysis tool into a Refined Fortran `8X compiler, and exploit the
special features of Refined Languages to construct a Refined Fortran `8X
symbolic debugger. Formal study of the comparative expressive powers of control-
oriented parallel imperative languages and data- oriented parallel imperative
languages will ensue.
