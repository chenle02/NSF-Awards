The project will expand our understanding of noise and develop new tools for
coping with, and benefiting from noise in a variety of computational settings.
Settings considered under this project can be broken into three groups: (1)
interactive communication; (2) circuit computation; and (3) dynamical systems
when viewed as computing devices. Considering the effect of noise in each of
these settings yields many interesting and important problems. At a theoretical
level, the project aims to develop new schemes for error-correction when dealing
with computation using unreliable components, as well as to map out the
limitations of such schemes. At a practical level, the research may lead to the
development of more efficient error-correcting communication schemes, and more
power efficient circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a technical level, the cross-
cutting theme of this proposal is using information theory to better understand
the effect of noise in the different settings. Past work by the PI and others in
the areas studied under this project, suggests that there will be a transfer of
techniques between these different settings. The project connects several
disciplines: interactive error-correction is on the cusp between traditional
coding theory and communication complexity; circuit error correction is of
interest within both complexity theory and computer architecture; and the study
of computational aspects of noisy dynamical systems brings together theoretical
computer science, dynamical systems, and theoretical physics. Broader impacts of
the project include curriculum development, broaden participation of students in
theoretical areas and writing survey articles.
