With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Division of
Chemistry is funding Professor Zachary D. Schultz of the University of Notre
Dame to explore ways to enhance the signal from molecular samples being imaged
by a scanning probe microscope. A type of light scattering (Raman scattering)
can reveal information about the structure of molecules. In a scanning probe
experiment, the probe tip can enhance the Raman scattering signal (this is
called tip-enhanced Raman scattering, or 'TERS'). Professor Schultz is
investigating the origin of Raman signal enhancements observed from
nanostructures coupled with tip enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) imaging. The
instrumentation and methodology is being used in collaboration with Snite Museum
of Art to identify pigments in medieval artwork and aid conservation studies.
The incorporation of graduate and undergraduate students in this research
provides a platform for promoting measurement science and a training opportunity
for the students to gain research skills relevant to academic research and
commercial interests.

The project focuses on understanding the plasmonic effects that give rise to
chemical specific signals in TERS experiments. TERS imaging combined with
hyperspectral dark-field microscopy determines the plasmon modes and Raman
scattering arising from the interaction of a TERS-tip with various sized and
shaped nanoparticles (NPs). The electric fields experienced by molecules around
the nanostructures are being studied by vibrational frequency shifts rather than
signal intensity. Chemical functionalization of the TERS tip and the surface is
being used to study the location of the molecules that give rise to the observed
TERS signals. The sensitivity of the TERS measurements is being investigated to
determine the possibility of single protein studies. This project has the
potential to enable chemical characterization of protein receptors in intact
cell membranes.
