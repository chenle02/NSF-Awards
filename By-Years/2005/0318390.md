This research will contribute to the development of a robust time-distance
analysis and inversion methodology to use the solar acoustic oscillations to
infer the three-dimensional subsurface structure of magnetic flux concentrations
rising from the solar interior. It will permit one to better characterize the
actual diagnostic potential of the method and to better understand the biases in
the inferred solutions introduced by the topology of the associated annihilator,
while addressing trade-off issues between resolution in space and time versus
error magnification. Such a development of time-distance analysis techniques is
a key element needed to maximize the scientific return of the upgraded Global
Oscillation Network Group (GONG) instruments, and it also offers the potential
of a long-range forecasting tool for the National Space Weather Program.
