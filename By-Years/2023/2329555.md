This award funds a Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) Regional
Research Conference on "Algorithmic Fractal Dimensions" to be held May 20-24,
2024, at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. The central focus of the
conference will be ten lectures to be given by Professor Jack Lutz of Iowa State
University. Algorithmic fractal dimensions were first developed at the beginning
of this century as measures of the density of information in various
mathematical objects. As the name suggests, they are versions of classical
fractal dimensions that have the theory of computing embedded in their
definitions. They have already had applications in computability theory,
computational complexity, information theory, and number theory. Most
strikingly, algorithmic fractal dimensions are being used with increasing
frequency to prove new theorems--some answering long-standing open problems--in
classical fractal geometry, theorems whose statements do not involve
computability or related aspects of mathematical logic. The conference will thus
be of interest to participants from multiple research communities. Invitations
to the conference will reflect this breadth and will prioritize early-career
researchers, members of historically underrepresented groups, and a range of
institutions in the Midwest.

The conference lectures will begin with an introduction to the classical
Hausdorff and packing dimensions and an overview of the lectures to come.
Following that will be a discussion of what it means to effectivize a
mathematical concept. The lectures will then proceed to use effectivization to
define algorithmic versions of classical Hausdorff and packing dimensions.
Application of these dimensions will be discussed, along with how they unify
Hausdorff dimension with the later information theories of Shannon and
Kolmogorov. The use of algorithmic dimensions to develop useful notions of the
dimensions of individual points in Euclidean space will be emphasized, as it
leads to the Point-to-Set Principle that has enabled several surprising
applications in geometric measure theory. The lectures will also discuss
applications in computational complexity, information theory, and the theory of
Borel normal numbers. Beyond the lectures, the conference will provide ample
time for open problem sessions and other discussions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
