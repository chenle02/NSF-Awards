This group studies gravity physics via experimental and theoretical work on
extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. The COBE detection of anisotropy of the
2.7K thermal cosmic background radiation (the CBR) shows the fluctuations are
large enough to be studied from the ground and balloons. It seems likely that
the character of the anisotropy on angular scales from 30 arc min to the COBE
resolution at about 10> will be a strong discriminant for theories of the nature
and origin of structure. Work will continue on the development of techniques to
map the CBR and the analysis of theories of the origin of the angular
fluctuations. The long wavelength part of the CBR spectrum is important as a
constraint on the evolution of the intergalactic medium, but the spectrum is not
well measured. Research will continue on a systematic approach to deal with the
main experimental problem, the separation of the CBR from the emission from our
galaxy. A believable theory of galaxy formation must account for the properties
of the CBR, the observations of galaxies and the intergalactic medium at
redshifts greater than unity, and the systematics of the distribution and
motions of galaxies at relatively low redshifts. Research will continue on the
development of the theoretical and numerical techniques needed to interpret
these phenomena and use them as tests for the models for the development of
structure in an expanding universe.
