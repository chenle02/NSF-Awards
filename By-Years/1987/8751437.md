National Workshop on the Role of Faculty in Meeting the National Need for
Minority Scholars. The primary goal of this workshop is to delineate the role of
graduate university faculty in increasing the number of minority scholars. The
impetus is the statis in minority enrollment in graduate school. Faculty members
play a pivotal role in producing scholars through recruitment, financial aid,
mentoring and guidance, all essential to academic success. The vehicle is a
national invitational workshop where specific courses of action will be
identified by 75-100 participants representing academia, industry and
government. Proceeding will be widely publicized and outcomes will be assessed.
A national advisory committee will aid in the implementation of workshop
recommendations. The focus on faculty roles is timely and the planned follow-up
activities are unique and should aid in the distribution and implementation of
findings.
