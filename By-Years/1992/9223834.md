The retina of the eye contains may classes of nerve cells besides just the
photoreceptors. These cells participate in networks that utilize a variety of
neurotransmitter compounds for communication and modulation of the cellular
responses. An important transmitter is dopamine, and goldfish provide a retina
where one class of cells produces dopamine. Other important neuroactive
compounds are the peptides, which often in other networks are modulators of
neural activity. This project uses biochemistry, pharmacology, and microscopic
anatomy on the goldfish retina as a model to examine the circuits formed by the
cells utilizing these compounds. The goldfish retina has provided extensive data
on the presence of these compounds, but their functions are largely unknown;
this study will clarify their functional role in transmission and modulation of
signals in the visual pathway. Because of the widespread occurrence of these
compounds elsewhere in the brain, this work on the goldfish retina not only
provides a useful model system for increasing our understanding of visual
processing, but also will have impact on neuroscience in general.
