The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers requests travel support for
participants in the Broader Engagement (BE) Program at the Supercomputing (SC)
2008 Conference. That program aims to increase opportunities for U.S.
undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industry professionals, and researchers to
learn about high performance computing (HPC). It emphasizes the participation of
members of the groups that are underrepresented within the HPC community:
African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native
Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, persons with disabilities, and women. Participants
will have the opportunity to connect with mentors, and attend a doctoral
symposium, a student job fair, and other special sessions. This award will make
it possible for additional participants to attend.
