This project will investigate the design sensitivity analysis for nonlinear
structures for certain design variables. The variables to be considered are:
structural dynamics, nonlinear buckling loads, general nonlinearity, and
nonconservative aspects. Material variables are: elastic-plastic, viscoelastic,
viscoplastic and related topics. The resulting algorithms will enable engineers
to design better, more economical and safer structural systems.
