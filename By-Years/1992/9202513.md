This research involves experimental investigations of strain localization on
single - and poly-crystalline ductile-matrix material systems, analyses of
mechanisms of micro-localization, e.g. shear banding, at intermediate and large
plastic strains in these material systems, and the development of constitutive
relations for the effective plastic response of ductile materials including the
effects of complex multi-slip hardening, particles and pores, and microscopic
shear localizations. The goal is to develop techniques to achieve optimal
processing conditions so as to avoid undesirable flow localizations.
