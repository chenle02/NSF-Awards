9457907 Bershadsky This activity in theoretical physics will continue the
investigation of the anomaly master equation. This study is closely related to
the properties of the Kodaira-Spencer theory of Gravity. In addition, a study of
topological massive field theories coupled to gravity will be initiated. ***
