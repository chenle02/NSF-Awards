The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is faster turnaround time for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
testing results. Routine testing of nasopharyngeal swabs are being performed
globally to try to control the spread of the virus. Ideally, the results of this
testing will be done and reported within 24 hours, preferably less.
Unfortunately, testing results have commonly been taking 2-3 days or even longer
due to case backlogs. Successful development of the technology from this
research should ensure much faster reporting of results by reducing the primary
bottleneck of sample preparation of COVID-19 testing. In addition, this research
should greatly improve the ability to analyze saliva samples by rapidly
enriching the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the virus, and this should therefore
lead to greatly reducing false negative results (especially for pooled
samples).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project utilizes a patent pending
membrane device for rapidly automating sample extraction. The use of these
devices allows for samples to be introduced under vacuum, and RNA to be enriched
in less than 10 min. The extracts can be rapidly dispensed into multiple 96 or
possibly 384 well plates for high throughput analysis. The enriched RNA from
nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva will be ready for sensitive analysis using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
