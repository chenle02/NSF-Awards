The purpose of the project is to develop a computer-managed laboratory for
physiological and experimental psychology. One such system, developed in the
psychology department, permits the precise programming of experimental events,
the collection of data, and the analysis and display of results. It has been
used to measure reaction times, GSR, EMG, heart rate, temperature and EEG.
Because of increasing demands for time with this system, the psychology
department plans to construct three more, one with enhanced capabilities for
state-of-the-art student research. This enhanced model will be interfaced with a
three-field projection tachistoscope and four biopotential preamplifiers for
elaborate control of visual events and rapid tracking of evoked EEG activity
across the cortex (among other uses). The tachistoscope and amplifiers can be
divided to provide for simpler but simultaneous data collection using all the
computers. This would be ideal for lab exercises in physiological and
experimental psychology. The versatility and precision of this lab system should
provide varied possibilities for directed student research, laboratory work in
the methodology course, and classroom demonstrations in introductory psychology.
