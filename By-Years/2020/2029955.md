Traditional museum specimens (e.g., skins, skeletons, dry- and fluid-preserved
specimens), once considered poor sources of DNA, are now becoming recognized as
a potential vast biological resource for historical DNA (hDNA), that provide an
unparalleled record of biodiversity spanning the last 200 years. In particular,
the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms (using short DNA fragments)
now provides a more efficient means of sampling the hDNA genome. However, hDNAâ€™s
potential has hardly yet been explored, with current procedures for DNA
extraction often relying on approaches tested on few individuals and optimized
for specific projects. Consequently, outcomes of most extraction efforts still
often lead to unusable sequence data, or otherwise, high sequencing errors,
missing data, and/or contamination. This project will develop efficient and
open-source protocols for yielding usable genome-scale molecular data from
typical traditional museum specimens, based on rigorous comparative experiments
of existing and novel DNA extraction methods, using time-series collections at
the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Broader societal impacts include
conservation (using museum specimens to document historical trends in
populations and emerging diseases), forensics (providing improved methods for
accurate species identification of biological material), and genomics
(documenting genetic change over the past 200
years).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project outcomes will determine optimal tissue
sources and extraction methods for hDNA, develop improved methods for reverse
crosslinking of formalin-fixed DNA, and provide a deeper understanding of how
DNA degrades due to exposure to formalin, alcohol, tissue buffers, and archival
storage time. This project will also develop new approaches for bioinformatic
processing of hDNA, to better detect contamination, evaluate the effects of hDNA
on phylogenetic inference, and improve the utility of hDNA in all aspects of
comparative biology. The application of reliable bioinformatic processing
pipelines produced from this study will scale-up the availability of genetic
research resources by at least 100-fold (e.g., at AMNH, 120,000 current DNA
tissue samples compared to &gt;20 million biological museum vouchers). The
availability of DNA from historical museum specimens will also allow the
genetics and epigenetics of extinct species and populations to be studied and
provide exciting new opportunities to determine how genetic diversity has
changed during the Anthropocene. Results of the project will be provided at

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
