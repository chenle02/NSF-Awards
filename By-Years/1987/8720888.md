Burial Diagenesis of the Sespe Sandstone, Ventura Basin, California. PI seeks to
study the burial diagenesis of the Sespe Sandstone, Ventura Basin Calif. PI will
use an array of optical, and chemical whole-rock techniques to establish the
relationship between the depth of burial and the diagenetic process in the
Oligocene. This study will demonstrate how depth of burial for the sand has
influenced thermal maturity, mechanical compaction, pressure solution, clay
diagenesis, quartz cementation, feldspar diagenensis, and the precipitation and
distribution of laumontite and calcium carbonate cements. Also to be observed
are the rock- water interactions during the progressive burial of the sands.
