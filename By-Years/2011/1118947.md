Our understanding of the processes through which species adapt to one another is
largely predicated upon the assumption that interactions between species depend
on only single traits. However, real interactions, including those with
implications for human health and agriculture, inevitably involve multiple
traits. The primary reason multiple traits have not been integrated into
existing theory is the sheer difficulty of developing and analyzing appropriate
mathematical models. The proposed work will overcome existing hurdles by
developing powerful new mathematical tools that allow a general theory of
multivariate coevolution to be formulated. These tools will be made widely
available to the scientific community through presentations at annual meetings
and publication of electronic Mathematica appendices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition to significantly advancing our understanding of how species adapt to
one another, the proposed work will promote undergraduate and graduate training
at the interface of biology and mathematics. A team of students recruited into
the University of Idaho's Undergraduates in Biological and Mathematical Sciences
program will be trained in basic computational and mathematical approaches
through work on this project. Graduate training will be accomplished by
immersing a student into the proposed research, resulting in intensive training
in advanced mathematical and computational approaches to biological problems.
