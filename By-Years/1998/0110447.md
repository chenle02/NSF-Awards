This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop
advanced magnetorheological fluids for various damping applications. The Phase I
project focused on a microwave plasma synthesis technique (NANOGENTM) and
chemical precipitation technique; both techniques were successfully used to
synthesize nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and iron oxide. NANOGENTM was selected
as one of the 100 most innovative technologies in 1998 when it won the
prestigious R&amp;D 100 Award. MR fluids were prepared from these fluids and
preliminary results on their damping behavior was found to be comparable with
commercially available fluids. The Phase II project will scale-up the production
of nanopowders and will conduct testing of their damping characteristics to help
foster the development and application of MR fluids in key technology driven
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The possible commercial applications will be in
automobile suspensions, hybrid actuator valves, semi-active vibration control in
turbines and bridges as well as for seismic damping. &lt;br/&gt;
