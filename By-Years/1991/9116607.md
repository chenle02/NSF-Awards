This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Richard Schlichting, Department of Computer Science,
University of Arizona, and Professor Takuya Katayama, Department of Computer
Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology. The goal of the project is to simplify
the construction of fault-tolerant software, that is, software that can continue
to provide service despite failures in the underlying computing platform. The
specific intent is to adapt the AG programming languages developed at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology for this purpose by extending it to support two
techniques frequently used in fault-tolerant programming, recovery and
replication. AG is based on attribute grammars, and as such, offers advantages
such as a declarative style, separation of semantic and syntactic definitions,
and a functional foundation.
