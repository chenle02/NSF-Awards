9406586 Prave Building on a pilot project, PI and co-workers, including Paul
Hoffman and members of the Namibian Geological Survey, will examine key strata
from the late Proterozoic, a critical time in Earth and life history. Study will
include sequence stratigraphy, structural geology, U-Pb geochronology,
chemostratigraphy, and regional tectonics. Team will critically evaluate,
chronometrically calibrate, and selectively refine the timing of Neoproterozoic
isotopic excursions and glaciations, as well as the timing and kinematics of
continental breakup and assembly of southern Gondwanaland.
