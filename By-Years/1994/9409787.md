9409787 Rubinstein This is an United States-Russia Joint Cooperative Research
grant funded jointly by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of
International Programs. Professor Michael Rubinstein of the University of
Rochester and Eastman Kodak Company will collaborate with Professor Alexander
Semenov of Moscow State University. Theoretical research will be conducted on
the staic and dynamic properties of heteropolymers with strongly interacting
groups including block copolymers in selective solvents, ionomers and
associating polymers. These systems have a number of unique structural,
mechanical and rheological properties. Each research group has complementary
skills to study these materials. %%% ***
