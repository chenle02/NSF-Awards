PI: Sharma, Anupam&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1554196 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this CAREER is to investigate the unsteady flow around the flapping
wings of an owl and to uncover the relationship between fluid dynamics phenomena
and the unique configuration of the owl wings that is responsible for the silent
flight of owls. The results of this research could have an impact on the design
of silent air vehicles with application in national defense, in commerce and in
transportation (an area of national need). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed
to use high fidelity computations to understand the effects of the wing
microstructure and of the way the wing flaps on sound generation. The specific
research objectives are to: (1) develop numerical methods to identify the true
sources of aerodynamically generated sound, (2) investigate the unique feather
adaptations (the "hush kit") of the owl that enable its silent flight, and (3)
adapt the owl hush kit to develop ultra-quiet Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and jet
engines. In addition to graduate and undergraduate student training, there are
plans to develop a new outreach program with the local museum (the Science
Center at Iowa) and to connect the students with the industry.
