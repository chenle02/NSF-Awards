The project aims to serve the national need to recruit and train high school
mathematics teachers in rural areas. In partnership with Southwestern Community
College (SCC) and the Macon County, Swain County, and Jackson County public
school districts, Western Carolina University (WCU) will work toward the
collaborative development of a cohort-based, prospective teacher pipeline. The
project intends to establish a recruitment and support plan and determine
barriers for prospective teachers. Additionally, the project will identify early
field experiences through SCC and mentoring and networking opportunities through
the Smoky Mountain Math Teachersâ€™ Circle (SMMTC). By focusing on the three needs
of infrastructure, collaboration, and retention, the project intends to build
capacity to help address the deficit of secondary mathematics
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the following goals: (1)
establish a plan for the recruitment and support of a diverse pool of talented
undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees with an interest in becoming high-
school mathematics teachers in Western North Carolina (WNC); (2) identify the
barriers to student success in Secondary Mathematics Education in WNC; (3)
establish various options for early field experiences through existing programs
at SCC, and (4) establish mentoring and networking opportunities through
involvement of students with the SMMTC. Data collection will include surveys of
in-service teachers, alumni, school counselors, and current STEM majors
regarding interest in and barriers to teaching secondary mathematics in WNC. A
Local Educational Agency focus group, a Community College Advisory Board, an
Educational Enrichment Programs Advisory Board, and the SMMTC leadership will
help the project meet its goals. As a result of this project, future STEM majors
could benefit from intentionally streamlined transfer options, designed
instructional bridges, and new regional partnerships. This Capacity Building
project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program
(Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and
professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary
K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It
also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12
STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
