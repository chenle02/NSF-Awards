The 1998 IEEE Information Theory Workshop is sponsored by the Information Theory
Society of the IEEE will be held in San Diego, CA on February 8-11, 1998. The
primary objective of the Workshop is to present new perspectives and results in
a broad range of research areas in information and its applications. There will
be six technical sessions, held serially covering the following topics: 1)
Information Theory: 50 Years and Beyond, 2) Universal and Lossless Source
Coding, 3) Channel Coding Applications, 4) CDMA, 5) Channel Coding Theory, and
6) Lossy Source Coding. Each session will include six invited speakers, each
internationally recognized for contributions in the respective research areas.
In addition, there will be a plenary lecture each morning, as well as a special
evening lecture. There is also a session for contributed recent research
results. The purpose of the award is to provide financial support from NSF for
travel grants to U.S&gt; scientists and engineers who could not otherwise attend
the Workshop for lack of funding.
