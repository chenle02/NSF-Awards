program lasting 4-weeks in the summer, in Advanced Technology Education for
twenty four high school students. The program will emphasize advanced
technology, design, applications. In addition to several other applications,
Computer Aided Design (CAD) projects will integrate various components of
technology and its uses. Evening seminars will be concerned with: ethics and
other topics concerning technology and the citizen. There will be field trips to
major industrial locations where advanced technology is used, as well as
recreation and reading during the weekends and evenings. Students who exhibit a
high potential for careers as technicians will be recruited nationally for the
program. ***
