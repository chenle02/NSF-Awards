9453949 Lipka This planning project, sponsored by the University of Alaska at
Fairbanks, will prepare its target community, the Yup'ik, to submit a proposal
to the Teacher Enhancement Program which will train Yup'ik teachers and Yup'ik
elders to use the most up-to-date curriculums in science and mathematics. The
activities supported by the grant are to: - identify personnel to strengthen the
science component of the project; - coordinate activities with other NSF
projects in Alaska; - identify, adapt and prepare teacher materials for a more
comprehensive elementary science program; - continue to maintain close
communication with the Yup'ik community; and, - develop a Teacher Enhancement
proposal intended to implement the Planning grants long-term objectives. The
matching funds, in support of the project, amount to 24% of the NSF grant.
