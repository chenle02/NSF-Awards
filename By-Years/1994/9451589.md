9451589 Benner The purpose of this grant is to equip our introductory biology
and advanced laboratories (Genetics, Microbiology, Immunology) with
instrumentation to enable students to carry out advanced projects in molecular
biology. This hands-on approach is part of a redesigned freshman biology
sequence intended to act as a pump for students into science. The more
traditional laboratory approaches to biology need to be complemented with modern
experimentation. This will not only attract more students into science, but will
also reduce the attrition rate of students who enter Rider College with an
interest in science. Additionally, we hope to significant impact the education
of our future science teachers by providing hands-on experience in molecular
biology techniques.
