This grant provides support for the acquisition of a nanoindenter for materials
research and education at Carnegie-Mellon University. Installation of this
instrument will benefit research and education programs in the Materials Science
and Engineering department and across a broad range of activities in the
engineering and science colleges. It will be the first such instrument at CMU.
This new instrument offers the required capability of testing mechanical
properties at the sub-micron scale. It will be a multi-user instrument that will
be used for at least five major research projects, including one industrial
partner.&lt;br/&gt;The major use of the instrument will be for research on
dislocation structures from plastic deformation, cermet composites, thin films
for microelectronic applications, probing of biological systems via mechanical
properties, and oxide thin films for coatings. Anticipated results include a
more fundamental understanding of the interaction between dislocations and grain
boundaries; new insights into strain gradient plasticity; a more detailed
understanding of mechanical property microstructure property relationships in
cermets; an improved understanding of microstructural evolution in thin copper
films for microelectronic applications; and information about the reaction of
proteins to their environment. It is anticipated that researchers from other
areas such as microelectromechanical systems and tissue engineering will request
occasional use of the instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of use of the
instrument is broad and its acquisition will thus have broad impact on
scientific activity in the materials area for Carnegie-Mellon University and its
collaborators. Undergraduates will be trained in the use of a state-of-the-art
instrument for probing mechanical properties through formal laboratory
exercises. Current and future graduate students will have access to a much-
needed tool to make advances in their research
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
