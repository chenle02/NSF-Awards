Study of a wide array of the evidential and inferential issues encountered in
our system of law occupies researchers from many different disciplines. Much
attention has focused on the behavior of jurors, attorneys, and judges. Of equal
importance, though not so frequently studied, are the various inferential and
decisional tasks required of others such as investigators and advocates. The
manner in which investigators and advocates play their roles has a direct
bearing upon subsequent inferences and choices made by other actors in the legal
system. This research concerns the inferential and decisional roles played by
investigators and advocates during fact investigation and other activities
before a matter comes to trial or is settled by other means. The objectives of
the project are to study ways of marshalling or organizing evidence that will
enhance reasoning, structuring complex arguments, and assisting in
decisionmaking at various points during the preparation of criminal or civil
cases. The study involves computer-assisted simulations of complex cases that
will result in the structuring of "inferential networks" of evidence marshalling
methods. This research is not only of theoretical and practical significance in
a legal context, but also bears on inferential and decisional behavior in many
other important contexts such as medicine, science, business, and intelligence
analysis. The results promise to introduce new levels of rigor, clarity, and
fairness into the technology of proof and persuasion. The linked networks of
prototype computer-based evidence marshalling systems will be useful in
illustrating theoretical issues in the practice and teaching of fact
investigation and may provide the sound inferential basis now lacking in many
current efforts to develop computer-based litigation and other inference-related
systems.
