This grant is for partial support of the 1992 International Ultrafast Phenomena
Conference, Antibes, France, June 8-12, 1992, the eighth in a series of meetings
on recent advances in research on ultrafast phenomena. These meetings are the
major international forum for discussions of new ideas and methods in this
multidisciplinary and rapidly moving field, which involves the technology of
generating ultrashort light pulses and their application to studying ultrafast
processes in physics, chemistry, biology, material sciences and electronics. To
remain at the forefront of this field, the U.S. conference organizers consider
it important that graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty
have the opportunity to attend this international meeting. NSF funds will
provide partial support of their travel.
