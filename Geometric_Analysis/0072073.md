Holomorphic bundles arise naturally in many different areas of geometry - indeed
they lie at the intersection of algebraic, symplectic, and complex differential
geometry. At the center of this intersection are sets of partial differential
equations, such as the so-called Hermitian-Einstein and Vortex equations, which
place constraints on the geometric features of the bundles. Their solutions
carry information not only about the geometry of the bundles on which they are
defined, but also about their topological and algebraic structure. In recent
year it has been discovered how by adding certain extra structure to a
holomorphic bundle, interesting new phenomena are revealed and important
applications can result. The primary goals of this proposal include a fuller
understanding of these `augmented bundles', the equations defined on them, their
moduli spaces, and their applications.

Holomorphic bundles fall within the class of geometric objects known as fiber
bundles. In addition to their prominent place in modern geometry, fiber bundles
play an important role within modern theoretical physics, where the influence of
geometry can hardly be overstated. General relativity, electromagnetism and its
extensions (known as gauge field theories), and string theory could not be
formulated without sophisticated geometric tools such as vector and principal
bundles.
