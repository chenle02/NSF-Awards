Numerous physical phenomena in nature involve the motion of interfaces
separating two or more regions. The level-set method was a PDE-based approach
designed to capture the interface motion through the evolution of a signed
distance function. This exploratory project aims to further extend the level-set
method to unstructured adaptive Cartesian grids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan
to address the following research task: Development of a level-set solver
supporting the adaptive Cartesian grids, and various data structures including
both tree and list-based data structures. This solver will be coupled to an
adaptive Cartesian grid adaptor for interface based grid adaptations to improve
the interface resolution and decrease the numerical errors near the
interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A set of software tools will be developed and
made available that can be used to both train students with basic interface
dynamics, and to conduct research in challenging engineering and scientific
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
