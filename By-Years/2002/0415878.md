In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Prof. Sean Decatur of Mt. Holyoke College
will conduct research on the infrared spectroscopy of isotopically-labeled
peptides. Additional collaborations with outside laboratories will investigate
the two-dimensional infrared and ultraviolet raman spectroscopy of some of these
same peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies by Prof. Decatur, his
postdoctoral fellow, and his undergraduate research students should help lead us
to a better understanding of some of the details of protein folding and protein
aggregation. The problems of protein aggregation to be probed by Prof. Decatur's
research will provide some of the basic information that will be useful in
sorting out the mechanics of prion protein aggregation, implicated in a variety
of diseases. In addition, the research experience that the proposed studies will
provide to the young women at Mount Holyoke College will help them in pursuing
future careers in the sciences, where women have been historically
underrepresented.&lt;br/&gt;
