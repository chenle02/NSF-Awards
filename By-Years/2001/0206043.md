Many of the kinds of inquiry activities that have become increasingly prevalent
as&lt;br/&gt;educational tools assume that certain basic understandings are in
place, for example the&lt;br/&gt;understanding that multiple variables may act
simultaneously to codetermine an outcome.&lt;br/&gt;Recent research, however,
suggests instead that this and related forms of meta-
level&lt;br/&gt;understanding are hard-won cognitive achievements that require
support if they are to&lt;br/&gt;develop during the elementary and middle-school
years and provide a needed foundation for&lt;br/&gt;more advanced inquiry
learning. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand&lt;br/&gt;the
basic cognitive skills that underlie inquiry learning and to examine how they
develop.&lt;br/&gt;As part of their science curriculum, middle-school students
will engage in a 10-week&lt;br/&gt;software-based inquiry curriculum under
several different conditions offering different&lt;br/&gt;kinds of cognitive
support. Employing a microgenetic method, researchers will
closely&lt;br/&gt;observe development, maintenance and transfer of cognitive
skills. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;stands to inform both the design and use of
educational technology to support inquiry&lt;br/&gt;learning, and in addition
should help to provide a clearer conceptual base for
teachers&lt;br/&gt;regarding the cognitive goals of inquiry curricula. The
project is situated at the&lt;br/&gt;intersection of quadrant II and quadrant
III in terms of the objectives identified in the&lt;br/&gt;ROLE RFP.
