Lichens are important not only as the best-known example of biological
symbiosis but also as sources of a huge array of unusual chemical products.
These compounds characterize chemical races or "chemotypes" into which many
morphological species have become differentiated over evolutionary time. The
interpretation of these chemotypes, whether as polymorphisms within chemically
variable panmictic species (and potentially of microevolutionary importance) or
as reproductively isolated sibling species (and consequently of taxonomic
significance), is the root of a long- standing controversy. The Culbersons at
Duke University will investigate possible measures of gene flow among lichens,
looking at the six different chemotypes of the morphologically identical
Ramalina siliquosa complex. These lichens grow in bands on the rocky coasts of
western Europe, and in this respect behave ecologically like distinct species.
Tests will be made on laboratory cultures of lichen thalli grown from single-
spore isolates taken from nature; parent and progeny samples will be made at the
interfaces of the bands or zones of lichen chemotypes. Mixtures of chemotypes
among the progeny of individual lichens will indicate the presence of sexual
reproduction and gene flow in these lichens. The results will introduce new
experimental techniques for study of the biological species concept into lichen
systematics and open the door for genetic studies of these dual organisms.
