ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;31 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1242072&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI: D.
White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to continue to provide
information technology (IT) infrastructure support to the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Office. The Ocean Information Center
(OCEANIC) at the University of Delaware?s College of Marine and Earth Studies
serves as a centralized location for the UNOLS information technology
infrastructure, web server, mail servers, file repository and backend relational
databases. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual
Merit: The Academic Fleet is well into its fourth decade of service to our
nation's ongoing effort to study the vast majority of our planet that is covered
by ocean. In a time of intense budgetary constraints and competing pressures on
scarce federal resources, this Fleet must stress cost-effectiveness, efficiency
and wise utilization of the taxpayer's dollars. The federal agency?s educational
and scientific missions must be accessible to educators, policy makers and the
public, and the maintenance of the UNOLS IT infrastructure directly contributes
to this mission with regard to effective vessel scheduling and public outreach.
