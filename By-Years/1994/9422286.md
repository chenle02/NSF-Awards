Computing Program (HPCC), along with several other Agencies. HPCC's goal is to
accelerate the rapid development of future generations of high performance
computers and networks and to bring the results of the program into widespread

Coordinating Office (hosted by the National Library of Medicine) coordinates the
programs of the participating agencies, and serves as a liaison to a variety of
parties ranging from the Congress, through academia and industry, to the general
public and the Executive Branch. This award provides the National Library of
Medicine with support for the Foundation's share of National Coordinating Office
responsibilities connected with the HPCC program.
