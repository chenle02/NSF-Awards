This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
development of commercial software, based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD)
techniques, to predict performance of liquid-feed direct methanol fuel cells
(DMFC). While computational modeling of fuel cells has been widespread in the
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and hydrogen-air proton exchange membrane fuel cell
(PEMFC) areas, it has been limited in the area of direct methanol fuel cell.
This can be attributed, in part, to the fact that in DMFC, since the liquid fuel
produces gaseous products, the modeling necessitates careful consideration of
two-phase phenomena, which is numerically challenging. A comprehensive
simulation tool for the prediction of performance of gas-feed PEMFC and SOFC
have been developed and marketed. In order to capture the rapidly growing DMFC
market, this project proposes to extend the simulation tool to address issues
specific to liquid-feed DMFC modeling. The model will be validated against
experimental data available from the literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid-
feed Direct Methanol Fuel Cells have become the center of attention, especially
for portable power applications where optimal space utilization is critical. The
proposed research will produce a commercial-quality predictive tool, which could
be utilized extensively for design and optimization of DMFCs, in addition to
providing better understanding of the transport and electrochemistry that occur
in such systems. &lt;br/&gt;
