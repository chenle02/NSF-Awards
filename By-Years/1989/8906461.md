The Engineering Research Equipment Grant is to extend an existing two- channel
Laser Doppler Anemometer System to three channels. The system will be used to
measure the three instantaneous components of velocity in turbulent flow through
turbomachinery passages. This enhanced research capability will permit more
detailed resolution of the interaction between stator and rotor blades, leakage
flow, and boundary layers, and will also serve to produce better data for
computer model verification.
