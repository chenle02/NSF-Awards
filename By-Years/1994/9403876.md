9403876 Klein Pion absorption experiments will be completed at the PSI lab in
Switzerland, focusing on multiparticle reaction mechanisms (through activities
of the LADS collaboration)and medium modifications of effective interactions
(through polarized target studies). Research will be carried out in support of
mounting spin structure function measurement programs at SLAC and CEBAF. At
CEBAF this will include design and construction of drift- chambers for the CEBAF
CLAS detector. ***
