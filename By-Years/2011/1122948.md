Dr. Holly R. Cashman (University of New Hampshire) will undertake research on
language dominance, maintenance, and shift. Traditional research on language
choice relies primarily on a nuclear-family based model of language and ethnic
identity transmission. In contrast, Cashman's research will focus on language
and identity among people who have strong community identities that do not
conform to the nuclear family model. The research will be carried out in
Phoenix, Arizona, among speakers of Spanish and English. Research methods
include discourse and conversation analysis of materials acquired through formal
interviews and participant observation. The researcher will engage graduate and
undergraduate students, as well as community members in the research, and will
disseminate findings beyond the traditional academic settings and publication
venues.
