CBET - 1510028 PI: Prausnitz, Mark

This project will explore a novel way to make cell membranes temporarily
permeable so that drug molecules are able to enter the cell and carry out their
therapeutic functions. The method relies on irradiating nanoparticles
interspersed between the cells with pulsed laser energy. Preliminary data show
that irradiating the nanoparticles leads to a significant increase in the
cellular uptake of a fluorescent molecule without loss of cell viability. The
research could lead to a new way to enhance the delivery of biomolecules to
targeted cells for therapeutic, diagnostic and laboratory applications.

This project will test the hypothesis that the laser energy raises the
nanoparticle temperature and vaporizes surrounding liquid, producing local
stress fields that can temporarily and non-destructively permeabilize cell
membranes, thereby allowing intracellular uptake of exogenous molecules by
living cells. A series of experiments will quantify the spatio-temporal
characteristics of the forms of energy released by laser-activated nanoparticles
to test the hypothesis that the dominant characteristic of energy transduction
by a nanoparticle is the rapid generation of an enveloping vapor bubble that
condenses slowly after formation. The research also will determine which
features of the particle transduction outputs correlate to high intracellular
uptake and cell viability to test the hypothesis that cellular bioeffects are
controlled by acoustic and thermal effects occurring on the scale of a cell
diameter.
