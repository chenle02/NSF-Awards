The objectives of this work are to experimentally test how the anatomical and
physiological control of skeletal muscles and breathing contributes to lymph
movement in anuran amphibians (frogs and toads). Lymph is the fluid that filters
from the small blood vessels (capillaries) of the circulatory system into the
tissue as a consequence of the pressure generated by the heart. The principal
role of the lymphatic system is to return this fluid that escapes from the
capillaries back into the circulation. Anuran amphibians lose circulatory fluid,
and hence form lymph, at about ten times the rate of mammals. Thus their ability
to return lymph to the circulatory system is critical and amphibians can replace
lost blood volume with lymph more rapidly than any other vertebrate. The working
hypothesis for this research project is that lymph moves in response to pressure
differences in lymph sacs created by two mechanisms: lung ventilation and
skeletal muscle contractions. Through a collaboration of researchers at three
institutions (Portland State University, California State University East Bay,
California Academy of Sciences) lymph flux associated with lung pressure changes
and skeletal muscle contraction in various anatomical pathways will be measured.
In addition, the effect of blood volume status on these pressures and activities
will be assessed. Comparative anatomical data will be collected to determine
whether anatomical differences correlate with differences in lymph flow and the
ability to withstand dehydration. This research will lead to a greater
understanding of the mechanisms of lymph movement and provide insight into the
adaptations that led to the successful colonization of land by the first
vertebrate group that left the aquatic environment. Undergraduate and graduate
students researchers will be trained and benefit from the collaboration between
the researchers' laboratories. The results of this project will be disseminated
via educational outreach efforts affiliated with the California Academy of
Sciences.
