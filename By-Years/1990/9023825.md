This action continues the Interagency Agreement between the National Science
Foundation and the Arctic Research Commission and provides for its continuing
operations. The Arctic Research Commission was established under the Arctic
Research Policy Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-373) and Executive Order 12501. The
General Services Administration will provide administrative services to the
Commission as specified in Public Law 98-373 (Section 106(4)). This action
fulfills the intent of Congress to provide FY 1991 funding for the Commission
through the NSF.
