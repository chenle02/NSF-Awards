Echinoderms include familiar animals such as starfishes, sea urchins, and a wide
array of extinct forms stretching back to the Cambrian Period, circa 500 million
years ago. Echinoderms share a common ancestor with backboned animals and thus
provide a crucial link to understanding a huge portion of the entire tree of
life as well as the history of our species. This project, the Echinoderm Tree of
Life Project, will resolve the phylogenetic placement of Echinoderms within the
tree of life and clarify important unresolved relationships among major
echinoderm lineages using data from genetic sequencing and
anatomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Echinoderms are fascinating, and their unique
features, such as mutable ligaments and novel means of detecting light, have
biomedical engineering applications. Because research on such marine animals and
their adaptations is naturally attractive to young people, excellent students
are expected to be recruited and the importance of science will be communicated
to a broad audience. Long-term impacts, embodied by scientific publications,
textbooks, anatomical and genomic data, and extensive pages in the Tree of Life
and Encyclopedia of Life web projects, will provide resources to researchers and
educators. Outreach will include videos and broadcasts about marine exploration
and applications of fundamental biological research across the biomedical
sciences.
