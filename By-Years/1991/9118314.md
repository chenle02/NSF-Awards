This award supports an investigation of the megafloras and palynofloras of the
Allan Hills area in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The objectives for this
project are to collect these floras using modern methods (i.e., placing the
floras within their paleoecologic and stratigraphic settings) and to
characterize the plants contained therein in detail. These data will provide
taxonomic, paleoecologic, paleoclimatic and biogeographic information that can
be compared with other better-known floras (e.g., from the central
Transantarctic Mountains) in Antarctica and in Gondwana.
