9413305 Weir The fifth Gordon Conference on Quantitative Genetics and
Biotechnology will be held February 12-17, 1995. at least 26 invited
participants will present recent and current results on the relationship between
molecular genetics and quantitative traits. Advances in animal, human and plant
genetics will be treated, along with theoretical developments in statistical and
evolutionary genetics. This continuing series of conferences has been one of the
main venues for molecular and quantitative geneticists to interact, and it has
played a role in the explosion of activity in setting up genetic maps for
livestock,and in subsequently locating genes affecting quantitative traits.
