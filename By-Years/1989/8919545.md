All societies can be viewed as a plurality of normative orders capable of
generating rules, customs, symbols, and compliance. Termed "legal pluralism,"
the study of the operation and interrelation of multiple normative orders has
provided a major impetus for the reconceptualization of the law and society
relation. Instead of being viewed as a "top-down" phenomena, law effectively is
the result of the interaction of historical, cultural, social, political, and
economic forces. Recent work in sociolegal studies has focused on this
relationship and the ways in which it has affected legal change. Using an
analysis of the interaction of legal orders in New Zealand as a vehicle for the
study of legal pluralism, this dissertation research will examine historical and
contemporary patterns of impositions, accommodations, and resistances that have
marked struggles over rights and resources in colonial and post-colonial
settings. Specifically, the student will study a Maori land claim against the
New Zealand government for violations of an 1840 Treaty. Through archival
research, statistical and demographic information, analysis of land tenure
patterns, and community level oral histories, it will be possible to ascertain
how law has structured the representation of interests, reflecting or
facilitating political and economic change. Ethnic claims, plural legal systems,
and politicization of "tradition" are familiar themes in the contemporary world.
Legal strategies for addressing them are of considerable importance. This
project has potential for contributing to a broader theoretical understanding of
the factors that impinge on such situations. In a period in which land claims
are being made in many parts of the world by the descendants of the original
inhabitants of areas subsequently appropriated by other populations, this work
has practical applications as well.
