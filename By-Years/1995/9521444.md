9521444 Nordlander The objective of this research program is to increase the
understanding of charge transfer phenomena between atoms and simple molecules,
and metal surfaces. The Principal Investigator will develop and apply a
dynamical many-body method, based on Green's functions, in which he calculates
the charge transfer probabilities by solving a set of coupled integro-
differential equations. The project includes an investigation of the influence
of substrate temperature, particle velocity, atomic and molecular level
degeneracy, substrate band width, and substrate density of states on charge
transfer. The results of this project provide the theoretical background for an
accurate description of charge-transfer processes in atom/molecule- surface
collisions. This formalism helps to interpret specific experimental results and
to relate microscopic properties of the surface to actual experimental data. %%%
This project develops of theory of the scattering and colliding of atoms or
molecules with metal surfaces. The main focus is on the transfer of charge
between the surface and the colliding particle. Part of the project involves the
development of the complex quantum theory that one needs to properly describe
these collisions. The project includes an investigation of the influence of a
variety of properties of both the substrate and the colliding particle on charge
transfer. This formalism helps to interpret specific experimental results and to
relate microscopic properties of the surface to actual experimental data. Such
scattering events are a primary way to measure various physical properties of
surfaces, the knowledge of which is necessary to develop new and better
materials. ***
