This research will consider analytical and computational problems motivated by
the time-dependent partial differential equations often used to model fluid
flows. These equations frequently contain singularities in their solutions. New
ways of classifying the smoothness of discontinuous solutions of scalar
hyperbolic conservation laws will be studied. Also to be considered are adaptive
and moving grid numerical methods for systems of conservation laws. This
research should lead to more efficient numerical techniques which take into
account the location and the geometry of singularities in solutions.
