This award provides support for the seventh in a series of conferences on
mathematical foundations of programming semantics. This research area
encompasses research on all aspects of the design and implementation of
programming languages, including the semantics of such languages. Topics of
interest include type theory, domain theory, and applications of category theory
to semantics. Previous conferences have been distinguished by the breadth of
interests of the participants and by the high-level of interaction which has
taken place between researchers representing the diverse areas mentioned. The
conference includes three types of formal activities: 1. invited talks by five
leading researchers 2. shorter presentations of refereed, contributed papers 3.
special sessions devoted to particular research directions The proceedings of
the conference will be published by Springer Verlag as a volume of Lecture Notes
in Computer Science, as was the case with the 1st, 3rd and 5th conferences.
