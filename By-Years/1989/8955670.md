The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will initiate a 6-week commuter Young
Scholars project for 20 students in grades 8-9 in mathematics and physics. Young
Scholars will be recruited from the Milwaukee area to participate in a program
designed to enhance their interest and skills in mathematics and physics. All
participants will be members of ethnic minority groups underrepresented in
science careers. Each program unit will integrate physics concepts with
mathematical skills. Students will prepare presentations to share with their
classmates during the academic year. Follow-up will include six Saturday
sessions, with science teachers invited, to cover more topics and prepare more
presentations.
