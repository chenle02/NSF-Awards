Semiparametric regression model provides data scientists a useful way to analyze
complex-structured data sets. It allows researchers to model some features in a
linear way, without restricting the effect of the rest covariates. This
flexibility can greatly enhance the prediction performance especially when
parametric model assumptions are invalid. In practice, the semiparametric
modelling is proven useful in many high dimensional applications in
Biostatistics, Econometrics and Neuroscience. However in literature, there is a
lack of statistical studies on the estimation and inference of high dimensional
semiparametric model. This project aims to lay a solid theoretical foundation
for high dimensional semiparametric analysis, in both frequentist and Bayesian
paradigms. This research will significantly promote the use of semiparametric
analysis of high dimensional complex data. This project consists of three
research components. First, the investigators will establish the frequentist
estimation theory and obtain new theoretical insights on the asymptotic behavior
of the estimators in high dimensional semiparametric model. Secondly, the
investigators will develop novel approach to conduct high dimensional
semiparametric inferences such as confidence intervals and explore related
semiparametric efficiency issue. Thirdly, Bayesian counterparts of estimation
and inference theories will be developed. The investigators will establish the
frequentist validity of Bayesian point estimations and interval estimations.
These research results will provide important theoretical guidelines for high
dimensional semiparametric modeling.
