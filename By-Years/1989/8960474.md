Oxygen limitation is a major obstacle in antibiotic fermentations that utilize
the aerobic bacteria Streptomyces. Current methods to increase oxygen transfer
to Streptomyces include improved bioreactor design and modified culture media. A
novel approach to the problem of oxygen transfer is the development of strains
that can obtain oxygen from the medium more efficiently. The current proposal is
directed towards the development of a genetically modified strain that expresses
a bacterial hemoglobin-like protein. This protein was originally discovered in
the aerobic bacteria Vitreoscilla, and apparently enables the cells to survive
in a oxygen-poor environment. When Vitreoscilla hemoglobin was expressed in the
bacteria Escherichia coli, the recombinant cells demonstrated higher growth and
respiration rates, and grew to higher cell densities. The gene encoding this
protein will be introduced into Streptomyces coelicolor, which produces the
antibiotic actinorhodin. The recombinant cells will then be tested for their
growth and respiratory properties, and actinorhodin production. The
demonstration of enhanced growth, respiration, and/or actinorhodin yields in
this system will have broad implications not only for antibiotic fermentations
but for any bioprocess system that involves aerobic cell culture.
