The interactions between cultured, anchorage-dependent mammalian cells and the
surfaces upon which they are cultured will be investigated. Primary human
endothelial cells and 3T3 cells will be cultured on surfaces whose properties
have been systematically altered and carefully controlled. Copolymers of
derivitized alkyl methacrylates will be used as the culture surface to determine
the effect of surface free energy and chemical moieties such as carboxyl,
tertiaryamine, and quaternary amine groups on cell adhesion, cell morphology,
and cell metabolism. Cell morphology will be measured microscopically and will
include the maximum force of adhesion. The role of specificcell adhesion
molecules will also be investigated. Cell metabolism will be investigated by
measuring the cell growth rate, the synthesis of extra cellular matrix, the
release of growth factors, and there lease of arachidonic acid metabolites.
These investigations are important to advances in applied cell culture, both for
biotechnological and biomedical use. Biotechnologically, mammalian cell culture
is used to produce critical and complex pharmaceuticals, and their performance
with respect to the surface characteristics of the bioreactor is poorly
understood. Biomedically, tissue replacements are desired which involve live
cells attached to some synthetic support structure, for example, blood vessel
cells attached to a synthetic tube to serve as an artificial blood vessel.
Invariably, some alteration in cell function is observed as a result of the
surface interactions, and this can comprise the function of the tissue
replacement.
