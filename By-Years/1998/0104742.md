This proposal seeks funding for an after-school program in science for 2,000
middle school students in grades 6-8. The proposed after-school Imperial Valley
Agriculture Learning Center project is designed to engage underrepresented
groups of middle school students in sustentative after-school activities in
specific areas of science, mathematics and technology. The science content will
focus on agricultural science and will include topics such as entomology, soils,
meteorology and genetically modified crops. Four twelve-week programs will be
offered each year and students will attend two sessions per week (after
school).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a cooperative initiative between El
Centro School District, The Valley Imperial Project in Science LSC, The San
Diego State University-Imperial Valley Campus and the University of California,
Division of Agricultural and Natural Resources, Desert Research and Extension
Center.
