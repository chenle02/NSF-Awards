9310676 Prell Besides their importance in the zooplankton and as links in the
marine food web, foraminifera and radiolaria also produce hard parts that
contribute to the flux, respectively, of calcium carbonate and opaline silica
from the upper ocean to the sea floor. As part of the Arabian Sea Process Study,
scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Brown University
will quantify the effects of the monsoon winds upon the production of
foraminifera and radiolaria and upon the flux of their hard parts to the
seafloor by examining samples taken from plankton tows, sediment traps, and in
sediment cores from the seafloor. Such studies should help us to understand both
present- day and historical patterns of oceanic biological production and
particle flux associated with the monsoons. ***
