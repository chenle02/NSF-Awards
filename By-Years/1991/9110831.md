The primary objective of this research is to apply a promising new algorithm
for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to a distributed memory parallel
computer. The long range goal is to significantly increase the size of flow
problems of industrial significance that can be routinely simulated on
affordable, high-performance machines. The chosen CFD algorithm , called BLIMM
for Block-Implicit Multigrid Method, has been shown to be very efficient for
solving recirculating, incompressible flows on meshes with large numbers of grid
points. The algorithm is based on the control-volume finite- difference method,
which is the basis of several commercial and industrial CFD codes.//
