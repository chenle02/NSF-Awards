Analyses of paleomagnetic data generally assume that the earth's magnetic
field, when averaged over several thousand years, conforms to that of a
geocentric axial dipole. Nevertheless, long-term non-dipolar components have
been found to be important. In fact, recent analyses suggest that during the
Cenozoic, multipolar field components have varied so as to produce alternating
"far-sided" and "near-sided" effects of significant magnitude. Understanding the
nature and magnitude of these deviations from an axial dipole are important in
plate tectonic reconstructions using paleomagnetic data, since such
reconstructions generally assume that the deviations are small when compared to
other uncertainties in the paleomagnetic data. The objective of the present
recommended award is to assemble and compile the paleomagnetic data from a large
number of piston core sites from the Pacific Ocean. These data were generated
during a number of separate projects during the last fifteen years and form an
ideal data set for examining both spatial and temporal aspects of the non-dipole
field. Initial activity on this project will be to determine sediment ages using
a consistent stratigraphy for the cores. Additionally, individual data points
will be examined for both their consistency and potential source of error. Once
this task is completed, the nondipole field will be examined in several areas of
the Pacific Ocean basin. The principal investigator on this project is highly
qualified to undertake the proposed study. Funding is highly recommended at
$85,000 in FY87 for 18 months.
