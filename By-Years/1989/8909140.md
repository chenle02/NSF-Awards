This project will investigate analytically and experimentally the load capacity
of an axially loaded I-Shape column of a fiber reinforced pultruded composite
material. The study will investigate: short and long term loading; ultimate
capacity after exposure to ultraviolet light; and effect of anisotropy and
viscoelastic properties. Guidelines and design provisions will be recommended.
