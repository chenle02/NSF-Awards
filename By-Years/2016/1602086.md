This project is focused on the study of the formation and growth of new
particles in the atmosphere. It involves an international collaboration that
enables U.S. scientists to work at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear
Research in Switzerland, at the CLOUD (COsmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber
there. The results of this research are expected to have implications that go
beyond the atmospheric sciences, to numerous industrial and other natural
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to: (1)
advance measurement methods to make it possible to measure the size distribution
of freshly nucleated clusters/particles as a function of time as they exist in
the atmosphere in which they are formed in order to map their passage through
the Kelvin regime, i.e., from near critical, or even sub-critical cluster sizes
through to stable particles; (2) measure and model the multicomponent activation
kinetics as low volatility organic compounds and extremely low volatility
organic compounds condense on inert and sulfuric acid clusters in the Kelvin
size regime, varying the temperature and composition of the atmosphere to probe
the underlying mechanisms; (3) measure and model new particle formation,
secondary activation, and growth in carefully controlled chamber experiments in
order to constrain and parameterize new particle formation under a wide range of
atmospheric conditions and for key aerosol precursors.
