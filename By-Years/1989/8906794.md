The focus of this award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the oxidation of organic molecules by compounds of the
transition metal ruthenium. The aims of this research are to elucidate the
mechanisms of these reactions and to exploit this knowledge to achieve high
degree of selectivity in the oxidation of organic molecules. It is likely that
these metal compounds can be used ultimately as catalysts for the oxidation of
organic molecules by atmospheric oxygen, a process of substantial importance in
industry and in the destruction of toxic substances. The mechanistic details of
the oxidation of a variety of organic and inorganic functional groups by
polypyridyl oxo complexes of ruthenium(IV) will be investigated. The mechanistic
work will be extended to the oxidation of olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons, amines
and other inorganic and organic functional groups. An attempt will be made to
acquire detailed insight into hydrogen atom and hydride transfer pathways which
occur with large isotope effects, and an attempt will be made to establish the
existence of long range, proton coupled electron transfer pathways. Extensions
will be made in the underlying descriptive chemistry of metal-oxo complexes, to
the reactivity properties of dioxo complexes, and to the preparation and
characterization of complexes in which ligand bridges span different metal-oxo
sites. The interest in multiple oxo complexes comes from their multiple electron
acceptor capabilities and the possibility of using controlled molecular
dimensions to achieve oxidative selectivity.
