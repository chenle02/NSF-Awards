Among the most interesting new organometallic compounds to be synthesized in the
last several years are the compounds of the metal samarium which are the under
study in this research project. These compounds are very powerful reagents for
the addition of electrons to other molecules, rivalling the very reactive metal
sodium in their ability to so, but having the advantage over sodium of being
soluble in a variety of organic solvents. The Principal Investigator has used
these samarium compounds to bring about a wide variety of unusual
transformations of small molecules, and these reagents are expected to be
valuable in the development of new syntheses of complex organic molecules. The
objectives of this investigation are (1) to define fully the reactivity of
organometallic Sm(II) complexes and (2) to exploit this reactivity in (a)
unusual transformations of small molecules, (b) new syntheses of complex organic
molecules, (c) the development of unusual inorganic materials, and (d) the
enhancement of understanding of organometallic chemistry in general. These
objectives will be accomplished by studying in detail the activation of CO,
alkynes, RN=NR, and isonitriles by the bis-THF adduct of
bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienide)- samarium(II); by also exploring how this
reagent activates nitriles, imides, NO and carbon dioxide; by investigating the
unusual bent structure of bis-(Cp*)Sm(II) with appropriate reactivity studies;
by contrasting the chemistry of bis-(Cp*)Sm(II) and of its bis-THF adduct; by
investigating the reactivity of organosamarium(II) complexes with inorganic
substrates; and by exploring new types of Ln(II) species.
