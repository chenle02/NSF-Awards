This research will study the theory of partial sums and partial maxima of
independent random variables, probability in Banach spaces and the theory of
random sets. The of the three major questions to be viewed will to approximate
the distributions of sums of independent random variables. The emphasis will be
to obtain results which are widely applicable eg. for random variables taking
real or vector values or values in infinite dimensional Banach spaces. The
second problem will be to study the partial maxima and their relationship to
partial sums. The third problem will be to study unions of independent or
dependent random sets and their role in modelling growth phenomena. These models
will incorporate a means to alter the activity in a region based on the number
of times that a region has been contaminated. Simulations on graphical computer
will be done to complement the theoretical work.
