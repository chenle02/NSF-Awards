This project is establishing a laboratory capable of supporting an undergraduate
specialization in computational science. Computational modeling is rapidly
becoming an important scientific research technique. However, a large number of
students in the physical, natural, and social sciences are completing their
undergraduate training without any experience in applying computational tools
and modeling techniques to problems in their own discipline. The focus of this
project is the new course sequence within the Mathematics and Computer Science
Department that is giving students the needed background and experience. These
new courses are introducing the core concepts of computational science,
including procedural and non-procedural programming, modeling, scientific
visualization, numerical libraries and toolkits, and parallel algorithms and
architectures. Students are using these concepts to solve large-scale problems
drawn from their own scientific field.
