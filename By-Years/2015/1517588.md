The task of developing educational materials that foster interdisciplinary
integration is especially challenging for undergraduate colleges where the
teaching load is so high that faculty find it difficult to keep up with new
developments in their own fields, let alone in new discipline-spanning fields
such as integrative systems biology. The goal of this project is to create fully
comprehensive educational materials that will help faculty nationwide enter the
field of integrative systems biology, educate students, and engage them in
interdisciplinary systems-based biological research. By developing the proposed
materials, the project will lay the foundation for educating current and future
teachers, including postdoctoral fellows and young scientists. This strategy is
anticipated to have an enormous multiplier effect and will empower instructors
who might otherwise not be able to engage in the transdisciplinary field of
integrative systems biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pressing need for
educational materials in the new field of integrative systems biology, in
particular at undergraduate colleges where faculty have little time to develop
new courses that require knowledge of several distinct parent disciplines. The
materials to be developed consist of lecture slides, projects, exercises,
homework problems, solutions, background materials, computer code in different
languages, and other materials that simplify the development of integrative
systems biology courses for faculty that come from different fields of STEM
education. The proposed materials will be developed and alpha-tested at Georgia
Institute of Technology. Subsequent beta-testing will occur at Spelman College,
historically known as a minority institution that primarily caters to female
students from underrepresented groups. Subsequently the teaching modules will be
further tested at other colleges.
