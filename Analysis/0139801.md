Following A.P. Calderon's program (sketched in his Helsinki ICM address in
1978), many basic boundary value problems in physics and engineering can be
attacked by starting with a representation of the solution in the form of a
potential operator, and then reducing matters to analyzing the functional
analytic properties of a system of pseudodifferential operators on the boundary.
The new phenomenon, occurring when non-smooth structures are present, is that
these boundary operators belong to a larger class, consisting of singular
integral operators. The lack of a symbolic calculus in this context makes the
study of such operators fundamentally harder, particularly when one has to
address such delicate issues like Fredholmness and invertibility. While in the
intervening years these ideas have undergone a dramatic development, much
remains to be done.

The main goal of the current proposal is to investigate the specific nature of
the singular integral operators arising in connection with basic problems in
mathematical physics, such as Maxwell's equations, vector Poisson problems,
Hodge decompositions, and Stokes's system of hydrodynamics, in light of recent
advances in the fields of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.
For maximum applicability, it is important to consider these problems in the
context of general Sobolev-Besov spaces and when the underlying structures are
minimally smooth.
