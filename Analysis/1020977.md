This award will fund U.S. participation in the AIMS' Eighth International
Conference on Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations to be held at Dresden
University of Technology, Dresden, Germany during May 25-28, 2010.

This conference series is a biennial event whose objective is to create an
opportunity to bring together mathematicians and scientists, working in the area
of dynamical systems and differential equations with different training
background and research approaches, to communicate and report on recent
achievements, exchange new ideas and discuss future research directions in an
atmosphere that prompts considerable interaction and inspiration. As past
conferences have demonstrated, the conference will foster communications and
collaborations among established researchers, young scientists and graduate
students working in the fields of dynamical systems and differential equations.
The funds will provide partial support for travel expenses of participants,
especially for graduate students, recent Ph.D.s, and participants from under-
represented groups in the mathematical sciences. This award is co-funded by the
Applied Mathematics and Analysis programs.
