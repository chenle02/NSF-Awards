This project provides challenging test data and benchmarks designed to advance
stereo vision methods to a level of practical relevance. It aims to bridge the
gap between the sophisticated but brittle methods that perform best on current
benchmarks and the robust but simple methods employed in real-world
applications.

The project provides new high-resolution datasets with accurate ground truth,
taken with different cameras under different lighting conditions, and depicting
complex indoor and outdoor scenes with non-Lambertian surfaces and outliers such
as moving people, reflections, and shadows. The project explores novel
algorithmic approaches for dealing with such challenges, including ways to
leverage resolution, deriving color and noise models on the fly, and designing
local region-growing techniques that allow deferring global optimization from
the pixel level to the region level. Undergraduate students are actively
involved in all components of this research.

The project has strong potential impact along several fronts. The datasets and
benchmarks resulting from this work serve as catalyst for new research and
enable machine learning approaches. The algorithmic contributions allow
harnessing the explosion of images available online. Robust matching techniques
that can handle the variety of images available on the Internet enable a host of
new applications with broad impacts on the population at large, including visual
localization and navigation, as well as automatic 3D reconstruction and
visualization of whole cities. Finally, the project exposes undergraduates at a
liberal-arts college in rural Vermont to the world of research, experimentation,
and discovery.
