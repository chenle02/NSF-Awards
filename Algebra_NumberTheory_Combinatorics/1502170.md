The investigations in this project are at the interface of geometry and physics.
In one direction, our knowledge of the geometric nature of the fundamental
forces and particles of physics will be expanded, much as Einstein explained
gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of space and time. In another
direction, physical ideas and insights will be applied to advance our knowledge
about the geometry of certain curved spaces. For the past thirty years, this
general area of mathematical investigation has produced many important
applications to other areas of mathematics, as well as sometimes surprising
applications to physics, and to science and engineering more generally. Doctoral
students will be trained to assist in mathematical aspects of these
investigations, adding highly skilled workers to the STEM workforce.

Several problems in algebraic geometry inspired by string theory will be
investigated, in addition to problems in string theory. One set of problems
involves the study of three important algebro-geometric curve-counting
invariants motivated by string theory: Gopakumar-Vafa (or BPS) invariants,
Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and Pandharipande-Thomas invariants, as well as
their motivic and refined extensions. Some of these theories are known to
describe equivalent data, while others are only conjecturally equivalent. New
techniques and examples will be investigated to extend the reach of these
theories. Important goals are to establish some of the conjectures, at least in
certain situations, and to put the definition of the refined BPS invariants of
string theory on a more firm mathematical foundation by connecting the differing
approaches. In another direction, the investigation of the small quantum product
of a toric variety will be reopened with the goal of answering a question about
its structure that was almost answered in the 1990s. Finally, the geometry-
physics dictionary for F-theory and its dual descriptions in terms of M-theory
and type II string theory will be investigated with the objectives of making the
dictionary more precise and then deducing applications to both algebraic
geometry and physics.
