This award will partially cover cost-of-living expenses for Dr. Richard Ladner
of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of
Washington while he is conducting research at Victoria University in Wellington,
New Zealand with Dr. Ewan Tempero. These two researchers plan to investigate the
problems associated with designing an end-to-end transport layer protocol in the
Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model of a computer network in the light of
recent theoretical work. The new theoretical results raise the possibility of a
new class of efficient protocols for this problem. The protocols will be
investigated by analytically and experimentally exploring which design
variations have the best chance of practical implementation. Those with most
promise will be implemented under Unix using the Internetwork Protocol in a
controlled environment. This work brings together the expertise of Dr. Tempero
in systems research and Dr. Ladner in theoretical research. This cooperative
activity builds on Dr. Ladner's current NSF supported work in distributed and
parallel computing (CCR-9108314). Ladner's travel expenses to New Zealand are
being covered under a 1992- 1993 Fulbright Travel Grant.
