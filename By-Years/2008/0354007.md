This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) related program at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee's Center for
Great Lakes Studies (CGLS). The program will support 18 REU students
(approximately one from each OCE-funded REU site) per year to attend the
American Society for Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) winter meetings each year
from 2005-2007. Students who have completed research projects the prior summer
at OCE-funded REU sites may apply for support via the program. The Directors of
each REU site are requested to nominate up to three students from their site.
Each student selected for the program will receive air and shuttle bus fare,
registration, room, per diem meal expenses, a ticket to the Award Luncheon or
similar event, and one year of membership in ASLO. Students will be prepared for
participation in the meeting by the PI's and will present the results of their
research in a poster session for undergraduates. This program will allow over
fifty-four undergraduates to gain a better understanding of how the professional
oceanographic community works and gives them many opportunities to further their
career in ocean sciences.
