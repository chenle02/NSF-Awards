This project is to investigate the origins and tectonic significance of
intermediate composition flood eruptives that re associated with continental
rifts. Chemical and radiometric isotopic analyses of approximately 10 natural
flood phonolite and trachyte lavas will be used to constrain possible source
reservoir(s) and the evolution of these lavas. Melting experiments on samples
from this suite will be used to examine the processes and the P, T. and
composition conditions necessary for the genesis of these lavas. Possible source
mineralogies, polybaric and polythermal crystallization sequences, and the role
of volatiles in partial melting and mass transport will be identified.
Complementary studies of compositionally simplified analog systems will
facilitate interpretation of phase relations and extrapolation of results to
different magma compositions. Forward approach studies, if appropriate, will
test petrogenetic models that result from the inverse experiments. The result of
this integrated experimental and analytical approach are relevant to
understanding heat and mass transfer from mantle to crust during rifting,
identifying the involvement of crust in rift magmatism, and developing
geophysical models for rift evolution and structure.
