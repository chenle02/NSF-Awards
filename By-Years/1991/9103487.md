Development of new polymeric materials involves new arrangements of monomers as
much as it does development of new monomers. Recently, interest has focused on
polymeric surfactants adsorbed on surfaces. Block copolymers or end-adsorbing
polymers have amphiphilic character, meaning that they tend to form aggregates
or microstructures such as micelles, microemulsions, lamellae and monolayers.
Chains are tethered in these structures in that they are attached by their ends.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from many countries
with experimental and theoretical experience in all aspects of tethered polymer
chains to discuss the latest issues and advance the state of understanding of
this important category of polymeric materials. Proceedings of the workshop will
be published.
