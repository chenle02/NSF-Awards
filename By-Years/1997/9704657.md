9704657 Magde This project will develop several different approaches to
integrating geodynamical models with seismic data. This will allow the
combination of the strengths of both methods, combining both observational
seismic data and physical constraints derived from first principles, to
investigate mantle flow and melt generation beneath mid-ocean ridges. After
examining the sensitivity of the transformation between geodynamic predictions
and seismic parameters, integration of the two techniques will begin with the
application of a self-consistent forward model to one of three actual data sets.
Then an approach to solving the inverse problem using hypothesis-testing and/or
iterative approaches will be developed.
