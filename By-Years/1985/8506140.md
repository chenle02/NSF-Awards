Behavior of construction materials under high static and dynamic stresses and
under high temperatures is very important for the analysis and design of
facilities in the resource extraction and disposal domain, but also in more
conventional structures. Basic knowledge on such material behavior is incomplete
largely due to a lack of experimentation. The proposed high pressure triaxial
equipment will make such experimental research possible. The triaxial apparatus
is designed for axial compression stresses and confining pressures of up to
50000 psi and true axial tensile stress of up to 10000 psi. The cell will be
built by a local firm specializing in high pressure equipment, while the other
equipment will be built by this firm and MIT staff and students. Research to be
performed with this apparatus includes investigations on rock and concrete,
which requires the combination of medium specimen size, large and dynamic loads,
pore pressures and high temperatures.
