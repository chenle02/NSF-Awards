Widespread concern about the presumed global-scale deterioration of coral reefs
mandates the need for documented case histories of the world's coral reefs. To
meet this need, the Colloquium organizers assembled a series of case histories.
Some 50 case histories from 22 different countries were selected as examples of
the health, hazards and history of reefs. These case histories were used as the
basis for critical review by coral reef scientists at a three- day Colloquium in
June 1993. Based on these case histories, the Colloquium addressed several key
questions: What is the geographical extent of coral reef deterioration or under
stress? How will the expected global warming influence reefs? How can natural
vs. anthropogenic-induced changes be identified? Does sea level history explain
some of the variations in the vigor of reef communities? What is the impact of
oil spills on coral reefs? How do excess nutrients from land-runoff affect
reefs? Immediately following the Colloquium, an open two-day Forum with keynote
speakers presented the results of this review to the public. Selected case
histories, their review and recommendations from the Colloquium and Forum will
be published in the University of Miami Serial Publication.
