Prop #: 0422612 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert Knox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the Research Vessels Melville,
Revelle, New Horizon, and Sproul operated by the University of California, San
Diego and dedicated to use in support of marine research. The Shipboard
Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed
essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program
provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment
such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the
location of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers
and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and
other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and
from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Robert Knox is fully qualified
to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the
institution to acquire life rafts, a remote radar repeater (through group
purchase), a shipboard announcing system, immersion suits (through group
purchase), and an engine monitoring and alarm system upgrade. ***&lt;br/&gt;
