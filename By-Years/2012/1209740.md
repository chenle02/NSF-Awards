This action funds Baek Soo Lee of Oregon State University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Slope and historical land management effects on the nitrogen
cycle in a Japanese forest watershed" during the summer of 2012 at Hokkaido
University in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Hideaki
Shibata.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand
mechanisms of the nitrogen cycle in relation to slope and historical land use as
well as to improve land management decision-making processes for enhancing water
and soil quality. This research addresses several new aspects of the influence
of slope and forest management history on nitrogen cycling in surface water and
soil within a forest ecosystem using spatial and statistical analyses and is
being conducted in the Nakagawa Experimental Forest in Hokkaido, the
northernmost island of Japan.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
