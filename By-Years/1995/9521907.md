9521907 Dam A key problem in oceanographic is understanding the factors that
effect changes in fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from surface waters to the deep
ocean. It has been recognized that planktonic organisms play an important role
in the downward flux of carbon and nitrogen Zooplankton, through their ingestion
and subsequent egestion of phytoplankton and protozoa biomass, are important
agents of export production in the ocean. Although rapidly sinking zooplankton
decal pellets have been identified as one of the main mechanisms responsible for
downward fluxes of organic, our knowledge in this area remains extremely
fragmentary. This research centers on the transformation by zooplankton of
phytoplankton and protozoa biomass and its subsequent export in the form of
fecal pellets, plus the role of zooplankton vertical migration and phytoplankton
aggregates in downward fluxes of carbon and nitrogen in the ocean. ***
