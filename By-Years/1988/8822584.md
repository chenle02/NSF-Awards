HARRISON This award supports observations of the completion of the surge of West
Fork Glacier, Alaska, and its effects on the Susitna River, into which it
drains. The results will be analyzed in the context of pre-surge studies of the
flow regime of the glacier, and the sediment regime of the river. Observations
of the surge and of the drainage system were begun early in the surge using
resources from an ongoing project. It is anticipated that the additional
information will be particularly important when compared with that from the
detailed studies of Variegated glacier. Also, it will be the first time that the
effects of a major surge on a large river have been studied. Results will impact
our understanding of the rapid glacial surge mechanism, and will have
significance for understanding the dynamics of large continental glaciers, such
as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
