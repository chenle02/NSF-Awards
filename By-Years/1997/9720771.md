Frank, Juhan AST-9720771 Dr. Frank will investigate the effects irradiation
from an accretion disk has on the evolution in semi-detached binary systems
containing compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes.
Irradiation, combined with systematic angular momentum losses, drives limit
cycles in the evolution of the system, which Dr. Frank will investigate by
numerical simulations under a variety of assumptions. His main goals include
determining if the observed dispersion in mass transfer rates and the relative
distribution of cataclysmic variable subtypes can be explained by the
irradiation-driven cycles, and then extending this work to the cases of systems
involving neutron stars and black holes.
