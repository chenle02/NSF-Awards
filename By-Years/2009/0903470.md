Microprocessor performance has doubled approximately every 18 months for several
decades, making existing applications faster without much programming effort and
allowing more demanding new applications to be developed. However, now the trend
of steadily improving performance for existing applications has stalled. The
performance potential of a microprocessor chip is still rapidly increasing, but
the increase now mainly comes from packing more and more processor cores onto
the chip, not from making each core faster. This provides little benefit to
existing applications that can only utilize one core, so they must be re-
designed to take advantage of multiple cores. Unfortunately, correct design of
multi-core applications is much harder to achieve than was the case for single-
core applications, and it is even harder for programmers to achieve scalability
? enabling applications to keep improving their performance as even more cores
become available in the future. This problem threatens to disrupt the entire
hardware-software ecosystem and possibly put an end to rapid improvements in
computing performance, the information technology revolution, and the resulting
productivity increases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will
investigate hardware and software performance debugging mechanisms that would
help programmers identify and alleviate performance problems in their many-core
applications, both for use in application development and in education. This
will help the information technology revolution stay on track by helping
existing programmers and training new ones to write scalable many-core
applications that will in turn create demand for even more cores, allowing rapid
progress in computing performance to continue.
