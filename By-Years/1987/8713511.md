It has been twenty years between the assessment of the state of the fields of
science and engineering policy by Skolnikoff and that of the AAAS Committee on
Science and Public Policy in 1986. Both science and science policy changed
during this period, as has the demand for science policy analysts. New
directions may be needed in the education of individuals for science and
engineering policy analysis. This workshop will bring together the heads of
leading academic centers in science and engineering policy, along with
individuals from emerging programs, from the "user" community, and from the
community of employers of science policy analysts. They will discuss the extent
to which they believe they share a common purpose and will, if indicated,
develop contact mechanisms among them. They will examine curriculum with intent
of bringing greater substantive coherence to the field.
