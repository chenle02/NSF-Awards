The purpose of this research is to measure the economic importance of the
introduction of the electric telegraph in the United States the end of the of
the last century. Estimates will be developed of the costs to society at that
time of not having had available the technology of the telegraph for long
distance communication. An estimate of the costs to society will be based on the
cost of replacing the service by some other existing communication technology,
like expanding the mail service at that time, together with the increased costs
to the economic sectors purchasing communication services. This research is
important because it looks at the economic development implications of the
adoption of new communications technology. Innovation in communications
continues at a rapid pace to this day, and the results of this study should
provide useful insights into the role of communication technology in economic
growth and development process.
