Forty students who have completed the junior year in secondary schools having
limited facilities or instruction, primarily from the Southern Appalachian
region, will be selected to participate in an enrichment program centered on
engineering. The program will consist of lectures in the Introduction to
Engineering series, engineering design, energy and environmental engineering.
The participants will also develop a proficiency in Fortran IV programming on
the main University computer system and on microcomputers. They will work in
design teams to develop an engineering design of a device or system. Field trips
will be taken to the Arnold Engineering Development Center (U.S. Air Force), to
a TVA power plant, and to a local industry.
