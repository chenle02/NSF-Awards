9503991 Bielak This proposal is concerned with the development of efficient
parallel algorithms for the numerical study of wave phenomena that arise when
waves propagating within an infinite or semi-infinite medium encounter obstacles
in their path. The focus of this proposal is to successfully integrate absorbing
boundary techniques, which primarily aim at the reduction of computational
domains, with parallel numerical algorithms that exploit distributed memory
multiprocessor systems. The ultimate objective is the physical understanding of
the modeled system: in this proposal the primary application target is the
elastic wave propagation arising in the simulation of the ground motion of large
basins.
