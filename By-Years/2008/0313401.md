Proposal Number: 0313401&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Multi-view Programming&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Andrew P. Black&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
aims to liberate programmers from representing programs as linear streams of
text, and to enable a qualitatively different way of
programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People understand complex artifacts more
easily if they can be viewed in multiple ways. An architect seeking to describe
the design of a building does not give her client a single drawing: she provides
site &lt;br/&gt;models, building models, plans, elevations, perspectives and
interior views. Each of these representations shows some aspect of the proposed
building to best advantage, while ignoring or glossing over details that are
irrelevant to that aspect. This project will attempt to do the same thing for
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the research is envisioning
the views: as programmers we are so used to flat text that it is hard to open
our minds to other possibilities. The second phase will integrate multiple views
with existing languages and program development
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By directing the awesome power of IT to the
problems of creating, understanding, changing, and testing software itself, we
believe that we can begin a revolution in software production that is just as
&lt;br/&gt;all-encompassing as the revolution that IT has created in almost
every other activity in our society.&lt;br/&gt;
