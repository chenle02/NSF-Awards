With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), F. David
Horgen and colleagues Brian J. Bozlee and Jiasong Fang from the Hawaii Pacific
University will acquire a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer detector
(GC-MS). The instrumentation is to be used by at least four faculty members, 13
postdoctoral research associates, and there will be training for undergraduate
and M.S. students. The GC-MS is proposed to be used in identifying biomarkers,
nanomaterials, bioactive marine-derived compounds, biosynthesized peptides, and
in quantitation of dimethyl sulfide in sea water, and nitrogen incorporation
studies in aquaculture systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatography with
mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for
the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. The results from studies using
the requested spectrometer will have an impact on organic/organometallic
chemistry, chemical biology, natural product chemistry, and materials chemistry.
