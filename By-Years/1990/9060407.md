The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) as refrigerants/working fluid in air
conditioning systems and their subsequent leakage, is a recognized major cause
of the depletion of the ozone layer. In this SBIR project, the development of a
novel new air conditioning system which eliminates the air conditioning CFC
emission problem is being investigated. The air conditioning system uses air as
the working fluid rather than a CFC or similar synthetic refrigerant making the
air conditioning system environmentally safe. It is anticipated that the
efficiency and simplicity of the device will make it a very attractive
alternative to current vapor compression machines.
