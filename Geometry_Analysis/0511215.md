Abstract

Award: DMS- 0511215 Principal Investigator: Susan Szczepanski, Huai-Dong Cao,
Donald M. Davis, David L. Johnson

The Co-PI's of this project will organize and host the next occurrences of two
important conferences on geometry and topology cosponsored by the hosting
institutions and the Journal of Differential Geometry. The first conference will
be held in May, 2005 and will be hosted at Harvard University, Cambridge ,
Massachusetts. This conference will be international in scope and will highlight
recent developments in the field of geometry that will likely determine the
primary direction of research in this area for the next several years. The other
two conferences will be the next occurrences (thirteenth and fourteenth) of the
Lehigh Geometry and Topology Conference and will be held on the campus of Lehigh
University, Bethlehem Pennsylvania in June, 2006 and June, 2007. These
conferences will be international in scope as well with a combined emphasis on
the areas of geometry and topology. All three conferences will be designed to
attract participants at all stages of careers from a large geographic area.

Prominent researchers will be invited to prepare lectures for the general
audience on a range of topics highlighting significant recent research
developments and their connections to the fields of geometry and topology as
well as the applications of results in topology and geometry to other areas of
mathematics and science. All attendees will be encouraged to present current
research results and to participate in mathematical discourse. In particular,
special effort will be undertaken to ensure that this conference will benefit
individuals in the early stages of a career in mathematical research. Financial
support will be provided to undergraduates, graduate students, recent PhD's and
untenured assistant professors, and members of under-represented groups; the
invited speakers will be expected to serve as their mentors by providing comment
and suggesting additional problems for study.

This award is funded jointly by the programs in Geometric Analysis and Topology.
