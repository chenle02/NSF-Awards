We propose to hold a workshop among experts in Ross Sea, Antarctica, ecology in
order to identify&lt;br/&gt;important factors that are likely to be affecting
the Ross Sea in the near future, including&lt;br/&gt;both climate and more
direct factors such as industrial fishing. On the basis of this
information,&lt;br/&gt;a report will be generated concerning how uncertainties
in this knowledge can best be addressed,&lt;br/&gt;including the use of
technological advances in marine ecology. This information, in
turn,&lt;br/&gt;will be used, in part, to adivse the US Department of State on a
management plan required&lt;br/&gt;in the designation of the Ross Sea as a
marine protected area under the jurisdiction of the&lt;br/&gt;Commission for the
Conservation of Antartic Marine Living Resources.&lt;br/&gt;
