9511869 Day Some estimates state that as much as one third of the mammalian
genome, some 30,000 genes, are expressed in the brain, but only a very small
number have been assigned clearly defined roles in neural development or
function. Increasing our knowledge of the genes involved in synapse formation
and stability is fundamental to our understanding of neural development,
learning, and memory. The major goal of this research is to identify genes with
roles in the compensatory synaptic reorganization that occurs after surgical
alteration of the adult brain. The studies to be performed will identify changes
in neuronal messenger RNAs induced by cutting neural connections to the
hippocampus, a region involved in learning and memory. Molecular cloning will
then be used to identify genes with increased activity during the brain's
attempt to compensate for the loss of these hippocampal connections. The cloning
strategy involves subtraction hybridization of complementary DNA libraries
constructed from brains having two different types of hippocampal alterations.
The complementary nature of these cloning strategies will remove gene products
associated with the non-specific effects, and enrich the resulting cDNA library
with synapse-specific neuronal clones. Careful screening of these candidate
clones will determine their roles in synapse formation and stability. This
research will identify specific genes that are involved in neural development
and regeneration and, ultimately, define the role of these genes in these
fundamental neural processes.
