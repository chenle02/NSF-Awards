This project maintains and enhances existing community software
&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, and creates new community data infrastructure to
&lt;br/&gt;enable the information retrieval research community and related
&lt;br/&gt;research communities to conduct research on a "web scale",
&lt;br/&gt;meaning datasets of a billion or more web pages together with
&lt;br/&gt;large query logs. The software infrastructure is based on the
&lt;br/&gt;Lemur Toolkit and the associated Indri search engine, which are
&lt;br/&gt;used by many information retrieval researchers due to the support
&lt;br/&gt;for multiple retrieval models, multiple forms of evidence, and a
&lt;br/&gt;powerful probabilistic query language. The enhancements to Lemur
&lt;br/&gt;include support for the popular MapReduce style of distributed
&lt;br/&gt;processing and other efficiency improvements to make it practical
&lt;br/&gt;to do research on large web datasets 'out of the box' in common
&lt;br/&gt;computer hardware environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new data
infrastructure consists of maintenance and &lt;br/&gt;distribution of a newly
created billion-page dataset, another new &lt;br/&gt;web dataset, and large,
anonymized search logs that match the &lt;br/&gt;datasets. The combination of
large datasets and corresponding &lt;br/&gt;large search logs enable a broad
community to conduct research &lt;br/&gt;with more realistic data resources than
were available &lt;br/&gt;previously. This research will lead to further
advances in the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the underlying issues for large-
scale, &lt;br/&gt;personalized search, which will be an important part of the
next &lt;br/&gt;generation of search engines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further
