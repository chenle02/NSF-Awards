The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable smaller
diagnostic systems and smaller blood draws without compromising on sample
quality and time-to-result. Currently, clinicians who want to ensure that blood
samples are well stabilized must use test tubes 1 mL or larger. Meanwhile,
point-of-care tests that use smaller volumes are challenged to disperse analytic
reagents rapidly and evenly throughout the volume. This project will develop a
microfluidic platform for rapid dispersal of dried reagents in whole
blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project tackles a vexing technical challenge. Mixing is hard to
achieve in microfluidic systems due to the lack of turbulence. In these so-
called low Reynolds number environments, a solute will only move relative to its
solvent by diffusion. Depending on the temperature, the size of the solute, and
the viscosity of the solvent, mixing across a millimeter-scale chamber can take
minutes or even hours. This project will demonstrate a low-power, non-
destructive microfluidic mixing technology to rapidly disperse dried reagents
into blood. The goal is to accelerate time-to-completion by as much as 10x.
