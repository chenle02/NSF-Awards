9402172 Mutter This is an eight-day multichannel seismic investigation of the
robust, intermediate-to-fast-spreading ridge north of the Orozco fracture zone.
The aim is to characterize the nature of the axial magma chamber reflections and
determine variability in depth, strike, width, and thickness of reflecting
bodies as well as to determine relationship between these variables and ridge
morphology. The "normal-looking' ridge just north of the Orozco will also be
characterized. This seismic investigation of an inflated- and normal-looking
ridge crest will address whether bathymetric expressions can be used to infer
magmatic budget. Can the state of magmatic activity in the crust and on the
seafloor? ***
