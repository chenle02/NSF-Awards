In this project, a zeolite film (membrane) is grown on a polymer film. To
accomplish this, tetralkyl ammonium ion templates for initiating zeolite growth
are attached to the surface of the polymer film by long hydrocarbon chains. The
zeolite, as it forms, grow a channel around the hydrocarbon chain. The resultant
hybrid film is evaluated for separation of gas and liquid solution as prepared
and after removal of the polymer film. It is planned to produce a silicalite
membrane on a cellulose ester film which will be applicable to the separation of
nitrogen/oxygen and ethanol/water solution. This will establish the basic
principles for expansion of this technology to many other separation
applications. The development of highly selective membranes will have many
benefits including purer, more competitive products, decreased pollution and
energy savings. Zeolites with their molecular sized channels and variable
chemical affinities have already demonstrated high selectivity in many
applications. The availability of zeolite films would lead to much broader
applications of membrane technology.
