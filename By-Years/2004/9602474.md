This work involves a two-pronged approach to fundamental studies in atomic
physics. In the first, the technique of recurrence spectroscopy will be combined
with that of resonance fields to obtain new information about the crossover
between quantum and classical physics. Particular attention will be paid to that
portion of the motion that approaches chaos. The second effort is the precision
determination of the Rydberg constant through measurement of transition
frequencies among high Rydberg levels in the atom. By making measurements
between Rydberg levels, QED and nuclear contributions to the energies are
negligible, and the result represents an independent determination of this
fundamental constant which can serve as a control for the more traditional
approaches.
