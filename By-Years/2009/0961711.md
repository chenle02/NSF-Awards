An hierarchy of intermediate coupled climate models will be used to investigate
multiple equilibrium states of the climate system, the role of ocean heat
transport in mediating the latitudinal range over which stable ice caps can
extend, and the stability of the equilibrium states. The modeling framework is a
coupled atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice model of an aquaplanet where the
geometrical constraints on ocean circulation and extent of land are represented
by a sequence of barriers. Key components of the ocean circulation, such as
subtropical gyres, zonal jets, and meridional overturning circulation will be
controlled by altering the geometrical barriers in the ocean. Their impacts on
the mean state of the coupled system and its ability to sustain polar ice caps
and multiple equilibrium states will then be examined. The proposal addresses
fundamental questions about the energy balance of the planet, the processes that
sustain polar sea-ice, interaction with the ocean and multiple equilibrium of
the coupled climate system.
