This award supports participation in the 2015 Maine-Québec Number Theory
Conference, taking place on October 3-4, 2015 at the University of Maine. This
is an annual conference, held at Laval University in Québec in even years, and
at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number
theorists from New England, Québec, and beyond, it promotes interaction and
collaboration between Canadian and American mathematics researchers.

The conference includes approximately thirty lectures addressing recent progress
in different areas of number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with
roughly 65 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and
young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers. This award also
provides travel support for US-based participants to attend the 2016 meeting in
Québec. The conference website has more information, including recent programs
and participant lists: http://www.math.umaine.edu/numbertheory/mainequebec.html
