Title: Asymptotic Results for U-Statistics This is a Minority Research
Initiation (MRI) planning grant to study problems associated with the
statistical estimation of population indicators and probability density
functions. The study will stress the need for consistency in the use of
estimators, expecially those expressed as U-statistics. The planning period will
allow the proposer to examine the general area of limit theorems and investigate
two problem areas: asymptotic properties for nonparametric U-statistics and the
convergence of U-statistics based on arrays of exchangeable random variables.
This grant will provide support for a well-trained minority mathematician to
prepare a competitive proposal to submit to the MRI research initiation
component.
