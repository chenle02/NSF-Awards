9301972 Kosro In this project, the PI will to carry out measurements of ocean
current velocities in the upper 300 meters, using an Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP). Specifically, measurements will be made across the Pacific at
about 17!S, during the Spring of 1994 as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE). This line is referred to as WOCE Hydrographic Program line
P-21. Measurements across boundary currents and in the central gyre of the South
Pacific will address the structure and transport of the currents, provide a
constraint for inverse models which will evaluate mass, heat, and tracer
budgets, and analyze the depth of wind-driven shear. ***
