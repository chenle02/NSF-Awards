This project is concerned with the mathematical modeling, numerical simulation
and model validation of surface-acoustic-wave driven microfluidic biochips. The
operational behavior of such biochips represents a multiphysics, multiscale
problem that can be described by a coupling of the equations of piezoelectrics
and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations featuring flow patterns on
extremely different time-scales. Heterogeneous homogenization techniques will be
applied for a proper modeling of the resulting flow field (acoustic streaming)
and develop, analyze and implement efficient and reliable algorithmic tools for
the numerical simulation. A model validation will be performed on the basis of
available experimental data.

Biochips and bioarrays are devices that are used in pharmaceutical, medical and
forensic applications for the chemical analysis of DNA and proteins and thus
play an important role in genomics, proteomics, and cell analysis. Current
technological efforts focus on the development of devices that guarantee a
significant speed-up of the analysis. Microfluidic biochips are characterized by
an integration of the fluidics on the chip itself and can provide such a speed-
up along with a better sensitivity, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. This
project will lead to a better understanding of the operational behavior and
develop methods that can be used for an optimal design of biochips and
bioarrays.
