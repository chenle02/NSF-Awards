9612522 Wilson In this research, we develop a design framework of novel signal
processing hierarchies and architectures for distributed sensing systems. We
propose to explore a design methodology that combines analog VLSI for
customizing front-end signal processing on the sensing plane with generic
processing centers located off the sensing plane for performing back-end
processing directed toward more complex feature analysis. We seek to apply these
distributed signal processing architectures to arrays of sensors that are
distributed within and fused across various sensing planes. These sensing planes
may be of the same type of sensor but placed at different locations in the
sensing environment. Alternatively, different types of sensing planes can be
fused for more accurate recognition and confirmation of objects of interest. The
applications of distributed systems of this type of architecture are numerous
and diverse. The phase of research proposed here does not seek to build systems
that satisfy all of these applications nor even systems for a substantial subset
of these applications. Rather, this research develops a framework for building
and testing novel architectures to be applied to the longer-term design of low-
cost, distributed sensing systems that have the capability to process large
numbers of sensing stations and sensory points in a variety of environments. ***
