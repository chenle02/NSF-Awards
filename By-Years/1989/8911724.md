The Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC), the
Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI), and the National Research
Council (NRC) will hold a two-day seminar which will be partially supported by
this award whose subject is "Learning from Earthquakes." This seminar will
present a concise summary of the main lessons learned from past earthquakes to
reduce hazards from future earthquakes. The seminar is especially oriented
toward the information needs of technical and policy- making staff of Federal
agencies involved in earthquake hazards reduction. It will be informative to all
persons involved in policy making, planning, design, regulation, research,
teaching, and consulting. The seminar is based on the synthesized experience of
EERI's worldwide investigations of more than 200 earthquakes. Observations from
the December 7, l988 Armenian earthquake will be integrated into the
presentations.
