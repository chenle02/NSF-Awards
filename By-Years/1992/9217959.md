Interstellar grains are thought to form, among other places, in circumstellar
flows from novae and infrared variable stars. Such objects will be observed in
the infrared to learn about the nucleation and growth of grains in these
environments, assess the heavy element contributions to the interstellar medium
from novae and infrared variable stars, and gain information on stages of
stellar evolution preceding the mass loss. A network of three remotely
controlled infrared telescopes in three different states will make it possible
to begin observations promptly after a nova eruption is detected to determine
the composition of the ejecta and to follow the development of dust in the
ejecta. The infrared variables will be monitored to learn their characteristics
and to study the changes in the inner dust shell throughout the pulsational
cycle.
