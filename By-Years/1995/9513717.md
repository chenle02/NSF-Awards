9513717 Yan This proposal is to investigate the fundamental constituents of
matter and the forces between them on two fronts. One aim is to test and to
extend the current understanding of the "Standard Model" of subatomic phenomena
in terms of quarks, leptons, gluons, weak bosons, and their interactions. This
research will also highlight the interplay between particle physics and
astrophysics, as well as mainstream topics in astrophysics such as the mechanism
for supernova explosions and the solar-neutrino problem. The second major theme
is the search for a unified theory of all interactions, and closely related
problems in such diverse fields as mathematical physics, statistical mechanis
and condensed matter physics. ***
