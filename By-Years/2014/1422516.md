Current processors employ aggressive prediction mechanisms to improve
&lt;br/&gt;performance and reduce power. To design effective optimizations, it
is &lt;br/&gt;increasingly important to understand and quantify a program's
dynamic &lt;br/&gt;behavior. However, today, most of these optimizations rely on
&lt;br/&gt;heuristics and are fairly ad-hoc. After some patterns are observed, a
&lt;br/&gt;hardware decision is made and the design space of the hardware
&lt;br/&gt;optimization is explored through simulation to determine the best
&lt;br/&gt;performing configuration. However, because the design is targeted for
&lt;br/&gt;observed and/or anticipated patterns, some dynamic behavior is not
&lt;br/&gt;captured and remains undetected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
develops a framework for quantitatively analyzing a &lt;br/&gt;program's
behavior in terms of regularities and patterns to provide &lt;br/&gt;insights
into the design of next-generation hardware prediction &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms.
Inspired by DNA discovery tools, the research adopts &lt;br/&gt;algorithms used
in string processing, compression and bioinformatics, &lt;br/&gt;in order to
summarize applications' dynamic data reference and branch &lt;br/&gt;outcome
behaviors. The findings from the methods and tools developed &lt;br/&gt;in this
project will have a big impact on the design and efficiency of future
&lt;br/&gt;hardware components. The PI will collaborate with industry partners
to further &lt;br/&gt;increase the broader impact. The research will engage
graduate and &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students and promote the participation of
&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.
