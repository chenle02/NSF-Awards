ABSTRACT OPP-9615312 SMETHIE, WILLIAM LAMONT-DOHERTY EARTH OBSERVATORY COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY The PI proposes to measure the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) content of
water samples taken in the Arctic Ocean on a German research ship in 1995. The
analyses will be used to determine the amount of time that has passed since the
water at different water depths was at the ocean surface in continental shelf
regions. This technique not only reveals the time that it takes for water to
sink and spread through the Arctic Ocean but also reveals pathways for currents
in which the CFCs are carried. The results of this study will yield definitive
information on water-mass exchanges in the Arctic Ocean that are responsible for
dissemination of pollutants and provide evidence of current patterns that may
have changed in response to global climate change since the current patterns
were previously determined. There is increasing evidence that current patterns
have changed in the past decade and this study will add important new
information to those preliminary results.
