This award will support attendance by students and postdocs affiliated with US
institutions at the upcoming thematic trimester on Semantics of proofs and
certified mathematics at the Institut Henri Poincare in Paris. The thematic
trimester will run from April 22, 2014 until July 11, 2014. The purpose of this
thematic trimester is to provide a forum for the extended community of
researchers and students in computer science and mathematics interested in proof
assistants, and more generally, in the mathematics of formal proofs. Supporting
student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very
important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next
generation of researchers in this important research area.
