Many elementary school teachers do not feel comfortable teaching physical
science using inquiry-based methods and do not have the required background to
present science as agender-neutral activity that relates to the every-day lives
of both male and female students. This is primarily a result of their university
training. The work proposed here would result in a revised introductory physics
curriculum for pre-service teachers, particularly those at institutions
employing the quarter system. The curriculum is to be developed as a series of
hands-on activities and exploration/research projects, and will include
historical and current biographical material on scientists of both sexes and a
variety of racial backgrounds. The activities will focus on areas, such as
health and the environment, that have been shown to be of concern to students,
particularly female students. Effectiveness of the curriculum for both male and
female students will be tested in the classroom and results will be disseminated
in the literature and through electronic media. A final version of the
curriculum will be made available for general adoption through a publisher.
