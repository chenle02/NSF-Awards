The Ghana Grid Computing School will be held at Kwame Nkrunah University of
Science and Technology (KNUST) in Kumasi, Ghana, August 6-8, 2012. The school
will be led by DOSAR, the Distributed Organization of Scientific and Academic
Research, which has partnered successfully in the past with institutions in
Brazil and South Africa to establish customized grid sites and conduct tutorials
on grid applications and operation. The school program will be aimed primarily
at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of university
studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. This school
will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists to
interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form
collaborations and partnerships in the domain of Grid Computing, which is
central to the analysis of several large-scale experiments with world-wide
collaborations, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva,
Switzerland. The school will make use of Open Science Grid computing software
infrastructure that has been developed with U.S. funding agency support
(including NSF: PHY/PIF and OCI. The grid computing technology harnesses
available computing resources and can be immediately used for other areas of
scientific research and education, in addition to a wide range of sectors in
society as a whole. The program is supported jointly by NSF Division of Physics,
through its programs in Elementary Particle Physics Experiment and Education and
Interdisciplinary Research, and the NSF Office of International Science and
Engineering through its Global Venture Fund.
