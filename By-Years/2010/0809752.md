In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Robin Hochstrasser of the University of
Pennsylvania, together with his post-doctoral fellows, graduate, and
undergraduate students, will develop dual-frequency, two-dimensional infrared
spectroscopic methods to investigate the correlated molecular motions of
solvated molecules, molecular ions and their associated water molecules. The
results from these experiments will shed light on how liquid water behaves, at
the molecular level -- an important fundamental question that has profound
implications in a number of fields, wherever water is the solvent.

Besides the broader scientific impact of the research outlined above, the young
researchers working with Prof. Hochstrasser receive outstanding training in
cutting-edge non-linear optical methods applied to a broad array of problems --
from fundamental physical chemistry to biology. Many Hochstrasser alumni may be
found at major research universities across the country and around the world.
