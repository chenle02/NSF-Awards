The goal of this research is to study crystal structures, electronic
structures, and bonding changes in metallic systems at extreme conditions of
pressures and temperatures. Calibrated pressures of over 4 million atmospheres
have been achieved in diamond anvil cell devices. This capability is combined
with laser heating techniques at synchrotron research facilities to examine
phase structure under extreme static conditions. The research includes prototype
metallic alloys from the transition metals, including molybdenum-ruthenium,
tungsten-rhenium, and titanium- aluminum to examine phase stability under
imposed high pressures and temperatures. Other metals of interest include
thorium, praseodymium, and neodymium. These studies should improve fundamental
understanding of high pressure, high temperature, and compositional effects on
phase stability and structure in metallic systems.
