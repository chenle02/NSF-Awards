This research is concerned with modeling of viscoelastic materials with fading
memory. Understanding these materials is crucial to the technology of advanced
materials engineering and process design, such as the development of high-
strength polymers and additive lubricants. The key to modeling these materials
is the development of physically correct and computationally tractable
constitutive relations. The approach is strictly interdisciplinary and has
produced analytical and computational results in nonlinear partial differential
equations that are of independent interest, and which help to explain important
physical phenomena.
