Dr. Ebrey is studying light energy transduction in the purple membrane of
Halobacterium halobium. A variety of physical techniques will be used to
investigate its only pigment, bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and its photocycle
intermediates. The purple membrane is a particularly simple biological light-
energy transducer. A great deal is known about the structure of both BR and the
purple membrane. A broad attack on the problem of how light causes the pumping
of protons across the cell membrane is planned. The key to this problem is to
understand the interrelationships between the structure of both the chromophore
and the protein part of bacteriorhodopsin, the photochemistry that occurs when
the chromophore absorbs a photon and the movement of protons across the cell
membrane. The well-defined nature of the problem of relating proton pumping
activity, the photochemistry of the purple membrane and the structure of BR make
it an extremely important area of study in biology today.***//
