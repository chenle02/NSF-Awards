This project introduces undergraduates to some advanced topics in fiber optics.
The fiber optics laboratory supported by this grant builds on an already
existing lab that was funded by industry. The enhanced lab permits students to
study modern optical fibers and connection techniques. A new course, supported
by this lab, permits students to investigate optical signal processing
techniques and components. The primary equipment that supports this lab
includes: laser diode drivers, HP pulse and function generators, fiber optic
receivers and power supplies, electro-optic modulator with driver, and a
collection of lasers and equipment accessories. This award is being matched by
an equal sum from the grantee.
