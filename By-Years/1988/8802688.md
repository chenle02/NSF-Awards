This project consists of two parts; the study of evolution inclusions and the
study of optimal controls problems governed by nonlinear evolution equations.
The first part is concerned with evolution in abstract spaces, allowing the
possibility of unbounded, multivalued and nonlinear operators. The second part
is concerned with the existence of optimal controls for various types of
problems and the properties of such controls. Optimal control problems arise
naturally in aerospace engineering, robotics, economics and other areas within
physical and social science. The second part of the project has relevance to
these problems whereas the first part of the project involves the development of
the mathematical tools used in the second part.
