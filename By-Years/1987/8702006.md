This research employs MEIS (medium energy ion scattering) combined with
channeling and blocking to describe the three- dimensional geometric surface
structure and vibrational characteristics of metal and semiconductor surfaces.
Computer simulation of scattering from the examined surfaces assists in the
structure analysis. Initial emphasis in the program is on iron, aluminum,
copper, silicon and germanium. This research provides experimental data needed
for development of theories of surface structure.
