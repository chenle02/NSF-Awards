The sale price of drugs is strongly affected by the cost of purifying the
product - i.e. separating the desired chemical from the reaction medium in which
it is produced. This project is a study of a bioreactor that combines the
production and separation stages in one unit and thus could greatly decrease
final costs to consumers. Some of this high cost is due to the increased
complexity of new drugs, often very complicated molecules which may exist in
more than one configuration (isomer). Of these, often only one configuration has
the desired properties and separating them from each other results in additional
difficulties over and above those encountered when separating different
compounds from each other. The configurations to be looked at are hollow-fiber
modules where the enzymes (the biocatalysts) are immobilized and product is
continuously removed. This has the advantage also that product concentration
does not build up which normally inhibits enzyme activity. The PIs plan to
measure enzyme activity and stereoselectivity and to operate a prototype reactor
in this Phase I work. They are well qualified to do the research and the
facilities are adequate. Funding is recommended.
