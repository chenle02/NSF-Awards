Long-span cable-stayed bridges are subject to aeroelastic effects because of the
configuration of the bridge deck cross-section and the varying velocity and
direction of the wind forces. This project will determine the aeroelastic
characteristics of various cross-section profiles and establish scale effects
for future research investigations.
