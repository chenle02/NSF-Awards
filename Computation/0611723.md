This grant provides funding for the development of novel numerical techniques to
solve computationally hard mathematical problems in combinatorial optimization
that have relevant applications in network design, sensor networks, and biology.
The developed techniques will be used to increase the scalability of problems
solved in these research areas. Specifically, the research will develop
innovative techniques to produce a specific but vital decomposition structure,
called a branch decomposition, for mathematical structures called graphs that
are used to mathematically model these problems. To this end, the developed
techniques will be compared with other exact algorithms in the literature to
validate and assess the computational efficacy of the techniques. If successful,
the results will increase the scalability and efficiency of solving the problems
of interest. Applications of these problems are in fields seeing increased
demand for services. In addition, the results can be used to solve other related
computationally hard problems in combinatorial optimization which have a wide
range of applications apart from the aforementioned applications. Thus, the
results will advance the knowledge base in combinatorial optimization and offer
new effective techniques for solving large-scale problems in the areas.
