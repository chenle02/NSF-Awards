Abstract Miller 9617181 The PI has proposed a study of time varying (TV) or
flickering flames created by imposing a modulation on the fuel flow rate, which
creates flames that pinch-off and then detach from the burner. These flames are
significantly different from non-perturbed steady flames and may offer an ideal
environment to reproducibly study chemistry-turbulence interactions which are
believed to control, ignition, extinction, and flame propagation in turbulent
reacting flows. The PI has proposed a proof-of principle experimental study in
which rapid probe sampling of a TV methane/air diffusion flame using both
tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) to measure CH4, CO2, CO and
NO concentrations, and mass spectrometry to determine the concentrations of
major flame species as well as concentrations of several products of incomplete
combustion (small hydrocarbons).
