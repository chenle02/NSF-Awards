A lesson learned time and again from major urban earthquakes is that the
management and operation of transportation facilities play significant roles in
the overall earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery. The scope of this
study is to extract lessons from the October 17, 1989 San Francisco earthquake
in terms of the transportation needs encountered and actions taken. The data
obtained will be integrated into a microcomputer-based decision tool with
capabilities in graphical network editing and zooming, traffic control and
diversion strategies, and mass transit resource management and operations.
Similar studies following the 1985 Mexico City earthquake have led to the
development of TEDSS, the Transportation Emergency Decision Support System.
TEDSS fulfills a number of crucial transportation needs pertinent to Mexico City
conditions. These include real-time network editing capabilities, emergency
vehicle dispatch, and street clean-up prioritization. The recent San Francisco
experience has shown intermediate needs such as route diversions, response to
modified travel patterns, and changes in transit demand and routes to also be
highly significant in recovery efforts and return to normalcy. These functions
will be added to TEDSS making it more adaptable to the U.S. needs and conditions
while other TEDSS functions unsuitable to U.S. conditions are deleted. In the
course of modifying TEDSS, efficient data structures, graphics modules,
heuristics algorithms, and a higher order programming language will be employed
to increase the software speed and capacity to handle larger regional street
networks.
