This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
sensor materials for detection of trace mercury in water systems, based on a
patent-pending technique licensed by MetalloSensors. This technique at its
current stage provides both high sensitivity (with detection limit as low as in
sub ppb) and selectivity (against other common coexisting metal ions),
demonstrating promise for future development into portable, easy-to-use devices
for onsite water monitoring of mercury. It is the goal of this Phase I project
to develop the new generation of sensor molecules that are suited for water
assays, while still maintaining the unique sensing features as achieved for the
current version of sensors. These new molecules will be incorporated into a
prototype detecting device through a series of tests and optimization.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research are two-fold: first, it will
help MetalloSensors verify the technical feasibility of manufacturing cheap,
portable, easy-to-use, but accurate fluorescence-based detectors, suitable for
expedient mercury monitoring in water environments; second, the innovative
products of MetalloSensors will offer strong market competition over the
traditional bench-top instruments, which are usually expensive and complicated
to operate. A substantial, sustainable market exists for the innovative mercury
detectors as evidenced by the increasing need of water analysis and global
concern of mercury pollution. The current US market size for mercury detection
was estimated as $0.25B/year, while in China the market size can be as large as
$1.5B/year, and this figure is expected to grow significantly in the future.
