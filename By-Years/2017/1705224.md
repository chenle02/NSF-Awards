This research project investigates the possibility of control of high-energy and
high-power lasers using mirrors and other optics created with plasmas. Continued
advances in laser science have enabled the development of more energetic and
more powerful lasers that can provide unprecedented access to ultrafast time
scales and to temperatures and pressures once reserved for the Sun. The utility
of these lasers is limited by conventional laser optics, typically made of
glass, which break down under high incident laser energy flux. In order to
support high-energy lasers using conventional materials, special large-aperture
optics are required to reduce the energy per unit area. The spatial limitations,
complexity, and costs associated with such optics are a roadblock to the
development and deployment of high-energy and high-peak-power lasers. Plasma-
based optical devices offer an alternative to the conventional optics because
they are not limited by material breakdown. The laser and x-ray technology
enabled by plasma-based optical devices would be used in a wide range of applied
research from materials science to biology to
medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of plasma-based photonic devices from
proof-of-principle concepts to an enabling technology for next-generation lasers
requires improved understanding of their performance capabilities and
limitations. The highest-level objective of this research project is to
understand the plasma physics of photonic devices by demonstrating and fully
characterizing ellipsoidal plasma mirrors (EPMs) for implementation in kilojoule
(kJ)-class laser systems to produce high-quality laser pulses with modified
temporal durations, increased laser contrast, and controllable focusing
geometry. This work will include a series of experiments with detailed
measurements of both the EPM performance and its effect on the laser properties.
The advantage of the EPM technology is that it can be employed in existing
lasers systems to increase their performance without having to modify the laser
infrastructure. EPMs are an excellent option to control the focusing of
ultrashort-pulse (&lt; 100 fs), kJ-class lasers and could enable the high
intensities necessary to explore emerging high-field scientific areas such as
quantum electrodynamics and attosecond science. This award to support an
undergraduate student is made under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma
Science and Engineering and is complementary to a DOE award made under the joint
program.
