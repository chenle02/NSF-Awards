Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans has helped improve our
understanding of the neuroanatomical organization of behavior. Unfortunately,
fMRI in animal studies has not kept pace with human work. Experiments are
limited because animals must be anesthetized to prevent motion artifacts,
precluding most studies involving neuroimaging of brain activity during
behavior. Since the level of arousal is inextricably linked to behavior, the use
of awake animals will produce a clearer understanding of the neural circuitries
underlying behavioral responses to different sensory modalities like olfactory
and visual stimulation. This proposal will develop and test a new head and body
holder for performing fMRI in fully conscious animals. Using this non-invasive
method of imaging brain activity, it will be possible to perform developmental
fMRI studies in animal models.
