Microdialysis, which is used for brain recording technique, requires the
analysis of neurochemical molecules. The micro-fluidics neurochemical analyzer
that will be developed will enhance brain and spinal cord recordings with
microdialysis by rapidly quantifying multiple neurochemicals with greatly
reduced cost and complexity. The instrument, after optimization, is expected to
measure neurochemicals such as glutamate, choline, acetylcholine, GABA, glucose
and lactate in samples collected from the brain and spinal cord. The resulting
inline detectors, coupled to a modern computer-instrument, are expected to have
a time resolution of one measurement per second, detecting biologically-relevant
levels of neurochemicals. The new analyzer will significantly impact
neurosciences, where large numbers of scientists are limited in their use of
microdialysis to study the temporal properties of neurotransmission in the brain
by the current analytical methodology: A simple literature search yields more
than 12,000 articles identified by the term brain microdialysis. The new
instrument will have increased time resolution, enhanced sensitivity, rapid
sample throughput and lower cost of operation and utilization than current
equipment. All of these factors will contribute to an instrument that will be
widely adopted to accelerate the efforts of biological researchers and
clinicians. Demonstrations related to chemical recordings will be used in
several outreach programs for K-12 educational ventures in Kentucky. For more
