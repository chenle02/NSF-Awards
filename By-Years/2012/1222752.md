This ISE award addresses the issue of disparity amongst media meteorologists in
their perspective on climate change. Since the media has considerable impact on
the public, this disparity of perspective is extraordinarily significant. One
common factor in this issue is the education of these individuals at the
undergraduate level. While there may be additional factors influencing these
perspectives, this project will determine if the variation in coursework is
responsible for the apparent disparity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This group of
researchers will interview media meteorologists, analyze the education provided
at the 126 institutions that produce the meteorologists, and hold workshops that
include media personnel, College faculty, and the public. From these efforts and
data, the research team hopes to determine the impact that undergraduate
education has on the media meteorologist?s perspectives.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative effort between 2 institutions,
Bentley College and Plymouth State University. The focus of this pilot effort
will be the New England area.
