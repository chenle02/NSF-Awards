The requested XL-L analytical ultracentrifuge will be utilized for five
distinct but interrelated activities encompassing both research and education.
(1) The Center will provide a significantly enhanced resource to be used by both
Department of Biochemistry and other institutional faculty to conduct NSF/NIH
supported research. (2) The Center will work closely with institutional faculty
to generate preliminary data for continuing or new grant proposals. (3) The
Center will develop collaborations with researchers outside the University of
Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio to allow them to perform key
analytical ultracentrifugation experiments that otherwise would not be possible
due to the lack of available instrumentation. (4) The Center will develop public
domain software for the XL-I based on the method of van Holde and Weischet that
permits determination of diffusioncorrected sedimentation coefficient
distributions. This analysis method allows one to rigorously characterize
supramolecular assemblies whose solution-state behavior is too vomplex to allow
characterization by standard methods such as gel; filtration, gel
electrophoresis or density gradient ultracentrifugation. (5) The Center will
vigorously promote analytical ultracentrifugation education at both the
institutional and national levels.
