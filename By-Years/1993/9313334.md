9313334 Sherman Research and research training activities are integral to the
success of the psychology faculty and students at St. Olaf College. The
Department of Psychology is experiencing an increase in student demand in
cognitive science, neuroscience and animal behavior research. Holland Hall, home
to the psychology department, was constructed in 1924 as the college's first
science building and was last renovated in 1970. Laboratories designed twenty
years ago no longer meet the needs of the current discipline. This award will
provide funding for the modernization of psychology research laboratories at St.
Olaf College. The laboratories that will be affected by the renovations involve
the areas of: perception, neuroscience, operant conditioning, computation,
psychophysiology and two support rooms. The renovations will rectify problems by
configuring laboratory space, making it accessible to persons with disabilities;
providing sound attenuated and electrical shielding where necessary, and
correcting plumbing, ventilation and climate control systems. This modernization
will significantly improve the infrastructure required for individual faculty,
collaborative, and undergraduate research and research training in the
Psychology department at St. Olaf. ***
