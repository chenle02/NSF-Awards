The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) is convening a major international
symposium in tropical studies in June 1988 to celebrate the Silver Anniversary
of its founding. The symposium will last one week and will consist of a North
American segment and a second part in Costa Rica where most OTS field activities
have historically been located. Appropriately, the North American part of the
symposium will be hosted by the University of Miami where OTS was founded in
1963. The unifying theme of the U.S. portion of the symposium will be Resource
Availability and the Structure and Functioning of Tropical Ecosystems. Six
plenary sessions will address the following topics: I. Soil fertility, nutrient
cycling, and the decomposer food web; II. Resource availability and plant
community structure; III. Resource availability and plant-herbivore
interactions; IV. Resource availability and food-web structure; V. Resource
availability and muturalisms; VI. Resource availability and the conservation of
biotic diversity in the tropics. The Costa Rican sessions will include:
Addresses from representatives of OTS and from the government of Costa Rica,
awards to winners of contests with tropical conservation themes, a series of
presentations on research, sustainable use and conservation issues and a series
of field trips to areas of biotic interest. The organizers for this symposium
have done a truly excellent job that will make the OTS 25th anniversary
observance a memorable scientific event. The Programs of the Division of Biotic
Systems and Resources take pride in recommending funding.
