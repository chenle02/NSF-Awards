Lupton 9730431 Funds are provided to analyze helium isotope samples collected
along two meridional hydrographic sections in the Pacific as part of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment and make the data available to the community. The
samples will be analyzed for their helium isotope ratios and for 4He
concentration using a special mass spectrometer. The helium measurements will be
useful in determining what the deep circulation patterns are and how consistent
they are with other analyses and model results.
