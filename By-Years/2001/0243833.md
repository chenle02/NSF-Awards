SUNY-Buffalo establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
with a research focus on the production, characterization and application of
nanostructured semiconductors. Twelve students are recruited nationwide every
year for a ten-week interdisciplinary summer research experience. The REU Site
involves faculty mentors from the Chemical Engineering, Physics, Electrical
Engineering and Chemistry Departments at SUNY-Buffalo. Students will participate
in research projects within the areas of synthesis, characterization, modeling
and applications of semiconductor nanostructures. Undergraduates also attend
scientific and professional development seminars, a lecture series on research
ethics, and participate in visits to high tech industries in the area and in
organized social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
