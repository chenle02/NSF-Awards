The Polypodiaceae is one of the largest families of homosporous ferns and in the
New World is represented by the single tribe Polypodieae. About 90% of the
species in the tribe occur in the neotropics where they are a conspicuous
component of the epiphytic flora. Despite this concentration of species in the
tropics, biosystematic studies within the tribe have focused only on the
temperate zone species in the genus Polypodium. Graduate student Elisabeth
Andrews, under the direction of faculty advisor Christopher Haufler, will apply
analytical techniques that have proven successful in studies of Polypodium to a
group of closely related tropical species. Morphological and molecular data will
be combined in distinguishing species and in resolving phylogenetic or
genealogical relationships within the Pleopeltis complex, a group of 15 simple-
leaved species. Fieldwork in Jamaica and Costa Rica will provide plant material
for cultivation, for chromosomal, isozymic (protein), and chloroplast DNA
analyses. The anticipated research will complete the first biosystematic study
of a group of epiphytic ferns, which integrates molecular and morphological
data, and as such it may serve as a foundation for future studies within the
predominantly epiphytic Polypodiaceae.
