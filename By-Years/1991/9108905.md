Dr. Hill proposes to investigate the structure of messenger RNA (mRNA) while it
is bound to the ribosome. Although significant progress has been made in
understanding the details of transfer RNA (tRNA) interaction with the ribosome,
the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome remains obscure. Yet, to understand
how mRNA interacts with the ribosome, tRNA and other factors involved in
translation is critical. In this proposal, Dr. Hill outlines methods by which
this interaction can be studies using short, complementary DNA oligomers. The
results should indicate where structural changes occur in the mRNA upon binding
to the ribosome. The path of the mRNA through the ribosome will be mapped. In
addition, a collaborative project in which short DNA oligomers are used to place
undeca-gold clusters in ribosome crystals is outlined.//
