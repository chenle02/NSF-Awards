This dissertation investigates how Beirut's locally based ethnic and religious
factionalism affects the plans for urban reconstruction in the wake of the
Lebanese civil war. Global and national elites have championed plans for a new
modern commercial city but now have to negotiate with previously subordinated
ethnic groups who seized neighborhood power bases during the war. Urban
reconstruction is therefore shaped by struggles between centralization and
decentralization, elite and subordinate groups, global and local economics. The
process in Beirut is expected to reflect similar conflicts in multi-ethnic
cities around the world. Archival newspaper data will supplement qualitative
field work and interviews that have already been completed.
