The project aims to improve the robustness of XML-based software systems using
static typing. The primary goal is the design, formal analysis, and
implementation of a new programming language called Xtatic-- a lightweight and
completely inter-operatable extension of a mainstream object-oriented language,
with native support for statically checked XLM
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key technology underlying the project is
REGULAR EXPRESSION TYPES. The basic constructors of regular expression types (
union, concatenation, repetition, etc.) are similiar to those of existing XML
schema formalisms. In a language with regular expression types, however, XML
trees become built-in values of the language and the static analysis of the
shapes of built-in value of the language and the static analysis of the shapes
of trees that may appear at run time ( as values of variables, parameters to
methods, result of complex expressions, or structued messages sent across the
network)becomes part of the ordinary work of typechecking.
