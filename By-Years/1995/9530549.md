This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Minnesota at Duluth
acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) Creation of New Carbon-Carbon
Bonds, (2) Halocyclopropyl Ether Fragmentation Applied to the Development of a
Substituted Acrolein Anion Synthon, (3) Chemistry of Polyvalent Iodine, and (4)
The Regiochemistry of the Hydroboration of 1-Aryl-1-Propenes. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
