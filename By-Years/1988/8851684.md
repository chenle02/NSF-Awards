Minority and disadvantaged students are learning microanalysis theory and
techniques and modern scientific research methods. Objectives include:
integrating a gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer - data system (GC-MS) into a
microscale organic laboratory; using GC-MS and pyrolysis for an instrumental
analysis course; and developing two novel advanced courses on "Methods of
Scientific Research." Innovative projects are being used in the use of
antibodies for biochemical analysis using pyrolysis GC-MS and the analysis of
actual "crack" samples by pyrolysis GC-MS. Lab writeups and videotapes of the
new experiments and instrument use are being prepared. Mastery of
microanalytical techniques, research methods and computer skills is increasing
the successful program completion by these students. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
