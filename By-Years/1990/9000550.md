This project will develop analytical techniques and software for advanced
processing and analysis of SeaMARC II side-scan images of the seafloor. These
techniques will preserve the quantitative nature of the backscatter data and
facilitate co- registration between the bathymetric and backscatter data. Data
acquired over the East Pacific Ridge between 13 and 15 degrees north will be
analyzed.
