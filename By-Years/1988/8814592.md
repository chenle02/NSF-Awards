This grant supports a group of four physicists from Vanderbilt University for
work on several Fermilab experiments and for design and prototype work on the
neutrino astronomy experiment DUMAND (Deep Underwater Muon and Neutrino
Detector). The Fermilab experiments are: E743, a study of charmed hadron
production; and E683, a study of jets produced by high energy photons. One of
the Fermilab experiments uses high energy particles to create and study some of
the heavier and more unusual quarks--the quarks which carry the characteristic
called "charm". Another experiment directs high energy photons at protons;
careful study of the "jets" of particles produced in some of the interactions
will reveal some of the characteristics of the "gluon" particle, the quantum of
the force field which holds protons, neutrons and nuclei together. The work on
DUMAND is for a proposed detector for observation of ultra-high energy neutrinos
from astrophysical sources.
