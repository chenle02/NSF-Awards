ECS-9702320 Braun Research equipment will be purchased which will allow the PI
to incorporate semiconducting polymer research and educational activities into
the undergraduate curriculum at Cal Poly State University. The research and
educational activities to be anabled will contribute to the understanding
necessary to design more efficient polymer Light Emitting Diodes and to enable
high resolution matrix applications.
