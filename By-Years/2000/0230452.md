This award supports a study of the chemical composition of air in the snow layer
(firn) in a region of "megadunes" near Vostok station, Antarctica. It will test
the hypothesis that a deep "convective zone" of vigorous wind-driven mixing can
prevent gas fractionation in the upper one-third of the polar firn layer. In the
megadunes, ultralow snow accumulation rates lead to structural changes (large
grains, pipes, and cracks) that make the permeability of firn to air movement
orders of magnitude higher than normal. The unknown thickness of the convective
zone has hampered the interpretation of ice core 15N/14N and 40Ar/36Ar ratios as
indicators of past firn thickness, which is a key constraint on the climatically
important variables of temperature, accumulation rate, and gas age-ice age
difference. Studying this "extreme end-member" example will better define the
role of the convective zone in gas reconstructions. This study will pump air
from a profile of ~20 depths in the firn, to definitively test for the presence
of a convective zone based on the fit of observed 15 N/14N and 40Ar/36Ar to a
molecular- and eddy-diffusion model. Permeability measurements on the core and
2-D air flow modeling (in collaboration with M. Albert) will permit a more
physically realistic interpretation of the isotope data and will relate mixing
vigor to air velocities. A new proxy indicator of convective zone thickness will
be tested on firn and ice core bubble air, based on the principle that isotopes
of slow-diffusing heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) should be more affected by
convection than isotopes of fast-diffusing N2 . These tools will be applied to a
test of the hypothesis that the megadunes and a deep convective zone existed at
the Vostok site during glacial periods, which would explain the anomalously low
15N/14N and 40Ar/36Ar in the Vostok ice core glacial periods. The broader
impacts of this work include 1) clarification of phase relationships of
greenhouse gases and temperature in ice core records, with implications for
understanding of past and future climates, 2) education of one graduate student,
and 3) building of collaborative relationships with five investigators.
