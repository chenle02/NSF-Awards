In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Regitze Vold will examine spin relaxation and molecular dynamics in
solid and semisolid systems. NMR pulse techniques, lineshape simulation
programs, and relaxation theory developed under previous NSF funding will be
extended and applied to molecular dynamic processes, including electron- and
proton-transfer reactions. Paramagnetic inorganic and bioinorganic compounds
relevant to the dynamics of electron transfer and spin-crossover processes will
be studied with deuterium quadrupole echo and double quantum lineshapes. The
location, ordering, and dynamics of ubiquinone in oriented and unoriented
membrane model systems will be determined, as well as the dynamics of trapped
alkanes and carboxylic acids and amidines. %%% The wide variety of experiments
undertaken in this project will help explain how molecular and lattice dynamics
in condensed phase materials affect phenomena in transition metal complexes,
bimetallic compounds, metalloproteins, such as simple iron porphyrins, and the
coenzyme ubiquinone. These will help elucidate diverse mechanisms such as
electron transfer between hemes, oxidative phosphorylation in inner
mitochondrial membrane, and photosynthesis and the respiratory chain in
mitochondria.
