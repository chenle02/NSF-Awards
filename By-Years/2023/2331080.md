The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
the energy efficiency and carbon footprint of distillation facilities to
facilitate decarbonization in chemical and refining industries, the top two
energy use processing industries consuming almost half of the U.S. manufacturing
sectorâ€™s primary energy and emitting half of its greenhouse gases. By de-risking
distillation system operation at its optimal operating region, this software
tool is expected to reduce energy requirement and greenhouse gas emissions. Some
of the well-known industrial processes that benefit from this software tool
include crude oil fractionation, natural gas separation, amine regeneration from
carbon dioxide capture, air separation, liquors production, etc. Furthermore, by
reducing operating costs, improving production throughput, and reducing safety
risks, this software tool enhances the economic competitiveness of U.S. chemical
plants and refineries, and improves health, safety, and environmental wellness
of nearby communities. The commercialization of this software will also help
train the next-generation workforce in chemical and refining industries,
including plant operators, process engineers, and plant managers, to use digital
tools for plant data analytics.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a data analytics technology
for real-time process monitoring and fault diagnosis of industrial distillation
systems. By strategically learning from historical operating data, this software
tool enables online monitoring of multiple nonparametric, heterogeneous process
data streams continuously produced from sensors, as well as accurate fault
classification from various possible fault scenarios. This is accomplished by
holistic integration of online process monitoring and fault diagnosis in a new
hierarchical architecture. Compared to existing general purpose process
monitoring tools that attempt to accomplish both tasks altogether, this
hierarchical architecture offers superior fault detection and diagnosis
performance in terms of fault detection speed, fault classification accuracy,
and robustness to handle multiple plant operation scenarios. This smart
distillation monitoring software can also be seamlessly integrated with existing
plant control and supervisory systems already in place, which is favorable for
retrofitting purposes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
