0211625 Parlange The purpose of the research is to address questions on the
particle transport from the World Trade Center (WTC) Site through the deployment
of state-of-the-art instrumentation to measure the emission and resuspension of
particles into the atmosphere It is planned to conduct the study over a ten-day
intensive field observation period at the WTC site and the surrounding region of
the greater New York City area to measure the flux of particles from the site
and the vertical and horizontal extent of the aerosol plume. &lt;br/&gt;At the
site, a combination of turbulence sensors, including Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV), Holographic PIV and sonic anemometers mounted on a telescopic profiling
tower to continually measure the shear stress and the concentration and flux
profiles of p[articles from the surface up to 10 m. above the site.&lt;br/&gt;A
scanning elastic lidar system will be deployed to measure at high resolution
(1.5 m.) the relative concentration of particles in the lower atmosphere (range
up to 7 km.). The lidar will be deployed both near the site and at sites to be
identified in the greater NYC area.&lt;br/&gt;The lidar system will be
calibrated using the concentration measurements obtained from the PIV
systems.&lt;br/&gt;An analysis of the field data collected will be conducted to
identify relationships between weather conditions (e.g., wind shear stress,
sensible heat flux) and the magnitude of the surface flux of particles and the
extent of the transport into the atmosphere. *** &lt;br/&gt;
