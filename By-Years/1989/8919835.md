Professor John Dahler is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the kinetic theory of polymers,
suspensions, and multicomponent solutions. This research has important
implications for the design of polymeric materials with desired physical
properties. Professor Dahler will perform research in the following areas: 1)
dynamics of polymers and macromolecular solutions; 2) nonequilibrium
thermodynamics of multicomponent solutions; 3) charged particle transport
through amorphous and semi-ordered macromolecular media; 4) kinetic theory of
rod-polymer solutions; 5) solutions of bent, broken and flexible rods; and 6)
the flow properties of suspensions of ferromagnetic particles. In each of these
areas of research theoretical tools will be developed which will be capable of
accounting for previously conducted experiments or of making predictions that
will guide and stimulate future experimental studies.
