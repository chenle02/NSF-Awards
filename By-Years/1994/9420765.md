This proposal aims to develop theories for a better understanding of the
observational results of the ionospheric HF heating experiments, and thus for
leading a better planning of future heating experiments. The work will focus on:
(1) the role of secondary parametric instability processes together with
nonlinear scattering processes on the generation of secondary stimulated EM
emissions (SEEs), (2) generation of ELF/VLF waves by thermal instabilities
excited in heater-modulated electrojet, (3) new spectral features of plasma
lines enhanced by obliquely incident HF heater, and (4) physical process
responsible for the generation of energetic electrons in the context of weak
turbulence theory.***
