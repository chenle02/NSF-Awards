This Science in Developing Countries award will support an international
workshop on Galeras Volcanic Complex, Colombia, to be held in Pasto, Colombia in
August 1992. Organizers are Stanley Williams and Marta Lucia Calvache V. of
Arizona State University and Jaime Romero L. of the Observatorio Volcanologico
de Colombia-Sur in Pasto, Colombia. The workshop aims to synthesize state-of-
the- art knowledge concerning Galeras, produce a preliminary working model of
the volcanic system, and plan future research collaboration. During the last
three years, seismic activity at Galeras has increased significantly. The
researchers' prior work on the volcano's recent geology suggests that an
explosive eruption is likely. In this workshop, participants will design new
dimensions to ongoing research programs at Galeras and try to mitigate potential
hazards by increasing basic knowledge before a disaster. If the eruption occurs
before the workshop, the organizers will use it to integrate results and direct
continuing research. Both the U.S. and Latin American participants will benefit
from a timely exchange of information and from the opportunity to develop future
collaborative projects.
