This grant funds a workshop that will bring together invited participants from
both the software design community and the general design community aimed at
improving out understanding of how software designers tackle early design
problems, as formed through a broad range of perspectives including problem
solving strategies, representations, communication patterns and language use,
and different forms of knowledge that are applied. Expert designers will be
videotaped to capture how they think, apply knowledge, make decisions and
communicate. The grant will fund the videotaping sessions, transcription of the
videotapes, and publication. At a subsequent workshop, participants will submit
papers that analyze the videotapes/transcripts from a variety of different
perspectives, discuss these papers at the workshop, and produce an edited book
covering revised chapters and discussions. The approach to studying design is
patterned after the Delft design workshop.
