This proposed research program focuses on the relationship between race, class,
and public opinion. It addresses the issues of black intragroup cohesiveness and
black/white differences in general attitudes and values. The first phase
examines the general attitudes, values, and opinions expressed by black
Americans and the extent to which class cleavages can account for any existing
intraracial differences. The second phase will explore interracial differences
(black/white) focusing on class- based explanations. Data come from the NSF-
supported General Social Surveys from 1982 and 1987. The PI will contrast
Myrdal's thesis that blacks lack intragroup diversity with Wilson's contention
that emerging class cleavages among blacks and the increasing social isolation
of lower class blacks have spawned measurable intraracial differences on a
variety of attitudes and opinions.
