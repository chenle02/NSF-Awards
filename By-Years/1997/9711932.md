9711932 Swift This project is to investigate passive polarimetric remote sensing
of the ocean surface wind direction and speed, and to compare this technique to
scatterometry. A rich data set will be analyzed to 1) develop an empirical model
describing the radiative Stokes parameters dependence on wind, 2) perform a
Fourier analysis to characterize the Stokes parameters; 3) compare the results
with backscatter signatures, 4) model the physical processes contributing to the
response, and 5) evaluate the potential of passive polarimetry for satellite-
based sensing of the ocean surface wind vector.
