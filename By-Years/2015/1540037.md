This collaborative project will support the planning activities for adding two
new sites to the existing NSF I/UCRC Center for Surveillance Research (CSR),
which is currently composed of Wright State University and Ohio State University
(both of which are in Phase 2 effective September 2015). A successful execution
of this project will lead to addition of these two new sites to the Center for
Surveillance Research, where students and faculty will be working on industrial
relevant applied research problems that could generate US Jobs in this unique
area, and help with the industrial job placement of students working on Center
projects. The fundamental intellectual issues addressed by these new sites will
have immediate application in application domains including medical imaging,
transportation, and law enforcement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core objective of
the CSR I/UCRC center has been the development of algorithms for sensor signal
and image exploitation, and the development of means to predict the performance
and reliability of these algorithms under a variety of operating conditions.
Proposed new sites at the University of Kansas and the University of Oklahoma
will extend the center's core technologies into weather radar, waveform
optimization and spectrum usage, multi-function systems, space-based sensing,
and maritime applications.
