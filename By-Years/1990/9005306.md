We propose to investigate the formation of discordant dunite in the Trinity and
Josephine peridotites, in northern California and southern Oregon.
Quantification of the degree and nature of wall rock reaction in natural
examples is crucial. If wall rock reaction commonly has a significant effect,
then this process may be as important as melting and crystal fractionation in
the production of magmas in the mantle. We propose to test our hypothesis by
measuring major and trace element compositions of pyroxene, olivine and spinel
in carefully selected samples of dunite and host peridotite. We will analyze
individual crystals in thin section using the election and ion microprobes at
MIT and Woods Hole. Use of major and trace element data on cores of individual
mineral grains to estimate parental liquid compositions, and solution of a
series of mass balance equations for these elements, should provide a
quantitative estimate of the relative importance of crystal fractionation and
wall rock reaction in the genesis of discordant dunite.
