The research plan focuses on incorporating fundamental knowledge in
micromechanics of granular media acquired through basic research into new or
improved engineering solutions and design methodologies. The plan involves the
study of the arching mechanism of load transfer in discrete materials. This
mechanism can take place within a large field or on interaction with a solid
body. Once understood and analyzed, the formulation of this mechanism can assist
in solving numerous engineering problems of granular material/structure
interaction where empirical and/or simplified solutions are currently employed.
