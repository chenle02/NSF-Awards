Every animal with legs has to generate forces by the legs to support the weight
of the body when standing and walking. The effects of such loading are not
constant, but vary on individual legs during the step cycle, on uneven terrain,
when carrying objects, or when a leg loses its footing. To adapt to changing
loads, the nervous system adjusts the contractions of the leg muscles. Receptors
that specifically monitor forces in the limbs can potentially provide the
central nervous system with detailed data about the direction, magnitude, and
rate of change of loads to compensate by appropriate muscular control. This
project utilizes electrophysiological recordings from individual receptors in
the legs of freely walking insects. These recordings are used to analyze the
sensory encoding of force information, including the forces from body weight
loading and forces generated by limb muscles, the contribution of sensory
receptors to compensatory reactions in walking under various conditions, and the
integration of sensory signals of unloading into the timing and patterns of
muscular activation during the swing phase of walking motion. &lt;br/&gt;
Results will help develop a model for understanding how sensory inputs of
loading signals are incorporated into the control of posture and locomotion, and
will define functional connections of cellular circuits for sensorimotor
integration. More broadly, there will be an impact on understanding vertebrate
and invertebrate locomotion, on robotic locomotor control and development of
'smart' prostheses, and on opportunities for cross-disciplinary training.
