Networks of workstations have been proposed for parallel computation, but slow
and unpredictable communication has made performance worse than expected. This
project is developing a network interface that reduces the cost of sending
messages, to guarantee fast, fair, and predictable performance. The essential
idea is to provide a virtual network interface for each user process, with
registers for message buffering and with a simplified process to process
communication path. The project is investigating several design issues within
such an interface, including efficient user-level access to the interface, lazy
swapping of interface state, access control, interactions with the operating
system kernel, and network fairness. The educational portion of this project
updates the computer engineering curriculum. At the undergraduate level this
includes course material on processor architecture and pipelining. At the
graduate level a course in advanced computer architecture is being developed, to
span computer architecture from technological constraints through operating
systems requirements. In addition to course work, students will be involved in
hands-on digital design.
