This is a CAREER award which combines research and educational activities. The
goal of the research component is to use newly developed atomic-scale first-
principles approaches to address some of the most fundamental issues in
transport in molecular wires that can have impact on the development of
molecular electronics. Issues that will be studied include: (1) current-induced
forces; (2) local heating and heating dissipation; (3) shot noise; and, (4)
interference effects at the molecule-leads contact. The work will proceed in
concert with experimental studies of leading groups in the field. The goal of
the educational component is to integrate the research activities into
undergraduate and graduate education with the development of a new course:
"Career Development for Physicists." This course will give undergraduates and
graduate students an appreciation of the new career possibilities other than the
academic one. Also, it will create the tools and specific problem-solving
stategies to make the transition from student life to professional employment.
Career options in nanotechnology will be the leading theme, but the scope of the
course will be wider in range. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER award
