9706332 Stone Stress-relaxation experiments have demonstrated that many
crystalline mineral and metal systems exhibit a mechanical (rheological)
equation of state, by which it is possible to completely and uniquely specify
the dislocation creep kinetics in terms of a single state variable, which is
termed the "hardness" parameter. This state variable must be related to one or
more aspects of the deformation- induced microstructure. The PIs propose in this
research to determine a microstructural basis for the hardness parameter in
terms of statistical distributions of large numbers of dislocations and of
larger-scale structures, for example, low-angle (subgrain) boundaries generated
during transient and steady state creep. The work focuses on single-crystal Fe-
Mg silicate olivine with the ultimate goal of enhancing our ability to
accurately extrapolate laboratory creep data to geophysical problems. ***
