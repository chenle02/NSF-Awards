Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing an expanded set of
features and functionality of a mathematical visualization program,
3D-Filmstrip. Project tasks include writing appropriate documentation, not only
for the software itself but more importantly for the mathematical objects it is
used to visualize; improving the scriptability of the program, both to enhance
its ability to communicate with other running programs (e.g., web-servers,
database programs, etc.) and also to facilitate the automation of its use as a
curriculum supplement; producing additional format interchange software, so that
objects created using 3D-Filmstrip can be further processed and viewed in other
programs (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, VRML) and vice versa; and improving the
cross-platform features of the program, in particular making more of its
features available over the Web. Several pilot integrations of the program into
the mathematical sciences curriculum are taking place at various educational
levels. This work is also informing the writing of two sets of undergraduate
level "Lecture Notes" tightly coupled to 3D-Filmstrip, one on the theory of
curves and surfaces, and the second on lattice models.
