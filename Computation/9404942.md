The principal investigators and their collaborators study the development,
analysis, and applications of numerical methods for nonlinear partial
differential equations. The three main topics addressed are: (1) high resolution
methods, including shock capturing, front capturing, numerical homogenization,
and particle methods, (2) multiscale analysis applied to these and other related
problems, and (3) fast methods for linear evolution equations based on
multiscale analysis and high frequency asymptotics. Engineering and physical
applications studied include combustion, fluid dynamics, crystal growth, Stefan
problems, microwave scattering, and reacting gases. These innovative numerical
methods are used to simulate real world problems in the areas of aeronautics,
oil recovery, materials science, and environmental science. Transition to
industrial and military application is made in the above areas, as well as in
low observables, semiconductor device modelling, and shape recognition. These
methods are applicable wherever the phenomena to be studied have sharp changes
of state variables or are beyond the resolving capabilities of standard methods.
