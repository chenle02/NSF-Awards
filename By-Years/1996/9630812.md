9630812 Bailey-Serres The Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of
California, Riverside (UCR) will hold a winter symposium, entitled "A Look
Beyond Transcription: Mechanisms Determining mRNA Stability and Translation in
Plants," January 16-19, 1997. The objective of the 1997 symposium is to
facilitate the first meeting in the plant field devoted to analysis of
posttranscriptional processes from pre-mRNA processing through translation. The
symposium will highlight basic genetic mechanisms, as well as the role of
posttranscriptional control during development and in response to environment
stimuli. The basic understanding of posttranscriptional mechanisms will continue
to prove useful in the genetic engineering of regulatable transgenes in plants.
The meeting will include six sessions with five to six speakers, and two Keynote
addresses by individuals in the animal field. The presented papers will be
published. ***
