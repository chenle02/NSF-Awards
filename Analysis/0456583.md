Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations Project Abstract

Carlos E. Kenig

The proposal will be a continuation of the PI's research on the regularity of
solutions to free boundary problems, the analysis of boundary value problems
under minimal smoothness conditions, the development of Liouville type theorems
for viscous conservation laws, the development of techniques from Fourier
analysis to study qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions of
nonlinear dispersive equations and the use of quantitative unique continuation
methods to study Anderson localization and the inverse problem in electrical
impedance tomography.

These partial differential equations arise in quantum mechanical models, fluid
mechanics and tomography theory amongst other areas so the analysis of these
equations may have many applications.
