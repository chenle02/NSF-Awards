The objective of this program is to explore a new class of spectrum filters that
can increase the energy efficiency of the LCD displays and potentially energy-
harvesting display media. Collaborating with industry will allow large area
prototype to be fabricated and evaluted for display applications. &lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit is to exploit resonance effect of nanophotonic elements for
energy efficiency spectrum filtering, and can be made compatible with LCD
operation. Non-transmitted light can be recycled. An energy harvesting scheme is
also proposed by integrating photovoltaic function into the display color
filters that can harvest the ambient light and/or the backlight energy. The
metal wire grid acting as transparent electrode provide multiple functions in
such photovoltaic-integrated display system. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are
to develop transformative new technology and education program that will benefit
the flat panel display and photovoltaics fields. Technologies that can provide
significantly improved energy efficiency are in high demand in our world today.
The proposed research provides a paradigm change to the spectrum filters used in
display and imaging systems, and points to a new direction to harvest energy for
mobile computing applications. The research component of this research will be
enhanced by the integration of the education and outreach components.
