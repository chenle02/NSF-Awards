This project will support a travel grant program for the 1990 International
Congress of Mathematicians to be held in August 1990 in Kyoto, Japan. The
Congress, which is held every four years, is a meeting of mathematicians from
all over the world. The American Mathematical Society will administer the
program, which will culminate in the selection of a group of mathematicians from
the United States who will receive awards providing partial support for their
travel to this meeting.
