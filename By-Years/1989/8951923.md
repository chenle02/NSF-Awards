A multi-function technical laboratory is being developed that includes
mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and electronic instrumentation equipment that
can be used as stand-alone devices for individual experiments as well as
integrated with controllers, microprocessors, and personal computers for project
team assignments. The major contribution of this project is the analysis and
operation of control systems and the associated advantage of providing hands-on
experience with equipment that provides an opportunity to apply many of the
engineering principles learned in the classroom. This project is being matched
by an amount greater than the award.
