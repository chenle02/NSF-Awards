The goal of this research is to investigate the chaotic behavior of several
important types of dynamical systems. The systems involved in the study include
several classes of complex dynamical systems, namely the exponential and the
standard family, an important class of systems arising in physics. The
investigation will also involve several related families, including area-
preserving and piecewise linear maps. Finally, the tricorn, an important new
fractal structure, will be described.
