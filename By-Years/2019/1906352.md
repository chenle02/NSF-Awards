Algebraic geometry is a field of mathematics concerned with the solutions of
(systems of) polynomial equations. These solution sets are called algebraic
varieties, and one is interested in understanding their algebraic and geometric
properties. These structures can be quite complicated and mysterious. One way to
gain some insight is to consider the variety's "Hodge structure". This is a
simpler object with a linear algebraic nature, that nonetheless often encodes a
great deal of information about the variety. The theme of this project is the
application of representation theory (a sophisticated generalization of linear
algebra) to obtain geometric insight into these
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics addressed in this project include: (a)
degenerations of Hodge structure, and their application to the study of moduli
spaces and their compactifications; (b) characteristic varieties of a variation
of Hodge structure (this program is driven by a close analogy with the Hwang-Mok
program to study Fano manifolds via their varieties of minimal rational
tangents); and (c) structure of hyperkahler cohomology as a representation of
the Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
