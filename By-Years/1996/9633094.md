9633094 Federoff This award provides support for a small workshop to consider
the implications for NSF of changes underway in how both the public and the
government view the role of research universities in society, and how, in turn,
the universities and their faculty view their roles. Although such change is
normal and healthy, increasingly the impetus for change comes from lack of
growth in support for faculty research by Federal agencies joined with increased
emphasis on teaching and changing patterns of employment among graduates. Recent
and rapid development of electronic information storage and exchange provide
another important impetus. The workshop will bring together faculty,
administrators and students to provide information about the effects of these
and other factors, and on the kinds of change in government and university
practices that are appropriate responses. ***
