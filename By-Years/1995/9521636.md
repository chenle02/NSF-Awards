9521636 Mohammed The award is for the International Conference on Intelligent
System Applications to Power Systems (ISAP), Jan. 28-Feb. 2, 1996, Orlando,
Florida. This conference is concerned with the newest research and development
on intelligent systems, application to power systems, including knowledge-based
systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and machine learning. The conference is a
prestigious one which is attended by key researchers in the field from 20-30
countries. NSF and EPRI supported previous ISAPs. The conference has a good
balance between industry and university participants - about half of the last
ISAP was from industry. Therefore, it is an important forum for academic
researchers to develop collaboration with the industry. This conference is also
multi-disciplinary since the diverse fields of intelligent systems and power
systems are involved. ***
