NSF actively promotes the inclusion of graduate students in technical
conferences and in the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the
IEEE Photonics Society requests that the Photonics Program, within the ECCS
Division of the Engineering Directorate at the NSF, sponsor a select number of
graduate students to participate in the 2016 IEEE Photonics Society Summer
Topicals Meeting Series.

The Topical Meetings of the IEEE Photonics Society are the premier conference
series for exciting, new areas in photonic science, technology, and
applications; creating the opportunity to learn about emerging fields and to
interact with the research and technology leaders in an intimate environment.
The 2016 Summer Topical Meetings are focused on "Emerging Technologies for Green
Photonics". The following five Topical meetings will be held:

1. Emerging Technology for Integrated Photonics (ETIP) 2. Space-Division
Multiplexing and Multimode Photonics (SDMP) 3. Nanowire Optoelectronics (NANO)
4. Photonic and Analog Hardware Accelerators for Energy Efficient Computing
(PAHAC) 5. Optical Wireless Communication Latest Trends in Systems and
Techniques (OWC)

NSF funding will be used to support travel, per diem, transportation and
registration costs for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students. Ten (10)
graduate and undergraduate student participants will receive funding to support
their participation in the IEEE Photonics Society 2016 Summer Topicals Meeting
Series. Additional funds will be used to support other conference related costs
such as the Student Poster Session.
