The PIs will hold a 3-day workshop in the spring of 2004 of about 30
participants to focus on quantification of N2 production via biological
denitrification. The objectives of this workshop will be: (1) to evaluate the
state of our knowledge of denitrification rates in a wide range of terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems; (2) to compare methodologies that have been adopted by
different scientific disciplines, with the expectation that collaborations
across disciplines could yield methodological advances; and (3) to chart out the
current weaknesses and the actions needed to address those weaknesses for an
improved global assessment of where, when, and how much reactive N is converted
to N2 in the biosphere. Two important considerations will be superimposed over a
matrix of ecosystem types and methodological approaches: (1) What are the
appropriate scales over which N2 production can and should be measured?; and (2)
How can models be integrated with the measurements to improve mechanistic
understanding of the processes and permit estimation of fluxes at larger spatial
scales, longer temporal scales, and across a range of forecasted scenarios? The
results of the workshop will be published as one or more synthesis papers in a
peer reviewed journal. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The boarder impacts of this
activity include an effort to direct scientific understanding of the N cycle
toward finding solutions to society's concerns about eutrophication of the
biosphere. The workshop is being organized as an integral part of the
International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), a joint project of SCOPE and IGBP. The
overall goal of the INI is to optimize nitrogen's role in sustainable food and
energy production, while minimizing negative effects on human health and the
environment. Hence, this workshop is part of an effort that has board
implications for society by contributing knowledge to future management the
global N cycle to meet objectives of both food security and environmental
quality.
