Molecular evolution is a synthetic discipline that employs the tools of
molecular biology to study patterns and processes of genetic change in
organisms. This rapidly developing field ranges from the study of viral
evolution to plant organellar evolution, human evolution, and the evolution of
specific gene families (e.g., hemoglobins and immunoglobulins). Many of these
research fields are advancing independently, and as a consequence, similar
problems are sometimes solved independently. The purpose of the UCLA-sponsored
conference on Molecular Evolution is to evaluate past accomplishments and to
stimulate coordinated research among molecular and organismal biologists. The
program presents a unique opportunity for evolutionary biologists, with their
expertise at the organismal level, and molecular biologists, with their
knowledge of biochemical techniques, to interact in a setting that facilitates
interdisciplinary exchange and stimulates new approaches to common problems. The
conference will also provide an opportunity for discussion about how an
understanding of principles of molecular evolution can be applied to global
problems in health care, agriculture, and the environment. Nearly 50 invited
speakers will participate, along with other senior investigators as well as more
than 60 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.
