What we will do: Five levels of hierarchical self-assembly will be used to
control the placement of single nanoparticles and inorganic molecules over areas
that are hundreds of microns in size. Self-assembly and enzymatic processing
steps will be used to create DNA tiles

1 and multi-tile "rafts" that have dimensions in the 4-60 nm size range. The
tiles will contain derivatization sites at known spatial locations to permit
attachment of non-DNA components. Up to six different molecules or nanoparticles
could be attached to each DNA tile. Molecular liftoff

2 will be used to direct the binding of the DNA rafts to lithographic features,
such as 30 nm lines. The dimensions of the DNA rafts are similar to the
dimensions of the lithographic features, so individual molecules that are
attached to the rafts will be placed on the surface with great control and could
be located near other lithographic structures. These capabilities would be very
useful for construction of molecular quantum-dot cellular automata circuits and
other molecular electronic devices.

Intellectual Merit: This project will: -explore hierarchical design as a tool
for creation of supramolecular complexity -extend molecular liftoff, which has
previously been used only for small inorganic molecules, to biomolecules such as
DNA. -integrate top-down and bottom-up approaches to the fabrication of
structures on the nanometer to micron size scale

Broader impact: This proposal combines detailed control over local physical
structure with ultra-high resolution nanolithography to create non-repetitive
arrays of the types required for large-scale implementation of different
architectures for molecular electronics.

3 DNA will be used as a self-assembling circuit board for active components,
which could include nanoparticles, other biomolecules, and small organic or
inorganic molecules. This method could be used to construct technologically
useful devices, such as molecular electronic field-programmable gate arrays that
are integrated with I/O structures on a silicon chip.
