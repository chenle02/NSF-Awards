This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will apply methods from combinatorics and convexity to problems in
computational algebraic geometry. A goal is to design new algebraic algorithms
for solving sparse multivariate polynomial equations. Other projects include the
study of fiber polytopes, intrinsic Grobner basis theory, hard Lefschetz theorem
for toric varieties, generalized hypergeometric functions, and geometric
invariant theory. The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award
recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's
strong potential for continued professional growth as a research mathematician
and for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
