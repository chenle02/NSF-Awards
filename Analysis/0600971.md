Harmonic Analysis and P D E

Abstract of Proposed Research Sagun Chanillo

This grant is to support research on some problems involving partial
differential equations and topics in geometry, physics and material science. One
class of problems concerns how to design a body of prescribed shape and mass,
with certain bounds on the density, that has least first eigenvalue. This is
related to certain models of composite materials. In earlier work we have proved
certain properties of the solutions of this problem and I will continue studies
on the properties of the interfaces between the different materials in the
solution. These are free boundary problems and the existing regularity theory
for such problems does not extend to these systems. Jointly with Carlos Kenig,
we intend to study some examples and analyze these models in considerable
detail. A second problem we are studying is the Plateau problem for constant
mean curvature surfaces. This is a joint project with A. Malchiodi and
continuation of our earlier work where the Dirichlet situation was analysed. Now
we are trying to understand the conformal situation.

A clear understanding of the composite membrane problem will lead to an
understanding and design of useful composite materials with important properties
for use in areas such as medicine, aeronautics and wherever light-weight and
strong materials are to be used. Our earlier work showed that one sometimes has
to build these materials by breaking the natural symmetry of the desired body,
for example to build the ubiquitous washer one needs to arrange the composite
materials non-symmetrically. The loss of symmetry has a direct bearing on the
regularity of the interface of the materials, the free boundary so to say and
this will be hopefully revealed in the current research investigation.
