The goal is to examine dynamics and phase transitions for adsorbates at high
densities and low temperatures, and under restricted dimensionality, using
pulsed NMR as a probe. The proposed research includes: studies of structure,
motions, conversion and phase-transitions in solid H2, HD and D2 at high
densities; high-pressure studies of Kr and Xe; very detailed studies of adsorbed
films of H2, HD, D2, Kr and Xe on MgO and BN substrates and in porous media;
measurements on the relaxation of dilute light impurities and on the structural
transitions they may induce.
