A comprehensive assay of the micrometeor flux using extant and new radar head-
echo measurements quantifies the amount and temporal variability of dust
deposition into the earth's middle atmosphere. The data are used to construct a
meteor input function model that will be useful to studies of ionospheric
E-region layering, sporadic-E formation, and to the communications disturbances
associated with those phenomena. Additionally, the information concerning meteor
trajectories prior to earth-encounter are important for understanding dust in
the inner solar system, planetary formation and evolution, and evolution of the
asteroid belt.
