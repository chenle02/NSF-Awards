This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in
relativistic astrophysics and general relativity. One focus is the exploration
of newly discovered conservation laws involving black holes, and their
implications for deep and poorly understood issues in quantum gravity such as
the information loss paradox discovered by Stephen Hawking. A second focus is on
tests of general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that have
been detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)
and that might be detected by future space based detectors. Theoretical studies
of sources of gravitational waves funded by this award will be useful to aid
detection of signals from black holes and other sources, and also to aid in
their interpretation. Gravitational wave studies can tell us about the nature of
gravity, properties of black holes, and properties of the early
Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the principal research topics of
this award are: (i) The development of methods to compute the gravitational
waveforms from point particles inspiralling into spinning black holes, using a
combination of analytical and numerical approaches; (ii) Generalizing the
mathematical formalism of Wald and Zoupas to develop a comprehensive description
and understanding of conservation laws involving soft hair on black holes, and
(iii) investigating the consequences of these laws for the quantum evaporation
of black holes and the ultimate fate of information that falls into black
holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
