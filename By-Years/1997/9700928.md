9700928 Leonov This grant involves cooperative research between the Department
of Polymer Engineering, The University of Akron (Akron, OH) and the Laboratory
of Rheology, Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, the Russian Academy of
Sciences (Moscow, Russia). Several fundamental problems in molecular rheology
will be investigated in the course of this work. The primary objectives of the
work are the following: Analytical and numerical studies of a self-consistent
condition for polymers with long and flexible chains. A molecular approach to
linear viscoelastic behavior of polymers using looping concept. Experimental
studies of slow relaxation processes in narrow distributed polymers. A theory of
relaxation interaction in liquid crystalline polymers using a mean field
approach to elaborate a constitutive equation for liquid crystalline polymers of
nematic type. %%% This research helps to lay the theoretical and experimental
foundations for the understanding of polymer flow and processing. ***
