0122264 Figueroa The objective of this research is to develop an improved
biological process for the treatment of wastewater with high phosphorus content.
This research focuses on improved understanding of the aerobic sequence of the
enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process by investigating aerobic
metabolism as it relates to generating storage and growth products from poly-b-
hydroxybutyrate. The specific tasks of this research are: (1) to establish and
operate a pilot-scale sequencing batch reactor to achieve phosphorus removal via
a stable, enriched community of phosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), (2) to
complete a series of batch reactor radioactive carbon tracer studies involving
isolation of intracellular components for PAOs during the anaerobic/aerobic EBPR
process cycle, (3) to perform mass balances on individual samples from the
tracer studies, and (4) to test the applicability of a proposed metabolic
mechanism involved in the EBPR process. ***
