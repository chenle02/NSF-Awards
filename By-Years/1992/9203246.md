This research concerns string equations in mathematical physics and integrable
systems. In particular, the research concerns the solutions of partial
differential equations related to quantum field theory and string theory that
may have solutions representable as special types of Feynman type integrals. The
project will also concern isopectral manifolds of differential operators and
boundaries. In particular, what is the behavior of the differential operators
and how does one regularize the differential operators near their blow-up locus.
This research is in the general area of geometric analysis and mathematical
physics and illustrates the exciting interaction between mathematics and
physics, especially in quantum field theory and string theory where there is a
circle of ideas involving integrable systems, module space, algebras, and matrix
models.
