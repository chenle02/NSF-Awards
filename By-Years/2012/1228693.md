Feedback is one of the most potent instruments of instruction; it informs
students where to focus their efforts, helps them gauge their progress,
challenges them to develop their skills, and confirms their abilities when they
succeed. However, the feedback needs to be accurate and valid for those benefits
to occur. Research by Kent Harber (Rutgers University Newark) and others suggest
that this may not be the case for minority learners. There is a "positive
feedback bias" in the tendency of European-American (White) individuals to
provide more praise and less criticism to African American, Latino, and other
minority learners than to White learners for work of equal merit. The positive
feedback bias appears to be robust and pervasive. It is communicated both in
writing and in direct, face-to-face, conversations; it has been displayed by
college students, teacher trainees, and public school teachers; and it has been
demonstrated in the American West Coast, the Midwest, and the East Coast. The
potential costs of such a bias are striking. If feedback is less critical when
directed at minorities, it can mislead effort, undermine motivation, and erode
trust. If minority students are chronically receiving positively biased
feedback, then their ability to advance as learners may be undercut. Perhaps as
important, their faith in praise that they have genuinely earned may be
compromised.

This line of research will assess how the positive feedback bias, and the
motives from which it arises, influence the quality of information that Whites
supply to minorities. It specifically focuses on the nature of inter-racial
communication, the language used to provide functional feedback, and the reasons
why the language used may differ as a function of the interracial context of the
exchange. By studying how positive feedback is expressed in open-ended
communication, this project may reveal how the positive feedback bias affects
minority students' learning and different potential remedies for the bias.
