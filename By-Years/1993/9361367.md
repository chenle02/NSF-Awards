9361367 Oakes An innovative technique for the polishing of polycrystalline
diamond films is described which uses a high flux, high translational energy (5
to 10 volt) atomic oxygen beam at glancing incidence to etch surface roughness.
The method operates in a reactive etchant energy range, at high flux, that is
not obtained by any other chemical or physical method. As a result, the
technique is capable of high polishing rates (0.2 micrometers/min) at low
substrate temperatures. In addition, it is non intrusive and is intrinsically
scalable for large area (1000 cm2) polishing. In a collaborative effort with
industry, efficient, high rate diamond etching with a significant degree of
surface finishing has been demonstrated. Existing polishing techniques suffer
from one or more of the following deficiencies: slow polishing rate, small
polishing areas, high substrate temperatures during polishing, the need to
aggressively handle the diamond film or substrate, and the potential for defect
and impurity incorporation into the diamond film resulting from interaction with
energetic ions. The proposed technique is capable of overcoming all of these
deficiencies. Due to diamonds superlative properties the potential commercial
applications of diamond films are extensive. In particular, polished
polycrystalline films have optical and tribological applications. Application of
diamond as a heat sink will also benefit from this technique.
