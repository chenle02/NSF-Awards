The objective of this Research Planning Grant (RPG) is to initiate the study of
multiple domination in graphs. A node in a graph G=(V,E) is said to dominate
itself and its neighbors. A subset of the vertices S is a dominating set if each
node of V is dominated by some node of S. Interest in the concept of domination
has mushroomed in the last twenty years as can be evidenced by over 500
publications on the subject. Furthermore, over 60 types of domination have been
defined and studied. No doubt one reason for this interest is its many
applications in computer science areas such as network design and analysis of
algorithms. A recent paper introduces multiple domination as a generalization of
classical domination in graphs. A set S is a k-multiple dominating set for G if
each node in V is dominated by at least k distinct nodes in S. This new concept
in which each node is in a sense redundantly dominated is a rich topic for
research and potential applications. In general, any question asked about
ordinary domination can be asked about multiple domination. This research
investigates multiple domination and develops the most promising research issues
for future study.
