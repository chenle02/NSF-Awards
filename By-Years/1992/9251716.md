This project will establish a parallel processing laboratory to provide
undergraduate students with the hands-on experience of programming in a parallel
environment and to increase their understanding of the theoretical aspects of
parallel computing through implementation and experimentation. Projects are
being created to expose the students to such issues as the coordination and
synchronization of parallel processes, resource management, load balancing, and
the related costs and tradeoffs of various architectural models and algorithmic
techniques. The laboratory will consist of a transputer-based, multi-user
parallel processing system. This system will be comprised of 64 transputers
connected to six PCs. A transputer-based system will permit the various
architectural topologies to be studied, since the interconnection structure of
the transputers can be configured to implement networks such as rings, meshes,
trees, toroids, and HyperCubes. OCCAM, a parallel-programming language designed
specifically for use with transputers, will be utilized by the students to
implement course projects. In addition, the C programming language will also be
available for use in independent studies and undergraduate research
opportunities.
