The investigator and his colleagues study a variety of packing problems. The
following five general areas are explored: (1) identification and
characterization of dense packings of nonspherical particles for a wide class
shapes in two and three space dimensions; (2) study of sphere packings of
maximal density in high Euclidean dimensions; (3) identification of low-density
jammed sphere packings in various dimensions; (4) studies of jamming on the unit
sphere in arbitrary dimensions; and (5) pursuit of improved order metrics to
characterize the degree of randomness in a packing. Important scientific
advances and outcomes are likely to emerge from the proposed research. This very
multidisciplinary project joins the applied mathematics, statistical and
condensed-matter physics, materials science, engineering, and pure mathematics
communities. Unifying these different perspectives and goals is a challenging
task, but one that offers great rewards to the scientific community in general.

Packing problems, such as how densely solid objects fill space, have fascinated
people since the dawn of civilization, and continue to intrigue scientists
because of their connection to a host of problems that arise in the physical
sciences, mathematics, engineering, and biology. While optimal packing problems
are intimately related to solid states of condensed matter, disordered sphere
packings have been employed to model the glassy state of matter. Sphere packings
in high dimensions have relevance in communications theory. The way that viruses
package DNA in protein containers is a packing problem. What are the densest
packings of spheres in dimension greater than three? What are the densest
packings of nonspherical objects in two and three dimensions? Can random
packings ever fill space more densely than ordered packings (implying disordered
or "glassy" ground states)? Can "randomness" of a packing be quantified in a
meaningful and precise manner? A greater understanding of packing problems has
implications for the synthesis of novel materials, our ability to efficiently
design communications channels to send digital signals over large distances, and
the design of new drugs, just to mention a few examples.
