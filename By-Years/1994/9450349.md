SSC-9450349 SUNY Research Foundation Albany, NY White, Denise "NSF Native
Science Foundations Summer Science Camp" The NSF Native Science Foundations
Summer Science Camp will give ownership of science and mathematics to Native
American students through summer exploration of environmental elements and
Native views of the environment. Students from the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation
at Akwesasne will take courses in Science, Mathematics, Environmental Studies,
and Writing Across the Curriculum. Classes, field studies, and visits by Native
American scientists and educators and other consultants will emphasize hands-on
experiences with practical applications of scientific and mathematical concepts.
The program has been designed in conjunction with Mohawk educators, parents, and
students. Potsdam College is the host institution of the Northern Consortium of
the State university of New York (SUNY) Native American Initiative. The summer
residential camp will be directed through the office of Native American Affairs,
within the College's office of Diversity. The Native Science Foundations Summer
Science Camp will take Mohawk 7th, 8th, and 9th grade students to the college's
Adirondack mountain campus at Star Lake for a four week exploration of Plants,
Water, Earth, and Air. ***
