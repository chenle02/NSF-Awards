Improvements and expansion in the teaching of spectrophotometry had been limited
by the small number of suitable instruments available in the Chemistry
department. Acquisition of the nine spectrophotometers removed this deficiency.
The instruments are being used by science students in a number of chemistry
courses and by non-science and education students in courses of an
interdisciplinary nature. The additional instruments are also permitting more
extensive use of spectrophotometry in experiments conducted with area high
school students and teachers. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal
sources.
