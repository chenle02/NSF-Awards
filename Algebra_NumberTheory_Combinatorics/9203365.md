Professor Silverberg will continue her work on Shimura varieties. In
particular, she plans to study adelic representations attached to points on
canonical models of arithmetic quotients of bounded symmetric domains. She also
intends to work on questions about the fields obtained by adjoining torsion
points on Abelian Varieties. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
