Wang&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807915&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; During recent years, the
energetic phase field approach has&lt;br/&gt;emerged as a successful modeling
and simulation method with many&lt;br/&gt;advantages in studying microstructure
evolutions. The idea of&lt;br/&gt;phase field methods is to introduce a set of
phase field&lt;br/&gt;variables to implicitly track the moving surfaces
of&lt;br/&gt;microstructures, which can be very complex and nonlinear.
In&lt;br/&gt;this project, the investigator and his collaborators apply
phase&lt;br/&gt;field methods to study biological microstructures,
especially&lt;br/&gt;cell membranes. The project is mainly concerned with
further&lt;br/&gt;analysis on phase field methods, and the broadening
of&lt;br/&gt;applications in studying the evolution of
biological&lt;br/&gt;microstructures for which phase field methods and
related&lt;br/&gt;concepts can be used as a basis for more convenient or
efficient&lt;br/&gt;treatments. The project includes modeling, numerical
methods,&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
investigator studies some theoretic and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;problems in phase
field methods that still remain unsolved or&lt;br/&gt;partly unsolved today,
such as asymptotic behavior of phase field&lt;br/&gt;variables (which is related
to the De Giorgi conjecture), the&lt;br/&gt;consistency of the fluid coupled
phase field model to the sharp&lt;br/&gt;interface model, topological
information retrieval formulations,&lt;br/&gt;and convergence and acceleration
of some popular algorithms. He&lt;br/&gt;also applies the theoretical results to
the modeling and&lt;br/&gt;simulation of some complex microstructure systems,
especially&lt;br/&gt;cellular adhesion and rolling in a shear flow, which can be
used&lt;br/&gt;in the study of blood flows. Cell motility is another
complex&lt;br/&gt;biological phenomenon that can be simulated using phase
field&lt;br/&gt;models. Also considered is the simulation of acto-myosin
driven&lt;br/&gt;cell oscillations, which can be applied to study cell
division&lt;br/&gt;and migration, two of the most important functions of
living&lt;br/&gt;cells. Besides simulating some observed phenomenon, phase
field&lt;br/&gt;models can also be applied to predict details of some
structures&lt;br/&gt;that are not yet fully known, such as highly folded
membranes. &lt;br/&gt;
