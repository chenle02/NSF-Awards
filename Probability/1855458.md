This project deals with large random systems, which can be typically described
as collections of particles with certain prescribed rules of interactions.
Examples are given by random stepped surfaces in three-dimensional space, random
sorting networks, six-vertex model (also known as the square ice and used to
model a thin planar layer of molecules of water). A distinguishing feature of
the studied systems is the presence of numerous exact formulas, describing the
probabilistic characteristics of the systems. The central questions concern
asymptotic properties of the systems of growing sizes, and the research aims at
exact rather than qualitative answers.

The project aims at two kinds of results. First, the new types of asymptotic
behavior lead to discoveries of connections between stochastic systems of
different origins, such as lattice models of two-dimensional statistical
mechanics, random matrices, stochastic partial differential equations, and
probability measures of asymptotic representation theory. Second, the
development of robust methods leads to the extensions of the results from the
exactly solvable cases to much wider universality classes, thus, justifying the
use of these cases for the extensive peculiar predictions, potentially reaching
the real-world applications. In particular, during the project the PI will
investigate the transition between Gaussian Free Field and Gaussian fields
solving hyperbolic SPDEs in the six-vertex model, connections between random
sorting networks and eigenvalue distributions of random matrices, and the link
between matrix elements of powers of random Hermitian matrices and the finite-
time distribution of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang SPDE.
