0134707&lt;br/&gt;Izatt&lt;br/&gt;Optical coherence tomography has matured into
a successful mesoscopic biomedical imaging technique, and is currently under
investigation for many applications in fundamental biology and clinical
medicine. Real-time imaging is particularly pertinent in medical diagnostic
situations, where it is desirable to screen large tissue regions rapidly. This
submission proposes development of a radically new concept for a mass-produced,
inherently robust, digitally addressed integrated-optic optical delay line for
optical coherence tomography. Successful demonstration of the integrated
addressable delay will lead to development of a fast, arbitrarily addressable
delay module which would serve as an enabling technology to allow for wider
application of this imaging technique.
