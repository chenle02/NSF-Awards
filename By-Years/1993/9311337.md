9311337 Scherer In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research Project in the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Scherer will
interface a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a femtosecond-pulse laser
system in order to investigate the temporal and spatial properties of atomic
structures on surfaces and at interfaces. Coherence properties of single
molecules and particles adsorbed or chemisorbed to conducting subtrates will be
measured. Pump-probe methods will be used to obtain tens of femtoseconds time
resolution of the photophysical dynamics of the adsorbate while the STM serves
as the molecule and site-specific detector of the optically induced changes in
conductivity. %%% Through the results of experiments conducted under this
research program Scherer will obtain a better understanding on a microscopic
level of the fundamental properties of molecules confined on surfaces. The
information and broader perspective obtained from these studies have the
potential for directly observing and controlling chemical processes at the
atomic level. This in turn has implications for nanoscale fabrication of
materials and other processes which occur at the interface between, for example,
a gas and a solid. ***
