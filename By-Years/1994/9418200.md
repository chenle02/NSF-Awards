9418200 Goldstein Whether or not large scale volume loss during slaty cleavage
formation is a long-standing and important problem. Geometric stain analysis
commonly concludes large volume loss, while chemical techniques generally find
no evidence for such large losses, expect over very short distances. This
project will use both approaches to deduce the role of volume loss in the
deformational history of the Taconic slate belt. A variety of strain indicators
and fossils are available, and the original composition of the shale may be
preserved adjacent to buttressing objects. Results will be widely applicable in
deformation models, restoration algorithms and in other slate terranes.
