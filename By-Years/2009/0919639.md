2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to understand how molecules in the brain help maintain stable
function during periods of change such as development and high neuronal activity
associated with learning. Alterations in neuronal structure are critical for the
function of neuronal networks and are greatly influenced by secreted factors
such as neurotrophins. One neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), enhances neuronal structure and function particularly in the
hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in learning and memory. The aim of
the project is to understand how these stimulatory effects of BDNF are counter-
balanced to maintain homeostasis. They propose that molecules induced by BDNF
such as OrphaninFQ/Nociceptin (OFQ) contribute to balancing the neurotrophin's
actions. First, using molecular manipulations to reduce levels of BDNF and OFQ
signaling, the PIs will examine whether OFQ and BDNF act in a feedback loop to
regulate neuronal structure. These experiments &lt;br/&gt;will be performed both
in hippocampal neurons in a culture dish and in slices which more closely mimic
the brain's architecture. Second, they will explore the signaling cascades
downstream of OFQ to understand the mechanism by which OFQ interacts with BDNF
and affects neuronal structure. It is expected that cells lacking OFQ signaling
will respond more dramatically to BDNF and visa versa suggesting that the two
molecules act in a feedback loop to regulate each other's function. The results
from these studies will have specific implications for mechanisms underlying
homeostasis in the central nervous system so that nothing goes awry during
development or learning and broader implications for the understanding of how
endogenous secreted molecules regulate cellular function. The proposed studies
are designed such that graduate and undergraduate students at UMDNJ-RWJ Medical
School will learn state-of-the-art techniques. The principal investigator has a
strong history of training female students from minority populations and
mentoring young women pursuing careers in science, and represents a role model
for these women who are interested in a career in research.
