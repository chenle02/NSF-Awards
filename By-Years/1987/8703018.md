This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in the general area
of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemistry. The
goal of this innovative experimental program is the development and
implementation of a technique with which electrode reactions can be spatially
mapped and the efficiency of these processes more fully understood. Professor
Engstrom and his undergraduate research students will use a microscope to
collect the image produced by a light- emitting electrode reaction, detect this
image with a position- sensitive detector, and use an imaging system to map the
activity of the electrode surface. This technique will be used to study problems
of non-uniform current densities at both micro- and macroelectrodes that plague
both electroanalysis and electroplating technologies, non-uniform current
densities in microelectrode arrays that are important to the development of
chemical sensors, microheterogeniety of electrode surfaces, and defects in
conducting polymer films. The results of this project should contribute to the
optimization of electroanalytical devices and to fundamental knowledge of
electrode processes at the microscopic level.
