9404089 Freire The research covers topics concerned with the spectrum of the
Laplacian on complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds, mainly in the case of
nonnegative curvature. Asymptotic methods are expected to give new results
concerning the spectral analysis of harmonic differential forms. The Yang-Mills
flow technique will also be studied to determine uniqueness of solutions of
partial differential equations. The research has potential applications to
mathematical physics, in particular, gauge field theory. ***
