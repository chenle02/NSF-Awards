9617751 Bangs This is a survey of the Barbados Ridge accretionaly wedge
designed to image the back of the wedge with seismic reflection profiling and to
obtain a detailed velocity model of the back of the wedge and backstop with
wide-angle reflection/refraction data recorded on OBS instruments. the goal is
to define the geometry and structure of the backstop, the subducting ocean
crust, and the back of the accretionary wedge to address mass balance, the
seismogenic zone, and other tectonic questions.
