9454715 Manning The school networking project "Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh" has
begun to create a networked educational environment in the Pittsburgh Public
Schools. The project has highlighted a number of research questions involving
the issues of student usage, community access, teacher enhancement,
institutionalization, dissemination and content. It is proposed to extend
"Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh" with the formation of a new Urban Research
Laboratory in which these questions can be thoroughly addressed. The Urban
Research Laboratory involves "Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh," the Pittsburgh
Public Schools, and a set of affiliated institutions which include vendors,
universities and other school districts. Each of the participants in the
Laboratory's activities helps to address one or more of the research questions
mentioned above. Project activities within the Urban Research Laboratory are
identified through a competitive process in the school district and are carried
out in classrooms of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. Typical projects use the
wide area network connectivity provided by "Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh" to
access remote resources or facilitate collaborations with groups outside the
school classroom. The same connectivity provides the thread which binds the
three groups which contribute to the activities of the Urban Research
Laboratory. "Common Knowledge: Pittsburgh" is itself a collaborative effort,
with technical support provided through the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,
assessment support and project management through the University of Pittsburgh,
and educational support from the Pittsburgh Public Schools.
