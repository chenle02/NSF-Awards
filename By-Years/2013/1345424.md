The Georgia Tech Digital Media program is conducting a workshop and developing a
website that fosters collaborations among researchers in the learning sciences
community who study informal learning, practitioners in STEM-related informal
learning environments (ILEs), and professional artists whose work incorporates
STEM concepts. This workshop explores how the intersection of culturally-
situated, arts-based learning (ABL), informal STEM learning, and digital media
can be leveraged to create higher interest, motivation and learning in STEM
among under-represented minorities (URMs). The workshop investigates the
potential for combining culturally-situated design tools (CSDTs), contemporary
art and crafts, and STEM concepts as a means to engage URM learners in STEM.

The primary goal of the workshop is to engage a dialog among STEM and ABL
experts, professional artists and cultural practitioners whose work integrates
STEM concepts through its content, methodology, and technological
implementation. Another goal of the workshop is to develop a professional
community that can advance understanding of the potential impacts of culturally-
situated design strategies and to present arts-based learning and research that
can extend participation and understanding of STEM to more diverse audiences.
