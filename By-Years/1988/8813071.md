This project concerns questions of existence and qualitative behavior of
solutions of systems of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations. In
particular, the development of waves and other spatial patterns will be
investigated. Systems of equations of the type considered here arise frequently
in the mathematical modelling of chemical reactions incorporating transport
processes. Also, applications may be found in population biology,
electrochemical systems and combustion theory.
