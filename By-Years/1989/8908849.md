The objectives of this project is to solve three physically important problems
in low-aspect ratio flat ship theory. These problems are 1) the calculation of
the rise and trim of a high speed vessel, 2) the performance of a stability
analysis for near optimal lift/drag hulls under time dependent perturbations and
3) the calculation of the flow past a low-aspect ratio flat ship traveling at
moderate speeds. The solution techniques for the first two problems involve an
extension of existing work by the principal investigator where mixed boundary
value problems are reformulated in terms of complex variable theory and solved
by a series expansion in terms of analytic functions using symbolic manipulation
software. These problems are mathematically interesting because of the inherent
difficulty of mixed boundary value problems and the recent developments in
symbolic computation. The third problem requires a novel apparoach that uses
matched asymptotic expansions, with the inner solution satisfying a double body
flow in each cross plane, and the outer solution corresponding to the flow past
a line of pressure sources.
