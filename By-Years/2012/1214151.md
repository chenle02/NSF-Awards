In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Diane K. Smith of San Diego State University
develops new methods to control supramolecular structure through electron
transfer. The first set of projects builds upon previous work with two hydrogen-
bond systems by exploring different means to create redox-dependence in existing
three and four hydrogen-bond homo- and heterodimers. The second set of projects
addresses the need to develop strong, selective, on/off redox-dependent binding
systems that work in aqueous solution. A completely new approach based on the
use of radical pi-dimerizations will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many
advanced applications of supramolecular chemistry will require some means to
control structure using an external signal. Electron transfer is a particularly
attractive approach because it provides a natural conduit between the nanoscopic
world of supramolecular assemblies and the microscopic realm of conventional
electronics. The new possibilities for electron transfer signaling opened up by
this research may impact a number of future technologies, including molecular
electronics, smart materials, and molecular machines. More immediately, it will
provide excellent education and training to a diverse group of undergraduate and
graduate students, many of whom are from groups under-represented in science.
