The long-term goal of this project is to understand key aspects of the post-
transcriptional modification process of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) at the
molecular level, including the basis of molecule specific RNA recognition by
modification enzymes and the functional basis for modifications within RNA
molecules. This research focuses on pseudouridine modification sites within
eukaryotic rRNA and the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs)
that introduce them. The project will explore the interaction of snoRNP proteins
with their RNA ligand, and examine the thermodynamic and structural effects of
snoRNA-mediated selection of pseudouridylation sites in functionally important
regions of the eukaryotic large subunit rRNA using biochemical methods and high
resolution NMR spectroscopy as the principal tools. Specifically, the following
topics will be addressed: (1) structural and thermodynamic studies of snoRNA-
rRNA complexes and (2) comparative structural and thermodynamic studies of the
unmodified and pseudouridyl-modified forms of the eukaryotic large subunit rRNA.
The results of these studies are directly relevant to understanding the
specificity and affinity of protein-RNA interactions and the mechanisms used by
RNA molecules to tweak local conformation and stability. These investigations
complement genetic studies of the pseudouridylation reactions catalyzed by the
snoRNPs and together provide a route to understanding the functional roles of
the most common and phylogenetically conserved RNA base modification. The
methods developed during these studies will serve as tools for structural
biologists and chemical biologists.
