Dr. Glascock will continue to operate an archaeometric center at the University
of Missouri and employ the technique of instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA) to analyze the elemental composition of archaeological materials. INAA is
a multi-elemental technique which allows the major, minor and trace elements of
a material to be determined simultaneously and with considerable accuracy and
precision. A sample is not destroyed by INAA and, as a result, the analysis can
be repeated or different analytical techniques can be applied to the same
sample. For valuable archaeological objects, this is an important consideration.
Of particular interest are potential analyses of ceramics, lithics, metal and
bone. Through elemental analysis of archaeological materials, a number of
significant kinds of questions can be addressed. INAA provides a taxonomic tool
because it allows materials of similar composition to be grouped together. In
some instances, it also permits the proveniencing of artifacts and thus may
provide information about procurement practices, routes of trade and political
boundaries. It may also improve understanding of ancient technologies and
(through analysis of skeletal remains) give insight into prehistoric diet and
nutrition. This project is particularly important because the Missouri
laboratory is one of the very few which provide INAA service to archaeologists.
It also plays an important role in training students.
