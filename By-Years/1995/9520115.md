9520115 Herman A workshop at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
aimed at introducing thermal spray technology to the wide engineering community
will be held in the summer of '95. The workshop speakers will consist of
engineers and managers from manufacturing industries which have successfully
implemented thermal spray into their production processes. In addition, selected
scientists from academia and industry will discuss key aspects of the
technology, from both the points of view of limitations and opportunities.
Bringing industrial end users and academic researchers in this focused workshop
will enable commercial growth of this emerging technology.
