New analysis techniques developed recently have eliminated much of the guess
work and creative thinking required in mechanism synthesis. They have placed the
synthesis process on a more analytical foundation. This project further enhances
that analytical base by incorporating knowledge based systems in the conceptual
design of mechanisms. Use of such systems is a more systematic approach to
mechanism design than other approaches currently in vogue. Although the project
addresses a small class of mechanisms initially, its ultimate application will
be to a broad spectrum of mechanisms from small machines to large deployable
space structures.
