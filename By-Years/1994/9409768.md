9409768 Calomiris This research will address two issues involving the banking
system during the Great Depression. First, it will examine the role of the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the recovery of the banking system during
the Great Depression. Second, it will examine the extent to which interbank
externalities played a major role in the crisis. The theory that banks that were
in trouble withdrew funds from healthier banks thus perpetuating a liquidity
crisis in the other banks, is referred to as the "contagion effect". The
empirical research will use data for banks across the United States for the
period 1930 to 1933. This project is of timely interest because it addresses the
role of federal assistance in the banking system. The study should offer
important new insights into the sources of banking failures during the Great
Depression. The results would also shed some light on the effects of federal
assistance on bank performance during the Depression.
