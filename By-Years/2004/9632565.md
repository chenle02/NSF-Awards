The project will investigate a central question for democratic government: how
citizens learn and form opinions about political choices. The convergence of
low-information models of rationality and recent work in cognitive neuroscience
indicates that the relationship between emotion and cognition is central to
political information processing. Judgmental heuristics are often used by
individuals to reason about choices when, as is usually the case, they possess
incomplete information and limited ability to consider it. Emotions function as
timesaving cues, or short cuts, in the cognitive process of integrating old and
new information. Because emotions often operate pre-consciously, research into
their role demands experimental conditions under which the investigator has
greater control of the informational environment than can typically be achieved
in survey-based research. In this work, experimental research will test the
relative importance of these factors in political choice. The experiment will
assess whether emotional and cognitive reactions are distinct and salient
factors in the process of attitude formation. The experiment will also test
previous survey-based evidence that anxiety can affect political learning by
inhibiting prior attitudes and focusing attention on new information.
