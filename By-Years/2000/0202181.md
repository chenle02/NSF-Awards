ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Effective Models of Science Research
Partnerships in the Classroom: Resolving Key Pedagogical
Issues&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRI (the Paleontological Research Institute) is
requesting funding to develop and evaluate "student-scientist partnership" (SSP)
resources for fourth through ninth grade student participants in the Devonian
Seas Project. Through the proposed activities PRI will contribute a fully
evaluated model laying out protocols for effective linkage between Earth science
research and pre-college classroom teaching. Age-appropriate materials and an
associated project database will be catalogued with the Digital Library for
Earth System Education (DLESE). This will greatly increase access to real world
data sets while providing DLESE with content usable in tests of new Digital
Library protocols. The timing of this award is critical and urgent since PRI has
recently acquired corporate support for its "Devonian Seas" classroom outreach
SSP. This award will allow PRI to leverage corporate funds to develop and
evaluate new SSP materials in the formative stages, one of the major challenges
facing SSP development and implementation. Funding will help to establish the
Devonian Seas Project as a model that may catalyze change in the way students
experience science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
