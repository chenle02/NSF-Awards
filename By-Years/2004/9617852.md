9617852 Kastens The two-year project will produce a CD-ROM package to help
students in grades 2-4 develop the ability to make, read, and interpret maps.
The learning outcomes align closely with the national standards for geography
education for grades K-4. The project will revise and elaborate on a pilot
version of a computer-aided learning tool and develop an accompanying teacher's
guide. The software and print materials are to help students develop their
ability to translate mentally between their visually-perceived, three-
dimensional physical surroundings and a schematic representation of that reality
(i.e., a map). Students will use the CD-ROM to learn about and practice mapping
skills and will apply those skills in developing and following maps in the area
in and around their school. The product will be commercially published and
disseminated as a CD-ROM with supporting print materials.
