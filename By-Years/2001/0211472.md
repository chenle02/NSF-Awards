This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Biogenic Volatile Organic
Compounds (VOCs) scheduled to take place at Queens College, Oxford, UK,
September 1-6, 2002. The meeting has been organized to bring together plant
physiologists, ecophysiologists, and atmospheric chemists to discuss plant
emissions of hydrocarbons. A significant fraction of the VOCs emitted to the
atmosphere in the U.S. are derived from plants. The most abundant of these,
isoprene, can play an important role in the formation of ozone and other air
pollutants and is therefore of general concern to the public. The study of
oxidation processes in the atmosphere and ozone formation is of central
relevance to the atmospheric chemistry. This meeting will bring together an
interdisciplinary team of scientists to assess research issues of common
interest to both atmospheric scientists and plant physiologists.
