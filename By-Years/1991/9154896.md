Erskine College will initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars project
in Computer Interfacing and Biotechnology for 36 students entering grades 10-12.
18 students will develop expertise in computer interfacing and learn to apply
this technology in the areas of meteorology, modern physics, acoustics,
chemistry, robotics and assistance for the disabled. The other 18 students will
develop expertise in biotechnology as they apply tissue culture and cloning to
botany and plant development, apply radiotelemetric to field studies of the
ecological zoology of small mammals and reptiles, and apply DNA fingerprinting
and genetic engineering to studies in molecular genetics. Students will visit
the Duke Power Nuclear Power Plant and the IBM National Support Center for
Persons with Disabilities.
