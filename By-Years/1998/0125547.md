This project will take a research-informed approach to understanding how
undergraduate engineering majors progress in their studies of engineering
design. Its goal is to better understand and describe design expertise and a
learner's growth towards acquiring that expertise. In this work, the
investigators intend to undertake research in three areas:&lt;br/&gt;(1) The
development of a continuum of design expertise as a way of describing learners'
growth toward acquiring expertise, (2) A study of design expertise that will
provide information to help populate the continuum, and (3) The demonstration of
a research-informed approach in design education through the use of the
continuum to enhance and assess student&lt;br/&gt;learning of engineering design
during their cooperative (coop) experiences. This research should help us to
better understand how students learn design principles in engineering, and the
continuum, itself, may be of great help to engineering faculty in their efforts
to teach design.&lt;br/&gt;
