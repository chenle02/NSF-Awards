The objective of this project is to develop a robust set of algorithms for
automatically learning admissible heuristics - that is, functions that identify
optimal solutions to combinatorial problems and give a lower bound on the actual
cost of a solution. The more accurate the heuristic function, the more
efficiently an optimal solution can be found, or if an optimal solution is not
required the more quickly a lower-cost solution can found. This research is
developing ways to learn these heuristics in a domain-independent manner by
applying a technique that has proved useful in automatically learning more
accurate admissible heuristic functions that take more time to compute, but make
up for it in the time they save for the algorithm using the heuristic. This work
will provide better solutions of combinatorial problems of artificial
intelligence which will be increasingly cost-effective as computers get faster
and larger problems are presented for solution.
