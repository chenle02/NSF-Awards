The goal of this project is to conduct the fifth U.S.-Japan workshop on wind
engineering as part of the UJNR (U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program on Natural
Resources) Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects that will be held for three days at
Minneapolis on July 26-28, 2010. This project will mainly support the travel
cost of the US participants while encouraging participation of young
researchers. This workshop is held every three to four years alternately in the
U.S. and in Japan. It is an ongoing effort of the UJNR Panel to bring together
U.S. and Japanese researchers from academic institutions, government
laboratories and industry to develop collaborative efforts that will benefit
both the countries. Specific objectives of this workshop are to (a) assess the
recently completed collaborative research efforts such as long-span-bridge
flutter, stay-cable vibration, tornado loads on low-rise buildings and storm
damage survey, (b) continue mutual exchange of information on ongoing research
and practice, and (c) identify new projects for collaborative research. This
workshop like those in the past will facilitate exchanging of technical
information, meteorological data and structural response data from strong winds,
and sharing of unique research facilities in both the countries.
