The HBCU-RISE proposal by Alabama A&amp;M University aims to develop research
infrastructure in the areas of advanced materials and nanophotonics. AAMU has a
doctoral program in physics with emphasis in areas of optics and materials
sciences. The proposed HBCU-RISEproject intends to strengthen the materials
science and optics infrastructure in the department. Some of the research
projects which will be supported include: nanostructured binary materials and
their application to chemical sensing, growth of novel triboluminescent crystals
and their application to structural health monitoring, preparation of rare-earth
ion doped oxyfluoride nanostructured glasses and their application to
luminescent devices, development of high-yield organic solar cells sensitized
with metal nanoparticles, two-photon biophotonic nanomaterials for cancer
diagnostics/ treatment and nanopatterned polymer substrates for plasmonic
chemical sensors. Recent developments in nanoscience/nanotechnology are a common
underlying thread that connects many of these projects. This project will
provide new opportunities for graduate studies and will create a pool for new
graduate students who would be interested in for PhD degree in materials
science. In addition, participation of undergraduates in research internships,
workshops and seminars will add to the pool of applicants for graduate studies.
