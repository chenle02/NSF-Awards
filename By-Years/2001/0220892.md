ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0220892&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accumulation
rates of Mo, Re and U in marine sediments can be useful proxies for
reconstructing past redox conditions. While an increase in accumulation rates of
authigenic Mo, Re and U is often a clear indication of more reducing conditions
in sediments, it is more difficult to deduce whether the change is due to a
decrease in bottom water oxygen content or an increase in organic carbon flux.
Three scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution plan to develop a
means of distinguishing between these two potential causes utilizing porewater
samples obtained from the Washington margin and seasonally from sediments in
Buzzards Bay (coastal site). The PIs will acquire these samples using benthic
flux chambers, centrifugation and in-situ polyacrylamide gel probes. The
porewater and solid phase samples will be analyzed for U, Re and Mo as well as
the necessary supporting parameters. Results from the profiles obtained at
Buzzards Bay will serve to document the seasonal evolution of porewater
concentrations and benthic fluxes as a function of bioturbation, bioirrigation
and non-steady state O2 penetration into the sediments. Samples from the
Washington margin region will be used to assess the influence of water depth,
carbon flux and O2 bottom water concentrations on the burial of these redox
sensitive metals. Results from this study will be incorporated into a steady-
state sediment-pore water model to use the derived parameters to obtain
realistic solid phase metal profiles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
