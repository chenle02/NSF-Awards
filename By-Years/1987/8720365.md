This conference covers a new and important topic . resonance ionization
spectroscopy . that is one of the new aspects of atomic physics made possible by
the "laser revolution". "R.I.S." is still expanding, as both new fundamental and
applied uses are found. This conference is the fourth in a series of
international meetings focussing on this topic. It has proven to be a unique and
necessary meeting point for those involved in this research, speeding the flow
of ideas and results. The latest meeting, held at NBS near Washington, D.C.,
will be equally valuable.
