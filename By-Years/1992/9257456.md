This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will use parametrically and externally excited standing waves to test
modern theories in nonlinear dynamical systems. It will also investigate the
energy transfer among wave modes in spectra with various initial conditions, the
effects of surface films on the waves' physics and the boundary condition at a
gas-liquid-solid interface. The National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes the
recipient's strong potential for continued professional growth as a research
mathematician and for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
