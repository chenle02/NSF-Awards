teachers, students and administrators at all schools; (2) increase student
motivation for success by giving students more responsibility for their
education, infusing multiculturalism into the curriculum, and developing
increased awareness of connections between science, mathematics and technology

teacher leaders and School Improvement Plans; (4) implement a national,
standards-based, student-centered SMT curriculum; (5) provide an extensive
student support system; (6) provide professional development for all teachers
and administrators led by the district's Center for School Improvement and
Professional Development in partnership with extant NSF-funded programs; and (7)
develop collaborations with parents and community partners to support the SMT
curriculum and involve them in the delivery of professional development and
student support.
