Developers and researchers at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Iowa
State University are initiating an innovative approach to pre-K students'
development of quantitative reasoning through measurement. This quantitative
approach builds on measurement concepts and algebraic design of the pre-numeric
stage of instruction found in the Elkonin-Davydov (E-D) elementary mathematics
curriculum from Russia. The project team is adapting and refocusing the
conceptual framework and learning tasks of the E-D pre-numeric stage for use
with four-year-olds. The adaptation is being done in collaboration with experts
in Russia who were involved in the original E-D development. A primary goal of
the project is to obtain a proof-of-concept and lay down a conceptual and
empirical foundation for a subsequent research and development.

The research progresses using teaching experiments involving six students. Each
student is engaged in 15 minute one-on-one sessions twice each week. Sessions
are videotaped and transcribed for further analysis. The analysis of the data is
conducted by the project team in collaboration with Russian consultants.

The research findings and methodology will provide grounds for supporting more
complex and sophisticated mathematical ideas that will inform curriculum
development for pre-K students and teachers. Results will be published and
reported widely.
