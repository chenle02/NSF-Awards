Detailed study of the tectonic and vocanogenic history of the northrnmost
Mariana backarc basin will be performed using existing data from two SeaMARC II
side.scan and bathymetric cruises and five Geological ZSurvey of Japan
geophysical surveys. Conventional bathymetry, SeaMARC II and seismic reflection
data will be analyzed. These data will allow the PI to test models of evolution
of the backarc basin spreading systems. Specifically, the PI will examine the
tectonic structure of the rift graben; the nature and distribution of volanism
in the early stages of rifting; and determine whether the observed structures
and volcanic elements agree with those predicted by existing models.
