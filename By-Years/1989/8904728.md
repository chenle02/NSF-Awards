This project covers three areas involving the theory of computation. First, is
work on average case complexity. Here there has been progress both in the
positive direction (proving specific NP hard problems to be polynomial time on
average), and in the negative direction (proving some randomized NP problems to
be complete in the average case). Work is continuing on both aspects of the
problem. Second, work is proceeding on a variety of complexity issues related in
one way or another to randomness. Time-space trade-offs for coin- flipping
machines is one of those issues. Finally, there is work on new time-complexity
classes: time polynomial in input or output, and nearly linear time.
