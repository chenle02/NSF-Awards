This proposal describes a set of new techniques for managing access to remote
files in the wide area. The vehicle for evaluating these techniques will be a
wide-area file system called MoteFS. MoteFS will provide fast, flexible, and
secure access to remote files over untrusted wide-area networks. In more detail,
the following mechanisms and policies will be investigated:&lt;br/&gt;- fine-
grained namespace mechanisms that allow namespaces to be efficiently and
securely added, mutated, transferred and deleted at granularities from single
files to millions of files.&lt;br/&gt;- decomposable credentials, which allow
credential holders to locally derive and transfer weaker credentials without
contacting file owners.&lt;br/&gt;- a cross-server versioning abstraction, which
allows correlated versions of a group of files to be referenced even if they
span multiple users and file systems.&lt;br/&gt;- client-side differencing,
which allows redundant data to be eliminated during network
writebacks.&lt;br/&gt;- wide-area prefetching and caching
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;The combined effect of these techniques will allow allow
users to interact with their files in a flexible, secure, location-independent
manner.
