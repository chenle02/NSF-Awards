Cloud computing enables flexible, dynamic outsourcing while improving cost
efficiencies. These operational and economic benefits, however, are today not
available to safety-critical and mission-critical real-time applications due to
the lack of timeliness supports by current cloud infrastructures. Providing
real-time guarantees on cloud platforms faces several novel challenges because
cloud platforms are not designed for response time guarantees but to achieve
elasticity and the illusion of abundant resources available on
demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research extends current cloud infrastructures
with resource management techniques to enable real-time guarantees on the cloud.
The proposed work focuses on the scheduling of data-intensive real-time
applications onto cloud resources to meet their timing requirements. The project
(i) proposes a formal framework for modeling and performance evaluation of real-
time applications in cloud environments, with a focus on data-parallel
middleware; (ii) develops algorithms for scheduling continuous streams of real-
time cloud applications in an online setting; (iii) designs techniques to
address issues introduced by virtualization and machine failures based on
probabilistic models, hierarchical scheduling techniques, multi-mode techniques,
and feedback control techniques; and (v) evaluates these techniques in the
context of practical real-time applications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research
will result in the development of a real-time variant of at least one data-
parallel middleware infrastructure by enhancing existing open-source platforms.
Research prototypes will be released as open source to spur the research and
development of cloud computing targeting real-time applications and systems.
Research concepts and tools developed in this project will be incorporated into
relevant courses at Penn.
