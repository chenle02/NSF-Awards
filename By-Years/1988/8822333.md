This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Program to
support the collaborative research of Dr. E. Eyring at the University of Utah,
Dr. S. Petrucci at Polytechnic University and T. Skotheim at Brookhaven. The
research will deal with the structure and dynamics of alkali and alkaline earth
cation complexation with polyethylene oxide(PEO). These polyether complexes are
of interest both fundamentally and as solid electrolytes in light-weight
rechargeable batteries. The dynamics of polyether complexes will be studied by
means of Radiofrequency and UHF ultrasonic relaxation spectra, radiofrequency
and microwave dielectric relaxation spectra, audiofrequency electrical
conductivity, Raman and infrared vibrational spectra, and X-ray photoemission
and synchrotron radiation studies. Effects of polyether chain length and the
nature of the coordinating cation will be systematically explored.
