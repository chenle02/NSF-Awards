This three-year award supports cooperative research in atomic and molecular
physics between D.M. Ceperley of the University of Illinois and Bernard Bermu of
the Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France, the investigators propose
to develop quantum Monte Carlo methods for the properties of hydrogenic plasmas
at relatively high temperatures. Plasmas are found in nature under different
conditions. There are interstellar plasmas, and the plasmas in the interiors of
planets and stars. Before classifying plasmas, their ionization state must be
determined. The investigators will calculate the ionization state of hydrogenic
plasmas under conditions were quantum effects, thermal excitations and
electronic correlation are simultaneously important. This project will benefit
form the complementary expertise of the U.S. investigator in quantum Monte Carlo
techniques and the French investigator in high temperature plasmas and transport
processes. Access to high speed computers in the countries will contribute
significantly to this joint effort. The results will be of general interest to
researchers in dense plasma physics and will advance our understanding of
planetary and stellar structure.
