The aim of this research is to study the effects of early experience on adult
mothering behavior, and also to identify the attributes and behaviors that
provide an intermediate link between early experience and behavior in adulthood.
Dr. Fairbanks is investigating these important problems using a colony of
captive vervet monkeys living in four social groups at the Sepulveda Veterans
Administration Nonhuman Primate Research Facility. Results from undisturbed,
captive social groups can provide good models of behavior in expanding
populations with an ample resource base and low death rate. These conditions
might have greater generality to some aspects of human behavior than conditions
found in more stable or declining field populations. Preliminary results from
Dr. Fairbanks' colony suggest that female vervet monkeys who were overly
protected as infants become overly protective mothers, while females who were
rejected more often as infants tend to be more rejecting as mothers. There are
also indications that laissez-faire mothers produce offspring who are more
independent, adventuresome, and responsive to the outside environment as
juveniles and adults, compared to the offspring of more protective mothers. The
objective of Dr. Fairbanks' further research is to verify these relationships
between early experience and later behavior with a larger sample of individuals,
and to determine how early experience influences an individual's ability to
react adaptively to its environment. This research represents the first
extensive study of the long-term effects of spontaneously occurring variation in
early experience for primates living in naturally composed social groups. The
results will allow Dr. Fairbanks to trace the developmental course of
differences in early experience from infancy through adulthood, and to test the
hypothesis that mothering style tends to be propagated from one generation of
females to another.
