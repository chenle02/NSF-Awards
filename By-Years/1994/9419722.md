9419722 Stephenson Recent studies indicate that phosphorus fertility can control
plant reproduction by controlling the characteristics of the pollen. Symbiotic
fungi, called mycorrhizal fungi, can increase the uptake of phosphorus into
plants. This research will determine whether the symbiotic fungi influence plant
reproduction via an effect on pollen quality. The project will greatly advance
our understanding of the response of plants to environmental stress (phosphorus
infertility) and the role of mycorrhizal fungi in that response. The study will
provide insight into the evolution of natural plant populations, especially in
regards to local adaptation and the genetic substructure of populations. The
research should have important ramifications for the understanding of
pollination of crops, the flow of genes among crops and their wild relatives,
and the development of techniques for pollen selection for agriculturally
desirable traits.
