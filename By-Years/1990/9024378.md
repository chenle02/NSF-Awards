In 1991-1992, the US JGOFS Equatorial Pacific program will study the
production, flux and fate of organic carbon along a cross-equatorial transect at
140oW. From the equator northward, this transect traverses a steep gradient in
particulate organic-carbon flux and burial at the abyssal seafloor. In order to
elucidate the fate of organic carbon in these sediments, an understanding of
bioturbation and seabed particle dynamics (as traced by naturally occurring
radionuclides) is essential. The P.I.'s propose to test, along this carbon-flux
gradient, four hypotheses of biogoechemical significance: (1) bioturbation rates
and depths vary with annual particulate organic-carbon (POC) flux to the
seafloor, (2) these variations have a significant impact on the mineralization
and burial of organic carbon in the seabed, (3) macrobenthic standing crop and
mean body size are correlated with annual POC flux, and (4) seabed inventories
of excess 234Th, 228Th and 210Pb are correlated with POC flux on 100-d, 10-yr
and 100-yr time scales, respectively.
