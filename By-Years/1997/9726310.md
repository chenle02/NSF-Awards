Proposal Number: ECS-9726310 Principal Investigator: Szymon Suckewer Title:
Development of a 4.8 nm laser in transition to ground state of Boron-V
Development of soft x-ray lasers at the very short wavelengths will be
investigated. Compact soft x-ray lasers will have many important applications in
biology and materials science. In this work, the x-ray generation is based on
rapid recombination of plasmas created by optical field ionization (OFI). OFI in
hydrogen-like Lithium-II, hydrogen-like Boron-V and hydrogen-like Carbon-VI will
be explored. The work will include modeling of the confinement of the plasma by
the microcapillary configuration in addition to experimental investigation.
