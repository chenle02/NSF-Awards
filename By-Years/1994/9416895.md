9416895 Cane In this project the PIs will study deep water formation in the Red
Sea using geochemical and physical techniques. Geochemical work will involve
obtaining high resolution samples corals, from which measurements of stable
oxygen isotopes (O-18/O-16 and Sr/Ca) will be made. Samples will be obtained
near the tip of the Sinai Peninsula, where the temperature is high, allowing
very rapid coral growth, but where the PIs hypothesize that strong winter
convection produces deep water formation. Samples of corals near the sea surface
will be compared with those at greater depths in the pycnocline. In this
component of the study, the data will be assimilated in a model of the Red Sea
which includes deep convection, in order to test the hypothesis.
