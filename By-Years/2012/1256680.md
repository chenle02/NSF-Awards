Insects are ideal model systems for studying associations between animals and
microorganisms because of the diversity of interactions formed between them.
These interactions, or symbioses, span a wide continuum of types, from those
that are pathogenic and short-lived to those that are beneficial and stable over
extremely long periods of time. Sap-feeding insects in particular have been
shown to form intimate and stable symbioses with bacteria that live exclusively
within insect cells. This strict intracellular lifestyle has profound effects on
the symbiotic bacteria, effects that are dramatically manifest in their highly
reduced genomes. This project will investigate a symbiosis involving a cicada
that lives in the southwestern United States and its dual bacterial symbionts.
One of these symbionts, named Hodgkinia, has a remarkably small genome encoding
many fewer genes than was thought possible for an autonomous organism. The
investigators will use both genetic and molecular techniques to uncover the
mechanistic changes that have allowed Hodgkinia's extreme genome reduction. It
is expected that adaptations in both the host insect and symbiont will be found
that enable such dramatic gene loss. This work has broad-reaching consequences
for the way we understand genome reduction in bacteria, the integration of
organisms in the context of intimate symbioses, and the formation of cellular
organelles such as mitochondria. The broader impacts of this project will
involve the training of several undergraduate students, one graduate student,
one postdoctoral fellow, and several K-12 teachers and students through
collaboration with the Missoula County Public Schools and College of Education
and Human Sciences at the University of Montana.
