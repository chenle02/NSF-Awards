The RECOMB conference series is an annual conference, now in its fifth year,
which meets at various cities around the world. The subject area, computational
biology and bioinformatics, is rapidly growing in scientific importance and
impact. The conference organizers are committed to supporting travel to the
conference of people at the beginning of their careers, especially Ph.D.
students and postdoctoral fellows. The support for student travel expenses will
result in exposing new workers in the area to the newest, best research.
