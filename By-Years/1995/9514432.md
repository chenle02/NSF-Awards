9514432 HOLLINS This research will investigate humans' sense of touch, and in
particular, the ability of people to determine, by touch, what the surface of an
object is like. People can often determine, by drawing a finger across a
surface, whether it is cloth, styrofoam, leather etc.; it is not known, however,
on what specific aspects of the stimulus event these perceptions are based. The
hypothesis to be explored in this research is that small vibrations, set up in
the skin when the finger moves across a textured surface, contain the
information needed to make many of these judgments, and that sensory processing
of the vibrations in fact contributes to texture perception. The research will
test this notion in a number of ways. First, the vibrations themselves will be
recorded and analyzed. The information they contain will be evaluated and
compared with the performance of experimental participants. Second, higher-order
features of the vibration, such as the way it waxes and wanes over time, will be
manipulated to determine if perception reflects the encoding of such temporal
patterns. Third, some textures will be presented repeatedly, to learn how
adaptation influences the precision of texture judgments; the resulting
perceptual changes will yield information about underlying sensory processes.
Fourth, textures will be touched indirectly, with a small rod, thus eliminating
all cues except vibration. If subjects' judgments are still accurate, the
importance of vibration in texture perception will be established. Fifth, pre-
recorded vibrations will be played back to the finger, to determine whether
participants can recognize the original texture. These five sets of experiments
will provide a thorough test of the hypothesis that vibrations contribute to
tactile texture perception, an idea that has important implications for remote
and prosthetic sensing, and for the possibility of sensory enhancement in
persons with somesthetic impairments. In additi on, the research will contribute
basic knowledge about an important aspect of tactile perception. ***
