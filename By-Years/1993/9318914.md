9318914 Wicker Over the past several years much progress has been made in
determining the environmental meteorological parameters that determine the
structure of thunderstorms. In particular, an important discovery is the factors
that are highly correlated with the storms (know as supercell storms) that
typically produce tornadoes. Even though most major tornadoes are spawned within
supercell thunderstorms, not all supercells produce tornadoes and the tornadoes
themselves span a broad spectrum of severity. In this research the Principal
Investigator will investigate the large scale environmental conditions that
control the intensity and longevity of tornadoes. Advances in computational
power and numerical techniques permit a numerical modeling parameter study of
supercell/tornado systems. The goal is to simulate the observed spectrum of
tornadic storms by systematically varying the environmental wind shear and
buoyancy. Successful completion of this research will increase understanding of
tornadoes and potentially provide operational meteorologists with better
information for predicting severe tornadic events. ***
