ability to return to the stream in which they were born. The sensory basis for
this remarkable behavior is olfactory: during a sensitive developmental period
(smolt transformation), salmon imprint to distinctive homestream odors, and
adults later use this odorant memory as a migratory cue to guide them back from
the open ocean to their natal streams. How salmon imprint to homestream odors
has remained an important but perplexing puzzle for over forty years. Proponents
of olfactory imprinting have assumed that the olfactory memory for the home
stream resides in the central nervous system. Dr. Roberts, however, proposes
that olfactory memory is actually retained in the olfactory receptor cells
themselves. The basis for his theory rests on two important findings. First,
surges in plasma thyroxine levels mediate smolting, and second, olfactory
imprinting coincides with this developmental metamorphosis. This small grant for
exploratory research enables Dr. Roberts to use state of the art
electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques to determine whether there
are thyroxine induced change s in olfactory receptor neurons to specific odors.
This basic research will have direct benefits to Pacific salmon by providing
insight into how olfactory imprinting might be artificially manipulated. If
thyroxine hormone can influence the ability of fish to imprint during a wider
time frame than smolting, this finding could markedly advance conservation
efforts aimed at transporting rapidly diminishing endangered salmon runs to
healthier river systems. ***
