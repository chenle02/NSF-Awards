Recent discovery of shatter cones and fluidal breccias resembling impactites in
Precambrian rock of southwestern Montana signal the possible presence of a large
impact structure. The shatter cones are in rocks of the Cabin thrust sheet at
the culmination of the southwestern Montana recess in the boundary between the
Cordilleran thrust belt and the Rocky Mountain foreland. This study will test
the validity of the "impact structure" interpretation by field documentation of
shatter cone distribution and orientation and by laboratory analysis of the
fluidal breccias. The results of this study will increase our understanding of
impact structures and of their possible influence on subsequent orogenic
processes.
