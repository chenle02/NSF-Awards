9320678 Samuelson Noncooperative game theory has become a pervasive theoretical
tool in economics. Unfortunately, this theoretical success has not been matched
by empirical applications, and noncooperative game theory is often dismissed
with the charge that it makes no testable predictions. The primary difficulty in
using game theory to make empirical predictions is the equilibrium selection
problem: games typically have a multitude of equilibria, and game theory
provides very little guidance as to how to choose between them. The project
continues the development of an approach to the equilibrium selection problem
based on evolutionary models of games, consisting of four components. The first
is the construction of explicit models of how boundedly rational players learn
to play games. These models are then used to derive dynamic processes describing
the evolution of play. Third, the limiting outcomes of these dynamic processes
are examined, with particular interest in how these outcomes compare to common
equilibrium concepts. Finally, the robustness of the results to various types of
trembles or noise int he learning process is investigated. More specifically,
under the current grant the project extends existing, preliminary models of how
boundedly rational players learn. Best-reply learning models are extended to new
classes of games, including signaling games; and "noisy selection" models are
extended beyond the 2x2 symmetric games to which they are now confined. With
these models in hand, the heart of the research involves investigating the
outcomes of evolutionary processes in the presence of various environmental
randomness or "trembles." The preliminary results indicate that such randomness
can have a profound impact on the evolutionary outcome. The proposed research
addresses the apparent arbitrariness of evolutionary learning models by
investing the evolution of the learning rules by which players guide their
behavior.
