9619191 Hollingsworth The focus of this proposal entitled Cooperative Phenomena
and Domain Switching Processes in Organic Inclusion Compounds is on a molecular
understanding of cooperative interactions in solids, and in particular on the
design, synthesis and characterization of a series of inclusion compounds that
undergo macroscopic domain reorientation under applied anisotropic stress
(ferroelasticity). The research program will address on a molecular level what
it is that controls domain switching processes in crystals, what are the
mechanisms of ferroelasticity, and what the rate determining steps are. Because
ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity are so closely related, the emphasis on
cooperative determinants of ferroelastic properties should provide important
insights into the domain switching processes in ferroelectric materials. %%% The
design and synthesis of ferroelectric inclusion compounds will provide new
materials, which because of their fast timescale for guest molecular
reorientation, should make them of high interest as rapidly switching
electrooptical materials. ***
