Gravity wave detection by optical interferometry requires an efficient, high
power laser with low amplitude and frequency noise. Prof. Byer's group will
design, build, and study a 13- watt, single-axial-mode, diode-laser-pumped
Nd:YAG laser, with the power, frequency and amplitude stability and spatial mode
properties necessary for the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory
(LIGO). This laser will be designed with the potential to operate at 20%
electrical efficiency and to scale to greater than 100 watts of optical power.
They will obtain stable, single-axial-mode, unidirectional oscillation by
injection locking the 13-watt oscillator with a low power (50 mW) stabilized,
nonplanar ring oscillator (NPRO). The output of the 13-watt laser will then be
frequency doubled with greater than 80% conversion efficiency in a monolithic
resonant harmonic generator to produce 10 watts of green light with the same
temporal coherence as the injecting NPRO laser. The 13- watt laser will then be
applied to interferometric studies in cooperation with the scientific teams
associated with the LIGO project.
