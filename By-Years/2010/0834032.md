Workshop on Recursion

It is well-known that language is an window into the human mind, not just
because our words reveal our thoughts, but because the way we put words together
reflects principles of organization that allow creativity to flourish. Recent
mathematically based research in linguistic theory has identified computational
principles that promise to provide the software behind our neurological
hardware. This workshop will bring together linguists, biologists,
psychologists, philosophers and computer scientists who are discovering how
these linguistic principles provide the abstract basis for language learning and
learning in general. Central to this enterprise is a simple concept, recursion,
the idea of building complex structures through repeated application of simple
rules, which may provide a metaphor for the organization of all human action.

This workshop is timely because research on complex structures in language and
cognition is now reaching a point where the various types of complexity can
begin to be defined with sufficient precision to consolidate results and
discover the sources and limits of complex human cognition. By identifying the
ways in with complex structures and complex can arise from the application of
simple rules, this research lays the foundation for new ways of designing
curriculum for optimal learning, new perspectives on artificial intelligence and
new insight into the evolutionary changes that distinguish animal cognition from
human cognitive abilities.
