Professor Onellion has been given a Presidential Young Investigator Award to
study the electronic and magnetic properties of metallic and semiconductor
heterostructures under vacuum. He will concentrate on three interrelated areas:
thin metal films, magnetic materials and low temperatures. The new science will
arise from creating new structures or phases of matter that normally do not
exist. The magnetic materials aspect possesses the valuable combination of
potential for interesting science and technological applications.
