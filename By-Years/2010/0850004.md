This award will support participation in workshops associated with the
international Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) Open Science Meeting
(OSM) in June 2009, Victoria, BC. The OSM will culminate the integration and
synthesis activities of the international GLOBEC program by providing a new
mechanistic understanding of the functioning of the marine ecosystem, in order
to develop predictive capabilities, and propose a framework for the management
of marine ecosystems in the era of global change. Selection of individuals to
participate in the workshops will be based on 1) Career stage, with priority
given to early career scientists, 2) contribution to the workshops and OSM in
terms of abstract submission for an oral or poster presentation and potential
for contributed manuscript and 3) applicant gender and ethnic background.
Selected applicants will be from U.S. Institutions. The synthesis, integration
and modeling activities will provide new insights into marine population
variability and climate change. This in turn will provide a basis for the
development of new research initiatives and programs focused on marine food webs
and their interaction with biogeochemical cycling (e.g., IMBER) and climate
variability
