9550704 Sampson The Heartland's Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP)
program is a collaborative effort of eleven midwestern universities and colleges
whose purpose is to substantially increase the quality and quantity of minority
students receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, engineering and mathematics
(SEM), and subsequently, to increase the number of minority students pursuing
graduate degrees. There are two major objectives of the Alliance: to increase by
15 percent the number of minorities SEM baccalaureate degree recipients in
participating institutions and to increase by 50 percent the number of
minorities at participating institutions who earn doctorates in SEM disciplines
in the next 10 years. The Pre-college Outreach Program will emphasize the
importance of science and mathematics education in elementary and secondary
public schools and encourage high-ability minority students to pursue SEM
degrees. The Post-secondary/Undergraduate transition Program will assist SEM
minority students in the transitions from high schools and community colleges to
four-year institutions. This tier features readiness seminars, tutorial
assistance, support teams, summer research opportunities and related enrichment
activities, designed to ensure the success of these students. The Graduates
Transition Program of study will be tailored to individual needs, and include a
dedicated mentor and financial support during the post-baccalaureate year. After
successful completion of the post-baccalaureate year, students will be awarded
fellowships to support their regular graduate study. A graduate fair will
provide for additional minority recruitment to the SEM programs of the
participating research universities.
