The objectives of this project are: to define a model of a specification of
large programs, and to design a language useful for writing specifications of
large programs. Toward the long-term goal of putting formal specifications to
productive use, the ability to specify large programs is needed, not just small
ones. It is intended to study behavioral properties of large programs, and how
to specify these properties; relationships among program module specifications
that constitute specifications of large programs; and language constructs that
facilitate putting together specifications. It is planned to use formal
mathematics to define the model and language. The research will simultaneously
be guided by more practical objectives: to develop a specification approach, and
to demonstrate the utility of the work by applying it to realistic examples.
