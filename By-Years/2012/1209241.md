This action funds Alan Michael Twomey of the University of Minnesota to conduct
a research project, entitled "Quantifying small-scale distribution of proteins
in frozen solutions using chemical imaging techniques," during the summer of
2012 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The host
scientists are Dr. Hiroshi Takamastu and Dr. Kosaku Kurata

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to quantify the effect of
cooling rate and thermal history on the distribution of proteins in the ice
interface in solutions composed of cryoprotective agents and buffers. Using
confocal Raman spectroscopy scans of solutions frozen along a temperature
gradient, the distribution of the proteins are being measured, as well as
changes in their conformation. The specific goal of the research project is to
develop a methodology to control the interactions of a protein in a solution
with a propagating ice interface in a manner that minimizes damage to the
protein structure. Minimizing structural damage to proteins has significant
implications for many applications, including the pharmaceutical industry where
therapeutic proteins are frequently stabilized and stored at length in the
frozen state.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
