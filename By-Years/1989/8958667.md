PYI - both theoretical analyses and experimentation in four areas which fall
under the general classification of signal processing using integrated optics
and active or passive waveguides will be pursued. The first topic is to study
waveguides and waveguiding devices formed in GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well
(MQW) material, the second is to extend the investigation of coupled waveguide
switching characteristics, the third is to examine lensing applications whereby
arrays of beams can be concentrated or directed, and the fourth is to study
other modulated waveguide structures with the intent of realizing new devices
which perform useful functions.
