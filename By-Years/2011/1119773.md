A request is made to fund additional and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda
Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes
four items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 ? Niskin Bottles &lt;br/&gt;2 ? Solar
Instrument Suite&lt;br/&gt;3 ? CTD sensors&lt;br/&gt;4 ? Weather
Instruments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal
impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure
support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in
support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually
undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
