9712129 Silleck Blue Mountain film Associates Inc., a production company formed
by the producers of the large format film, Cosmic Voyage, is requesting a
planning grant of $50,000, of a total budget of $130,000 to conduct preliminary
work on Biodiversity: Life in the Balance. A 40-minute large-format film will be
the centerpiece of this multi-component science education project. The film will
be based on what appears to be a critical paradox: while we humans, like all
living things, have always been dependent upon natural systems for our survival,
our unique cultural development and technological prowess have convinced us that
we are somehow "above" nature. The following a among major tasks will be
accomplished during the five month planning period: * The project principals, a
researcher, and advisors will create a comprehensive project plan to include a
large format film; complementary print materials for informal and formal
settings; a website; a CD-ROM; a video presentation for museums, schools, and
home markets; and a related traveling exhibit. * Work with advisors and other
scholars to develop detailed project content. * Write and review a treatment for
the film. * Develop the museum exhibit component * Write a detailed script for
the film. * Develop draft of outreach plan for advisor review. * Develop
promotion plan. The principals in the project will include: Bayley Silleck who
will be PI, Director, Co-Producer, and Writer; Jeffrey Marvin, Co-PI and
Producer; and Thomas Eisner, who will be a Co-PI and will serve as primary
content specialist and chair of the advisory committee. The advisory committee
includes: Niles Eldredge, American Museum of Natural History; Jane Lubchenco,
Oregon State University; Peter Raven, Missouri botanical Garden; and Edward O.
Wilson, Harvard University.
