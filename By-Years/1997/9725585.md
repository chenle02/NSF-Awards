9725585 Dixon Deformation of sedimentary piles in passive margins in classical
understanding of deformation of sedimentary piles impassive margins is based in
past on structural relations in the Gulf Coast region. However, the evolution of
the structures in this region is rather poorly understood. Fundamental questions
that remain are what is the rate of growth of growth faults, is motion they
continuous or episodic, is salt motion along the Gulf Coast kinematically linked
to this extension, and how is strain partitioned between fault zones and the
regions between faults. Dokka and Dixon will combine forces to collect GPS data
to address these issues. Their multi-year multi-station campaigned to measure
three dimension motion data as a function of time with the results integrated
with sea level elevation data will address all of these issues in the central
Gulf Coast region. Their results will provide a bridge between GPS data and
tidal data, and differences in motion between and across known faults will
reveal data on strain partitioning. The results will have generic significance
because they will serve as a model for deformation of other passive margins
where data are much less complete.
