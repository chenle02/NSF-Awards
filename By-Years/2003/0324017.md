Students are provided with services and activities that are designed to promote
the following: 1) improve the undergraduate educational experience of students
in relevant disciplines; 2) increase the number and percentage of students
completing the first stage of the baccalaureate study and those student
receiving degrees in relevant disciplines; 3) improve the likelihood of Program
Scholars post-baccalaureate placement in employment or graduate programs in
technical or related disciplines; and 4) provide the opportunity to further
strengthen partnerships with employers and the institution.

Forty students are chosen for participation in the CSEMS Program: fifteen (15)
freshman level and twenty-five (25) junior level students who are enrolled in
full-time, baccalaureate degree programs in Engineering (Electrical, Mechanical
and Computer) and Engineering Technology (Electrical, Industrial, Manufacturing,
and Mechanical) Programs. Each scholar is paired with a mentor who is a member
of the Program Scholars discipline area in which he/she is pursuing his/her
baccalaureate degree; the mentor serves as an advocate for the scholars academic
and career success. Activities that some of the scholars are involved in
include: tutorial assistance, visitations to research laboratories and graduate
programs, career counseling, attendance and/ or participation in national
professional conferences within their discipline and national student research
conferences, writing assistance, and professional work experiences.
