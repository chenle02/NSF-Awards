Evaluating the causes of variation within and between communities is the major
problem in community ecology. Dr. Menge will investigate community regulation in
the low intertidal zone on the central Oregon coast. These studies are aimed at
determining the factors regulating the spatial structure of plant-dominated
assemblages at sites differing in exposure to waves. Use of factorial
experimental designs will permit quantitative evaluation of the relative
importances of each of several factors, and will provide tests of a recent
multifactorial model of community regulation. Factors evaluated will be
predation, disturbance, competition, recruitment, sedimentation, and
physiological stress. Specific goals are: (1) determination of the causes of
variation in distribution of surfgrass along a wave exposure gradient, (2)
quantification of gradients of environmental stress and recruitment density, (3)
determination of mechanisms of disturbance, (4) experimen- tal studies of the
mechanisms underlying plant overgrowth, and (5) recolonization of surfgrass in
relation to clearance size and position.
