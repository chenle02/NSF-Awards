ABSTRACT The National Academy of Sciences, through the Ocean Studies Board of
the Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources, will convene a
colloquium on carbon dioxide and climate change to document the present state of
research and knowledge in this field. This colloquium will be held in honor of
the late Professor Roger Revelle, a pioneer in assessing anthropogenic effects
in the global carbon cycle. This colloquium will be jointly supported by the
NAS, DOE, NOAA, NASA and ONR along with NSF.
