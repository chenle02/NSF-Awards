Oregon State University proposes to support technical services on R/V Wecoma, a
185? general purpose research vessel as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the
National Science Foundation. The proposal requests support for both basic and
specialized services. For basic services, they will provide one or two shipboard
technicians on each cruise of R/V Wecoma to support seagoing research projects
and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool
of shared-use research instrumentation. As part of specialized services, they
will continue to operate and maintain the NORCOR facility, a shared use coring
facility available to all operators as well as continue development and support
for the SWAP effort, a ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications protocol.
The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year
continuing grant.
