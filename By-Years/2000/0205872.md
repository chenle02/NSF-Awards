AST 0205872 Gaustad

Dr. John Gaustad, at Swarthmore College, recently completed a Southern H-Alpha
Sky Survey Atlas (SHASSA). The images in this atlas have a resolution of 0.8
arcminutes and sensitivity of 2 rayleighs per pixel. Dr. Gaustad will now use
the same robotic camera system to obtain comparable images of the brighter
H-alpha regions in an emission line of ionized sulfur (SII). The SII/H-alpha
ratio is a useful discriminator between regions that are heated by the
ultraviolet light of embedded stars and regions that are heated by supersonic
shock waves produced by supernova remnants and stellar winds. These measurements
will contribute to understanding the astrophysical nature of ionized regions in
the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. ***
