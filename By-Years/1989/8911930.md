The XXII Interamerican Congress of Psychology to be held in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, June 25-30, 1989 will provide an opportunity for US and Latin
American psychologists to discuss research ongoing in all areas of psychology.
Partial travel support will be provided for a small number of American
participants. Encompassing all aspects of the discipline of psychology, The
Interamerican Congresses of Psychology, sponsored every two years by the
Interamerican Society of Psychology (SIP), have since 1953 been the single most
important forum for exchange among psychologists and other behavioral scientists
in the western hemisphere concerned with the comparative and cross-cultural
aspects of human behavior. The program will feature 52 invited speakers,
including many eminent US scientists, along with over 1800 other scientific
presentations in symposia, literature reviews, poster sessions, and roundtables.
The outcome of this meeting, as with previous Congresses, will be increased
collaboration between US and Latin American scientists, particularly on cross-
cultural issues, and a positive influence on experimental behavioral research in
Latin America.
