Rodlike polymers are the basic components of various high -- temperature, high
-- strength materials. Conventional processing methods are often inadequate for
rods, so they must be processed from concentrated solutions -- most often into
fibers and films. However, the solution behavior or rodlike polymers remains
poorly studied compared to random coil polymers. Additionally, it is important
to understand the dynamics of mixtures of rodlike and random coil polymers, as
these mixtures are the precursors to composite materials in which rodlike
polymers reinforce a conventional random coil matrix. Optical studies of the
diffusion of helical polypeptides have already revealed much about concentrated,
isotropic solutions. These studies will be extended to mixtures with random
coils and also to liquid crystalline solutions. A special class of polypeptide,
the poly(alkylglutamate)s, will facilitate these studies. Thermoreversible
gelation of rodlike polymers is a baffling phenomenon, but an important one if
rodlike polymers are to be developed into three -- dimensional materials and not
just fibers and films. Poly(alkylglutamate)s and other polypeptides will be used
to study the gelation of rodlike polymers. Light scattering and tracer diffusion
measurements will help to establish the relative importance of aggregation and
phase separation in gelation.
