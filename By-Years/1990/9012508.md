In this project, the P.I. will study the annual cycle of thermocline variability
in the equatorial Pacific, using a new compilation of hydrographic data. Tests
indicate that a vertically propagating annual Rossby wave can be resolved by the
available data. Comparisons will be made with linear wave theory, and attempts
will be made to relate the observed waves with wind forcing.
