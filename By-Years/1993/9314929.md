9314929 Gary The solar array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory is uniquely
capable of mapping solar flares and active regions over the entire microwave
spectrum. During the next year an additional antenna will be added to the array
which will further improve its resolution. The solar array will be used in
connection with other radio instruments, optical telescopes and satellites to
study the conditions in active regions on the Sun. Progress is anticipated in
understanding the triggering, particle acceleration and energy transport in
solar flares as well as the coronal structure of active regions. ***
