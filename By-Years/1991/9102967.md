This project will consider controllability of systems using minimin control,
linear dynamics using minimax control, optimal control of rapidly oscillating
systems, and multiple minimization problems. Weak solutions, in particular
viscosity solutions, will be used intensively throughout. The effect of inertial
controls rather than measurable controls will be examined in the case of rapidly
oscillating systems. These studies have applications in engineering design,
economics, decision theory, and a variety of control systems.
