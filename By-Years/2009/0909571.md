This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to determine how
arctic zooplankton communities have varied over interannual to decadal periods,
from regional to panarctic scales. The PI states the specific hypotheses that
zooplankton biomass may be increasing, due to environmental changes, and that
the prevalence of the dominant copepod in deeper waters, Calanus hyperboreus,
may be eroded by smaller congeneric species. He will assess the validity of this
hypothesis by (1) filling the regional data gap over the Canada Basin through
analysis of zooplankton samples collected or to be collected by the himself
between 2002-2011; (2) assembling available zooplankton and environmental data
throughout the Arctic into a single data portal for a GIS-based and spatially
explicit modeling of community structures, species abundances, biomass, and
distributions; and (3) rescuing precious older ?unpublished? data sets and grey
literature worldwide, many of which he has already assembled or will have full
access to, that will strengthen and extend his modeling efforts back more than
50 years.
