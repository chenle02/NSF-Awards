Davies 9421184 The studies in this proposal focus on the relation between the
structures and loss properties of a series of perovskite dielectrics. While
these tantalate-based oxides have the lowest losses of all the microwave
ceramics, optimization of their properties requires careful control of their
chemistry, processing, and degree of structural order. Preliminary
investigations made on one of these systems have indicated that the dielectric
losses associated with internal domain boundaries can be reduced by introducing
selected chemical substituents. The proposal describes a series of experimental
studies designed to understand and explain this effect, and outlines new
approaches for improving the loss properties of other petrovskite dielectrics.
Many aspects of this work are being conducted in close collaboration with
scientists from industry, and several aspects of this study are expected to have
a direct impact on the processing and production commercial ceramic resonator
systems. %%% The goals of this work are to understand what aspects of the
structures of the existing microwave dielectric materials are critical in
realizing an optimized electronic performance, and to use these crystal chemical
insights to enhance the performance of other oxide systems. ***
