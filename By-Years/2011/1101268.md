The proposed research covers the representation theory of Lie superalgebras,
Hecke algebras and affine Lie algebras over fields of characteristic zero as
well as over fields with positive characteristics. In recent work, the PI and
collaborators have obtained a conceptual solution to the irreducible character
problem in various parabolic categories of classical Lie superalgebras. The PI
proposes a new approach to attack the well-known open problem on the irreducible
characters for the FULL category O for Lie superalgebras. The PI also proposes
to develop a spin analogue of the invariant theory for Weyl groups and a spin
analogue of Hecke algebras. These formulations call for the computation and
comparison of spin fake degrees and spin generic degrees, as a striking spin
analogue of a deep classical theory (which is intimately related to finite
groups of Lie type). The PI further proposes to initiate a systematic study of
the modular representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras in positive
characteristic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical language used to describe
symmetries in nature often involves the concepts of groups, algebras, or their
variants. Wang's research has helped to solve long standing old problems for Lie
superalgebras (part of the language used in describing the supersymmetry), and
also to raise many exciting research problems. The PI's research has attracted
students to the active area of representation theory of groups and algebras. He
is a popular speaker for summer and winter schools aiming at training graduate
students and young mathematicians at the beginning of their careers.
