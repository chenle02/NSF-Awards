9412010 Nerem This project is on research to develop a tissue culture model for
blood vessels. The model involves the culture of smooth muscle cells within a
collagen gel to produce a support for a monolayer of endothelial cells. There
are three specific aims: (1) to continue the evaluation of a reconstituted blood
vessel system under steady state and pulsatile flow; (2) to optimize the
collagen/smooth muscle cell matrix within the model blood vessel; and (3) to
extend these cell culture models to a tubular configuration. ***
