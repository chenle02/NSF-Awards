The SUPER Program has completed its field work and most of the ensuing
laboratory analyses. SUPER stands for SUbarctic Pacific Ecosystem Research, a
program studying the pelagic production dynamics of the Gulf of Alaska,
sponsored by NSF. Six expeditions into the Gulf of Alaska were mounted for a
large variety of observations. The goal was to understand the absence of
phytoplankton blooms in this region, together with continuously high
concentrations of nutrients like nitrate. This investigator represents an
accomplishment-based renewal (ABR) in order to prepare a full summary in book
form of the SUPER results. This also would take account of other past and
current research on the pelagic ecology of the subarctic Pacific. The SUPER
group did arrive at a new, system-level view of production dynamics in the
subarctic Pacific. This system level view will be the basis for developing the
summary for the SUPER results.
