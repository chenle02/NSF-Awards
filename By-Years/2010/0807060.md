The college, a minority-serving institution with 5300 students (91% African-
American and 5% Hispanic), is creating a Computer Science, Environmental
Science, and Mathematics Scholarship (CEMS) program to serve 28 to 30 students
per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project combines
financial support with a strategic plan based on current research related to the
retention of minority students in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) areas. The scholarships are being augmented by support
services including orientation sessions for entering freshman and transfer
students, enhanced faculty-student interaction through career development and
research-oriented workshops, monthly symposium with representatives from
industry and national research laboratories, midterm grade reporting for early
intervention, peer-tutoring workshops in gateway courses and major courses, and
student field trips to research centers, national laboratories and research
centers. These activities are intended to support the retention of students
through their BS degrees as well as provide opportunities for potential career
paths or graduate studies post-graduation. The scholars have opportunities to
participate in summer research programs at NASA centers or with university
partners. The rationale for the scholarship program is based on the natural
clustering among Computer Science, Environmental Science and Math students as
they take common science and math core required
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is increasing the
number of the minority and female students obtaining BS degrees in STEM areas of
national need and contributing to a diverse workforce. It also contributes to
the number of underrepresented students pursuing graduate degrees in Computer
Science, Environmental Science and Mathematics.
