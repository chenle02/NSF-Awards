GameSec is a leading research conference focused on analytical models based on
information, communication, optimization, decision, and control theories that
are applied to diverse security topics. At the same time, the connection between
theoretical models and real world security problems are emphasized to establish
the important feedback loop between theory and practice. The conference helps to
promote a "science of security" with a theoretical foundation that helps us
understand security risk in a principled way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
provides travel support to allow more students to attend the 2014 conference.
Preferences for travel support are based on the credentials of the students,
with a focus on attracting women and underrepresented minority students to
support their participation in this event.
