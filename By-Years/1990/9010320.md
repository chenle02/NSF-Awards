This is a proposal to develop microbiosensors that can measure biochemical
substances at the cellular level. Substances whose activity is to be measured
include ascorbic acid, free fatty acids, free radicals and superoxide dismutase.
The sensor is based on the PI's previously developed miniature oxygen, hydrogen
peroxide, and pH electrodes. The tip of the micropipette containing the
electrodes will be covered with a membrane; the micropipette will be filled with
appropriate commercial enzymes that are selected on the basis of the substance
to be measured. Since oxygen- derived free radicals are known to damage vital
tissues, sensors to measure substances associated with free radical activity
could substantially contribute to the gaining of basic knowledge aimed at
preventing and treating oxygen-related injury.
