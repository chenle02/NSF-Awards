This project is to support travel for 20 American geographers to attend the
International Geographical Union Congress in Sydney, Australia, August 21-26,
1988. The IGU is organized to promote the study of geographical problems,
initiate and coordinate research, and provide a forum for international
scientific discussion and publication. The Congress is expected to attract some
1500 participants to its general assembly and related working sessions. The
project will provide an opportunity for selected geographers to present papers
at the Congress, interact with foreign colleagues, generate cooperative research
projects, and exchange scientific information and knowledge.
