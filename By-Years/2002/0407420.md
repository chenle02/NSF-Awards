The proposal requests funding to help dray the cost of organizing the 2004
Meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF2004) of the American
Physical Society. The meeting is to be held on the campus of the University of
California at Riverside on August 27-31, 2004. The latest results from particle
physics, theoretical physics, particle astrophysics, cosmology and heavy ion
physics will be presented in both plenary and parallel
sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will include opportunities for the
general public to interact with the physicists and there is planned to be a
public physics lecture by a well-known speaker. The funds will be used entirely
to support graduate students and postdocs, who otherwise could not afford to
attend the conference, through reduced conference fees and partial travel
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
