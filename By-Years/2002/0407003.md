The proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
Fifth International Workshop on Electron-Electron Interactions at TeV Energies.
It will take place from December 12-14, 2003 on the Santa Cruz campus of the
University of California. The funds will be used to help support graduate
students and young scientists who otherwise could not afford to attend the
meeting.
