This project seeks to develop a Network-centric classification as the central
component of a Cyber Threat Intelligence framework. This framework will permit
security personnel to analyze a broad spectrum of information harvested from
different sources. In addition, the research proposes an analytical approach to
the study of network structure and the prediction of network behavior in the
context of this framework. The ability to accurately model these characteristics
provides a strong theoretical and practical basis for the Cyber Threat
Intelligence framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
