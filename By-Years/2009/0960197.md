This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI-R2) award is to
acquire a high resolution x-ray tomography apparatus. A parallel computing
cluster with associated software is acquired as part of the system for fast
three-dimensional structure re-generation to accommodate the use by multiple
researchers. A cooling stage will provide a constant temperature environment. A
loading stage will allow in-situ observation of a sample under load.

The instrument will be accessed by multiple users on projects that require the
ability to use non-destructive techniques to determine the microstructures as
well as their evolution under deformations. The instrument will be made
available to all users at the university, and industry in the region as well as
in the nation. The equipment will help enhance the training of graduate and
undergraduate students, including a substantial number of under-represented
minority and women students, and will also support student projects at nearby
high schools.
