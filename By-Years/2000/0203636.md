The PIs plan mapping and sampling features on the Cocos and Nazca plates to
provide a basis for inferring the properties of the subducted Cocos plate under
Central America. The basic premise is that the Nazca plate south of Grijalva was
formerly contiguous with Cocos plate under Nicaragua and parts of Costa Rica and
that this fossil plate boundary could form an important structure in the down-
going slab. Because a small fragment remains unsubducted, the investigators
propose to not only study it, but also it's conjugate off Peru, where much more
remains. At that locality, the structure can be mapped more thoroughly and the
results extrapolated to the subducted slab beneath Costa Rica. Further, dredging
will provide essential samples to measure the composition of the lithosphere
that is beneath the Central American arc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
