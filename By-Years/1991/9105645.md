The means by which interferons (IFNs) activate gene expression through
interaction with cellular receptors is being actively investigated. It has been
shown that intracellular human IFN-gamma can activate characteristic responses
in murine cells despite the normal species-specificity barrier presumed to be
due to the receptor. This effect is not due to induced synthesis of murine IFNs
or TNF. Experiments to be performed will determine whether other secondary
mediators could be responsible. If they are not, alternative mechanisms by which
intracellular IFN-gamma may activate gene expression and the relationship
between this response and the normal physiological pathway for IFN-gamma action
will be investigated. To examine the role of secondary mediators, the induction
of MHC class II mRNA expression in cells will be assayed in cells expressing
intracellular IFN-gamma transiently or under a regulatable promoter, or after
delivery of IFN-gamma protein by liposome fusion. Neutralizing antibodies and
inhibitors of protein synthesis will be added to such cells to block the action
or production of secondary mediators. To examine mechanisms by which
intracellular IFN-gamma can activate responses, a search will be made to
identify cytoplasmic proteins which interact with free IFN- gamma. Mutations of
the IFN-gamma molecule will be used to explore the role of C-terminal domains in
both normal extracellular and intracellular activity. The "comon wisdom" is that
inteferons exert their effects, such as induction of specific gene expression,
on target cells via receptor-mediated signal transduction. The proposed work
embraces an unconventional concept, i.e., that an extracellular ligand can have
an intracellular function. The experiments proposed will explore the hypothesis
that IFN acts directly, possibly within the nucleus, to turn on specific genes.
The information obtained from this study could turn out to be applicable to
signaling mechanisms used by other cytokines and growth factors.
