The ultimate objective of this research is to understand the role of vertical
transport of atmospheric trace gases by convective clouds. This grant provides
for the expanded analysis of an extensive set of airborne observations of
vertical profiles of the tropospheric trace gases, nitric oxide, NOy, carbon
monoxide, ozone, and non-methane hydrocarbons.
