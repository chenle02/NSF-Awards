I propose to use methods from algebraic topology in the study of knots. A knot
induces a map from the space of configurations on the knot to configurations in
the ambient manifold. With recently developed compactification technology, one
can fix boundary conditions on those configuration spaces and study the homotopy
class of this induced map relative to those boundary conditions. Such an
approach was pioneered by Bott and Taubes in de Rham theory and by the PI and
his collaborators in homotopy theory itself. Results of Volic may be used to
show that all Bott-Taubes invariants, and thus all real finite-type invariants,
are homotopy invariants of this induced map. Already in lowest degree, new
geometric understanding arises from studying the induced map directly homotopy,
and I propose to continue this study in higher degrees. I also propose to more
deeply understand the role of operads in this theory, as well as to extend these
techniques to study link homotopy.

Knot theory, the study of embedded loops in space, is one of the oldest and most
distinguished fields in topology. For most of its life, knot theory has
developed in parallel with other subfields of topology. But in the last twenty
years, the field has changed dramatically from the influence of previously
unrelated fields. In particular, quantum field theory has provided ground-
breaking new constructions. One can try to define the energy of a knot as an
invariant, but in order to do so one must "integrate over all connections", that
is over all ways of putting an "energy field" on the space in which the knot
lives. Such an integral does not exist in precise mathematical form, but through
the standard perturbative expansion in quantum field theory one can write down
Feynman integrals which are meant to approximate it to finite order. Topologists
have made such integrals precise and rigorous in this setting, and shown that
they provide a basis for the finite-type invariants of knots. But topologists
would like to reconnect the theory to more standard constructions in topology.
The PI's previous work marks the beginning of such a connection. New geometric
insight was gained in the process, as the simplest quantum invariant can now be
computed by counting instances of a line intersecting a knot in exactly four
places. I hope to find both new connections with classical topology and novel
geometric interpretations in this proposed work.
