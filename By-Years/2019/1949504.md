Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of the linkages between finance,
debt, and macroeconomic outcomes, such as growing inequality, become evident
since the Great Financial Crisis. To date, no single initiative has organized
this recent empirical literature into a meaningful whole. Similarly, to date,
data sources used to address macro-finance research questions are not
integrated. This project fills these gaps by disseminating the new techniques
and datasets used in macro-financial research and by creating an open-source
textbook that grounds each topic to its theoretical foundations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop an open-source textbook and data-
sharing platform to promote teaching and research about empirical finance and
macroeconomics (macro-finance), filling the gap for an integrated approach in
this important area. Data and instructional resources will be freely available
to students and researchers via the project website. The codebase will be
accessible on a platform for open-source software development. In addition to
standardizing currently available data on macro-financial variables, the project
will digitize new data on (i) US County Business Patterns, (ii) Global Sectoral
Credit and National Accounts, (iii) International Loan
Contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
