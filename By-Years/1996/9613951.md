The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support from NSF to
connect ten of their member institutions of higher education to the Internet.
These include: Anderson College, Anderson, SC, Bacone College, Muskogee, OK,
Bartlesville Wesleyan College, Bartlesville, OK, Caldwell College, Caldwell, NJ,
Erksine College, Due West, SC, Lon Morris College, Jacksonville, TX, Park
College, Parkville, MO, Schreiner College, Kerrville, TX, University of
Charleston, Charleston, WV and Ursuline College, Pepper Pike, OH. Each of the
institutions funded will connect to the Internet using service providers in
within their respective areas. These institutions of higher education need the
Internet connections to be able to access information resources throughout the
state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff
students of these institutions as well as the community in general.
