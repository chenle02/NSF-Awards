proposal# 9413561 PI - Scheer The STTR is an outgrowth of two different R&D
efforts leading to two product lines originally targeted to science education:
Bioluminescence and the Labless Lab DB1 TM. These two unique and very different
technologies can be combined to produce what on might call analytical chemistry
without instruments. The basic idea is to build the entire instrument into the
sampling device. Readout and detection utilizes light produced by
bioluminescence. Specificity is provided by the use of enzymes. In this project
the focus is on direct analysis of ATP using firefly luciferase coupled with
others enzyme-mediated biochemical processes which either produce or consume
ATP. The sensors utilize stable luciferase/luciferin films coupled to a
capillarity- based sample distribution system. The result will be specific,
quantitative, rapid, direct reading, inexpensive and disposable analytical
devices.
