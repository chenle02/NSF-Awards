The investigators will carry out research in relativity and relativistic
astrophysics. A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical
solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. The focus is to
track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate
the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes. These processes are
primary targets for gravitational wave detectors now being deployed, like LIGO,
and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms. The numerical solution of
this problem has proved to be remarkably difficult. The investigators will use a
new computational technique on the problem, pseudospectral collocation. This
technique has been successful in many other areas of the physical sciences, and
shows great promise for numerical relativity.

The research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental
physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong
field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with
observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the
black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's
theory? The research will also have an impact on the broader area of
computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be
used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics,
meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these
techniques are in great demand.
