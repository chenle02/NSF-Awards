The problem of determining a quantum mechanical potential from its scattering
amplitude goes back to the beginning of quantum mechanics. One aspect of the
problem which has received little attention is finding data sets for which the
problem is well-posed, i.e., that the mapping from the potential to the
scattering data set is continuously invertible. This work focuses on one such
set, the so-called backscattering data. It is the data which occurs from the
restriction of the scattering amplitude to the direction opposite to the
direction of the incident plane wave. In dimensions three and higher, the
relationship of the backscattering and potential is well documented. In two
dimensions or in cases where the data is restricted to half-spaces, there are
obstacles which will be analyzed during the course of this project. Other work
on inverse scattering will focus on the wave equation with variable speed of
sound and the Schrodinger equation with both electric and magnetic potential. A
second line of investigation concerns hyperbolic partial differential equations
defined in domains with wedgelike boundaries and the propagation of
singularities of solutions of initial-boundary value problems for second order
equations in the presence of boundary wedges. Partial differential equations
form the backbone of mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena
which involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials and
energy are known to obey certain general laws which are expressible in terms of
the interactions and relationships between partial derivatives. The inverse
problems described in this proposal play a central role in these studies. Their
object is not to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative and
quantitative meaning from them.
