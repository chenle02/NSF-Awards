The majority of species of animals have tightly regulated intrinsic
reproductive cycles that are governed by such things as the time of the year or
the availability of food. However, in some species reproductive function is
governed by non-verbal physical cues, such as chemical attractants or
pheromones. These chemicals provide information about the reproductive status of
potential mates and may trigger reproductive cyclicity in some species. Dr. John
Harder is investigating the reproductive, hormonal and neurobiological
consequences of pheromone exposure in a model system completely dependent on
chemical signaling. These exciting investigations will advance comparative
reproductive biology and provide a unique model for the study of chemical
activation on neuronal substrates. In addition, these investigations will have a
significant impact on our understanding of the diversity of reproductive
strategies used in wild animals and may facilitate the application of that
understanding to the preservation of species in the wild and in captivity.
