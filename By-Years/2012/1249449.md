Most modern microprocessors support some form of vector operations that allow
the same operation to be applied to small vectors of arguments simultaneously.
Studies have shown that use of these instructions can improve the performance of
many scientific codes by a factor of 2 or more. Unfortunately, the state of the
art in autovectorization falls far short of this goal, only achieving
improvements of 20-30% on the same codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While studies
have shown that current autovectorizing compilers do not identify all of the
opportunities for vectorization, little is known about why they fail to do so.
The PIs plan to evaluate tradeoffs between different compiler optimizations and
vectorization in an effort to understand how optimization choices affect
opportunities for autovectorization. They will use an extensive set of
benchmarks to evaluate these tradeoffs. This research will make it possible to
develop better autovectorizing compilers by avoiding optimization choices that
interfere with autovectorization. The performance benefits of such compilers
will improve the performance of applications ranging from multimedia software to
scientific computing.
