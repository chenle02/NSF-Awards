This project investigators scheduling protocols for the transmission of
multimedia traffic in a network. Specifically, the research covers the following
areas: point to point transmission of general multimedia objectsthe support of
multicast communications fault-tolerance. The goals of the project are the
development of strong theoretical foundations for the study of such problems and
subsequently finding protocols that perform well in practice.
