This proposal explores mixed-mode fracture in two aluminum alloys and a titanium
aluminide alloy. Variations in microstructure allow for analysis of the role of
second phase precipitates and dispersoids on the fracture process. Variables
include particle shape and volume fraction, temperature, and matrix condition.
Mechanical behavior to be examined includes fracture toughness, plane strain
tension and compression behavior, and axisymmmetric tensile flow. Scanning and
transmission electron microscopy are used to characterize the microstructure.
Both theoretical and experimental approaches are outlined, the theory examining
shear bands in such materials. The shear bands are represented by a tilt wall
dislocation array, a portion of which can breakaway and propagate, interacting
with dispersed particles in the vicinity. %%% The fracture of structural metal
alloys is important to a wide variety of applications. This research advances
our understanding of crack propagation in complex alloys and should provide
avenues of applied research that will lead to improvement of mechanical
properties of structural materials.
