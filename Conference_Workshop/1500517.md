Abstract (Uhlmann, 1500517):

The award will support graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to
participate in the Applied Inverse problems 2015 (AIP 2015), be held in
Helsinki, Finland, May 25-29, 2015, as well as a summer school held also in
Helsinki, May 19-22, 2015.

AIP 2015 is one of a series of AIP Conferences aimed to provide a primary
international forum for academic and industrial researchers working on all
aspects of inverse problems, such as mathematical modelling, analytic and
geometric methods, computational approaches, numerical algorithms etc. It will
cover a broad spectrum of the applications of inverse problems, focusing on
recent developments in medical imaging, determination of defects in materials
homogenization and inverse problems, geometric inverse problems, remote sensing,
industrial applications, numerical and regularization methods in inverse
problems, and also, invisibility and cloaking. More information of the
conference can be found at the website http://aip2015.fips.fi/. The NSF support
from this award will allow a financial package for US students and postdocs to
participate in the conference and the summer school, and will significantly
enhance the ability to recruit an outstanding and diverse group of researchers
to work in the area of inverse problems.
