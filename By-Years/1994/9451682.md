9451682 Healy The project will establish the HPLC method as a fundamental
instrumental component in the biochemistry laboratory curriculum. The HPLC will
be used for experiments involving peptide structure determination,
conformational and kinetic analysis of small antibiotics, protein isolation and
enzymatic active site analysis. Additionally experiments involving modern
reverse-phase and chiral HPLC techniques will be incorporated into the second
semester organic laboratory.
