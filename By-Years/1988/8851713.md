Eight work stations, four computer-aided modeling machines, and supporting
software are provided for a computer-aided drafting and manufacturing
laboratory. This laboratory will offer a relatively inexpensive facility to give
students hands-on experience in computer- aided manufacturing. The facility will
be used in two contact classes in mechanical engineering and will support
several others on student projects. One of the two contact classes will be
required of all students in mechanical engineering to give them an introduction
to CAM. The equipment proposed will be such that each student will be required
to design (on a workstation) a simple part, development the NC information, and
then machine the part in wax on the computer-aided modeling machines. In an
elective course on CAD/CAM, the students will be given much more extensive
projects. In a project course on the design of experiments, the equipment will
be made available for the design and fabrication of small parts required in
various experiments. The CAD part of the facility will also be used by students
in a senior design project course and in a senior/graduate student elective
course on computer aided design. A low-end workstation approach is taken for the
facility because of the low cost involved and because more and more of the
students who graduate from mechanical engineering will be using this type of
facility rather than large CAD/CAM facilities based on expensive mainframes.
