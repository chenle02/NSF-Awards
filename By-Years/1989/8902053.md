This is an award to support Phase II of a project, the objective of which is to
determine the feasibility of a novel system for producing grass sod using
organic wastes as a substitute for topsoil. In this system, the grass seed is
germinated in organic waste spread over polyethylene film. when ready for
harvesting, the sod may be rolled like carpeting leaving the polyethylene sheet
in place for the next crop. The proposal leading to this Phase I award was
submitted in response to NSF Program Solicitation 87-8, Small Business
Innovation Research. During this phase, it was determined that it was possible
to substitute waste materials for topsoil and to produce consistently high
quality sods in as little as 5 weeks compared to 1-2 years for conventional soil
grown sods. Additional findings also revealed that the new sod required less
water, much less mowing, was lighter and required no pesticides. The research
indicated that the innovative system provides a useful product from waste
materials; several crops can be produced per year; extensive amounts of topsoil
can be saved and replaced by waste materials from which nutrient resources are
recovered that would otherwise be lost; and the waste materials are recycled
into a non-food crop thus maximizing the potential for adoption of this concept.
The concept being evaluated, if found to be economically feasible, would utilize
the resource potential of otherwise wasted materials, conserve topsoil, water
and fertilizer, and improve the efficiency with which sod is produced.
