This individual investigator award will fund a project to study the
superconducting and normal state properties of electron-doped copper oxides, a
class of high-temperature superconductors, with the aim of eventually
understanding the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. The electron-
doped high-Tc superconductors have some unique properties compared to the more
prevalent, and more studied, hole-doped cuprates. A synergistic feedback between
the materials preparation of single crystals and thin films, and physical
properties is expected to lead to both higher quality materials and new insights
into the nature of the normal and superconducting states. The measurements
planned include: low temperature thermal and electrical transport, low
temperature specific heat, single particle tunneling, Raman scattering and
optical reflectivity, photoemission, and penetration depth. All measurements
will be done at zero magnetic field to probe the superconducting state and at
fields above the critical field to probe the low temperature normal state. This
project provides excellent training for graduate students and post doctoral
research associates in a multidisciplinary area of research. It will expose them
to research tools and ideas that will be useful for careers in industry and
academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origin of high- temperature superconductivity
in copper oxides is one of the major unsolved problems in physics. An
understanding of high-Tc superconductors is likely to impact not only
fundamental condensed matter physics, but also potential applications of these
materials as improved electronics devices and current carrying wires. This
individual investigator award will fund a project that has as its goal to
understand electron-doped high-Tc superconductors. These materials form a subset
of all the high-Tc copper oxides, but they have very unusual properties that
need to be understood. The experiments proposed in this project will provide
excellent training for graduate students in a multidisciplinary area of
research. It will expose students to research tools and ideas that will be of
great use in industry.&lt;br/&gt;
