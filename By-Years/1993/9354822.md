9354822 McDonald This project improves student awareness of science and
technology and increases the retention of freshman students. This goal requires
a curriculum development process that creates a pilot course to provide a survey
of modern technology. The pilot course leads to a permanent offering in
engineering technology that will serve as an orientation course for technology
students. The course also serves as a general education elective course to
provide general students, including teacher education majors, with a survey of
science in modern technology. The course uses active learning experiences as an
orientation process to foster student success in technical careers. These
learning experiences use motivational laboratory exercises to explore modern
technology while improving the students' problem solving, communication, and
study skills. These laboratory exercises present modern technology in automated
manufacturing and robotics, computer-aided design and manufacturing, and
electronics and computer technology. Women, Native American Indian, and
undecided students are encouraged to enroll in the survey course. This course
increases their technical literacy and encourage their pursuit of engineering
and science related careers.
