9319226 Paffenhofer The long-term goal of this research is to identify, describe
and quantify key processes which govern the abundance, composition and
distribution of zooplankton in the ocean. The main hypothesis is that both
signal perception, and the ability to respond to signals, determine if a
predator captures prey, of if the prey escapes from the predator. The objectives
of this work were triggered by ongoing studies on prey and predator behavior.
Aside from major differences between species, a range from small to major
differences within species were observed. Behavior observations alone appear to
be insufficient to comprehend a stage's range of capabilities. This work will
determine the abundance and distribution of chemo- and mechanosensors on the
cephalic appendages of nauplii, early copepodid stages, and adult females of
four species of marine planktonic copepods: and ontogenetic changes in sensor
types. Data obtained in the study will further knowledge on the ecological
significance of predator/prey responses in marine plankton. ***
