This project involves the development of a constitutive model with no adjustable
parameters for predicting the effects of the manufacturing process on the
mechanical properties of engineering polymers. This ambitious research, if
successful, will predict the Newtonian flow of polymers fluid, the
solidification process during cooling and the three dimensional stress-strain
relation including ductile failure of the glassy solid.
