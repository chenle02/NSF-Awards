This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacific STEM Teaching Pathways (PSTP)
is a collaboration among the Pacific University Division of Natural Sciences,
the College of Education, and several local Oregon high-needs K-12 school
districts. Its purpose is to increase the number of exemplary K-12 STEM teachers
by targeting two specific candidate pools: Pacific University undergraduate STEM
majors and career-changing STEM professionals. Individuals with no secondary
school experience but interested in making teaching a career are strongly urged
to complete a 30 hour volunteer internship with a mentor teacher. PSTP is
providing up to two years of Noyce Scholarship support for 35 STEM teaching
candidates, who are obligated for two years of service in a high needs school
district for each year of support received. Teachers graduate with a Master of
Arts in Teaching and are supported with an induction program for three years.
