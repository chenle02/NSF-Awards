summer residential and commuter, Young Scholars program in Biology and
Mathematics for 79 students entering grades 10 and 11. The Program involves the
biology students in laboratory projects guided by faculty, and in lectures and
discussions on enzymes, molecular genetics, and neurochemistry. Mathematics
students explore areas of research including number theory, geometric
optimization, chaos, and statistics. All students have a computer laboratory
experience and all will engage in follow-up activities during the academic year.
