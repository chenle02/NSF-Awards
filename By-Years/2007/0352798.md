This is a Dissertation Research proposal by Douglas Anderson PI and Julie Esdale
CoPI, Brown University, to examine existing collections, data-bases, and planned
excavations of archaeological assemblages from the Brooks Range, Alaska of the
middle Holocene period in order to answer some fundamental questions concerning
hi-latitutde hunter-gatherer adaptations. The National Park Service is the
primary funding source, the funding from this proposal will be utilized to
facilitate local Alaska Native community involvement in the project and provide
supplement funds for radio-carbon dating and travel to museum collections.
