Researchers propose to build a tool that could be used on top of existing cloud
storage services to enable secure document management in the cloud. In essence,
using our client side apps developed for different platforms, all the documents
will be automatically encrypted before they are sent to the cloud and stored in
the cloud in an encrypted format. Therefore, the cloud service provider will not
have any access to stored documents. In addition, encryption keys will be
automatically managed by our server side solution. Using techniques developed as
a part of prior research, the tool's server side implementation will provide
efficient search over encrypted data, role-based access control, secure document
sharing, and audit log generation. Furthermore, due to the proposed design that
separates encryption keys into multiple pieces, any potential hacking into our
server cannot be used to recover any document stored in the cloud. In addition,
our server will never store any information related to documents in plaintext
form. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will allow researchers to understand
best practices in managing encrypted data in the context of cloud and mobile
services. In addition, it will allow them to see the performance and limitations
of current encrypted data management solutions (including ours) in real
operating environments. Longer-term, if this project is successful, it could
substantially decrease the privacy and economic risks of information disclosure
due to usage of cloud and mobile services. This could have a direct economic
impact, as well as increasing trust in using cloud based document management
services, opening the way for new applications that would today be considered
infeasible due to lack of necessary security and compliance mechanisms.
