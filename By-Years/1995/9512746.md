9512746 Brand This award renews support of a project aimed at development of
improved methods for cryopreservation of single-celled algae, and use of these
methods for the freezing of strains now found in the UTEX collection of
freshwater algae. The collection includes a variety of algae, both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic. The use of cryopreservation allows more confidence that the
unique genetic characteristics of organisms are being preserved than does the
use of serial transfer, the most common method for maintenance of stocks of the
kinds of algae found in the UTEX collection. In addition, the development and
use of such methods should lessen the time and expense required for routine
storage of such strains by collections and by individual investigators who work
with these organisms. ***
