The University of New Hampshire believes that the advent of parallel computing
introduces an important new dimension to computer science and that the study of
parallel computers, algorithms, data structures, and programming languages
enhances and extends many topics learned else- where in the curriculum.
Consequently, they are introducing a new undergraduate computer science elective
entitled "Parallel Computers and Algorithms." The aim of the course is to
introduce upper-division computer science majors to fundamental theoretical
results and give them experience implementing parallel algorithms on an actual
parallel computer. They are purchasing for hypercube workstations, to be used
for program development and debugging. Designated time periods will be made
available on the department's 64-processor research hypercube, enabling students
to benchmark their parallel programs on a larger machine. Their department is in
a particularly good position to integrate parallel computing into the
undergraduate curriculum. Students entering this course will have a background
in computer architecture, operating systems, and analysis of algorithms; the
curriculum is well developed, having grown out of graduate course taught at this
university for the past five years; and suitable textbooks are now available.
