In the past decade, the analysis of massive, high-dimensional, time-varying data
sets has become a critical issue for a large number of scientists and engineers.
Observations across several disciplines, by researchers studying dramatically
different problems, suggest the existence of geometrical and topological
structures in many data sets, and much current research is devoted to modeling
and exploiting these structures to aid in prediction and information extraction.
Recent work by the investigators, among others, has shown that integrating
statistical methodologies with ideas derived from computational topology and
diffusion geometry often leads to strikingly superior results than by
conventional means. The investigators now propose to bring these methods into
the mathematics/statistics curriculum and departmental structure in a formal
way, by establishing a vertically integrated program of undergraduate and
graduate research and education. This activity has broad support from programs
within the Division of Mathematical Sciences, including Applied Mathematics,
Computational Mathematics, Statistics and Topology programs, as well as Division
of Mathematical Sciences Workforce Program. This involves new undergraduate
courses in the core theoretical areas, graduate topics courses, an extensive
summer research program for undergraduates, as well as year long seminars aimed
at both graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, the investigators will
disseminate their ideas via summer workshops aimed at small-college faculty, and
methodology workshops directed to faculty from other large research
institutions.



The need to analyze massive, complex data arises in a wide variety of scientific
areas of national importance, including for example satellite image analysis,
medical genomics, and internet security. The investigators propose a program of
training future mathematical scientists to attack these new types of problems.
The program will be vertically integrated, fostering extensive collaboration
between post-docs, undergraduate and graduate students, and senior faculty, and
will comprise a dynamic mixture of theoretical coursework and hands-on research
activity. Participants in the program will gain valuable professional experience
to distinguish them in the industrial and academic job-market.
