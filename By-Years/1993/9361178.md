9361178 Zaidi Laser application for noncontact temperature measurement of a
semiconductor wafer is proposed. The technique can be applied for either
chemical vapor deposition or rapid thermal processing systems. The method is
based on thermal expansion of a semiconductor wafer, and uses speckle patterns
generated from the back side (rough surface) of the wafer. Speckle patterns are
generated by coherent illumination by two symmetrically incident laser beams.
Speckle patterns are recorded at various temperatures and subtracted from an
initial frame stored at a known temperature. Speckle decorrelation takes place
as number of fringes approaches typical speckle size. Signal-to-noise ratio of
the speckle fringes is improved by incorporating single-step phase shift in our
data acquisition and processing system. Temperature measurements up to 400-deg
are demonstrated with a single reference stored frame. Fast Fourier Transform of
speckle fringe patterns is applied for calculation of speckle fringe period of
extract temperature information. A detailed investigation of these techniques is
proposed for speckle temperature measurements up to 1000-deg. 1. Potential
applications in RTP and CVD systems. 2. Improvement in material synthesis using
better temperature during fabrication. *** v s t I $ $ ( F / ! ! / 1 Courier
