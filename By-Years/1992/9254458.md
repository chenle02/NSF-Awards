9254458 August, John This 3-year project aims at giving 3 groups of 24 well-
prepared, motivated high school teachers from the Mid-Atlantic region an indepth
experience in mathematical modeling. Participating schools are asked to send
teams (consisting of 1 mathematics and 1 science teacher) to a 1-year (spring-
summer-fall) program. The capstone of the program is the week the teachers spend
on-site at the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, working on modeling
problems of current interest to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the
Refuge (for example, beach erosion, migration, traffic, and the like). In the 6
months prior to the summer field experience, the teachers will learn some of the
mathematics that underlies modeling by attendiing 6 2-day workshops. In the
post-summer fall semester, the teachers turn their attention to such educational
issues as: how to use their summer experience to their students'advantage;
writing lesson plans in modeling; sharing their knowledge with other teachers;
etc. The project emphasizes writing, and the results of the teachers' work
(reports, charts, graph, etc.) will be made available to the Wildlife Service
and the 1.5 million annual visitors to the Refuge. The project evaluation will
focus on changes in the teachers, their classrooms, their colleagues, and their
schools. ***
