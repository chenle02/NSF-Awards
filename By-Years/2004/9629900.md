The focus of this research may be divided into five areas. First, asymmetric
synthesis methodology involving pseudoephedrine as a chiral auxiliary will be
developed. Second, the syncytium-forming inhibitor terpestacin will be
synthesized. Third, the HIV protease inhibitor L-696,474 will be prepared.
Fourth, new synthetic methodology will be developed for the synthesis of
allenes, for the reductive transposition of allylic alcohols, and for the
production of radicals from alcohols for use in deoxygenation and cyclization
reactions. Fifth, methodology for the the sequencing of polypeptides and
proteins from the carboxyl terminus will be developed. With this prior award,
the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew G. Myers
of the Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.
Professor Myers will focus his work on the development of a wide variety of
synthetic methods that will provide new tools for the elaboration of important
organic molecules.
