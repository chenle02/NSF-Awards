The nonlinear response of minor species in the mesosphere-lower-thermosphere
(MLT) region to sheer flows in gravity waves is investigated. Airglow signatures
that are a consequence of this nonlinear response are isolated for the purpose
of interpreting existing and future measurements. A nonlinear model previously
used to successfully investigate dynamical effects of gravity waves on the
ambient MLT region is expanded to include the response of chemically active
species to sheer flows. Subsequent response of related quantities, like
populations of vibrationally or rotationally excited species and the energy
level populations of those, are determined for the expressed purpose of
interpreting airglow measurements.
