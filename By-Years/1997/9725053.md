The goal of this project is to develop test procedures for synchronous
sequential circuits to produce high quality solutions taking into account the
size and complexity of modern circuits. Quality is measured by the fault
coverage, the defect coverage, and the test sequence length. To handle size and
complexity, high quality solutions are being derived using limited run time and
memory. New heuristics and techniques for test generation, test compaction and
design-for-testability to address this need are being explored.
