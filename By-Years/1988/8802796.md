This project is mathematical research in perturbation theory for problems in
classical mechanics and related areas. The essential difficulty to be overcome
is that one is working near resonances that lead to very large terms in the
perturbation expansion. These are overcome by the techniques of the so-called
K.A.M. theory, which gives a more sophisticated way of handling such
perturbations. The numerical bounds given by a straightforward application of
K.A.M. are not sharp. The main objective of the present project is to sharpen
the bounds to values that are close to best possible. The method is to explore
various strategies for obtaining the bounds by use of a computer program that
automates the process of finding rigorous bounds through the use of a sort of
interval arithmetic in Banach spaces of functions.
