This REU program in Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Arkansas
seeks to motivate a diverse group of students to pursue careers in scientific
research. Within our 8-state region, undergraduate students will be selected
from academic institutions with limited research opportunities. A key facet of
this development will be the opportunity given each participant to present their
research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a summary of their
work in a journal format that will be compiled for distribution to their home
institution. The participants will visit local chemistry and nanotechnology
start-up companies and a national laboratory (National Center for Toxicological
Research, Jefferson, AR). The participants will be provided an experience which
will not only enable them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical
research, but they will be exposed to an environment indicative of that to be
expected in graduate school. The broadest impact of this program will be the
preparation of scientists for global competition in science and innovation. The
majority of the University of Arkansas REU participants over the years have
continued their studies post baccalaureate in chemistry or biochemistry, and
these individuals have now assumed positions of responsibility in the technical
infrastructure of the chemical industry, as faculty at 4-year and Ph.D.-granting
academic institutions, and as technical staff at a variety of Federal
Laboratories and Agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
