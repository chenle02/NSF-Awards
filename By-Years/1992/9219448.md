This project will support an Algebraic Geometry Program for Women Students, to
be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, CA
from May 17-28, 1993. A group of fifteen women who are graduate or advanced
undergraduate students will be invited to participate. Participants in the
Special Year in Algebraic Geometry at the MSRI will give lectures about the
subject and their own work. In addition, a mentoring activity will take place
with the purpose of providing further encouragement to the participants.
