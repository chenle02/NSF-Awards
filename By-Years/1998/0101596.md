The goal of this project will be to analyze the effect of the mixing state of
aerosols on global and regional direct forcing and temperatures. This effort
involves the development of global-scale baseline aerosol model simulations and
comparison with actual observations and climatologies. The project will
investigate the global- and regional-scale mixing state of aerosol-particles and
the resulting direct radiative forcing and feedbacks of aerosol-particles to
climate. Aerosols to be investigated include (a) fossil-fuel soot and organic
matter, (b) biomass burning gases and particles, (c) sulfur dioxide and
resulting sulfate.
