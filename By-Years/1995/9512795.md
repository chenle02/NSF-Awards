9512795 Chollet This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in plant biochemistry and physiology between Raymond Chollet at the University
of Nebraska and Jean Vidal at the Plant Biotechnology Institute of the
University of Paris, Orsay campus. The investigators propose to continue their
collaborative studies on signaling pathways for the regulation of C4
photosynthesis. They propose to investigate the role of a key enzyme -
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in the protoplasts of C4 and
Crassulacean-acid-metabolisim (CAM) plants. The French investigator provides
expertise in cell biology while the U.S. investigator provides expertise in
protein kinases.
