Multipole-accelerated iterative methods for potential problems will be developed
to include automatic discretization error control, in particular, methods to
include higher-order boundary elements and automatically refine low-and high-
order elements. Two test problems with known analytical solutions specified by a
mixture of Neuman and Dirichlet boundary conditions will be used to investigate
the low-order approach and to give a direct numerical error calibration.
Utilizing the above results several localized approached will be developed with
different "Computational Cost" for the purpose of element refinements with
specified error bounds.
