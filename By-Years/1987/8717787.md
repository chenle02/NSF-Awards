The study of the dynamic behavior of engineering systems (through experiments,
modelling, and computation) is an integral part of the understanding, design,
operation, and control of engineering processes, ranging from laboratory-scale
experiments to operating chemical plants. Treating problems that range from
periodic harvesting of a bioreactor to the response of large structures to
oscillatory loads as time marching problems, initial value problems, has
traditionally provided most of the information for systems dynamics. During the
last ten years local bifurcation analysis have been developed as an alternative
method to classify the behavior of nonlinear systems. In fact, algorithms are
available for bifurcation analysis, e.g. AUTO, PITCON, DERPAR, PEFLOQ, etc. The
algorithms are based on the numerical implementation of analytical procedures
close to bifurcation points and iterative solution of nonlinear equations.
However, most of these treat only periodic responses and local bifurcations.
This research project will extend dynamic system studies to more general system
response with special emphasis on interactive graphic data manipulation at the
work station level.
