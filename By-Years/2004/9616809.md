Abstract 9616809 Mende This award provides support to continue to operate and
analyze the data from an advanced dual-wavelength intensified CCD all sky camera
at South Pole for the purpose of better understanding the aurora and Earth's
magnetosphere. The camera is substantially identical to those which the proposer
has installed in the Automatic Geophysical Observatory (AGO) array which is
being deployed over a very large area of the very high magnetic latitude portion
of the East Antarctic ice sheet. The South Pole instrument is an important
component of the overall coverage of the Antarctic upper atmosphere. The nearly
complete coverage of the magnetic polar cap afforded by the AGO- South Pole
system of imagers is especially valuable now because it complements the imaging
capabilities of the recently launched POLAR satellite of the International Solar
Terrestrial Physics Program (ISTP). ***
