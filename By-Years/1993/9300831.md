This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska in the purchase of a gas
chromatograph with a mass spectral detector (GC-MS). This state-of-the-art bench
top GC-MS is essential to meet current and future research needs of the
Chemistry Department, primarily in the synethic groups in the Department. This
instrument is essential for research in the department which includes the
following areas: 1) New catalytic transition metal mediated carbocyclizations,
2) Bioorganic approaches to novel therapeutic agents, (phosphate inhibitors,
amino acid decarboxylase inhibitors, and a chemoenzymatic approach to the
(-)-podophyllotoxin),3) New synthetic methods using highly active metals, 4)
Bioorganic and synthetic chemistry of hydroperoxides (steroselective
dioxygenation of 1,4 dienes and synthesis of hydroperoxides), 5) Intramolecular
ferromagnetic coupling in di- and trinitroxides, 6) Theoretical and experimental
physical organic chemistry (siloxane research and nitro and nitroso additions).
%%% The gas chromatograph with the mass spectral detector (GC-MS) allows one to
separate a mixture of compounds and to measure the molecule weight of each of
the individual compounds. This information is one of the essential pieces of
information needed in order to determine the molecular formula and/or the
molecular structure of newly synthesized compounds.
