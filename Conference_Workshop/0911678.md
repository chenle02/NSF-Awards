In July 2009, the twenty-first international conference entitled Formal Power
Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held at the Research
Institute for Symbolic Computation of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz,
Austria. As in the past, there will be nine plenary speakers, about twenty-five
contributed talks, and two poster/software demonstration sessions. The
continuing success of the annual FPSAC conferences stems in part from their
considerable interdisciplinary breadth---linking leading researchers in
combinatorial mathematics with strong researchers in allied fields such as pure
and applied mathematics, computer science, physics, and biology. The span of
this conference series is unique among international conferences with an
emphasis on combinatorial mathematics.

As well as its breadth, a second distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC
conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young
scientists. This is accomplished in part by choosing at least one plenary
speaker to be an ``emerging'' star and by ensuring that talented young
researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed
talks. Another special feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continuing effort
to emphasize inclusiveness among participants. The conference seeks to draw
substantial participation from groups which have been traditionally under-
represented in the mathematical sciences. FPSAC 2009 will be an excellent
opportunity for these students and junior researchers to make both domestic and
international contacts that will be of great value in their developing careers.
This grant support their attendence. Additionally, because of the variety of
past locations (2008: Chile, 2007: China, for example), FPSAC draws a truly
international crowd.
