9409339 Goldberg This research is an empirical investigation of the nature and
degree of competition in international markets. The main objective is to use
information about firm behavior in response to large exchange rate variations of
the post Bretton Woods era so as to test explicit models of market structure.
Special attention is given to the existence of trade policy restrictions, and
the effect these restrictions may have on the nature of competition. The
empirical analysis will use customs declaration data on the annual value and
quantity of exports from several sources to various destinations for selected
industries. This project is of significant interest because it provides a broad
empirical assessment of the effects of alternative trade and regulatory policies
and will inform the design of better ones. The results from the study promise to
give us a better understanding of the impact of antidumping regulations, the
effectiveness of export quantity restrictions, and the optimal strategic trade
policies under imperfect competition.
