Combinatorics deals with discrete objects such as finite sets, graphs, and
permutations. Many continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation,
lending themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. This project
investigates combinatorial structures arising in algebra and geometry, focusing
on further development of the theory and applications of cluster algebras.
Cluster algebras and the associated combinatorial and algebraic constructions
were discovered at the turn of the century. Their importance for applications in
other areas of mathematics and physics is becoming increasingly apparent. In
algebraic combinatorics, it is often the case that similar combinatorial
structures underlie seemingly unrelated mathematical phenomena. As a result,
hidden connections are revealed, allowing the transfer of insights and
techniques from one discipline to another. This project aims to extend and
deepen these connections. The project will also involve graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is motivated by several classical
areas of mathematics. The main tools come from combinatorics, including
combinatorial topology, the machinery of quiver mutations, and combinatorics of
bicolored planar graphs. Cluster algebras, and the combinatorics of quiver
mutations underlying them, have found applications in many mathematical
disciplines including representation theory, Teichm√ºller theory, mathematical
physics, and enumerative and geometric combinatorics. The project suggests new
applications of cluster theory to the study of plane algebraic curves and
related problems of singularity theory and low-dimensional topology. Other
research directions involve applications of algebraic combinatorics to discrete
and computational geometry, the study of planar projective configurations, and
discrete integrable systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
