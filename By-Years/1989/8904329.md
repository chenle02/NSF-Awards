The Sevier Desert Detachment is a major Cenozoic low-angle normal fault in
western Utah that has documented offset of more than 30 kilometers. The
extension of this fault to the south is unknown; therefore, there are several
possible explanations, including continuation of he detachment at depth,
transfer of displacement to another low-angle normal fault or termination by a
transform fault. This collaboration project will investigate the Milford area,
immediately south of the known extent of the detachment to determine which model
most closely explains how the fault displacement varies and also to determine to
what degree co-eval magmatism plays a part in extensional tectonics. Results
address displacement termination mechanisms and role of magmatism which will be
applicable to a wide range of extensional tectonic settings.
