The scientific community has been under increasing pressure from policymakers
and the public to explain how research contributes to the public good. The
community has emphasized two distinct approaches to explaining its operations
and value. The first is the use of narratives that can make the work of science
more accessible and engaging to nonscientists. The other is the use of new data
mining and analysis methods to document quantitatively the complex paths by
which research progresses and eventually contributes to a variety of societal
goals. While both of these approaches have proved useful, the goal of this
workshop is to explore ways that they might be combined into a hybrid approach
that will be even more effective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
assemble experts in the narrative and data-driven science communication
approaches with leading science researchers to discuss how these various
perspectives can be merged to define a template for a type of communication that
encompasses the appeal of narrative, the rigor of new analytic data, and the
understanding of how science works in practice&lt;br/&gt;
