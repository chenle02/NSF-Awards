Complex Manifolds and Algebraic Dynamics&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; C.

Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the behavior
of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems in settings where the methods of complex
analysis&lt;br/&gt;and algebraic geometry can be brought to bear.&lt;br/&gt;The
core of the proposal focuses on three types of&lt;br/&gt;area-preserving
dynamical systems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * Automorphisms of algebraic
surfaces,&lt;br/&gt; * Polygonal billiards and&lt;br/&gt; * Planar fluid
flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of the rich and still mysterious structure
of&lt;br/&gt;these systems entails many methods, ranging from
estimates&lt;br/&gt;for differential equations with minimal smoothness to
rigidity results &lt;br/&gt;for Lie groups acting on bundles over the moduli
space of Riemann surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From meteorology to robotics,
from fluid mechanics to&lt;br/&gt;quantum field theory, the control and
prediction of dynamical systems &lt;br/&gt;plays a central role in science and
technology.&lt;br/&gt;This project will include computer explorations of
mathematically simple&lt;br/&gt;systems that exhibit rich combinatorial
structure &lt;br/&gt;and universal analytic features. Its aim is to
&lt;br/&gt;advance the theoretical understanding of dynamics &lt;br/&gt;and
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;
