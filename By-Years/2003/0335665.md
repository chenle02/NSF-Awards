Time variability within the atmospheres of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars will be
investigated via an ongoing high spatial resolution image collection program
employing the AEOS 3.67-meter adaptive optics telescope. Narrow bandpass
filters, which are optimized for altitude discrimination in the giant planet
atmospheres, and filters already available with the AEOS instrument, will be
utilized to discriminate aerosols in all three planetary atmospheres and study
surface reflectance characteristics on Mars. Current spacecraft orbiting Mars
provide a sun-synchronous view of the entire planet each day, but do not provide
time-of-day information at most locations. The AEOS images, collected within
short windows of opportunity amongst the normal operations of the facility, will
enable the determination of the importance of time-of-day variations as
manifested by surface dust lifting and/or convective dust lofting to high
altitudes where wind speeds are large. This complements the limited time-of-day
global view provided by the orbiters. Long timeline monitoring of the giant
planet atmospheres, specifically their aerosol distribution, will assist in
better understanding the dynamics of these atmospheres. With the suspected
seasonal driving of large storm events on Saturn, monitoring during this time
period near southern summer solstice (the most recent convective storm on Saturn
occurred near northern summer solstice) might provide a 'forecast' capability,
should any storm event occur in the next several years. Long temporal coverage
will enable the investigators to look back into the data set and search for
previously unrecognized precursor signatures of convective activity in Saturn's
atmosphere.
