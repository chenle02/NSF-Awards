9314555 COULL This research project will center on determining if meiofauna are
as fully integrated into sub-tropical estuarine detritus-based food webs as they
are in similar temperate region food webs. This research project will be carried
out in cooperation with Australian colleagues who have a long-term data record
on the species composition and abundance of demersal/natant fauna in the
mangrove dominated Pumicestone Passage, Moreton Bay, which is located on the
central east coast of Australia. The project will first determine what species
of juvenile fish utilize meiofauna as a numerically abundant diet item.
Subsequently, the meiofaunal species composition in the habitats where the fish
live will be determined. This data is essential to determine if the prey fauna
in the guts have been eaten where the fish live and, if gut contents are
consistent with the resident prey available. After these two descriptive phases
of the research are completed experiments are planned to test meiofaunal removal
rates by a dominant juvenile fish predator and whether certain meiofauna are
being selected by bottom-feeding juvenile fish. These experiments will be
conducted in microcosms in a recirculating sea-water system and will follow the
protocol used in similar experiments performed previously in the PI's laboratory
in South Carolina. ***
