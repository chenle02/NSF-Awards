Extreme winds driven by bursts of star formation or active galactic nuclei can
eject gas from a galaxy, but weaker galactic winds are more prevalent and their
long-term impacts on galaxy evolution may be significant. Principal Investigator
(PI) Medling and her team will analyze the Sydney Australian Astronomical
Observatory Multi-object Integral-Field Spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey data
to identify outflows and quantify the effects of winds on their host galaxies.
The PI will form a multi-level mentoring community to build connections between
students, faculty, and staff at the University of Toledo to help students excel
in their degree program. The team will develop a public show for the Ritter
Planetarium, “The Secret Lives of Galaxies”, which will be freely available for
download in both English and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use a
3D shock diagnostic that can trace outflows 1-2 orders of magnitude weaker than
standard methods. The team will combine SAMI gas and stellar kinematics with
follow-up near-infrared observations using the Rapid Infrared Imager
Spectrometer on the Lowell Discovery Telescope and molecular gas observations
using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The combined datasets
will provide three independent tracers of shocked gas at similar spatial
resolutions: optical emission lines at 10,000K, near-infrared molecular hydrogen
lines at 500K, and carbon monoxide emission at 10-30K. This large sample of
spatially resolved measurements of the phase structure of outflowing gas is
crucial for constraining feedback prescriptions in galaxy evolution
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
