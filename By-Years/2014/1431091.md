Under the supervision of Prof. Seth Koven, Ph.D. student Hilary Buxton will
conduct a historical study of the development and application of some of the
many sciences and industries of war rehabilitation including trauma psychology,
orthopedics, prosthetics, and nutrition. The co-PI will focus on the way the way
understandings of race have shaped these sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award will result in a trained professional researcher and in a dissertation
which will include first-person accounts of the experience of racially diverse
veterans who experienced rehabilitative treatment.
