9413112 HALL This archaeological project in northwestern interior Alaska seeks
to elucidate the character of the Ipiutak and Late Prehistoric cultures which
span the transition between the 4000 year old Arctic Small Tool tradition and
recent peoples of the region. The Ipiutak culture contrasts dramatically with
Late Prehistoric cultures and various hypotheses to explain these differences
will be tested using excavated data from numerous sites. Points of comparison
will include settlement patterns, subsistence systems, house forms, tool types
and paleoenvironmental data. Although some new fieldwork will be undertaken, a
major component of the project consists of analysis of previously excavated but
unpublished material. The product will stand as a significant contribution to
anthropology and to the knowledge of cultural development in Alaska. ***
