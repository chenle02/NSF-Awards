The PI proposes a series of experiments which will investigate the effect of
decisions on emotions. The outcomes of various gambles are hypothesized to
influence participants' emotions dependent on such factors as the range of
potential outcomes and the "closeness" with which the outcome occurs. In
addition, the PI proposes to investigate how accurately an anticipated emotion
corresponds to an experienced emotion after the awaited event actually occurs.
The PI also will examine the influence of emotions on subsequent outcomes and
the hedonic experience of various outcomes in social and "real-world" contexts.
