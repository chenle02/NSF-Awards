One of the most basic questions astronomers are asked by the layman is "where
did the atoms composing the Earth and our bodies" come from?" Indeed during the
last generation astronomers have put a great deal of work into answering this
question by mapping the enrichment of interstellar gas by heavy element atoms
from stellar explosions that occur after these atoms are formed from hydrogen by
complex nucleosynthetic reactions in the deep interiors of highly evolved stars.
Although earlier work concentrated on determining the chemical abundance of the
iron group elements, recent investigations have shown that the iron-group
abundance enhancements did not start until comparatively late in the history of
the Galaxy. Better indicators of enrichment during the early era (including the
first hour after the Big Bang) are provided by the elements oxygen, carbon, and
beryllium. The oldest stars betray this history best, but they are faint and
difficult to observe. Moreover, the absorption line leading to abundance
determinations of beryllium is located in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum
that is inaccessible to Earth-based astronomers except in high mountain, low-
latitude observatories such as Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The Principal Investigator
(PI) has been active in studying chemical evolution studies of old stars in the
Galaxy for years and will extend her investigation to the faint halo stars in
the Galaxy with this three year award. Recent advances in detector technology
should also permit the PI to obtain not only more accurate abundances but also
to sample the chemical evolution in stars that were formed during the original
collapse of the Galaxy from a proto-galactic cloud. The abundance results for
beryllium may also permit a more constrained model of the Big Bang to be
developed.
