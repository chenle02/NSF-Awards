This historical project will study the role of blood clotting disorders in the
development of the medicine for women. It will explore the role of the body in
the development of medical theory and practice. The work will be of interest to
medical advocates, citizens, doctors, and public health workers. The study will
provide findings that may improve doctor-patient relationships, research
methods, roles of bodies in research and development, and public health
activism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will document the story of the
development of the pill by looking at how the science was built upon the
knowledge of what caused blood clots to form and how they moved throughout the
body. The study will explore perceptions of risk and the asymmetry of risk by
tracing the active agents in shaping pathological thought on venous blood
clotting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and ideas about hormonal
contraception and its risks in the twentieth century. The project will use
archival materials from pathologists, patients, and drug developers in order to
trace the history of hormones and clotting risks. It will illustrate the many
contributions of the patients and physicians involved in this research on blood
clotting from the 18th- 20th centuries.
