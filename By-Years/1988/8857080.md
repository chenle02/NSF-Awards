Base Isolation of structures and systems is an attractive strategy to mitigate
the effects of earthquakes. Implementation of the strategy, on a limited basis,
has been achieved in several countries world- wide. Many issues, which require
considerable research, remain unresolved and are barriers to further accelerated
implementation. This research project address many of these issues in both
conventional structures and for bridges. This includes soil- structure
instruction effects, materials behavior under seismic conditions and actual
performance of structures on a shaker table simulator. The research will provide
design and analysis methodologies to aid in accelerated implementation of base
isolation. This research grant provides the base support to Dr. Constantinou for
a Presidential Young Investigator Award.
