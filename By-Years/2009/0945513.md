This SBIR Phase I project will develop a nano-engineered polymeric, highly-
branched solid material that will sequester and also adsorb waterborne metals
efficiently. Metal capture is 60 times greater, gram-for-gram, than the powdered
activated carbon currently used. The materials to be used can capture metals
over broad concentrations, over a wide range of waste stream temperatures, and
over a range of pH levels. The form can be micro-dimensional particles or they
can be engineered into solid filter media.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be in the capture of
metals contaminating industrial water or gaseous emission streams. In 2000,
industry worldwide produced 1.2 billion tons of seven heavy metals of greatest
environmental concern. If successful, a market for the technology already
exists.
