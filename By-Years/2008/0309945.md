The goal of this project is to establish the existence or absence of mafic-
ultramafic roots to batholiths and whether such roots can reconcile the
fundamentally basaltic nature of mantle magmatism with the intermediate average
composition of the crust. Two hypotheses are considered: 1) that the dense
ultramafic residue founders into the mantle leaving the intermediate crustal
compositions above, or 2) the residue exists below the Moho and is
seismologically indistinct from mantle peridotite. The PIs will use a
combination of petrology, geochemistry and geochronology on the plutons of the
Central Coast Range Batholith to track changes in source, depth of origin
through time and seismic and gravity data to image the present state of the
lithosphere. The Central Coast Range Batholith (CCRB) in British Columbia is a
very good location for this study. It is a very large batholith which is
relatively young and has not had a protracted tectonic history. It's rugged
topography gives access to depth profiles of 20 to 25 km.
