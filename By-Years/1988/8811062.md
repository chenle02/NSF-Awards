The light-absorbing pigments necessary for vision are on special membranes
within photoreceptor cells in the eye. The maintenance of these membranes in the
living eye occurs through processes of membrane shedding and renewal. This
project will unravel this important visual mechanism by exploiting mutants of
the famous fruit fly, Drosophila, that have particular visual deficits to
correlate with observed ultrastructure in the eye. Electron microscopy and
freeze-fracture techniques will be used to examine the stages of membrane
turnover within the photoreceptor cells. Both abnormal diets and mutant flies
with unusual periodicity of recycling will be used as probes to examine
correlations of structure with visual function. This study will provide
important new data on invertebrate photo- receptors, to compare with those of
vertebrate eyes, and provides a novel genetic approach to an issue that is of
crucial importance to vision in general.
