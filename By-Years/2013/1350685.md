Designing software that can properly and safely interact with the physical world
is an important cyber-physical systems design challenge. The proposed work
includes the development of a novel approach to designing planning and control
algorithms for high-performance cyber physical systems. The new approach was
inspired by statistical mechanics and stochastic geometry. It will (i) identify
behavior such as phase transitions in cyber-physical systems and (ii) capitalize
this behavior in order to design practical algorithms with provable correctness
and performance guarantees. The algorithms developed through this research
effort hold the potential for immediate industrial impact, particularly in the
development of real-time robotic systems. These algorithms may strengthen the
rapidly developing U.S. robotics industry. The proposed research activity will
also vitalize the PI?s educational plans. Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate
courses that make substantial contributions to the embedded systems
education&lt;br/&gt;at MIT will be developed. The classes will focus on
provably-correct controller synthesis for cyber-physical systems, which is
currently not thought at MIT. Undergraduate students will be involved in
research activities.&lt;br/&gt;
