9312513 Poling The successful description of phase equilibria in aqueous-weak
electrolyte systems requires an accurate description of the liquid phase
composition. In models that are now used, concentrations of all the ionic
species in such a liquid phase are calculated, but these calculated compositions
are not based on experimental determinations of true ionic compositions. To
reliably evaluate existing models, and develop improved models, experimental
determinations of the liquid phase compositions will be essential. The goal of
the proposed research is to determine the concentrations of the ionic species in
a typical aqueous-weak electrolyte system. Specifically, it is proposed to use
carbon- 13 NMR to determine the concentrations of the carbonate, bicarbonate,
and carbamate ions in equilibrium in the liquid phase for the CO2 -NH3-H20
systems. The behavior of the carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium is well
established. But in spite of the industrial and biological importance of the
C02- NH3-H20 system, the equilibrium behavior of reactions involving the
carbamate has not been established experimentally. It is proposed to establish
this behavior over a range of concentrations and temperatures. ***
