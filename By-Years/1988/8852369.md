Acquisition of a quantitative image analysis system will make possible the
development and completion of the following projects and the verification of the
effect of the quantities measured in each of them on the materials properties:
measurements of grain sizes in metallic materials; measurements of phase area
percentages in multiphase materials; measurements of porosity in powder parts
and castings; measurements of particle plated and thermochemical treated layer
thickness; applications to composite materials; applications to ceramics and
quality control.//
