This is a one year Planning Grant to a young Principal Investigator at the
University of Guam to conduct numerical simulations of tilted accretion disks in
models of pulsar binary systems. The aim of this project is to bring together
high energy (x- and gamma- ray) and optical observations to attempt to
discriminate among competing theories of the "long periods" of x-ray pulsar
binary systems, such as precisions of tilted disks and obscurations of the
pulsar emission by clumps in the disks.
