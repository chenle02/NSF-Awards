This project will support research on several problems in the areas of
nonlinear harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Among the topics
to be studied are the method of layer potentials for the heat equation in time-
varying domains, Hardy spaces and boundary value problems for operators of Dirac
type on Lipschitz domains, the characterization of the spaces of uniform
holomorphy for partial sum operators for classical expansions, the calculation
of the spectral radius of the trace of the double-layer potential for harmonic
functions in certain domains, and applications of nonlinear harmonic analysis to
problems in nonlinear partial differential equations. Nonlinear harmonic
analysis emerged and developed in response to the challenges posed by difficult
problems in classical analysis, particularly, but not exclusively, those arising
from the study of partial differential equations. It is anticipated that
applications of this work will lead to a better understanding of potential
theory and the parabolic partial differential equations of heat flow.
