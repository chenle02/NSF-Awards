This project seeks to simplify the proof of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)
and reduce the computational complexity of the FHE algorithm, motivated by new
approaches in lattice theory. If FHE were computationally practical, it would
change security practices in cloud computing and storage that would have
significant economic and social benefits.
