This project gives new direction to the engineering materials course by greatly
enhancing the students ability to engage in quantitative evaluation of
mechanical and structural properties. A computer-controlled Instron tester will
allow for the more detailed quantitative study of a greatly expanded set of
materials under a variety of load conditions (e.g., tension, compression,
flexure, and cyclic).
