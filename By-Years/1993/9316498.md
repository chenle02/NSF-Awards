9316498 Stanton The proposed work is part of an integrated research program
("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern
Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the
austral winter of 1994. The work proposed here is the deployment of three
instrument systems to measure momentum, heat, and salt fluxes from the
pycnocline (a surface separating higher density deep water from lower density
surface water) upward to the ocean-ice interface. In the surface layer these
instrument systems will provide a hierarchy of direct flux and dissipation
measurements which will identify several dynamically distinct layers: the
surface constant stress layer, the turbulent boundary layer, and the active
mixed layer. Continuous time series of these measurements will be made at each
of the two fifteen day drift stations to observe both quiescent background
conditions, and the response of the upper ocean to the short, severe, storm
systems that are characteristic of the area. These measurements, in conjunction
with other concurrent experiments to quantify the energy brought to the
underside of the ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes
responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice cover. It is
believed that these conditions are only marginally stable, and are maintained by
a relatively high upward heat flux, which, if interrupted, could lead to deep
vertical convection, and a significant change in the oceanic climate. ***
