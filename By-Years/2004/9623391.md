9623391 Balogh Although normal and paracompact spaces are classical and
frequently used classes of topological spaces, and have been extensively
investigated (indeed, major breakthroughs such as those on normal Moore spaces
and Dowker spaces took place exactly in this area), they are also among those
classes in which a number of old and venerable problems remain open. The aim of
this project is to make progress in settling some of these problems, mainly by
creating new constructions of topological spaces. The principal technique to be
used has its origin in a paper of M.E.Rudin, where an example of a normal but
not collectionwise normal simplicial complex is constructed. In that paper Rudin
uses countable substructures of a structure of size 2^c on a set of cardinality
c (= the cardinality of the real line) to code normality. Refinements of and
improvements on this technique will be used to attack seven problems from the
literature as well as to obtain related results. A typical such problem is
whether and which normal, screenable (= every open cover has a sigma-disjoint
open refinement) spaces are paracompact. The following two important properties
of the usual Euclidean space are often used in mathematics. (1) Every continuous
function on a closed set can be continuously extended over the entire space
(normality). (2) Continuous local structures can be continuously amalgamated
into global ones (paracompactness). Research during and before the early fifties
showed that many of the more general types of spaces used in mathematical
applications also have one or both of these properties; those that do are
called, respectively, normal and paracompact spaces. Major breakthroughs in the
seventies and eighties uncovered much of the structure of normal and paracompact
spaces. However, basic research questions remain unanswered. Such questions are
typically concrete, explicit conjectures in the literature that have to do with
problems such as these: (a ) How does one recognize paracompact spaces in the
class of normal spaces? (b) Does the product of two or more normal spaces of a
certain kind also have this useful extension property? During the course of this
project, refinements of a technique originated by M.E.Rudin will be used to
build general topological spaces, with the goal of settling some of the
conjectures mentioned above. ***
