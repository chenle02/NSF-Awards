9453018 Thompson The Los Angeles Urban Systemic Initiative (USI) is committed to
having students attain world class standards in mathematics, science, and
technology by developing student understanding of the importance of competence
in these disciplines for success in today's society, and by preparing them for
higher education and employment in mathematics and science-related fields as
well as for productive citizenship. To achieve these goals the LA USI will
create schools that are centers of learning for everyone, students, teachers
administrators, and parents and other adults; implement a rigorous curriculum
and enhanced teacher capacity to teach it; develop strong community
partnerships; and greatly increase achievement expectations. These strategies
are carefully phased in and well staged over five years, starting with the
introduction of 100 schools in the first year. The LA USI will also develop its
own bilingual teachers by actively recruiting prospective science and
mathematics majors, establishing a career ladder as incentive for bilingual
teacher aides and offering science and mathematics classes in a second language.
