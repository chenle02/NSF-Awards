This project provides funds for expanding and improving undergraduate
biopsychology teaching laboratory curriculum. Two upgraded versions of current
courses (Laboratories in Neuroanatomy and Animal Learning) and two new ones
(Laboratories in Hormones and Behavior and Human Psychophysiology) are being
offered to approximately 200 biopsychology majors. A laboratory complement is
provided to lecture course material and emphasizes the dynamic, i.e., ever-
changing, nature of scientific discovery. Other goals of the laboratory
curriculum are as follows: (1) to provide undergraduates with hands on
experience in state-of-the-art neuroscience research methodologies through small
group instruction in the laboratory, preparing them for careers in the health
sciences; (2) to teach undergraduates the scientific method, by having them
design and conduct independent experiments to test specific, self-generated
scientific hypotheses; (3) to improve scientific literacy (including critical
thinking) and communication, by requiring students to read the original
scientific literature and present their own data in written and/or oral form;
(4) to enhance our students' computer usage skills. Achievement of these goals
enables graduates: (1) to be cognizant of their own physiology; (2) to evaluate
critically the enormous amount of information (scientific or otherwise)
presented by the media; (3) to compete successfully in the markeplace for jobs
or additional postgraduate education; (4) to succeed in the increasingly
technology-driven workplace of current and future society.
