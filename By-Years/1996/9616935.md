This dissertation project examines the development of Argentine criminology in
the years 1890-1930. It explores how this new discipline, which at the turn of
the century included legal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, anthropology, and
sociology, played a critical role in political debates on immigration, class
formation, and national identity. It argues that these criminologists helped to
delineate the boundaries of citizenship and nationhood in a rapidly modernizing
society rife with true and imagined social problems. Argentine criminologists,
many of whom were trained in Europe, sought to become vital players in the
international scientific community. At the same time, they were engaged in a
conscious project to build a distinctly Argentine science geared to solving
Argentine social problems. The project documents how the Argentine political and
intellectual elite used the language and scientific concepts of criminology to
articulate their fears of social unrest, political chaos, and property loss.
Moreover, it demonstrates how, as criminologists sketched new definitions of the
criminal and proposed new criminal types, they as importantly constructed new
ideals of the good Argentine citizen. The project first traces the intellectual
formation of criminology as a discipline, its institutionalization, and its rise
to international status. Second, the project describes the impact and
realization of new criminological ideas in government policies, specifically in
policy techniques, courtroom procedure, and legislative decisions. Finally, it
concludes with a discussion of the impact of criminological concepts on the
increasingly narrow requirements for Argentine citizenship in the first decades
of the twentieth century.
