Blum Distributing multiple sensors over some region for the purpose of detecting
a signal in noise is becoming increasingly attractive. The majority of the
research work concerning the design of such schemes has focused on signal
detection problems where a complete observation model which categorizes the
environment under consideration is known. This research deals with distributed
detection schemes for cases where a complete observation model is not available
due to incomplete knowledge of the operating environment. This is an extremely
practical case which has applications in air traffic control, radar weather
monitoring, and other radar and sonar systems. Robustness results for important
cases with alternative hypothesis which are not simple, finite observation
sample sizes, dependent observations, and non-additive observations are being
sought. The plan to construct these schemes focuses on applying the theory of
minimax robust statistics. Cases with nonstationary, possibly non- Gaussian
background environments and possibly dependent observations are also being
investigated.
