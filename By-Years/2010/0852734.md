Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0852734&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: James A. Isenberg, Boris I. Botvinnik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award provides partial support for meetings of the Pacific&lt;br/&gt;Northwest
Geometry Seminar (PNGS) to be held during 2009--2012 at&lt;br/&gt;the University
of British Columbia, Oregon State University,&lt;br/&gt;University of Oregon,
University of Utah, University of&lt;br/&gt;Washington, Portland State
University, and Stanford&lt;br/&gt;University. Invited research talks by leading
experts in&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry and algebraic geometry are
complemented by&lt;br/&gt;discussion sessions in which the speakers and
participants assess&lt;br/&gt;the state of various areas in geometry, and
highlight open&lt;br/&gt;problems in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are
a number of very active researchers in geometry&lt;br/&gt;scattered throughout
the various universities which are involved&lt;br/&gt;in the Pacific Northwest
Geometry Seminar. These periodic&lt;br/&gt;meetings bring these researchers
together for consultation,&lt;br/&gt;collaboration, and stimulation of new
ideas. A significant number&lt;br/&gt;of research programs have been initiated
as a result of&lt;br/&gt;interactions at these meetings. The PNGS is especially
valuable&lt;br/&gt;for graduate students in geometry at the various
participating&lt;br/&gt;universities which have small geometry groups. The PNGS
meetings&lt;br/&gt;give these students an excellent opportunity to see the
broader&lt;br/&gt;picture of research in geometry. The meetings are also
very&lt;br/&gt;valuable for the growing number of geometers working at some
of&lt;br/&gt;the smaller universities in the region, such as
Pacific&lt;br/&gt;University, Lewis and Clark, Seattle University, and
Idaho&lt;br/&gt;State. More information can be found on the conference
