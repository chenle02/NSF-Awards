The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will result from enabling small companies to enjoy affordable,
customized ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. An ERP system is a
platform integrating a centralized database with functionalities to support the
core business processes. A customized solution can generate substantial
efficiency gains, economic savings, and competitive advantage, but this has
typically required specialized expertise unavailable to small firms. This
project will generate a solution to help small businesses remain competitive.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will build on recent advances in program synthesis to automate software
customizations in an ERP. The specific rules and requirements of a company are
expressed as a set of easy-to-write declarative rules. The ERP synthesizer will
automatically ensure that a combination of tasks is guaranteed to obey all
specified rules. This project will build a tool to automate most ERP
customizations while minimizing many classes of software errors by construction.
This project will also explore the trade-offs of using this
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
