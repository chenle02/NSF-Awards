This grant will provide matching support to that provided by the American
Society of Civil Engineers to hold a workshop to assess the role which
Engineering Mechanics research can play in introducing new technologies in Civil
Engineering. Civil Engineering, which has most of its' activities eventually
expressed in construction, has one of the lowest levels of research activity of
any major industry in the U.S. This low level of research activity along with an
extremely conservative attitude toward change and the introduction of new
materials and technologies has actually resulted in a decreased level of
productivity for increasingly complex Civil Engineering projects. A new attitude
responsive to increased change and introduction of new technologies is
developing in Civil Engineering and it will be timely to assess the role which
Engineering Mechanics' research can play in the future to improve productivity,
quality and costs in Civil Engineering projects. A small report will be
published containing summaries of deliberations at the Workshop and
recommendations for future activity.
