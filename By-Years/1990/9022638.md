The research proposes to investigate the behavior of marine clays under large
strains with wave and tsunami loading. The wave induced forces have been
continuously transporting soft sediments from shallow water depths to deeper
parts of the ocean. It is proposed to examine the stability of the marine clays
by subjecting them to similar stress paths and damage caused by the waves. A
special testing device will be used to subject the clays to circular stress
paths which can not be applied in conventional available apparatuses. Additional
tests are proposed to relate plasticity index, over consolidation ratio and
anisotropy of clay to coefficients of permeability. Finally an effort will be
made to develop or modify an incremental plastic model which can simulate the
effect of rotation of principal stress direction.
