This project will produce a fundamentally new computational model of light
scattering from surfaces with multiple heterogeneous layers (such as human skin
and inkjet prints). The new model will remove common assumptions in current
methods, including ignoring the roughness of the layer interfaces and
simplifying the directional characteristics of the scattered light. Such an
accurate, general model can be used in predictive simulation, a branch of
information technology that already plays an important role in fields such as
color science, electronic chip manufacturing, aerospace engineering, and
automotive engineering. The project will extend predictive simulation to many
new applications, including the development and testing of printing
technologies, photographic image capture, medical diagnosis, remote sensing, and
display devices.

The project will combine theoretical and experimental approaches to provide a
robust, efficient computer implementation of the new model. It will: - Construct
an integrated array of high-quality digital cameras - Produce calibrated,
complete measurements of the reflectance of printed flat samples and living
human skin - Use powerful analytic and numerical tools to devise theoretical
models of the scattering within the surfaces measured - Carefully implement a
robust, accurate, efficient computational scattering model
