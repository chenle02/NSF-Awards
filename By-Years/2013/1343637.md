This grant supports participation of approximately 12-15 graduate students from
US institutions in the first instance of the Conference on Online Social
Networks (COSN) of the Association for Computing Machinery, to be held in
Boston, Massachusetts, on October 7-8, 2013. Participation in conferences such
as COSN is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience,
provides students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers
and exposes them to leading edge research in the field. Attendance at the
inaugural COSN event is especially important as it will be the first unified
meeting of core members of the research community, the result of merger of six
different workshops held over the last few years that were co-located with a
diverse set of conferences.

This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a
premier technical meeting in online social networks. Students will have the
opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior
researchers in the field. The proposed student participation is expected to have
a positive impact on the students' research interests. The project will promote
diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other under-represented
minorities to participate. Furthermore, the truly international flavor of COSN
as an annual conference is reflected in the composition of the Technical Program
Committee as well as the expected set of authors of papers. As such, it
cultivates international research interactions and presents a tremendous
opportunity to students.
