9451507 Gries This instructional computer laboratory will be used for a novel
sequence of courses that starts with an introductory programming course targeted
at students having no previous experience in programming. The laboratory will be
used to teach this programming course in an interactive environment. Another
point in the sequence will be a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering course in
system dynamics. This is an upper-level course for majors. New equipment is
needed that will enable these students to do interesting work with dynamic
simulation. The existence of a teaching laboratory will be important when
instructing the students in the use of their software. This sequence is the
result of ideas from the faculty in the two departments. They plan to exploit
the joint use of the facility to build bridges between the introductory computer
science courses and upper-level courses in engineering and science. Using the
systems dynamics course as a target, they will try to facilitate a student's
progress from this introductory programming course, to our more challenging
introductory course for students with a knowledge of calculus, and finally to
the systems dynamics and other upper-level engineering courses. This joint
effort will be incorporated into the development of a text for the programming
course. The laboratory will have a significant impact locally at Cornell. The
programming text produced should help other colleges and universities to
institute a similar approach. The enrichments to the course and text achieved
through work with Mechanical Engineering will make the text quite different from
anything now available.
