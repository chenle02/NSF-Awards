This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment is for a small network of workstations that
will be used to support research in the following projects; The Solution of
Linear and Nonlinear Integral Equations on Surfaces in Space; Singular
Configuration Manifolds of Mechanical Systems; The Study of Ring Theory,
Algebras, and Modules; Computational geometric Topology; and Operator Theory and
Operator Algebras.
