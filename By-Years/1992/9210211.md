The objective is a bedload transport model for the channels and rivers. The
following problems will be addressed: bedload transport of mixtures, bedload-
induced roughness, boundary conditions for suspended sediment computations,
transverse bedload transport, and transition from bedload into suspension. A
Lagrangian treatment of saltating particles, which includes both a deterministic
component (particle trajectory) and a stochastic component (collision and
splash), will be used. Computer simulations will be conducted to investigate the
effect of particle-fluid and particle-bed interactions. Flow visualization with
a high-speed video recording system will be used for experimental verification.
The mechanics-based bedload transport relation proposed in this project provides
an improved approach to assess environmental flow problems in which reliable
sediment transport prediction are needed.
