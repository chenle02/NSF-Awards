The proposal seeks funding to support graduate and postdoctoral student
participation in the 26th meeting of the North American Catalysis Society (NACS)
to be held in Chicago, Illinois June 16-20, 2019. The funds will provide
registration fees and accommodation assistance to 38 students from U.S.
universities as administered through the merit-based Kokes Travel Award program
sponsored by the NACS. The students will present their research at the
conference, attend lectures by leaders in the field of catalysis, and provide
assistance to the organizers in running the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
biennial NACS meetings are the largest North American meetings dedicated to
catalysis. Student participation helps train young researchers in this vital
aspect of science and enginering that supports advances in environmental
pollution control, energy utilization, sustainability and greenhouse gas
reduction, and competitiveness of the U.S. chemical and petroleum industries.
The Kokes Award selection committee will ensure appropriate representation of
women and underrepresented groups in making their
awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
