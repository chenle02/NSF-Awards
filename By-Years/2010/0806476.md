Dr Oey will investigate how ultraviolet light from hot young stars, with photon
energies high enough to ionize the hydrogen gas in and around galaxies, can
escape from the stars' natal region and spread through the galaxy and beyond.
She will use the red light of H alpha to map the ionized hydrogen in galaxies
undergoing a burst of star formation, and use radiative transfer models to
predict how much of the ultraviolet light escapes to intergalactic space.
Studying the spectra of ionized gas around single hot stars in very nearby
galaxies (the Magellanic Clouds and M33), she will test stellar-atmosphere
models that predict how much ultraviolet light each star should supply. With
spectroscopic measurements of star-bursting dwarf galaxies that trace emission
from several atomic species, she will probe chemical inhomogeneity and
ionization in the gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A woman graduate student and a woman
postdoc will take part in the research. Dr Oey is a woman with a strong track
record of working with undergraduates, and is involved in undergraduate
outreach. At U. Michigan she is the lead organizer for a Theme Semester for the
2009 International Year of Astronomy, which includes special undergraduate
classes, a production of Brecht's 'Galileo', distinguished lectures, exhibitions
and star parties.
