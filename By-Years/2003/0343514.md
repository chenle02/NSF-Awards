This grant supports the acquisition of an unsaturated flow apparatus (UFA) and
two years of half-time technical support for a UFA operator in the Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee. The UFA consists of
an ultracentrifuge and pump that uses acceleration to drive water through porous
media. The UFA will be used to measure unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, a
difficult parameter to measure in porous media but important for intelligently
applying hydrologic models of vadose zone processes. The UFA will be also used
to measure colloidal, pathogen, and solute transport though variably saturated
porous media. The operational range of rotation speeds and flow rates of the UFA
allows for simulation of hydraulic conductivities between 10-4 and 10-11 cm/s.
This will be the first such device available at a U.S. academic institution. ***
