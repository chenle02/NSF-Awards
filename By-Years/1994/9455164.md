The MAA is offering a workshop on cooperative learning techniques for
mathematics instructors. The workshop takes place over two summers and the
intervening academic year, beginning in summer 1995. Experienced, enthusiastic
collegiate-level mathematics faculty, particularly those from two year colleges,
who are interested in cooperative learning techniques for their own classrooms
are the target audience. The goals of the workshop are preparing them to bring
cooperative learning into their classrooms and departments, and to serve as
regional resources for local cooperative learning projects. The project will
also test the hypothesis that the proposed setting and time frame is an
effective way to aid faculty to develop the skills to enable them to
successfully use cooperative learning as a significant teaching mode.
