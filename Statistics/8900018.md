Log-linear models for qualitative data are usually analyzed by means of the
large-sample approximations for maximum- likelihood and weighted-least-squares
estimators. Computational problems have made the corresponding exact tests and
confidence intervals difficult to use. Employing the Newton-Raphson algorithm
for the computation and falling back on slightly less optimal procedures reduces
the problems. The models are extended to qualitative data with random effects as
well as data which is only approximately consistent with the model.
