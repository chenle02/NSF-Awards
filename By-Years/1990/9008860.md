This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of physical chemistry. Dr. Amy E. Miller of the University of Oklahoma will
study the intrinsic acidity of organometallic hydrides in the gas phase by
determining enthalpies of dissociation into free metal anions and free protons.
Construction of a flowing afterglow ion-molecule reactor to determine the
kinetics of protron abstraction from neutral acids by metal anions is central to
the project. Compounds containing trifluorophosphine ligands, expected to be
"superacids", will be among those synthesized and tested. A postdoctoral
associate with participate in the program, which will enable Dr. Miller to
expand her laboratory to include an instrumental component in addition to the
synthesis capabilities already in place.
