Rheological (flow and deformation) properties of polymers are the most
important factors affecting the microstructure of polymers, critical process
parameters for polymer production and processing, and subsequent product
quality. The focus of this project is the acquisition of a computer-instrumented
laboratory capillary rheometer (LCR) and on-line process rheometer (OLPR) such
that students can experimentally investigate and observe the rheological
phenomena of plastics through laboratory testing and on-line process monitoring.
Several laboratory experiments have been planned to allow students to use the
state-of-the-art LCR/OLPR equipment to study (1) the effects of processing
parameters on the rheological properties of a polymer melt during processing and
on the mechanical and physical properties of final products, (2) process
monitoring, control, optimization, and automation, (3) the application of
computer-instrumented technology in rheometry, (4) the application of the
LCR/OLPR in recycling and processability analysis, (5) rheological data analysis
using statistical techniques, and (6) the integration of the LCR/OLPR with
computer-assisted design, manufacture, and engineering. The LCR/OLPR project
greatly enhances both the materials engineering and polymer processing programs
in the Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Mechanical Engineering curricula.
It can directly affect students enrolled in the following two courses:
Engineering Materials and Polymer Processing. Data provided from the LCR/OLPR
equipment can be beneficial to all courses in which discussions focus upon the
relationship between the rheological, physical, and mechanical properties of
polymeric materials, such as Material Characterization, Polymer Science,
Adhesive Technology and Applications, and Industrial Painting Technology.
