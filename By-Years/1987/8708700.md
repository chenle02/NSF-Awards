In this project constitutive equations and processing maps using a dynamic
modeling approach will be developed for metal forming processes. Inconel Alloy
718 will be used as the work material. This alloy is selected because of its
extensive application in areas requiring high strength, corrosion resistance and
weldability in aged condition. A computer program will be used to calculate an
array of values, giving the desired ram position as a function of time for
particular combinations of strain rate and specimen height. Effective stress and
effective strain-rate values will be extracted at various strain levels and test
temperatures from flow curves; constitutive equations will be derived therefrom.
Processing maps will be developed to describe the intrinsic workability of each
material and to evaluate the dissipative/metallurgical processes occurring
during hot deformation in the stable and unstable regions, and to identify in
the stable region the optimum temperature and strain-rate range for processing
the materials. This research is important in the area of metal forming and has
immediate potential applications.
