Professor King will study a number of questions in ergodic theory. He will
consider potential generalizations of a structure theorem based on joinings. He
will investigate the "continuous selection problem", related to work of Oxtoby
and Ulam. He will study two combinatorial problems: the 2-fold 3- fold mixing
problem and the van den Berg-Kesten "box conjecture". This project involves
research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the
average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be
followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the
modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In
this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify
flows on homogeneous spaces.
