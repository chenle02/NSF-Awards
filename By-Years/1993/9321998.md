9321993 Esch This award provides funds to continue a success REU SITE for
another three years. Undergraduate students, with the primary emphasis on women
and minorities, will be given the opportunity of an 11-week research experience
(Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) with faculty members in the
Department of Biology of Wake Forest University. The research interests of the
students will be matched with those of participating faculty. In conjunction
with the research experience, students will be exposed to a range of other
activities, including two overnight field trips and a weekly seminar program
given by departmental faculty members. Special time will be set aside for
instruction in elementary biostatistics, experimental design, slide preparation,
review of primary literature sources, etc. The summer's research activities will
culminate with an afternoon-long colloquium, at which time the students will
present the results of their work to faculty and other summer participants.
Students will be quartered in one of the University's residential houses in
order to facilitate maximum student-student interaction. Previous experience
with this research program format has shown it to be successful. ***
