The objective of the this project will be to conduct research in the
development of database technology and to meet the challenging requirements of
engineering and scientific applications, such as design automation and the Human
Genome project. This will aslo involve graduate students in research projects
aimed at developing object-oriented database technology that supports 1) the
integration of complex data types, 2) the maintenance of customized database
interfaces for individual tools, and 3) the entensibility of the system without
discrupting existing database uers and tools.
