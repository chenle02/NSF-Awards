The focus of this research is the development of reactive metal powders and
other reactive zero-valent and anionic metal species for use in synthetic
methodology. The principal metals to be studied include Zn, Mn, Ba, Sr, Cu, Mg
and Sm. The formation of reactive organometallic species from the metals and a
wide variety of organic substrates will be probed. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program and the Experimental Programs to Stimulate Competitive
Research (EPSCoR) Office are supporting the research of Dr. Reuben D. Rieke of
the Department of chemistry at the University of Nebraska. Professor Rieke will
focus his work on the development of novel highly reactive metal powders and
other highly reactive metal species that can be used in a variety of synthetic
applications.
