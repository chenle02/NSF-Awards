This project provides a seamless interface between the classroom and laboratory
experiences in Software Design and Implementation, the second Computer Science
course in this department's curriculum. This integration is done through the
design of a combined classroom and laboratory that contains 10 computer
workstations. These facilities provide an ideal environment for cooperative and
collaborative learning experiences facilitated by the latest computer equipment.
The students also learn to develop software in a modern environment and have
access to that environment throughout the time of class instruction. The
facilities also provide projection equipment to make the work being done by any
student visible to the rest of the class. This laboratory classroom enables the
development of activities that combine lecture, discussion, group work. and
laboratory work, all within a single class period. The results of this project
are a set of exercises and activities designed to utilize this concept. The
success of this concept can be assessed and the result may be disseminated over
the Internet and World Wide Web, conference presentations, and papers.
