Due to the increase in design complexity as a result of the paradigm shift from
single-core to multi-core technology, designers require advanced optimization
techniques to meet design constraints (e.g. power, energy, performance, area)
within an ever shrinking time-to-market. Autonomous self-tuning architectures
and methodologies enable a system to dynamically adapt to input stimuli to meet
design constraints with little or no designer effort. However, self-tuning
systems are exceedingly difficult to design, requiring custom algorithms,
flexible reconfigurable architectures, non-intrusive self-evaluation techniques,
etc. This research explores and architects novel, lightweight, and efficient
reconfigurable architectures, algorithms, and methodologies in the context of a
self-tuning cache hierarchy for energy efficient embedded systems. This research
will provide fundamental knowledge of how core inter-dependencies both
complicate and reveal new optimization opportunities and self-tuning
methodologies applicable to other system components (e.g. communication
topologies and protocols, voltage scaling, task-to-core mapping, etc.). The
outcomes will spawn future research endeavors and enhance academic curricula as
well as impact society through more rapidly advancing state-of-the-art
technology made possible by reducing design time burdens, enabling application
designers to focus more heavily on enhanced functionality rather than system
optimization. A research group composed largely of underrepresented minorities
and women will undertake the project's endeavors. In addition, the project will
include an in-depth evaluation of real-life experiences gathered from successful
women engineers to provide tangible motivation, which will be disseminated
through scholarly publications, summer research experience programs for high
school students, as well as seminars for K-12 students, teachers, and parents.
