The focus of this research award is improved methodology for the scale-up of
animal and insect cell cultures. Three projects are now in progress which
involve collaborations with industrial and academic laboratories. Diagnosis of
Cell Stress in Large-Scale Bioreactors. The goal of this project is to develop
techniques for identifying specific sources of cell stress in large-scale
bioreactors through analysis of intracellular protein synthesis. Recent results
have shown a set of intracellular proteins whose increased synthesis rate is
indicative of heightened hydrodynamic stress. The goal of future work is to
identify and quantify intracellular proteins associated with other types of
environmental stress. This information is to be ultimately used for the rational
scale-up of animal cell cultures. Scale-Up of Genetically-Engineered Insect
Cells. An insect cell expression system has recently been developed for the
production of genetically-engineered proteins of therapeutic and agricultural
interest. In this project, the potential of this expression system will be
assessed. Recent results have identified the conditions necessary for the growth
of these cells in a sparged bioreactor. Future work will examine environmental
conditions necessary for optimum cell growth and product formation in large-
scale bioreactors. Metabolic Engineering of Mammalian Cells. Normal human cells
have a limited life span in cell culture. This problem is being addressed
through the incorporation of a specific class of genes, called oncogenes, into
human cells. Recent results demonstrate that one of these genes can increase the
life span of human kidney cells at least five-fold. Future research is directed
toward further characterization of these kidney cell strains, toward the
reduction of mammalian cell growth factor requirements through oncogene
incorporation, and toward an extension of this approach to other important cell
types.
