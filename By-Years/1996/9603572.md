Abstract EEC-9603572 Oren The power industry must undertake a managed redesign
of the Nation's Power System so that it can adopt to deregulation and to rapid
changes in the power requirements and economic conditions. A planning grant was
awarded last spring to study the feasibility of an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power Systems Engineering to address
the research needed to create the tools and models to aid in the technical
design of a future high-performance electric power system. A multi-university
I/UCRC in Power Systems Engineering, involving Cornell University, The
University of Wisconsin-Madison, The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
and The University of California, Berkeley, and Howard University as an
affiliate, is viable. The research agenda for the Center will address: 1)
Simulation Tools for Analysis of Alternative Paradigms for New Electricity
Business; 2) Market Mechanisms for Competitive Electricity; 3) An Internet
Platform for Simulating Competitive Bidding for Unist Commitment and Schedule;
4) Available Transfer Capability; 5) Data Calibration; and 6) Real-Time Control
of Oscillations. The Electric Power Research Institute is planning to cost share
some of the activities. The Center is being cost-shared with Dr. C. Singh,
Program Director, Engineering Systems/Power Systems Program, Division of
Electrical and Communications Systems.
