Clayton&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0126185&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxygen isotopic compositions
of primitive Solar System materials have proved to be very powerful tracers of
chemical process involved in formation of objects as small as chondrules to as
large as planets. Isotopic compositions serve to determine genetic associations
of divers meteoritic groups, such as the SNC (martian) meteorites and the HED
(howardite, eucrite, diogenite) groups. Low-temperature aqueous processes in
carbonaceous chondrites have been studied in terms of reservoir origins,
alteration conditions and water/rock ratios. All this has been possible even
though we lacked consensus on the ultimate origin of the "anomalous" effects. A
novel approach, combining photochemistry and the X-wind model of stellar
accretions, has the possibility of providing a consistent picture of oxygen
isotopic evolution, along with a novel interpretation of the chemical evolution
of the inner Solar System. In addition, we plan to use oxygen isotopic
compositions of organic molecules in carbonaceous meteorites to determine how
much of the organic chemistry occurred within the parent asteroid, and how much
occurred earlier, in the Solar Nebula or in interstellar space. These are
fundamental questions for the origin of pre-biotic organic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;
