&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to the University of Minnesota-Twin
Cities for the support of a five-year, REU Site in Electrical and Computer
Engineering, under the direction of Dr. Douglas W. Ernie. This ten-week summer
program will involve fifteen students annually in an intensive research
experience on a wide range of topics including biomedical engineering, computer
engineering and VLSI design, control systems, power systems and electronics,
magnetic recording technology, optics and photonics, microelectronics materials,
device design and fabrication, and signal processing and communications. Each
student will be paired with an electrical and computer engineering faculty
mentor and will be actively involved with the mentor's research group. In
addition, the participants will be involved in extensive complementary
educational activities, including a weekly seminar series focusing on heir
research projects, career seminars/field trips, and specialized workshops on
assorted topics. As a capstone to their REU experience, each student will
prepare a final written report and give a presentation at a concluding
departmental poster session and an all-campus summer research program
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
