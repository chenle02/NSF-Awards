9628351 Jordan This research involves the determination of the structure of the
Earth's mantle in Australasia, eastern Asia, and the western Pacific through a
series of seismological experiments that begin with a three-dimensional, high
resolution tomographic study. Motivation for the study comes from new stations
in the study area and new inversion techniques for a more diverse collection of
seismic phases. Frequency dependent travel times of body waves, guided waves,
and surface waves can now be derived from a self- consistent analysis of three-
component seismograms recorded at short epicentral distances, which makes them
ideally suited for regional tomography. Combination of these data with the band-
centered travel times of zeroth-order and first-order ScS reverberation phases,
allows inversion for mantle discontinuity topography and lateral variations in
polarization anisotropy. The resulting model has a direct bearing on the mode of
mantle convection which is the driving force for plate tectonics and
earthquakes. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program. ***
