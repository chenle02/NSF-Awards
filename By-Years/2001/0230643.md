The objective of the project is to create an innovative learning environment
that addresses the challenges of teaching stochastic modeling courses to
undergraduate engineering and science students. The project develops four
application-based modules to demonstrate the relevance of theory in practice and
incorporates real-life applications into Industrial Engineering curriculum. The
modules include visual media from industrial partners to present a problem with
a web site that provides written module and reference material. The main topics
covered in these modules include Brownian motion, reliability theory, queuing
theory, Markov chains, and renewal theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this
project consist of improved learning environment, exposure of students to
technological tools, integration of advanced technology in the design and
creation of the modules, and a curriculum package that is highly transferable to
other programs and universities offering stochastic modeling courses.&lt;br/&gt;
