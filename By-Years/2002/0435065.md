&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Shared Facility for Internet Reverse Engineering
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, network researchers
are hamstrung by a lack of quantitative data about the Internet's structure and
operation, much as biologists prior to the Human Genome Project were hampered by
a lack of data. To meet this need, the investigators are designing and building
an open, shared facility for the continuous measurement, analysis, and archival
of the Internet's underlying structure and operational controls. The facility
allows any researcher to gain access to a live or archived feed of information
about the Internet's structure and to contribute new measurement and analysis
tools, thus renewing and improving the facility as a community effort over time.
Three factors enable this effort: 1) recent advances in network measurement
provide techniques to infer Internet properties from external observations where
they were previously hidden by network boundaries; 2) large-scale, wide-area
testbeds (exemplified by PlanetLab) provide a distributed platform that hosts
the facility; and 3) large-scale data collection and warehousing is feasible and
cost-effective given technology trends. The key expected result is the public
availability of an unprecedented data set: an annotated map of the entire
Internet, complete with a rich set of link, router and operational attributes.
This will allow researchers to investigate the extent of problems in practice,
construct models of the Internet to predict its behavior, and evaluate proposed
protocol designs using real data. The broad impact of this work is to improve
the quality and effectiveness of network research, and thus ultimately the
security, efficiency and flexibility of the Internet itself. &lt;br/&gt;
