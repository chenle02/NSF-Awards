This is an award to support research on transport of toxic contaminants in
flowing, natural waters involving exchange processes between the stream-flow and
the stream sediments which act as storage locations for the contaminants. The
research involves investigation of the fundamentals of stream-bed exchange using
adsorbing inorganic contaminants and utilizing a five-meter long recirculating
laboratory flume with a fine sand bed. Adsorbing inorganic tracers planned for
use include bivalent calcium and trivalent aluminum and chromium cations. The
investigators plan on using the adsorbable cationic dye tracer methylene blue to
establish equilibrium and kinetic behavior of organic contaminants in batch-
scale work before proceeding to flume experiments. This project is being jointly
supported by the Fluid, Particulate and Hydraulic Systems Program and the
Environmental Engineering element of the Environmental and Ocean Systems
Program. The relationship of bed-contribution of water pollutants from
contaminated sediments to water quality with which those sediments are placed
into contact by physical processes influencing the relative motion between
sediments and particles disturbed by fluid motion are not well understood. It is
expected that results of this research will contribute toward formulation of
better models than now exist of interactions between water in motion and
sediments contaminated with organic and inorganic pollutants that contaminate
the water, and application of those models in environmental and hydraulic
engineering practice.
