9417142 Sauer This block travel grant will support the attendance of U.S.
academic researchers at the third Bulk Power System Voltage Phenomena Seminar to
be held in Davos, Switzerland on August 22- 26, l994. This seminar will be
addressing the critical issues of voltage phenomena in large interconnected
systems. These phenomena are emerging as one of the most important problems
associated with the maintenance of reliable electric service in the U.S. The
objectives of this grant are to allow a significant number of U.S. academic
researchers to actively participate in this major international event. The first
two seminars on this topic have produced the leading literature and primary
references for voltage collapse problems. The first two seminars were scheduled
in the U.S. in September 1988 (Potosi, Missouri) and August 1991 (Deep Creek
Lake, Maryland). In an effort to promote more international exchange of ideas,
this seminar has been scheduled in Europe. It is essential for the U.S.
researchers to continue their active involvement in this critical area of power
system analysis. ***
