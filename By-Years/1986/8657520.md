This project is a multidisciplinary activity involving research in adaptive
control, robotics and magnetic disk technology. The adaptive control work
concerns theoretical and practical considerations in the design of robust
adaptive controllers for mechanical systems in the presence of unmodelled
dynamics, such as high frequency flexural modes, and mechanical nonlinearities,
such as Coulomb friction and stiction. The robotics work concerns investigating
the derivation, development, and experimental verification of continuous time
and discrete time adaptive control schemes for robotic manipulators and the
development of cartesian space straight line trajectory generation algorithms
and robot motion control using end effector cartesian coordinates feedback
instead of joint coordinates feedback control. In the area of magnetic disk
technology, the research addresses the application of self tuning techniques to
measure the absolute in-plant motion of the recording head and control tuning
and testing of high performance disk file systems.
