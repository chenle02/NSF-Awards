This activity is intended to foster the interdisciplinary collaboration between
the research groups headed by Shing-Tung Yau in the Harvard Mathematics
Department and Cumrun Vafa in the Harvard Physics Department. Vafa's group has
furthered our understanding of the non-perturbative aspects of string theory
along several fronts: deriving the Seiberg-Witten results as a low-energy limit
of the moduli dependence of the prepotential in string theory; studying D-brane
physics and relating the counting of BPS states to topological questions,
including instantons on K3; geometrizing the SL(2,Z) invariance of the Type IIB
string and postulating a twelve-dimensional theory (``F-theory"), which contains
many interesting string dualities; developing a geometric understanding of non-
abelian gauge symmetries and confinement in string theory; and describing the
Beckenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes in terms of counting states via
string theory and string duality. This last result is perhaps the most striking
revelation in quantum gravity from string theory. Yau's group has been
instrumental in understanding several aspects of mirror symmetry and string
dualities: interpreting BPS state counting in terms of enumerative geometry;
investigating the differential equations of period integrals on Calabi-Yau
manifolds; solving the large radius limit problem in general, which is crucial
for applying mirror symmetry to enumerative geometry; describing mirror
manifolds as the moduli spaces of supersymmetric submanifolds; and classifying
K3 fibrations, which are the key to heterotic-Type II duality. This GIG Award
will sponsor postdoctoral research fellows and visiting scholars in mathematics
and string theory (physics). String theory has undergone a revolution during the
past year but will languish without fresh mathematical results --- for the many
conjectures need to be justified with rigor! The pace of mathematics needs to
quicken in order to accommodate this recent influx of remarkable ideas. T his is
a very exciting time for mathematics, as well. Hard conjectures abound, with
physical reasoning providing guidance for serious investigation. Likewise, the
physics of string theory is hungry for new math. Within these two groups there
is a wealth of intellectual resources. Mathematics and physics will both greatly
benefit from full exploitation of this interdisciplinary collaboration.
