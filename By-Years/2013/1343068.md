The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international
organization in the field of natural language processing and computational
linguistics. The NAACL HLT conference is the ACL's major conference held
annually in North America. This project subsidizes travel, conference
registration, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the
NAACL HLT Student Research Workshop, which takes place during the main
conference held on June 10-12 in Atlanta and in a one-day workshop on June 13th.
The workshop accepts papers in two categories: thesis proposals and general
research papers. The thesis/research proposal can have only one author who must
be a student. The research papers can have multiple authors, with the first
author being a student. The workshop is organized and run by
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Research Workshop provides a valuable
opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers
to enter the research community. It allows the students in the field to take an
important step toward becoming professional computational linguists by receiving
critical feedback on their work from experts outside of their dissertation
committee, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in
their field. The students who are involved in running and reviewing for the
workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and
interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main
conference. The NAACL HLT Student Research Workshop contributes to the
maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics
and natural language processing community.
