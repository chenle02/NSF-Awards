9308028 Davila The goal of this Research Initiation award is to develop several
new techniques that can be used to analyze sensory evoked potentials. One
methods is a generalization of the traditional ensemble averaging approach that
should maximize the signal-to- noise ratio. The second proposed method would
track the principle eigenvectors of the evoked potential autocorrelation matrix
in order to find the frequency spectrum of the data. This research is important
since it has the potential to reduce the amount of data, and consequently the
time, needed to estimate sensory evoked potential. ***
