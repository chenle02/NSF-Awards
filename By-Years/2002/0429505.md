Resource-Sensitive Framework for Concurrent Programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will develop a trace-theoretic denotational semantic framework and a
concurrent form of separation logic, for compositional reasoning about the
behavior of concurrent programs which share access to mutable state. Such
programs are widespread, for instance in Java applications. Pointers are
difficult to reason about, and concurrency makes the problem harder. Unlike
previous models, our semantics will detect the potential for races, such as an
attempt by one process to write on a piece of state used by
another&lt;br/&gt;process. Races cause unpredictable, possibly irreproducible,
behavior, and our semantics will treat a possible race as a catastrophe. This
semantics will be used in validating logics and advancing methodologies for the
design of correct race-free parallel programs.
