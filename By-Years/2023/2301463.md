Singularities are points where a geometric object degenerates in some way. They
play an important role in the study of algebraic geometry. This project is
concerned with the use of certain novel techniques to study invariants of
singularities. This theory provides an algebraic approach to the study of linear
partial differential equations, but it has found many applications in algebraic
geometry and related subjects. The goal of this project is, on one hand, to
further study some recently introduced classes of singularities and, on the
other hand, to explore new connections with zeta functions and invariants. The
proposal provides ample opportunity for the PI to collaborate with graduate
students and post-docs. He will also write a research monograph on this subject.

This project will involve several different research directions. First, the PI
will expand the study of k-rational and k-Du Bois singularities beyond the case
of hypersurfaces, using the recently defined version of minimal exponent for
locally complete intersections. In a different direction, he will investigate
D-module theoretic invariants of singularities modulo powers of a given prime,
that refine the test ideals and F-pure thresholds from positive characteristic,
and that might provide an arithmetic counterpart to characteristic zero
invariants, such as Hodge ideals and minimal exponents. A third direction
concerns exploring connections between the motivic zeta function and the minimal
exponent on one side, and between the topological zeta function and D-modules on
the other side (with possible applications to the Strong Monodromy Conjecture).
