In a suite of seismic experiments conducted in 1999 and 2000 microseismicity,
regional and teleseismic earthquake events were recorded on an array of twenty
seafloor instruments and 23 PASSCAL stations deployed on islands around the
Western Woodlark Basin. Preliminary data analysis was completed in the original
grant period, and this project will continue that effort. More data were
collected than anticipated, and in particular, the preliminary receiver function
data have proven a fertile source of information on regional crustal structure.
