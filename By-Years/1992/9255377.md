The Education Development Corporation will provide technical assistance to the
Statewide Systemic Initiatives Program by: 1. Providing technical assistance to
active SSI projects; 2. Assisting SSI states through various networking
activities; 3. Developing a leadership process for SSI states; and 4. Assisting
other states to develop SSI projects. EDC will (1) assist each participating
state in effectively implementing and institutionalizing its program for
mathematics and science reform, and (2) establish a self- sustaining and
permanent national network that will serve as a forum for supporting the science
and mathematics education reform efforts underway. Each SSI state will be
supported by an EDC-based state liaison technical assistance team that will
develop a thorough understanding of each state's infrastructure, resources,
problems, and constraints. Based on this understanding the team will design
appropriate technical assistance strategies to support each state in carrying
out its project goals. In addition, Action Groups composed of participants from
each state will be established to address issues common to all states that can
be best addressed through collective effort. The action groups will be supported
by the EDC team and its consultants. The activities that will support this
effort will include providing ongoing targeted consultation; establishing and
operating a communications network; organizing and conducting meetings, forums
and conferences; developing a clearinghouse for state-of-the-art resources; and
documenting and distilling new knowledge in systemic reform in mathematics and
science education.
