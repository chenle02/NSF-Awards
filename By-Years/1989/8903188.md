The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovak research project between Dr.
Josef Michl of the University of Texas, Austin, and Dr. Stanislav Hermanek of
the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Rez, is to explore several aspects of the
phyiscal inorganic chemistry of boranes. Upper electronic state spectroscopy
will be employed to examine a large number of closo, nido and arachno boranes.
Additionally, calculations of excited state energies and wavefunctions,
vibrational information, and results from studies of matrix-isolated reactive
intermediates will be drawn upon to characterize boranes. Through study of
boranes chemistry the researchers expect to determine principles of behavior for
electron defuicient molecules and to create an order, similar to that already
available for electron-satisfied elements derived through study of the chemistry
of carbon. This project in inorganic chemistry fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
