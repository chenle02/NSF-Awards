The ability to perform a task which involves a choice of right versus left
depends upon connections between the two sides of the brain. These connections
are carried by a bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum. in this
award Dr. Noonan will investigate the effects on right-left discrimination of
surgical disruption of the corpus callosum and selective damage to various areas
of the neocortex which are interconnected by the corpus callosum. His previous
work has shown that surgical disruption of brain pathways which interconnect the
two hemispheres can actually improve right-left differentiation and this award
will explore more precisely the anatomical localization of that phenomenon. Many
aspects of the research will be performed by undergraduate students, who will
receive valuable experience in basic scientific work. This research will
contribute to understanding the brain processes which are responsible for
mediating spatial information that allows an individual to navigate successfully
in the environment.
