Zhongwei Shen. DMS-9732894 The PI will study several problems which arise in
the fields of quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics. For Schr\"odinger operators
with electro-magnetic potentials, work will be done on the estimates of negative
eigenvalues and the non-classical asymptotics of the counting function. The
objective is to establish useful estimates in the cases when the classical
Cwikel-Lieb-Rosenblum bound fails. Work will also be done on the semi-classical
analysis of the ground state energy. The emphasis will be on the degenerate
potentials. The second line of research concerns the Pauli operator, which
describes the motion of charged particles with spin. The PI will study the Lieb-
Thirring type inequalities for the Pauli operator with a non-homogeneous
magnetic field. Such inequalities play an important role in the study of
stability of matter and semi-classical analysis in a magnetic field. Finally
work will be continued on boundary value problems in domains with rough
boundaries, which arise naturally in many engineering applications. In
particular, the resolvent estimates and fractional powers of the Stokes operator
in Lipschitz domains will be studied. The objective is to obtain a better
description of the behavior of the solutions to the nonlinear Navier-Stokes
equations in nonsmooth domains. This project lies at the interface of
mathematical physics, harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Its
goal is to gain better understanding of the spectral properties of quantum
systems, and to improve the mathematical theory, upon which the numerical
approximations and applications are based, for the Navier-Stokes equations which
model the fluid flow.
