Ravi-Chandar 9700449 The University of Houston proposes a three-year effort
aimed at investigating the phenomenon of dynamic shear banding and shear
fracture in ductile polymers, specifically polycarbonate. It is proposed to
perform experiments to characterize the high strain-rate thermomechanical
behavior of polycarbonate, to study shear banding and shear failure and the
associated failure mode transitions, and to compare these with experiments on
the metallic materials that are known to exhibit a similar behavior. Split
Hopkinson pressure bar and torsion bar experiments will be used to characterize
the high strain rate constitutive behavior of polycarbonate; high speed
photography combined with photoelasticity and high speed photomicrography will
be used to investigate the mechanics and mechanisms of shear banding and failure
mode transitions; temperature measurements using high speed infrared detectors
will be used to examine the role of temperature on the onset and growth of the
shear banding localization. Similar experiments will be performed in a metallic
material that also exhibits shear banding/shear failure mode transitions for
comparison. This basic research will lead to a better understanding of the
mechanisms and mechanics of shear banding and failure mode transitions in
ductile polymers. If the reasons for the similarities between the observed
behavior of polycarbonate and some metallic materials are understood, this work
will provide insight into shear banding in a wide range of materials. The effect
of superimposed static loading or displacement constraints on failure mode
transitions could have significant technological implications for the design of
structures resistant to impact damage and is proposed to be investigated.
