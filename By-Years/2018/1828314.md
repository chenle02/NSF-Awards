Maintenance of soil is critically important for sustaining the world's growing
population. Eroded surface sediment can also be a major pollutant degrading
aquatic ecosystems worldwide through light attenuation and heavy-metal
contamination. This instrumentation grant will add to sediment mobility research
through the measurement of decay products from naturally produced radioactive
isotopes adsorbed to sediment. This instrument will help build a foundation for
efforts to (1) create new datasets, (2) enhance infrastructure for
interdisciplinary, collaborative research, and (3) train a diverse workforce
capable of tackling society's environmental challenges through student training.
Education impacts of this grant include the incorporation of the instrument into
a new course and undergraduate student research projects through the NSF-funded
Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Scripps Institution of
Oceanography, UC San Diego.

Measurement of fallout radionuclides provide a means to measure rates of
surficial processes. Specifically, the short-lived beryllium nuclide 7Be can be
used to understand the chemically similar 10Be radionuclide commonly used in
surface-process research but typically only measured by more expensive
accelerator mass spectrometry. Detection of the abundant short-lived beryllium
radionuclide (7Be) via acquisition of a Canberra/Mirion U-Style Cryostat Small
Anode Germanium (SAGe) Well Detector System will facilitate research into the
mobility of cosmogenic 10Be and the adsorption behavior of 9Be, which is a toxic
pollutant. The acquisition of this instrument will drive scientific research
(some already NSF-funded) and innovation and cultivate interdisciplinary
collaborations among researchers studying low-temperature geochemistry, marine
geoscience, ecology, archaeology, and Earth-surface dynamics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
