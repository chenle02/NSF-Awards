The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Hampton University will enhance undergraduate education
in the Computer Science department to prepare students to meet the needs of the
workforce related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or advanced studies in AI.
Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers and peer
tutors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key goal of this project is to integrate
artificial intelligence modules and assignments into core computer science
courses to increase students' career preparation, knowledge, and professional
skills related to an area of artificial intelligence. The three specific
activities will be to: develop artificial intelligence modules and course-
relevant assignments; reform the core computer science courses; and enhance the
current advanced elective courses, such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine
Learning, and Data Science. The project will disseminate its findings widely and
have significant broader impacts on the education of African American computer
science majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
