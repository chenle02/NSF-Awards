This project involves the dissertation research of a student from Emory
University. The student will study how Palestinian people living in the West
Bank use the health care facilities made available to them by political
organizations such as Hamas, the PLO, and the PFLP. The project will test the
hypothesis that people's political identities influence their selection of
health facility to use. Patients, administrators, doctors and health care
providers in 4 clinics will be interviewed, clinic practices and dynamics will
be observed and health decisions of individual families will be followed. This
research is important because the middle east is a source of significant
political tension and change in the world. The project will advance our
understanding of the relation between nationalism, political ideology and
health. By studying the complex decisions and behavior of people who are
balancing health needs, economic and social constraints and political ideology
and identity, the study will advance our understanding of the importance of
politics in this region. A practical benefit of the project is that the insights
learned about health care will be available to planners in the middle east as
well as in similar regions of developing countries.
