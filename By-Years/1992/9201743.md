In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest, from different points
of view, in vector bundles in algebraic geometry. Several topics of interest in
this field include moduli of vector bundles on a Riemann surface, moduli of
vector bundles on algebraic surfaces, linear series and vector bundles, and
vector bundles on projective spaces. This project will support the Workshop on
Algebraic Vector Bundles to be held from October 16-19, 1992 at the University
of California, Los Angeles. It is anticipated that researchers will be brought
together from several subareas of the field, in the hope of stimulating
interaction between different outlooks. One of the principal objectives of the
workshop will be to expose newer researchers in algebraic geometry to this area.
