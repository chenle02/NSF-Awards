This research is a continuation of the past NSF-supported work on the theory and
practice of the p-and h-p versions of the finite element method. The aim is to
further develop theoretical and computational aspects of the method in
conjunction with its use in the engineering and industrial computation. The
collaboration with a number of engineering institutions will allow the
investigator to obtain essential experience with the solution of large
engineering problems, and will lead to speedy transfer of the results in the
engineering and industrial practice.
