The grant supports research in the design and analysis of algorithms and
improving the education infrastructure at the PI's department. The research
focuses primarily on the following areas: (i) fast approximation algorithms for
intractable (NP-hard) problems; (ii) fast approximation algorithms for very
large problems requiring nearly linear- time solutions; (iii) competitive
analysis of on-line caching problems. The style of research emphasizes the
following: (i) general techniques for understanding, unifying, and simplifying
large classes of algorithms; (ii) theoretical measures that are more realistic
than either the standard worst-case or average-case models; (iii) empirical
studies of new algorithms demonstrating their effectiveness. The education plan
consists of the following. (i) Developing a training course for a core group of
advanced undergraduates who will them lead small weekly discussion sections in
the introductory courses. (This will simultaneously improve the introductory
courses and provide a training ground for students to become educators.) (ii)
Working with an outside evaluator to extensively evaluate the experience of
majors and prospective majors. Two primary goals are to determine the effects of
the aforementioned discussion sections (both on the students in the sections and
those leading them), and to identify reasons for the low rate of retention of
women undergraduates by the department.
