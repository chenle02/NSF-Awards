The principal investigator will study the mathematical problems of fluid motion.
Methods of Littlewood-Paley theory and wavelets will be used to study weak
singularities for the incompressible flows of an ideal fluid. The basic
nonstationary problem for the Euler equations will be investigated in function
classes with, generally, essentially unbounded vorticity. He will address the
problem of linear vector transport by flows that are less than regular. These
aspects of transport theory are directly applicable to questions of existence
and uniqueness for the Euler equations.

The mathematical theory of fluid motion is fundamental both for applications in
meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics and within mathematics itself. Most of the
flows in nature such as ocean currents, or hurricanes, or the motion of matter
in a galaxy, are highly irregular. The origin and evolution of singular
structures such as rapid oscillations of a flow are still not well understood.
In addition to this, numerical modelling of irregular flows is limited by
instabilities due to the small scale structures constantly produced by the flow.
The PI will investigate two related aspects of this subject. First, the basic
mathematical nature of the flows with singularities. Second, transport of
quantities such as the magnetic field by irregular flows in the solar
photosphere.
