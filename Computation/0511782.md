This project is concerned with the numerical solution of partial differential
equations, as applied to layered models of ocean circulation. Particular issues
that are addressed include the following. (1) Develop numerical methods for
applying the spatial ``B-grid'' to layered models with vanishing layers, and
compare this grid to the ``C-grid'' in such situations. Each of these grids is a
staggered grid for which the mass variables and velocity components are defined
at different locations. Presently, the B-grid is widely used in z-coordinate
models, whereas layered models more typically use the C-grid. Of particular
interest in the present project are behavior near variable bottom topography and
the possible generation of grid noise. These issues have interfered with
previous attempts to use the B-grid with layered models, but the B-grid
nevertheless has attractive properties that warrant consideration. (2) Compare
different formulations of the momentum equation for numerical discretization,
and compare different advection methods for solving the equations for mass and
momentum. One issue of interest is the nature of the nonlinear interactions
within the discrete system. The choice of numerical scheme is also influenced by
the need to transport multiple scalar fields simultaneously.

The overall purpose of this work is to improve the algorithms that are used in
computer simulations of ocean circulation. The ocean plays a crucial role in the
global climate system, and a better understanding of that system relies in part
on numerical simulations of the ocean's circulation over long periods of time.
The investigator has developed an improved time-stepping method and related
algorithms, and the present project represents further work towards the goal of
improving the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the algorithms that are
used in numerical models of ocean circulation. The investigator has extensive
contacts with practicing ocean modelers who provide valuable insights to help
guide this research.
