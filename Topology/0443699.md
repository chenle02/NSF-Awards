Abstract

Award: DMS-0443699 Principal Investigator: Mikhail Kapranov

We propose to run a year-long program at the Fields Institute on the subject of
``Geometry of string theory''. The program will be devoted to mathematical
subjects motivated by string theory, and to recent developments in string theory
and related physical fields which are of strong mathematical interest. On the
mathematical side, the aim is to foster interaction between such areas of
mathematics as derived categories, elliptic cohomology, geometric Langlands
correspondence, quantum cohomology, differential geometry varieties with special
holonomy and of special Lagrangian varieties. On the more physical side, the aim
is to foster new progress in the continuing drive towards understanding the
foundations of string/M-theory, and in the wealth of new ideas involving
D-branes, BPS states and various dualities which are of great importance to
mathematical subjects such as algebraic geometry.

The overall goal of the program is to advance our understanding of the
fundamental questions of physics of the microworld. Probably the most promising
application of quantum physics contemplated nowadays is the Quantum Computing
Project which can potentially lead to creation of computers whose power exceeds
the present-day limits by many orders of magnitude. This direction is a part of
the proposed activitie and we plan to have a distinguished lecture series (the
Blyth Lectures) devoted to the subject. This program represents an excellent
opportunity for young scholars to experience a high-level interdisciplinary
collaboration. In particular, it is going to be a very important training ground
for young American scientists.
