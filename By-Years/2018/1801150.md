The automotive industry continues its radical transformation into new
technologies driven by developing connected/automated (autonomous) vehicles,
increasing fuel efficiency, minimizing environmental impact, and increasing
safety in car design. With this continued transformation, the industry expects
automotive employment to increase by 10.8% from 2013-2018. The proportion of
automotive technicians within the overall automotive industry is also expected
to grow, even as the work becomes more technically complex. These employment
projections highlight the importance of automotive technician education programs
that incorporate the latest innovations, so that program graduates can meet the
growing needs and expectations of the automotive industry. The Center for
Advanced Automotive Technology (CAAT) proposes to transition to a Resource
Center that will maintain components developed and/or supported by the Regional
CAAT Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAAT will continue to maintain, grow, and
distribute its library of open source, industry approved curriculum resources
that are aligned with the knowledge and skills needed by today's technicians in
the automotive industry. CAAT's leadership team will work closely with auto
designers, manufacturers, and parts suppliers to determine emerging education
needs, to ensure that the materials shared through CAAT continue to educate
graduates who meet employer needs. CAAT will also use outreach at the secondary
and post-secondary level to increase the talent pool of individuals interested
in advanced automotive technologies. As a resource center, CAAT aims to
strengthen the bridge between education and industry, so that technician
education programs include the most recent and promising new technologies that
affect the vehicles of today and tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
