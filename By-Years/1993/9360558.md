9360558 Wang In the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a multi-zonal
approach greatly simplifies the resolution of complex geometrical details and
the application of different flow physics in different zones of the flow domain.
Previous multi-zonal patched and overlapped approaches suffered from one or both
of the following problems. In the proposed approach, one of the overlapping
boundaries is used to divide the physical flow domain into non-overlapping
regions and flux conservation is enforced on this overlapping boundary locally
and globally. The proposed approach unifies the treatment for arbitrarily
patched and overlapped meshes. The interpolation of flow variables from one zone
to another is not necessary. The proposed approach is fully conservative, highly
accurate, suitable for both steady and unsteady flow problems and easy to
implement in finite-difference/finite volume CFD codes. In Phase I, the proposed
methodology will be implemented and assessed for several 2D and 3D problems
without relative mesh movement. Further extension to viscous flow and unsteady
flow with relative mesh movement and implementation of the proposed methodology
in a production-level flow analysis code will be carried out in Phase II.
