The rapid development of computer power is shifting the focus of undergraduate
science teaching away from reproduction of prescribed procedures to observing,
investigating, and even discovering physical laws. This project is using the
analytical tools that were once available only to the research scientist, and
that can now be used by undergraduates to visualize data and mathematical
functions, to broaden the range of problems accessible to them, and to develop
model-building and simulation skills. Also, the computer has itself become an
integral part of nearly all scientific instrumentation and its use must be
included in the modern physics curriculum.The project is being implemented by
developing a computing laboratory using the software packages Mathematica (for
visualization and computational power), LabView (a data acquisition and analysis
code), and LogicWorks and PSPlCE (electronics simulation codes). The codes are
being run on Macintosh IIci computers using computer interfaces and associated
hardware from National Instruments.The Department of Physics of the University
of Richmond is applying these new technologies to the introductory course
program and are now being extended to the upper-division courses. Quantum
mechanics is one of most mathematically foreboding courses undergraduates face.
The laboratory is enabling students to experiment graphically and symbolically
and to investigate the science more deeply. We are also incorporating modern
simulation and data acquisition and analysis techniques into our two-semester
electronics sequence. The students are learning to transform physical
measurements into electrical signals, process the signals, and collect them with
the computer. They are using simulation software to design, develop, and test
circuits.
