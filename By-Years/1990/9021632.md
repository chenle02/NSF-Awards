Dr. Edward Green is studying the intricate electrophysiology of a brain
structure, the hippocampus, which is known to be involved in learning and
memory. His work should provide important information regarding the nature of
the information processing which takes place in the dentate gyrus, a special
region of the hippocampus, during exploratory behavior. Furthermore, this work
is designed to evaluate functional alterations in the hippocampus associated
with behavioral exploration. The proposed studies will utilize
electrophysiological recordings of field potentials and single unit responses of
granule cells in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. The specific goals of
the work include: a) an evaluation of the interaction between the transient
alterations in synaptic transmission related to behavioral state, and moderately
persistent changes in synaptic efficacy that are associated with exploratory
behavior; b) an assessment of the role of adrenal hormones in naturally
occurring, synaptic efficacy changes in the dentate gyrus that accompany
exploratory behavior; c) a determination of whether the locus coeruleus is
necessary for producing environmentally-modulated alterations in granule cell
excitability; d) an evaluation of whether naturally- occurring alterations in
synaptic efficacy and electrically - induced long-term potentiation share a
common synaptic mechanism; and e) a comparison of granule cell unit activity
during specific behaviors in the home environment to unit activity during the
same behaviors following exploration. Findings from these studies will provide
us with detailed information about how a specific area of the brain processes
information and retains that information for the purpose of memory storage.
