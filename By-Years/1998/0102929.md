Dr. Carlyle Storm of the Gordon Research Conferences is sponsoring the 2001
Electrochemistry Gordon Conference in Ventura CA, January 14-19, 2001. The chair
is Debra Rolison of the Naval Research Laboratory and the vice-chair is Henry
White of University of Utah. The theme of this meeting is "if charge moves, it's
electrochemistry," and the topics include fields at surfaces, materials,
electrochemical power sources, and nanochemistry. This broader scope of the
meeting represents a change from past meetings in the series. The meeting has
excellent participation of underrepresented groups. The meeting is partially
funded by this grant from the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
