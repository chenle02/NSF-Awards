This RAPID project will explore how different professional development programs
impact faculty instruction. While studies of one program are useful, they do not
result in a deeper understanding of faculty instructors learning that can be
achieved through comparative studies of multiple approaches. The proposed study
is better situated to discover factors that influence faculty learning and
teaching behavior by examining faculty learning in four different professional
development programs that have been enacted at the University of Georgia
beginning in the spring, 2016. It will study these (and a control group) and
measure their impact from differences in outcomes as faculty instructors
implement what they are learning in real time and in the fall. These four
methods are representative of the approaches being implemented nationally across
a large number of universities. This project has the advantage of studying all
four at the same time at the same institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will
be a mixed methods study, which will have quantitative and qualitative
components that are mixed in the analysis. Qualitative data will be collected in
the spring, and will consist of interviews, observations, and artifacts that
pertain to instruction. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected in
the fall. Quantitative data will examine the teaching of faculty who
participated in the different programs and a group that did not participate in
such a program. Qualitative data will consist of interviews about the
implementation (or not) of active learning approaches.
