Three different one-week workshops on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy will be offered for chemistry faculty from undergraduate
institutions. The first week will cover introductory material intended to help
those who attended college and graduate school before NMR spectrometers were
commonplace. The second will emphasize the features of pulsed and multinuclear
NMR, and the third will deal with sophisticated pulse sequences and two-
dimensional techniques. The workshops will combine lecture, computer simulation,
hands-on instrumentation, and spectral analysis.
