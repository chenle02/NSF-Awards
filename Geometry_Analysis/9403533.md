9403533 Vitter The proposal coverss group activity in the general area of
mathematical physics, topology and complex geometry. Specifics include
foliations of Monge-Ampere type, group actions on spheres and the geometry of
vector bundles over Grassmannians. These topics are important in modern
mathematical physics including soliton theory. ***
