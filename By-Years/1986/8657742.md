This action is to award funds for a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Robert
Sapolsky has already embarked on a brilliant career in neuroendocrinology
research. His work focuses on three basic questions: 1) What are the
neuroendocrine abnormalities that underly syndromes of glucocorticoid
hypersecretion; 2) What are the consequences of excessive exposure to
glucocorticoids, in particular, what role do glucocorticoids play in mediating
neuron death during aging and following neuropathologic insults; and 3) What are
the cellular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids are neurotoxic? Dr. Sapolsky
has already studied negative-feedback regulation of glucocorticoid secretion,
focusing on the role of the hippocampus as an inhibitory negative-feedback brake
upon adrenocorticoid activity, its role in terminating glucocorticoid secretion
at the end of stress and the failure of this type of regulation in aged rats. He
has refined and originated methods for quantitative measures for steroid
receptors in the brain in order to examine the relationship between occupancy of
hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors and the initiation of inhibitory
hippocampal signals to the hypothalamus.
