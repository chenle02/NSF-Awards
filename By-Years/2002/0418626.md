Over 30 years ago the NSF-supported Symbios Expedition to Enewetak Atoll,
Marshall Islands, aboard the R/V Alpha Helix, gave science new insights into the
metabolism and functioning of coral reefs. Yet, although scientists worldwide
know this expedition from the many papers that resulted from it, few know what
resources and planning it took to undertake this highly successful research
project. The goal of this project is to provide better documentation of this
expedition, and in the process, assess its high scientific productivity and the
key factors that led to this productivity.
