9628576 Yeats Rates of deformation are data that are difficult to obtain, but
essential for the understanding of active tectonism in any tectonic
environments. Rates of deformation are determined by various means, both
directly and indirectly, but commonly employ phenomena of tectonic geomorphology
are currently almost entirely based on subaerial landforms, even though most
active plate boundaries are offshore. This project will attempt to use subsea
landforms off the Cascadia Coast to estimate shortening rates during that part
several thousand years. Results should illustrate the potential of active
tectonics studies offshore to add considerable rate information for on-going
deformation.
