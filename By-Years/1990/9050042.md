A symposium will be convened at the National Technological Literacy Conference
in February 1990. Participants will be the major practitioners and innovators in
science and engineering education for non-science majors, who will review and
share their work. The symposium is aimed at, and should be of great use to ,
faculty and administrators from the many liberal arts colleges who will soon be
launching attepmts to improve science and technology education for the majority
of their students who will not go on to become scientists and engineers.
Products will consist of a survey report, to be widely disseminated, and a
collection of documents publicized and made available through Penn State
