Manhattan College is creating an Integrated Solid Mechanics Laboratory for the
Departments of Mechanical and Civil Engineering. This funding supports the
acquisition of a mechanical dynamic testing apparatus (Instron 8501) which is
the cornerstone of the laboratory. This equipment supports five new experiments
for an integrated laboratory course and also the advanced undergraduate courses
in structures, soil mechanics, foundations, machine design, and the capstone
design courses offered by both departments. This test equipment brings state-of-
the- art capability to an important area of the undergraduate engineering
curriculum at Manhattan College. This award is being matched by an equal sum
from the grantee.
