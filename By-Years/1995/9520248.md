9520248 Betenbaugh This proposal is on research to develop a better
understanding of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in order to use this
information for constructing more productive expression systems. This involves
research to: (1) determine the genes which suppress the induction of apoptosis
for several cell lines, and (2) clone the genes and assess cell death in
response to viral infection or other environmental insults such as nutrient
limitations and exposure to toxic levels of by-products. ***
