This proposal seeks to establish the Ohio Research Academic Resource Network
(OARNET), an intrastate network connecting universities, colleges, and other
research laboratories in the State of Ohio to the Ohio Supercomputer Center and
to the NSFNET. A network management organization will provide technical support
and policy oversight. Initially the principal use of the network is expected to
be for supercomputer access, but other types of use will develop. General use
involving electronic mail, exchange of research data, and interactive computing
by academic and governmental instituions is expected to grow rapidly and to
facilitate much more research collaboration. The NSF funding will supply seed
money to purchase gateway equipment and provide partial funding of the network
management group. The Ohio state government will provide much of the long
distance line costs by using the State of Ohio Network for Integrated
Communications (SONIC) as a means of connecting participating institutions to
major hub site at Ohio State University.
