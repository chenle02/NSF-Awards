The research component of this CAREER project explores the differences between a
representative eukaryote, prokaryote, and hyperthermophilic (grows at over 80
degrees C) archaea in their utilization of sugars and, more specifically, their
evolved strategies for substrate recognition and turnover by enzymes involved in
the synthesis of carbohydrate polymers and sugar nucleotides. An understanding
of the differences in carbohydrate binding and catalysis between the three major
life forms provides not only a window into the evolution of such a fundamental
aspect of life as sugar metabolism, but also clues to the directed evolution and
use of these protein catalysts over a range of temperatures for laboratory and
industrial syntheses of carbohydrate or carbohydrate-derived structures. The
teaching component of this project is 1) redesigning the undergraduate organic
laboratory curriculum for discovery-based learning and introducing state-of-the-
art concepts and techniques and 2) incorporating the non-covalent interactions
common to biological binding events into and developing examples from fields
intersecting with chemistry for both undergraduate organic chemistry and
graduate level physical organic chemistry courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: Probing the differences in charged sugar recognition among the three
major branches of life and developing new teaching aids will have broad impact
in attracting students to chemistry, in mentoring and training students in
research, in developing new mass spectrometry-based and synthetic methodologies,
in discovering rules for best use of carbohydrate-recognizing biocatalysts in
syntheses based on renewable resources, and in providing insights into how the
basic processes of life may have evolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-
funded by the Metabolic Biochemistry program and the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry program.&lt;br/&gt;
