This research program of Professor Madeleine Joullie in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania will be supported by the Organic
Synthesis Program. The principal investigator will continue her investigations
into the synthesis of cyclopeptide alkaloids, and to use the elaborated
methodologies for the synthesis of other natural products. Cyclopeptide
alkaloids belong to a closely related group of more than one hundred macrocyclic
polyamide bases of plant origin. The compounds are primarily composed of simple,
natural amino acids linked by amide bonds except for one non-amino acid unit
which is a styrylamine portion or derivative thereof. With one exception, all
cyclopeptide alkaloids contain a beta-hydroxyamino acid which distinguishes the
various families of compounds. There is evidence that these compounds function
as ionophores and may be involved in the absorption of nutrients from the soil,
especially alkali metal ions. The low natural availability of the cyclopeptide
alkaloids makes the development of synthetic routes to this interesting class of
compounds desirable.
