The investigators model and analyze a mechano-chemical instability recently
discovered in the study of catalytic chemical reactions on very thin crystals:
spatiotemporal variation in the reaction rate coupled with heat release causes
spatially varying thermal expansion and buckling of the catalyst surface. This
changes the catalytic properties, closing the loop between reaction, heat
release and deformation; it has been observed to lead to sustained mechano-
chemical oscillations. The project builds on experience in studying pattern
formation and instability independently in mechanical and in chemically reacting
systems. Theoretical and computational studies of nonlinear buckling of beams
under constraints are extended to account for static as well as dynamic
variations of the beam properties, including thermally-induced strains. Earlier
computer-assisted studies of pattern formation on catalytic surfaces are used to
drive, through the temperature fields thereby generated, mechanical deformations
of the catalyst. Finally, the loop is closed by allowing the deformation to
change the surface catalytic properties, thus attempting to reproduce the
oscillations observed in experiments. The modeling, stability analysis and
computer-assisted work are performed in constant dialogue with experimental
groups in Princeton (on inhomogeneous beams) and in Berlin (on deforming
catalytic crystals).

Heterogeneous catalytic reactions constitute the backbone of chemical processes
of industrial and environmental relevance: the CO oxidation reaction the project
addresses occurs, for example, in every automotive catalytic converter. The
development of techniques for analyzing in fine spatial and temporal detail what
occurs on the catalyst in situ under reaction conditions is revolutionizing the
way modeling of these processes is done and enabling the discovery of new
phenomena. This will in turn improve the design of catalytic processes.
Specifically, this project aims at understanding a phenomenon only recently
observed in CO oxidation: oscillations involving mechanical deformations of the
catalyst coupled to temperature and chemical concentrations. Computer-aided
analyses of the process lead to better, predictive models, which can be
exploited in optimizing both the material properties and the operating
conditions of the process. Funding for the project is provided by the program of
Computational Mathematics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS
and by the Chemical Reaction Processes program in ENG.
