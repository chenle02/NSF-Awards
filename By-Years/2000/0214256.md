The Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is a new multi-
university, multi-disciplinary Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC). The vision for the center is to provide integrated solutions to
logistics problems, through modeling, analysis and intelligent-systems
technologies.

The four universities involved in this proposal, the University of Arkansas,
serving as the lead institution, the University of Oklahoma, the University of
Louisville, and Oklahoma State University are assuming a leadership role in
engineering logistics research and education.

The scope of CELDi will address (1) value-adding processes that create time and
place utility (transportation, material handling, and distribution), (2) value-
sustaining processes that prolong useful life (maintenance, repair, and rework),
and (3) value-recovering processes that conserve scarce resources and enhance
societal goodwill (returns, refurbishment, and recycling).
