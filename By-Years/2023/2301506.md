Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies geometric properties
of spaces defined by polynomial equations. One of the key objects in algebraic
geometry is the moduli space of curves, a geometric space whose points
correspond to types of algebraic curves. This moduli space has many connections
to other areas of mathematics and to physics (where the algebraic curves are the
strings appearing in string theory). One way to study the moduli space of curves
is via its intersection theory, the study of how certain loci in the moduli
space (those corresponding to curves with specific properties) intersect each
other. In this project, the PI will investigate various problems relating to a
fundamental intersection-theoretic class on the moduli space of curves: the
double ramification cycle. This project will also provide research opportunities
for graduate students, who will be trained in the methods of the field.

The PI will study two main groups of problems dealing with the intersection
theory of the moduli space of curves. First, the PI will develop improved
formulas for the logarithmic double ramification cycle, a refinement of the
double ramification cycle constructed and studied in the last several years by
Holmes, Ranganathan, Schwarz, and others. The PI and his coauthors recently
developed an approach to computing this cycle, and the primary goal of this
project is to make this approach more effective so that it can be applied to
localization computations in logarithmic geometry. Second, the PI will
investigate assorted connections that have surfaced in recent years between the
double ramification cycle and other tautological classes. This includes
developing a theory of log tautological relations, defining and computing an
orbifold version of the double ramification cycle, and attempting to prove a
one-dimensional socle result for the tautological ring of the moduli space of
bridgeless curves.
