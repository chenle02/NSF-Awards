This grant explores the processes leading to mechanical mixing in metallic
alloys during high-energy ball milling and during dry sliding wear. A major
objective of this work is to elucidate the atomistic processes leading to
mechanical mixing during ball milling, and their competition with thermal
decomposition in the case of alloys with positive heats of mixing. The aim is to
use analytical and high-resolution electron microscopy as well as atom probe
field ion microscopy for characterization of the selected Ni-based alloys
processed under controlled conditions. A goal of the project is to improve the
understanding and the development of self-lubricated materials, and to apply the
findings on the evolution of alloys during ball milling to the microstructural
and chemical evolution of solids undergoing dry sliding wear. Along with the
experimental studies, molecular dynamics modeling will be developed for improved
kinetic model and simulations of mechanical alloying. %%% The project results
are expected to lead to structural nanocomposites with improved properties. A
goal of the project is to broaden the impact of the proposed work by
implementing and developing a student teaching-based instructional method, by
integrating research and teaching, and by developing collaborations on
techniques with nanometer-scale resolution, such as electron microscopy and atom
probe field ion microscopy. Collaborations with academic institutions and
laboratories in US and abroad are planned. ***
