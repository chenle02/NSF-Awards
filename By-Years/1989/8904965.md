The objective of this research is to make an extensive series of laboratory
experiments on bed configurations produced in fine sands by oscillatory flows
and combined flows (superpositions of oscillatory and unidirectional components)
over a wide range of moderate to long oscillation periods, moderate to large
maximum orbital velocities, and small to large unidirectional current
velocities. The experiments will be made in a large new combined-flow duct about
15 m long, 1.2 m wide, and 0.4 m deep. The oscillatory component is produced by
forcing water back and forth through a closed horizontal duct between open
reservoir tanks by means of a piston moving in simple harmonic motion, and
superimposing a current by pumping water from one end of the duct to the other
at the same time. Comparison of the stratification geometry produced in the
sediment deposit with that observed in shallow-marine sandstones in the ancient
sedimentary record should lead to fundamental advances in the ability to
interpret the depositional conditions of ancient storm-deposited sandstones.
