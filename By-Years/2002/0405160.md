Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
hold conferences concerning various aspects of dynamical systems for the two
years beginning September 2004. We will cover expenses of
&lt;br/&gt;approximately 30 participants each of the two years. After covering
some expenses for speakers, the priorities will be to support graduate students
and nontenured researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Midwest Dynamical Systems
Group has fostered the interaction of a &lt;br/&gt;diverse group of people
working in various aspects of dynamical systems, &lt;br/&gt;from topological to
analytical, and from theoretical to applied. &lt;br/&gt;We have also actively
supported the research of younger researchers. This program has been active
since about 1970.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speakers for 2004-5 include Robert
Williams (University of Texas), Robert&lt;br/&gt;Devaney (Boston University),
Carl Simon (University of Michigan), Michal Misiurewicz (IUPUI), and Hassan
Aref. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
