*** 9603361 Goldburg This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
in condensed matter physics involves the research groups of Walter Goldburg at
the University of Pittsburgh and H. Kellay at the University of Bordeaux I. The
award provides travel support and living expenses to Dr. Goldburg, his
colleague, X.L. Wu, and a graduate student. The objective of the research is to
investigate the statistical properties of the vorticity field in two dimensional
(2D) turbulence flow. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
expertise in turbulence studies. This is complemented by the French experimental
effort in thermodynamics and phase behavior of systems. The collaboration will
advance understanding of two dimensional turbulence. ***
