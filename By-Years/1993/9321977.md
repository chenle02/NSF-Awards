9321977 Stermitz The focus of this research will be the study of the
biosynthesis of 2,6-disubstituted piperidine alkaloids in Ponderosa pine and
Colorado blue spruce. Further, the bioactivity testing of the alkaloids should
define the importance of these compounds in plant/herbivore interactions.
Research on plant/insect interactions center on the study of iridoid glycosides
from Scrophulariaceae and the specialist lepodoptera whose larva feed on the
plants. It is anticipated that free-flying butterflies can be used to help
identify larval food plants. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Frank R. Stermitz of the Department of
Chemistry at Colorado State University. Professor Stermitz will focus his work
on the isolation, stucture, biosynthesis and ecological role piperidine
alkaloids in conifer species and in the isolation and structural
characterization of iridoid glycosides and the importance of these compounds in
plant/insect interactions. ***
