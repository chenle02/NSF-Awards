This award will provide funds to investigate the magnitude of the deglacial
deep-sea carbonate preservation maximum with a multi-proxy approach that
includes a new bulk sediment calcite dissolution proxy, the menardii
fragmentation index (MFI), and multiple cores from the Pacific and Indian
Oceans. Specifically, the PI will apply the MFI to deep sea sediments in an
attempt to explain why a preservation spike is not seen with the MFI relative to
other proxies. Results of this work will provide a significant test of
hypotheses that link the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 to increased
ventilation of deep water masses. Broader Impacts include undergraduate
involvement in both research activities and the scientific and public
dissemination of results as well as public outreach events such as activities
for Super Science Saturday, postings on www.realclimate.org and annual student
presentations at Student Scholarship Day. This project also brings together
collaborators from premier research institutions and a primarily undergraduate
teaching institution.
