The goals of this new project are to examine the mechanism by which the primary
mouth of deuterostomes forms at the extreme anterior of the embryo. A particular
emphasis is on evolutionary conservation, or lack of it, in determining this
organ. The primary mouth is the initial opening from the gut of the embryo to
the outside, allowing ingestion of food. In most deuterostome species, the
primary mouth remains the mouth opening. In vertebrates, the neural crest grows
around the primary mouth to form the face and a secondary mouth opening must
therefore form. The primary mouth then becomes the pharyngeal opening. The
region from which the primary mouth develops is unusual as here ectodermal and
endodermal germ layers are directly juxtaposed. Both ectoderm and endoderm are
required for primary mouth formation. The broad hypothesis of this proposal is
that the mechanisms by which the primary mouth is determined are evolutionarily
conserved. There are three specific aims. 1. Markers of the primary mouth region
in Xenopus will be isolated. 2. Mechanisms of primary mouth determination in
Xenopus will be examined, focusing on candidate transcription factors and
signaling systems involved. 3. Comparison of the expression of selected Xenopus
markers will be made with expression of homologs in another deuterostome, the
zebrafish, Danio. The intellectual merit of this proposal will be the increased
understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of primary mouth formation. This
region is important and its development poorly understood. Part of the broad
impact of the proposal is that it spans the fields of Developmental and
Evolutionary Biology. It will allow investigators involved to work with more
than one species, which is an unusual training opportunity. Further, this study
is a wonderful teaching tool, that will allow graduate, undergraduate and high
school students a hands-on opportunity to think about evolution, and to compare
formation of distinct animals.
