This award is a Research Planning Grant under the Research Opportunities for
Women Program. The research project which will be planned under this grant
involves the use of cage-like compounds of aluminum and nitrogen to simulate
some of the features of activated metal oxide surfaces which are used as
catalyst supports. These cage compounds resemble the surfaces in electronic
properties, low coordination number, and multiplicity of active sites. The goal
of the research is to induce and characterize multiple interactions of the cage
compounds with transition metal carbonyl complexes. The reaction chemistry and
photochemistry of the cage-transition metal compounds will be examined. These
homogeneous systems will provide interesting contrasts to the chemistry of
catalysts composed of transition metal compounds supported on metal oxide
surfaces. A better understanding of the relationship between surface effects and
the catalytic activity of the heterogeneous species is expected to result from
the work.
