Six faculty members of the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology request
funds to purchase a phosphorimager. Use of this instrument would obviate the
need for prolonged autoradiographic exposure and quantitation by scanning
densitometry or gel slicing and scintillation spectrometry currently necessary
for several of the projects discussed herein. One project (Richter) deals with
translational control during early development. Cis sequences and trans binding
proteins that control translation have been identified and their isolation and
cloning would be facilitated by the phosphorimager. Another project (Baril)
examines the factors involved with DNA replication in human cells. Detailed
analysis of the enzymatic activities of the many factors involved in replication
requires the sensitivity of a phosphorimager. The goal of a third project
(Vallee) is to understand how the mechanochemical protein dynamin produces the
force required for organelle movement. Recent evidence suggests that
phosphorylation plays an important role in this process and the phosphorimager
would be critical for examining this posttranslational modification. A fourth
project (Witman) deals with the generation and control of flagellar motility in
sperm and Chlamydomonas. Phosphorylation of dynein and other proteins appears to
be necessary for cell motility, whose study would be enhanced with a
phosphorimager. RNA processing is studied in the fifth project (Pederson). The
activity of some proteins in the splicing apparatus is regulated by
phosphorylation, which would be analyzed more reliably and with greater speed
with a phosphorimager. The sixth project deals with how protein kinase activity
in Alvsia neurons affects channel function. Analysis of this function would be
facilitated with a phosphorimager.
