The proposal presents several problems related to the geometry of algebraic
varieties and their moduli. A first research objective is to study the
birational geometry of the Grothendieck-Knudsen moduli space of stable rational
curves, in particular, via arithmetic techniques; a sub-project is to develop
the Arakelov theory of this space. A second objective is to prove that 2-Fano
manifolds are rationally simply connected. This is an analogue of the celebrated
Koll√°r-Miyaoka-Mori result that Fano manifolds are rationally connected. Using
results of de Jong and Starr, a consequence will be a generalization of Tsen's
theorem, namely, that a 2-Fano manifold defined over the function field of a
surface has a rational point. This would give a natural geometric condition for
the existence of rational points.

The broader context of the project is the area of algebraic geometry, currently
one of the most active branches of mathematics, with widespread applications
throughout mathematics and reaching into physics and engineering. Algebraic
geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are geometric objects given
by the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. The variation of algebraic
varieties is captured by the so-called moduli spaces, which are themselves
algebraic varieties with a very rich structure. In the two main themes of this
project, moduli spaces play a central role, both as spaces whose geometry we
investigate, and as tools for answering questions about whether certain systems
of polynomial equations have solutions or not. The expectation is that the
projects will significantly impact other areas of mathematics, especially
arithmetic geometry.
