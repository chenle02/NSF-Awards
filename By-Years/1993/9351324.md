This project is designed for the improvement and expansion of several courses
that focus on the role of sciences and scientific methods as applied to
archaeological problems . The primary course, Introduction to Sciences in
Archaeology, is required of archaeology majors, but draws the majority of its
students from other non-science disciplines. The enrollments in this and other
courses have increased substantially over the years and the updated equipment
meets the needs of the larger classes. It is also expected that the project will
improve the standard of teaching, as well as expand the existing framework of
the courses to include additional discussion or laboratory sections.
