The Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at the University of Cincinnati
on October 22 and 23, 1999. This colloquium series has become an important
regional meeting. It attracts participants primarily from the greater Midwest
probability community. It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate
students and other young investigators to attend and interact with specialists.
