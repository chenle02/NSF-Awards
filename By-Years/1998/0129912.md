The Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) conference
entitled "Post-Transcriptional Control of Gene Expression: Effectors of mRNA
Decay" will be held July 6-11, 2002 in Tucson, Arizona. The objective of this
conference is to provide an opportunity for the cross-fertilization of ideas
between workers studying mRNA decay in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. mRNA decay
plays a major role in determining the level at which genes are expressed.
Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of mRNA degradation becomes very
important to understanding how genes are regulated. Among the topics planned for
this conference are: (1) A keynote overview of mRNA decay at the start of the
conference by Dr. Roy Parker (University of Arizona). (2) Multicomponent
bacterial nucleases. (3) Multicomponent eukaroytic nucleases. (4) How mRNA
transport and localization affect mRNA decay. (5) How translational accuracy
affects mRNA decay, including how the premature termination of translation
elicits mRNA decay. (6) Cis-acting mRNA sequences and their associated trans-
acting factors that affect mRNA decay. (7) RNA as a tool and target for drug
design.
