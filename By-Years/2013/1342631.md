The research team has developed a thermostable and acidotolerant mobile enzyme
sequestration platform (mESP) system capable of enhancing deconstruction
efficiency of pretreated lignocellulosic substrates. The current research is
focused on preparing this technology for use in 2nd-generation bioethanol
production processes, and can also be employed in corn-based (1st-generation)
production. The technology enhances the efficiency of enzyme-mediated processes
that deconstruct pretreated feedstock and convert complex carbohydrates to
simple fermentable sugars. The research team plans to upscale mESP technology
from a laboratory-scale system to an industrial system that can potentially;
accelerate the development second generation mESP prototypes for lignocellulosic
(2nd-generation) production processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of mESP
systems can result in significant savings for 1st-generation bioethanol
producers and open markets for 2nd-generation products. Additionally, mESPs
enable wider-spread production of lignocellulosic-based biofuels (2nd
generation) by providing another option for high efficiency feedstock
deconstruction. Opportunities to use mESPs in bioremediation and food production
will also be explored by this I-Corps team.
