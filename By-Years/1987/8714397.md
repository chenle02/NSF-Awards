The work proposed here will study the effects of somatic variation on the
population biology and evolution of plants by examining somatic changes of
nuclear DNA. Two aspects of genomic change will be studied: 1) the occurrence of
rapid genomic changes in response to environmental variation, and 2) the
accumulation of somatic mutation. Plants have been chosen as model systems
because they are particularly amenable to the study of somatic change. Plants
can attain great ages, thus mutations accumulate over time. In addition, plants
appear to have flexible genomes which respond to environmental pressures. The
proposed studies will measure the accumulation of somatic mutations in long-
lived individuals of Pinus longaeva, the Bristlecone Pine, and in ancient clones
of Solidago altissima, a species of undisturbed prairies. Somatic changes in
ribosomal DNA and in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene will be determined using
standard DNA technologies. These studies will determine the rate of somatic
change over time and the influence of somatic mutation on genetic variation
within populations. The experimental induction of rapid genomic change in
response to variable environments will be studied in both Solidago and
Taraxacum, an asexually reproducing species. The work proposed here examines
fundamental genetic processes which have potential importance for the genetics
and evolution of plant species. Moreover, somatic variation occurs in all
organisms and has been implicated in the process of ageing and in the generation
of tumoricity. The work proposed here will provide detailed knowledge of the
rate and accumulation of somatic variation and thus will provide information
which is of potential use in the study of age dependent genetic changes in
humans.
