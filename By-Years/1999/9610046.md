9610046 Ross This research investigates certain properties of stochastic
processes that have applications to operational problems in production systems.
In particular, for an independent, identically distributed sequence of random
variables with arbitrary distribution, the investigator studies the distribution
of the first time at which a particular (fixed) pattern appears. Such a sequence
may represent any of a variety of practical quantities; e.g., a moving average
of observations of quality characteristics, or the successive states of a multi-
component, failure-prone system. Traditional approaches to this problem have
attempted to study the structure of imbedded Markov chains and prove to be
computationally intractable. The investigator proposes a new approach based on
renewal-theoretic arguments to obtain bounds and approximations that can lead to
analysis tools and efficient simulation procedures. A related problem, also
studied in this project, involves improving on central limit theorem-based
approximations of convolutions. While the primary thrust of the work is
theoretical, the investigator will study the computational aspects of these
problems as well. This work has direct relevance to fundamental problems in
reliability and quality control, particularly in the area of multivariate
control charts. Thus this research is expected to result in both theoretical
advances that can be applied to a wide range of problems as well as in practical
new tools in the area of multivariate quality monitoring. The latter is an
active and extremely important area of operations research, and one in which
stochastic process-based techniques can be expected to make significant
contributions.
