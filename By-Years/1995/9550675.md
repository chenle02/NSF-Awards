The California State University, Chico proposes to conduct a residential summer
science camp on its campus for 50 Native American youth from rurally isolated,
northeastern California, in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. Over a three
year period this amounts to 150 students being served. The camp will be composed
of two, two-week sessions each summer. These sessions will take place during the
month of July. This program will be delivered by University faculty and staff,
and American Indian youth counselors will be role models. The curriculum will be
conducted through the College of Natural Sciences. Because the world of the
Native American student is relatively limited in the science and mathematics
areas, this camp will provide exercises and experiences that students can relate
to. The activities will be hands-on, involving students in learning practical
aspects of design, analysis, and manufacture while learning and reinforcing the
content and principles of chemistry, biology, physics, math, and engineering
which apply. This SSC program will follow students through a tracking program to
establish completion of middle school. The University will also provide
individual career counseling to each of the students to determine their
individual interests and goals and determine the most appropriate path to
achieve these goals. Finally, this SSC program would be the only one of its kind
in the Western Region, focusing entirely on Native American youth. ***
