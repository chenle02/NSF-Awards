This project allows the development of condensed matter physics experiments to
be used in conjunction with the courses offered in the sophomore through senior
years of the undergraduate physics curriculum. The equipment is easy to use,
flexible in its ability to support a wide variety of solid state physics
experiments, and fairly free of maintenance. The solid state physics laboratory
utilizes two temperature control systems: (1) a home-made liquid nitrogen
cryostat for experiments between 77 K and room temperature, and (2) a closed
cycle liquid helium refrigerator for experiments between 10 K and room
temperature. The second, acquired for this project, allows for low temperature
experiments without the need for purchasing, storing, and transferring liquid
helium. A laboratory computer system is used for experimental control, data
acquisition, and data analysis in some of the more advanced experiments, and
additional pieces of modern instrumentation are used to instrument fully the
experiments.
