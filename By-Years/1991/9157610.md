This research will focus on the design of parallel algorithms, languages and
simulation tools that promote effective utilization of parallel architectures by
simplifying the task of programming them efficiently. Also, research in
evolutionary software design methodologies based on the use of hybrid models
that include simulated and implemented system components for the design of
performance-critical distributed systems will be performed.
