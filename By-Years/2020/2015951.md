Soil bacteria make compounds called anthracyclinones (ACs), some of which have
powerful therapeutic activity. ACs have complicated structures that are produced
by enzymes found in the bacteria. This project will “mix-and-match” these
enzymes to make novel ACs expected to have antibiotic and anticancer activity.
As a Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project, it will attract
undergraduate students to careers in science and engineering by involving them
in the completion of the research aims. The professor and students will
communicate to the public through a podcast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall
objective of the project is to characterize polyketide synthase (PKS) genetic
parts. These parts will be brought together in a platform (BIOPOLYMER) to form
productive in vivo biosynthetic pathways. BIOPOLYMER will facilitate rational
combinatorial biosynthesis. The central hypothesis is that combinatorial
biosynthesis of selected PKS and post-PKS enzymes will facilitate the production
of rationally designed anthracyclinones. The hypothesis will be tested in two
specific aims: (1) characterize and develop PKS BioBricks parts for metabolic
engineering of tricyclic anthracyclinones via heterologous expression of these
components in actinomycetes; (2) characterize and develop post-PKS BioBricks
parts for metabolic engineering of tetracyclic and oxidatively modified
anthracyclinones in actinomycetes. At the completion of these studies, PKS and
post-PKS gene sets will be identified that compose “new-to-nature” biosynthetic
pathways for synthesizing new pharmaceuticals or commodity chemicals. The
strains and vectors that are developed in this project period will be shared
with the broader natural products community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
