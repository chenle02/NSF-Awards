This grant is to purchase the equipment necessary to apply reflection high
energy electron diffraction to the study of epitaxial growth of phosphide-based
compound semiconductors. The instrument is a charge coupled detector-based
camera system which has the capability of high sensitivity and dynamic range,
high speed data transfer for real time measurements, multiple beam measurement
capacity, high angular resolution. The instrument is being used to study
dynamics of dislocations during epitaxial growth of compound semiconductors, the
growth of tilted superlattices, surface atomic structure, precision control of
stoichiometry, quantum wire devices, and quantum-effect transistors.
