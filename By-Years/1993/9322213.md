9322213 Yacov The work addresses the issue of managing the risk of extreme
events in engineered systems under climate change conditions. The research will
consist of three tasks of which the first will be to determine the potential
application of existing risk management methods to global climate change; the
second will be to establish the links among the statistics of extreme events,
the conditional risk function as a measure of extremes, and the generalized
concept of return period; and the third task will deal with the application of
the results from the first two tasks to the assessment and management of flood
risk under potential climate change including decision-making for the risk-based
design of engineered systems. The results from this work will be the improved
understanding of the potential impact of climate changes on engineering planning
and design for flood control. ***
