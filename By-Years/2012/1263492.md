Sediment deposited during hurricanes is a little-studied but potentially
important contributor to long-term coastal marsh aggradation. Studies of modern
hurricane storm surge deposits are needed to quantify the impact of hurricanes
on long-term marsh sedimentation rates, and to inform interpretations of
prehistoric hurricane deposits. This Rapid Response project will make use of
recent storm surge deposits associated with Hurricane Isaac, a Category 1 storm
that impacted the U.S. Gulf Coast in August 2012. Sampling transects will be
established at sites of storm surge sedimentation that vary in distance from the
hurricane landfall location. Excavation pits along transects will be
stratigraphically described and sampled to determine the magnitude,
distribution, and characteristics of the storm surge deposits. To place the
deposits in the context of long-term marsh sedimentation rates, underlying
sediments will be dated in increments using Cesium-137. Transects will be
revisited after a year to characterize the incorporation of the deposits into
the marsh. The project will build upon related NSF-funded studies recently
conducted by the principal investigator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this
research will aid interpretations of hurricane deposits in the sedimentary
record, which contribute significantly to assessments of hurricane recurrence
intervals, long-term trends in hurricane activity, and associated risk to
coastal inhabitants. The potential involvement of a graduate student will
include training in sampling and analysis, presentation and publication of
results, and incorporation of the research into a Master?s thesis.
