Combinatorial techniques developed primarily by Alistair Lachlan of Simon
Fraser University have proved to be effective in a number of classification
projects involving homogeneous structures. The investigator intends to develop
this set of techniques further in the search for new classes of structures which
cannot be analyzed in this fashion. He will follow up progress by Ehud
Hrushovski of M.I.T. by attempting to construct new strongly minimal sets with
an algebraic flavor or to prove that they do not exist. Two other problems in
model theoretic algebra are also on his agenda. Model theoretic algebra of this
sort is a mixture of mathematical logic and the study of classical algebraic
structures. It has a characteristic flavor of its own but can shed light on
difficuties which have arisen in traditional approaches to the classification
and analysis of such structures.
