The project is a study of concentration-dependent diffusion in supersaturated
solutions of non-electrolytes. Diffusion in supersaturated solutions,
particularly near critical points (e.g., consolute point) on the spinodal curve,
represents a relatively unexplored phenomena at the extreme of concentration and
non-ideality. Results from this project develop further understanding of the
mechanisms of diffusion, as well as help predict diffusion coefficients in the
supersaturated region where these transport coefficients rapidly decrease in
magnitude. Diffusion data in the supersaturated range are necessary for the
rational design of crystallization processes.
