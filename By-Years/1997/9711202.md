A central problem in understanding the brain concerns how knowledge is stored in
synaptic connections among neurons. In artificial neural networks this
phenomenon is modeled by connection weights, which determine how much of the
activation of one neuron is passed to another neuron. The goal of this project
is to understand how knowledge is stored in a set of connection weights, and to
use this understanding as the foundation for an epistemology that is directly
grounded in what we know of the brain. Our understanding of the brain and of the
neural networks that model it, including those used for artificial intelligence
purposes, will be limited until we understand how to correlate specific changes
in connection weights with specific changes in stored knowledge. For similar
reasons, psychological explanations of cognitive processes and the philosophic
theories of epistemology that build on them both rely fundamentally on
understanding what knowledge is stored, and under what conditions, within a
neural network.
