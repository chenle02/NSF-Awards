9305133 Andersen The aim of this research project is to further understand the
fundamental behavior of gravity retaining walls subject to earthquake loading;
in particular, the effect of coupled sliding and tilting on a gravity earth
retaining structure (current design practice neglects rotational motion and its
effect on earth forces); the effect of obstructed motion (that is, a retaining
wall coming in contact with a fixed object such as a bridge abutment and a
bridge deck); and the effect of repeated loading. The focus is on gravity
retaining walls, as these can provide the basis for understanding more complex
earth retaining systems. The specific objectives are to: 1. Complete the data
reduction and analysis of a prior centrifuge modeling study that focused on the
tilting behavior of gravity retaining walls; 2. Conduct a new study on gravity
retaining walls with dry sand backfill that is capable of coupled sliding and
tilting, obstructed motion, and repeated loading behavior. This involves
experiments on a scale-model retaining wall mounted on a geotechnical centrifuge
which is capable of simulating earthquake strong motions. These studies will be
used to assess the utility of currently proposed techniques for describing
coupled sliding and tilting, obstructed motion and repeated loading behavior of
earth retaining structures. ***
