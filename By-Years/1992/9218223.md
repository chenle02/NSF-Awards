Oregon State University in conjunction with a local small business will
undertake an ocean sciences instrumentation development project to develop an in
situ spectral fluorescence and absorption meter for use at sea. Specifications
call for it to quantitatively measure absorption and fluorescence at multiple
excitation and emission wavelengths throughout the ultraviolet and visible parts
of the spectrum. The instrument will address several research areas in
biological, chemical, and optical oceanography. It will facilitate measurements
of the concentration and nature of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the
composition of suspended matter in the water column, the rate of photosynthetic
processes, the degree of light absorption in the ultraviolet (and the related
problem of the potential effects of ozone depletion on biota), and the
contribution of spectral absorption and fluorescence on radiative transfer.
Spectral data improves upon non-spectral information by allowing accurate
representation of the relationship between the depth-dependent changes in the
spectral underwater light field with phytoplankton absorption and quantum yield
spectra. The instrument represents new capability to help address critical
questions in bio-optical oceanography and it represents an important step toward
remote detection of quantities previously measured only from discrete bottle
samples.
