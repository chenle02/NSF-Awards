9411982 Bourque This award is being made through the Small Grants for
Exploratory Research program to collect data on the January 17, 1994 Northridge,
California earthquake. Data will be collected on the reactions to the earthquake
of a sample of residents of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. creation of this
data set will allow for the comparison of community members' behavior in the
reactions to earthquakes across time within the Los Angeles area (1987 and
1994), across two of the most earthquake-prone urban areas of the United States
(Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area), and three earthquakes (Whittier
Narrows, Loma Prieta, and Northridge). The results of this analysis will
increase understanding of the societal response to earthquakes and provide a
basis for improving community preparedness. ***
