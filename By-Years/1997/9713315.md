The Unidata Program Center (UPC) at the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research enables academic institutions to acquire real-time atmospheric data and
employ sophisticated software to use them. UPC offers support services that
encompass training, troubleshooting, documentation, and metadata, as well as
workshops, electronic mailing lists, and Web pages that stimulate community-wide
dialogues. UPC continues to develop software for improved ease-of-use and
greater compatibility with more data access and advocating free and open data
exchange. Such compatibility entails, beyond adapting decoders and applications
to analyze and display the data, development of the Internet Data Distribution
system to incoporate new sources; to handle higher data rates; to adjust itself
automatically to variations in user demands; to adapt dynamically to Internet
performance variations; and to exploit networking advances, such as multicast
protocols.
