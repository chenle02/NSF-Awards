9523655 Cavanagh The emergence of new experimental and theoretical capabilities
are having a major impact on the ability to understand the mechanisms that
underlie the dynamics of chemical processes at surfaces and interfaces. Current
research is focused on extending this insight to the atomic level properties of
systems undergoing chemical change. The Gordon Research Conference entitled
Dynamics at Surfaces provides a unique opportunity for students to interact with
leaders in this active field and to delve into frontier questions of atomic
scale growth and energy transfer. The Dynamics at Surfaces conference will
provide a unique opportunity to bring together researchers with diverse
backgrounds and expertise in subspecialties that currently have common meeting
venue. The availability of one-on-one contact time is critical to foster the
development of rewarding interactions between researchers in areas of laser
spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, film growth, and other dynamical
aspects of surface reactions. %%% The Gordon Research Conference entitled
