The objective of this program is to develop a new generation of room-temperature
terahertz spectrometers with significant bandwidth increase compared to existing
technologies for advanced chemical sensing. For this purpose, a novel plasmonic
heterodyne spectrometer concept will be investigated which replaces the
terahertz local oscillator of traditional heterodyne receivers by a near
infrared local oscillator with a terahertz envelope. Unique capabilities of
plasmonic antennas are key in this innovation, which enable efficient coupling
of the near infrared local oscillator and terahertz signal into the
semiconductor nanostructures that are specifically designed to allow direct
mixing of the local oscillator and terahertz signal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the proposed work is an entirely new heterodyne terahertz
spectrometer architecture that uses a near infrared local oscillator instead of
the terahertz local oscillator employed in conventional heterodyne terahertz
spectrometers. Near infrared local oscillators offer orders of magnitude higher
power, wider frequency tunability, and narrower linewidth compared with
terahertz local oscillators, leading to a significant improvement in
spectrometer sensitivity, operation bandwidth and spectral resolution at room
temperature. The broader impacts of the proposed research are developing high
performance systems for biomedical sensing, pharmaceutical quality control, air
pollution control, and security screening, as well as developing an
education/outreach program for increasing the supply of terahertz engineers and
scientists through new graduate and undergraduate courses, K12 activities,
recruitment and retention of under-represented minorities.
