The facility for High Resolution Electron Microscopy continues its programs
which have two principle aspects: the development of new techniques, methods for
data analysis and instrumentation for advanced high resolution electron
microscopy on the one hand, and the provision of services, assistance and
education for the national electron microscopy community on the other hand.
Major recent developments include the installation, evaluation and initial
application of two new electron microscopes designed for observation of
specimens in ultrahigh vacuum or controlled environments, as part of a large
scale effort to integrate the techniques of surface study with those of high
resolution microscopy so that the field of surface science may be extended to
include studies with atomic resolution. Increasing contributions are being made
by facility users to the advancement of many areas of solid state science,
including studies of semiconductor defects and interfaces, supported metal and
oxide catalysts, chemical reactions in the solid state, the structures of
minerals, structures and defects of high temperature superconductors and several
aspects of disordered systems. Interactions of the facility with industrial
laboratories have been enhanced by the establishment of an Industrial Associates
Program. The future will see an expanding role for the high resolution electron
microscopy and associated techniques and for the facility in key areas of
condensed matter science and technical developments which will enhance the
effectiveness and productivity of the advanced instrumentation.
