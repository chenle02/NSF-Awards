A novel regenerating filtration system for Diesel engines will be investigated.
The system consists of a rotating fluidized bed reactor with a variable speed
that will collect soot during low power operations, and react the collected soot
with NOx at high power operations where the temperature is sufficiently high.
The particulate catalyst acts as filter medium for soot retention and promoter
of the NOx reduction. The operation of the catalyst is essential to the success
of the filtration system. Laboratory and pilot station experiments are planned.
A single catalyst granule model will be develop to be used as reference in
conducting and interpreting the experiments. A group of companies, including
petroleum refining companies (Exxon, Mobil Technology Co.), catalyst
manufacturers (Engelhard Co., Alcoa, Johnson Matthey) and Diesel engine
manufacturers (Cummins, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo) will collaborate to the
project by providing support to experiments and technical feedback, and
supplying partial funding. Industrial partners will provide in-kind
contributions, participate to research, and support with funds the university
research component, satisfying the requirements for a GOALI project. NJIT will
contribute 50% of the cost of equipment. The NJIT team has the co-P.I.s from
chemical engineering, chemistry, and mathematics. Four programs have co-reviewed
this proposal: Fluid, Particulate and Hydraulic Systems (FPHS), Chemical
Reaction Processes (CRP), Environmental Technologies (ET), and GOALI.
