This research project aims at applying the swarm intelligence framework to
design a new class of networking protocols for mobile wireless ad hoc networks,
facilitated attractive features such as scalability, autonomy, robustness, and
fault-tolerance for routing, topology control and energy conservation. The basic
idea is inspired by the collective activities of social insects, and utilizes
small packets equivalent to ants in the real world. These packets, traveling
like ants, deposit some information at nodes they visit similar to the way ants
lay pheromone trails. This information, in turn, affects the behavior of other
ant packets. With this form of indirect communication, the deployment of ant-
like packets resembles a distributed reinforcement learning system that evolves
itself to an optimal state, based on the current condition of the environment.
This project will characterize the behavior and study the performance of swarm
intelligence for ad hoc networking protocols based on probability, reinforcement
learning, and stochastic control theories, in addition to large-scale simulation
studies. To cope with network dynamics and mobility efficiently, the ad-hoc
networks based on swarm intelligence are expected to learn and inherently adapt
to changes in network states.&lt;br/&gt;
