The objectives of this research are to characterize the lignin-degrading enzymes
of streptomyces viridosporus T7A and streptomyces badius 252 which are involved
in the initial generation of the acid precipitable polymeric lignins (APPL)
intermediate. APPLs have the potential of being industrial chemical feedstocks
and specialty materials, e.g., as an antioxidant in foods. Objectives include:
determination of the cellular and/or extracellullar location of each enzymatic
component of the B-etherase complex, and continued examination of cultures for
new extracellular ligninases; characterization of the involvement of an
extracellular phenol oxidase, laccose, in initial oxidation of lignin; isolation
of each enzyme of the B-etherase complex and the characterization of its
mechanism of action using lignin substructure models as substrates; and
determination of the action of each enzyme and of entire B-etherase complex on
native polymeric lignin.
