The research in this project is on the theory and applications of multigrid
methods. One of the goals is to generalize the investigator's additive multigrid
theory, which can handle the convergence of V-cycle and F-cycle algorithms for
nonconforming methods, to more difficult problems such as anisotropic problems,
nonsymmetric problems and indefinite problems, and to new discretization
techniques such as mortar finite element methods and discontinuous Galerkin
methods. Another goal is to extend the PI's multigrid method for singular
solutions and stress intensity factors to more complicated problems and to three
dimensions. This new multigrid approach can recover the optimal convergence
rates of simple finite elements on simple grids, even in the presence of strong
singularities caused by nonsmooth geometries, abrupt changes in boundary
conditions, or jumps in the coefficients of partial differential equations. It
can also take full advantage of superconvergence phenomena, extrapolation
techniques, and parallel implementations.

Multigrid methods can produce fast solutions to large systems of equations. The
errors of multigrid solutions are comparable to the smallest possible errors and
at the same time the computational cost of multigrid methods is proportional to
the number of unknowns. Therefore multigrid methods have optimal complexity, and
they (either on their own or combined with other methods) are powerful engines
for large scale scientific computations. The results of this project can provide
answers to the important question of the reliability of multigrid methods and
provide guidelines for the development of new algorithms. They will also
generate useful computational tools for many challenging problems in material
science, fracture mechanics, fluid flow and electromagnetism.
