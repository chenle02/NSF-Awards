The proposed research will investigate architectural approaches to optimize
memory-hierarchy performance, focusing on the gap between the lowest level of
on-chip cache and the off-chip DRAM. Prior work has shown that the combination
of careful scheduling of prefetch requests on dedicated high-band width DRAM
channels and careful placement of prefetch data in the cache can make very
aggressive prefetching schemes practical. The proposed work builds on this
framework in three directions: integration of multiple prefetch-generation
sources, development of prefetching based on run-ahead threads, and integration
of prefetching and replacement such that predictions of future access patterns
can be applied in both domains. In each of the proposed areas, detailed designs
will be developed, tested, and iteratively refined via simulation. As solutions
in each area firm up, the results will be integrated into a unified model to
work out interactions among the mechanisms. The overall objective of the
research is to develop and analyze an integrated memory system that delivers
maximum efficiency across a range of DRAM-constrained system workloads. The
impact of these design techniques will be to increase the efficiency and
performance of the high-performance systems used as database, web, and technical
computing servers, increasing their responsiveness and capacity.
