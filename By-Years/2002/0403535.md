Proposal Title: GOALI: Development of Combinatorial Polymeric Substrates for
Efficient Screening of Protein Adsorption Proposal Number: CTS-0403535 Principal
Investigator: Jan Genzer Institution: North Carolina State University



The objective of this proposal is to develop a novel technology for
investigating protein adsorption on material surfaces. A combinatorial screening
methodology that improves upon existing analytical tools will enable faster,
more reliable, and more efficient evaluation of protein adsorption. This
approach will provide an effective analytical method and will facilitate
manufacturing of devices with controllably modified biointerfacial properties.
Novel polymeric surfaces based on the tailored deposition of macromolecules
grafted to flat silica substrates will be fabricated and characterized.
Conditions will be controlled to permit formation of continuous gradients in
polymer grafting densities, and graft-polymer chain length. Gradient structures,
on which the polymer grafting density and chain length of the grafted polymers
vary independently in orthogonal directions, will be prepared. In terms of the
broader impacts, educational efforts will focus on activities in an elementary
school in Mount Airy, NC aimed at attracting local K-12 teachers and students.
The gradient-based technology developed in this program will provide a powerful
methodology that should be superior to current techniques in that it enables
fast and simple screening of protein adsorption and complete and reliable
exploration of a broad parameter space. The structures developed in this program
will facilitate controlled adsorption of cells, a process that represents the
central focus of many pharmaceutical devices.
