This project will continue the operation of the Fabry.Perot interferometer that
was installed at South Pole Station in early 1989. The instrument measures the
temperature of the atmosphere and the winds in the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MALT) region of the upper atmosphere. The instrument will be
operated in conjunction with the University of Illinois sodium lidar that will
be installed in January of 1990. Together they will give a complete picture of
high altitude atmospheric dynamics at high latitude, and provide important
information for the verification and subsequent modification of the
thermospheric global circulation model that has been developed at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research. This project is an important component of the
Coupling, Energetic and Dynamics through Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) initiative.
