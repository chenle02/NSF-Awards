This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled NUE: Enhanced Undergraduate Nanotechnology Education with Haptic and
Visualization Tools, under the direction of Dr. Gary Bertoline, Purdue
University, aims at enhancing student knowledge, understanding, and attitudes
towards nanoscale science, engineering, and technology by developing course
modules that utilize haptic (force-feedback) and visualization tools developed
by an interdisciplinary group of researchers. A series of learning modules for a
sophomore Electrical and Computer Engineering course for undergraduate
engineering students will be developed that utilizes advanced visualization and
haptic technology to help students "see" and "grasp" phenonmena at the nanoscale
that are otherwise difficult to comprehend using the traiditional textbook
medium.
