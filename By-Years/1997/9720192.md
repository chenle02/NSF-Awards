This project will investigate scalable parallel algorithms for the solution of
light transport balance equations for environments composed of complex surface
geometry. Although Monte Carlo methods can solve such balance equations when the
input geometry is complex (e.g., 100 million surfaces), their convergence is
slow. To overcome this limitation, finite element algorithms will be used to
roughly characterize the light flow in the environment, and this large-scale
information will be used to guide the sampling strategies of the Monte Carlo
algorithms. Because designers of optical systems typically know where the large
energy flow occurs in their systems, a 3D computer graphics steering front-end
will be used to help guide both the subdivision in the finite element phase, and
the sampling strategies of the Monte Carlo phase. Although the research being
conducted attempts to improve solutions to the light transport problem, the
systematic combination of the strengths of deterministic, Monte Carlo, and
human-assisted methods could have applications in many high-dimensional problems
where Monte Carlo methods are typically used.
