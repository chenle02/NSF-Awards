Little knowledge exists about the role of antibiotics in fungal life cycles an
activities. One hypothesis is that antibiotics are important determinants of
competitive interactions among fungi; experimental evidence to support this
hypothesis, however is lacking. A freshwater fungal community on wood will be
used experimentally determine: (1) the degree to which competition occurs among
fungal species; (2) how the competitive ability of initial colonizers influences
the development of fungal communities over time; and (3) whether the ability of
fungi to produce antifungal antibiotics confers a competitive advantage.
Competition will be assessed by pre- colonizing wood in the laboratory with
pairs of species (antibiotic producers and non-producers) in various proportions
at different densities and then submerging the wood in a stream. Species
reproduction over time will be measured as an indicator of species success. %%%
Results should demonstrate the degree to which competition occurs, the role of
competition in organizing fungal communities, how well species interaction in
culture predict species interactions in the field, the relative importance of
antibiotic production in fungal species interactions, and the process and
pattern of fungal colonization of submerged wood. This knowledge will contribute
to understanding the role of competition, the evolutionary significance of
antibiotic production, and life strategies of saprophytic organisms.
