9732301&lt;br/&gt;Ghattas&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of scalable highly parallel
supercomputers has opened up new possibilities for modeling complex physical
systems in the engineering sciences. Significant strides have been made over the
past 20 years in the development, analysis, and implementation of parallel
numerical methods for solution of the partial differential equations (PDEs) that
govern the behavior of many of these complex physical systems. For many broad
classes of simulation problems in the engineering sciences, parallel algorithms
are sufficiently mature so that one may move beyond the simulation problem to
optimization of systems governed by PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to
the large body of work on parallel PDE solution, very little research has been
conducted on parallel algorithms for optimization of PDEs. However, given the
maturing state of parallel PDE solvers, time is ripe to mount a concerted effort
to develop, analyze, implement, apply, and study parallel numerical methods for
optimization of systems governed by PDEs or "simulation-based
optimization."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parallel algorithms for solving large-scale
optimization problems governed by complex PDE systems will be developed. Efforts
will focus on addressing two barriers that arise in very large scale
optimization problems: large numbers of constraints and large numbers of
decision variables. For the former, interior point methods will be developed and
to address complexity stemming from growth in decision variables; tailor
reduced- and full-space Newton-Krylov methods for the optimality system will be
developed, with several choices for preconditioners including those based on
infinite dimensional approximations of the reduced Hessian. The optimization
methods will be implemented on highly parallel supercomputers, and applied to
several challenging problems in engineering science, including inverse problems
in seismic wave propagation and optimal design/control of biomedical
devices.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
