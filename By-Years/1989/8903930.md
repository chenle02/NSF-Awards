This award allows a cultural anthropologist doing research on the elderly in
Philadelphia to spend time at the University of California at Irvine studying
"consensus theory" with the faculty there. This theory is a form of multivariate
analysis which allows one to specify the domain of shared knowledge that
characterizes a group and to pinpoint the degree of expertise this knowledge
held by each member. The award will help the anthropologist develop skills in
psychometric theory, Bayesian statistics, and statistical computing required for
application of consensus theory. The PI will then use this theory in a study of
the household production of care or impaired elderly living with adult children.
This activity is important because it will spread the expertise at a leading
research university to social scientists involved applied research.
