Simulating the dynamics of quantum systems is a major potential application of
quantum computers. Quantum simulation can be applied, for example, to model
chemical reactions and to predict the behavior of materials. It can also be used
as a tool to develop other quantum algorithms, and its study sheds light on the
power of quantum computers. This project focuses on two related aspects of
quantum simulation: developing improved quantum algorithms for basic simulation
problems and studying applications of quantum simulation to other computational
tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the state of the art in quantum simulation
algorithms is fairly advanced, the ultimate limits for this fundamental task
remain unclear. Operating within a broadly applicable framework of quantum
systems described by sparse matrices, the project aims to develop optimal
tradeoffs among all relevant simulation parameters. It also studies quantum
algorithms for simulating open quantum systems, leveraging algorithmic ideas
from the well-studied scenario of noiseless systems to give new algorithms for
the more realistic setting of noisy quantum systems that interact with their
environments. Furthermore, the project studies applications of quantum
simulation algorithms. Quantum simulation is the core component of a quantum
algorithm for extracting information about the solutions of large systems of
linear equations. The project applies recent improvements to quantum simulation
algorithms to give improved quantum algorithms for linear systems. It also
studies the computational power of particular types of linear systems, such as
those that arise in the computation of effective resistances in electrical
networks. Finally, the project investigates how algorithmic ideas from advanced
quantum simulation algorithms can be applied outside the context of simulation,
e.g., in computational number theory.
