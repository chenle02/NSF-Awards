The molecular structure of two new classes of tellurium-based optical glasses
will be investigated using Mossbauer spectrosopy, Raman spectroscopy, and
calorimetry. The alkaline and alkaline- earth tellurates will be alloyed with
germanium to modify the glass transition temperatures of these amorphous
materials. The fragility of corresponding glassy melts will be established by
viscosity-and enthalpy-activation energies and thermal expansion measurements.
The results will be correlated with aspects of glass molecular structure
deducted from spectroscopy. Of particular interest is the average coordination
around the probe ions (iodine and tellurium). On a basic level, the present
glasses provide convenient systems to explore further the recently suggested
correlation between rigidity percolation in glassy covalent networks and
fragility of corresponding melts. On an applied level, the present thrust
provides a basis to determine their viability for optical applications.
