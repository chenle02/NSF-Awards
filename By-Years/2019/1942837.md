This project sets a comprehensive research agenda focusing on the foundation of
the design and implementation of end-to-end quantum applications, as an effort
to bridge the gap between the theoretical foundation of quantum computing and
the limitation of realistic quantum machines. In particular, it aims to make
fundamental contributions to research in quantum algorithms, quantum machine
learning, and quantum software foundation. This project will help facilitate
end-to-end quantum applications in all related fields, such as physics,
chemistry, and material science, and hence contribute to the establishment of
major milestones of quantum computing. The results obtained will be disseminated
through a variety of venues, including conferences, new course materials,
expository writings, and high school open days aimed at exposing young computer
scientists to the frontiers of quantum information
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will integrate methods from the fields of
theoretical computer science, (theoretical) machine learning, formal methods and
programming languages to address the unique research challenges in achieving
end-to-end quantum applications. In particular, this project includes (1)
designing quantum algorithms for sub-modular optimization and log-concave
sampling, (2) developing new functionality for variational quantum methods (or
the so-called quantum neural networks) and their training methods, (3)
leveraging techniques from formal methods and programming languages to certify
the correctness of the implementation of quantum applications as well as to
obtain concrete (rather than asymptotic) resource/error analysis. This research
agenda will enable a more complete assessment of end-to-end quantum applications
and their near-term feasibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
