9451683 Devlin Computers and computerized data acquisition units will be used to
teach state-of-the-art techniques at each stage in the experimental process -
from initial observations and hypothesis formation, to data acquisition and
statistical analysis, to the production of the formal lab write-up and class
presentations. The biology curriculum of PSU is currently undergoing a major
restructuring, one that will result in the creation of new introductory level
and three 200-level biology courses. Laboratory instruction for these new
courses will focus primarily on the scientific method as a "way of learning." In
addition, the new 200-level courses have been designated as "writing across the
curriculum" courses, part of a university-wide requirement that each major area
of study incorporate writing skills into its curriculum. This "back to basics"
approach will: 1) emphasize scientific experiment procedures; 2) enhance
computer literacy; 3) introduce technical writing skills; 4) encourage an
exchange of scientific ideas. Our goal is to lay a solid foundation from which
the student will be able to ask more challenging questions later in their
research or professional careers.
