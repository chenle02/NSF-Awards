The overall objective of this project is to increase the capability of dextrous
robot hands to flexibly manipulate unknown objects in unstructured environments.
Tactile sensing will be used to determine global properties of an unknown object
using class models, rather than specific object models. Specific goals of the
project include: 1) extracting sufficient knowledge from local surface
information to grasp an manipulate unknown objects, and 2) determining as much
about the object as is possible from sparse sensory information, particularly
from only an initial grasp. Cylindrical tactile fingertips have already been
developed, and algorithms for extracting local contact properties have been
demonstrated, namely position, orientation, total force, and radii of curvature
for a convex second-order surface. Global properties including size, location,
and orientation will be determined from the local contact shape at multiple
simultaneous finger contacts. An object class of cones will be assumed, and
geometric constraints will be derived from the measurements. In experiments, an
unknown cone will be touched with 3 tactile sensors. Additional touch probes may
be required to find the cone's global properties.
