High latitudes are recognized as climatically sensitive and poorly understood
components of the Earth's climate system. The transport of heat and moisture in
the atmosphere constitutes the primary link between the Arctic and the global
circulation system, yet owing to the dearth of conventional data in the central
Arctic, little is known about the quantities, pathways, and interactions of
energy and moisture after they enter the region. New data sets offer an exciting
opportunity to observe the Arctic climate by providing measurements of
atmospheric and surface quantities at (100-km)2 spatial resolution for two
decades. This project will exploit observations from unique and recently
available satellite-derived products to evaluate a new method to compute
atmospheric heating caused by the convergence of horizontally transported
sensible heat and moisture. Preliminary calculations suggest that these
quantities have, indeed, changed significantly during the 20-year record of
observations, with varying magnitudes and signs in different regions of the
Arctic.
