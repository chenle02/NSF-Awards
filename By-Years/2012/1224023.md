This award will partially support a workshop to help organize paleoclimate
modelers and data generators for participation in the IPCC AR5 deliberations.
Specifically, the award will be used to support the travel costs for six early
career researchers and graduate students to participate in the workshop as well
as provide some support for meals during the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For
the first time, paleoclimate modeling/data research activities are being
incorporated into the Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)
activities. A major goal of the workshop is to ensure that the community of
paleoclimate researchers is aware of the best practices to be applied in these
modeling/data comparison activities. The outcome of the workshop should be
better approaches for using paleoclimate model/data activities to infer climate
sensitivities to external forcings and strategies to account for uncertainties
in both the model output and paleoclimate proxy reconstructions.
