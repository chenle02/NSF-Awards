The purpose of this planning grant is to conduct an assessment of
Dull&lt;br/&gt;Knife Memorial College's SMET curriculum and infrastructure in
order to&lt;br/&gt;develop an institutional SMET action plan that will be used
as the basis for a&lt;br/&gt;full TCUP grant to be submitted by May 2002. In
addition, the College will&lt;br/&gt;develop assessment instruments to determine
the effectiveness of its SMET&lt;br/&gt;instructional programs and to develop a
system to track SMET graduates&lt;br/&gt;that transfer to 4-year colleges and
universities.&lt;br/&gt;The planning period will be for 12 months and will
include three&lt;br/&gt;phases:&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1 (October 1, 2001 - December
15, 2001) assessment of SMET&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2
(January 1, 2002 - May 1, 2002) development of institutional&lt;br/&gt;plan and
full TCUP proposal.&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3 (August 15, 2002 - September 30, 2002)
development of&lt;br/&gt;assessment instruments.&lt;br/&gt;By the end of the
grant period Dull Knife will have developed an&lt;br/&gt;assessment of its SMET
programs, developed an institutional plan to&lt;br/&gt;enhance its SMET program,
submitted a full TCUP grant, developed&lt;br/&gt;instruments to evaluate its
SMET courses, and developed a student tracking&lt;br/&gt;system.
