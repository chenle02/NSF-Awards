A text and related lecture materials for a lower division course in Fourier
analysis for students in the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences
are being prepared and class tested at SIUC and a number of other colleges and
universities. This course has become feasible due to the recent development of
FOURIER, a software package that enables students to do calculations with a
stack of `functions' in much the same way that they would do calculations with a
stack of numbers on an RPN calculator. Students will use FOURIER to explore
classic and contemporary phenomena commonly analyzed with Fourier series,
Fourier transforms, or the discrete Fourier transform and thereby come to
appreciate the essential roles of mathematical analysis and computer simulation
in modern science and engineering.
