This project is an observational study of the formation, evolution, and
dissipation of mesoscale cyclones along the coastline of the antarctic
continent, specifically in conjunction with intense and persistent katabatic
winds. It has been known for some time that the higher southern hemisphere
latitudes are regions of decay for synoptic scale cyclones. It has however only
recently been found that smaller mesoscale cyclones can frequently occur over
the sea ice and the adjacent coastal areas of Antarctica, and significantly
affect the coastal climate This study will include both climatological and
dynamical aspects of mesoscale cyclones and will be based on observations by the
array of automatic weather stations in the Terra Nova Bay region, and the
digital satellite data recorded at McMurdo Station. Specific tasks to be
undertaken include the study of the dynamics relating to the genesis of
mesoscale cyclones, numerical modeling of these dynamics, and a comprehensive
satellite survey of mesoscale cyclogenesis over West Antarctica to define the
contribution of synoptic forcing. The project should improve our understanding
of antarctic climate dynamics, particularly the interactions between the
synoptic and the mesoscale, and should identify whether these cyclones in
conjunction with synoptic forcing contribute significantly to the West Antarctic
snowfall.
