This award is for support to continue research on the concentration of methane,
the isotopic composition and concentration of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and total
gas content of samples from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice
core. The methane concentration of air is a proxy for the extent of wetlands and
the warm, wet climates they signify. Methane is also a radiatively active gas
which affects climate. The isotopic composition of oxygen in air reflects
relative rates of primary production in the terrestrial and marine environments,
and humidity in productive continental areas. Methane and the isotopic
composition of oxygen are also constant (or nearly so) throughout the atmosphere
at any one time. They therefore serve as time stratigraphic markers for
correlating Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. Nitrogen and Argon isotopes
indicate the extent of gravitational fractionation during the trapping process
and allow for correction of the measured concentrations and isotopic
compositions of these gases. Total gas content reflects paleoelevation of ice
sheets among other poorly understood influences. This work will provide
information on climate and biogeochemistry during the last approximately 250,000
years of Earth history.
