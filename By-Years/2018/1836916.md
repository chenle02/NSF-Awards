Nontechnical Abstract: This project is aimed at 'braiding' of the half-flux
quantum vortices. 'Braiding' means moving these quantum vortices around each
other as a function of time, corresponding to quantum mechanical exchange. These
vortices are believed to have unusual quantum mechanical exchange properties,
and the ability to braid them is a necessary enabling step towards topological
quantum computation. Therefore, the successful braiding of such vortices would
be a major achievement in its own right but also a critical enabling milestone
along one of the main envisioned routes towards the development of a topological
quantum computer. The new ideas and technologies developed here will enable the
braiding of non-abelian anyons, a concept that has so far just lived in the
imagination of mathematicians and physicists. The project's broader impacts are
related to the major societal impacts to which quantum computation might bring,
for example, exponentially increased speeds for certain types of computations,
which could then enable many new types of scientific and technological
endeavors.

Technical Abstract: The goal of this project is to make progress towards
braiding half-flux quantum vortices in the p-wave spin-triplet superconductor
Sr2RuO4. Such half-flux vortices are believed to be non-abelian anyons whose
quantum exchange should be distinct from that of fermions and bosons. The
braiding of these anyons is considered to be a major enabling step along one of
the main envisioned routes towards the development of a topological quantum
computer. Efforts in this project include the synthesis of the Sr2RuO4
materials, the testing of the materials, the device fabrication using these
materials, as well as a theoretical program to address some of the issues that
might be encountered along the way. While this program is unusually challenging
and therefore of high risk, the potential rewards for its success are also very
high, as it might enable quantum computation protected from many aspects of
decoherence.
