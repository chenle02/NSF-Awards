The aim of the project is to introduce undergraduate students to the scientific
study of visual perception. Students enrolled in various psychology courses will
serve as experimenters, subjects, and data analysts as they empirically
investigate phenomena related to spatial, color, form, depth, and motion
perception. This project will affect a broad range of students as the new
laboratories are targeted at freshmen- level courses for non-majors up through
senior-level courses reserved for psychology majors. While earlier vision-
related coursework has relied on non-interactive, passive demonstrations of
visual phenomena, the requested equipment allows the implementation of a hands-
on, interactive student laboratory. A comprehensive, flexible computerized
system capable of handling many different visual perception experiments
represents the specialized equipment needed to carry out the planned
laboratories. The set-up centers around a high-speed computerized display system
that is capable of delivering well controlled, ultra-high resolution graphic
stimuli. Collectively, this system gives undergraduate students a chance to
experience the scientific procedures involved in studying the human visual
system.
