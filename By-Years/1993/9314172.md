The objective of the proposed research is the development of numerical computing
systems which operate with a small amount of electrical power. It concentrates
on arithmetic structures and algorithms and models power consumption by the
number of signal transitions. These low-power structures are essential for the
development of future computing systems. The proposed research will further the
understanding of the effect of number representation, algorithm, and
implementation on the power dissipation of numerical computation structures.
Moreover, methods and technique for the design of low-power structures will be
developed, as well as low-power designs for specific operations, such as adders,
comparators, multipliers, and dividers.
