0413823 Prudhomme This proposed research will provide a plan for how CLEANER
concepts, structures, strategies and networks can be applied, organized and
managed to study and control nitrogen pollution in North Carolina's Neuse River
Basin. The CLEANER approach is justified by the need to address and network
similar environmental issues of broad geographic scale and/or subject
commonality involving scientific and engineering complexity where current
fundamental knowledge and models are lacking and cyberinfrastructural
understandings and supports are not available.
