This research is to obtain an estimate of the Loma Prieta earthquake rupture
process first by analyzing the teleseismic records and then by simulating
strong-motion seismograms. Using records from the new NSF/IRIS PASSCAL seismic
instruments that were installed in the aftershock area, the research will
involve analysis of aftershock activity including determination of crustal
structure near the source region. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
