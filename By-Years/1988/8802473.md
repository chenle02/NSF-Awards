In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, Keyes will further develop
the theory of light scattering from liquids and investigate several other
aspects of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. These projects include
development of a kinetic theory of transport, studying growth models and
spinodal decomposition both analytically and on the computer, and studying light
scattering from disordered systems. In the theory of light scattering and in the
theory of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, the hardest problems, involving
high density, large disorder, large spatial fluctuations, etc., will be
attacked. The powerful method of real-space renormalization will be directly
applied to light scattering from disordered materials. The possibility that
light scattering from disordered systems need not probe averaged properties
only, but may in fact give entire probability distributions and new information
will be investigated. The theory of diffusion in liquids will be advanced via
application of methods developed under the previous grant. These include the
derivation of a kinetic equation which should describe liquids accurately, a
variational method which seems well suited to its solution, and development of a
new concept in the solution of kinetic equations, finding stochastic computer
simulations which solve the equation. An entirely new approach to transport
theory in supercooled liquids, based upon the utilization of quantities derived
from the force constant matrix, will be pursued. Several other projects in this
broad line of research also will be pursued.
