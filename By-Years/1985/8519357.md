This is a study of selective (partial) hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes.
This reaction is of great importance in many industrial applications (monomers,
drugs, alchols, surfactants, etc.) where control of the selectivity of the
reaction is crucial, but poorly understood. The work has good prospects for
direct influence on industrial technology.
