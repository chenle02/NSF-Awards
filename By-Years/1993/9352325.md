The objective of this project is to provide undergraduate civil and
environmental engineering majors laboratory experience analyzing organic and
inorganic pollutants in water utilizing modern chromatographic instrumentation.
The requested equipment, a capillary gas chromatograph and an ion chromatograph,
will give engineering students the opportunity to become familiar with these
important instrumental techniques, which they are likely to use in their
professional careers. The equipment will play a key role in redesigning a
required senior level laboratory survey course. The redesigned course will give
students hands on experience in analysis in addition to in-plant experience in a
drinking water treatment plant.
