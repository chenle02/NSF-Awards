This project supports activities of the U.S. National Committee for the
International Union of Psychological Science (USNC/IUPsyS). The USNC exists to
represent the United States in the scientific union, which is a member of the
International Council for Science (ICSU). The objective of this program is to
support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the international
union in response to expanding needs in international science and technology. It
will accomplish this by taking advantage of the volunteer tradition of the
National Research Council (NRC) -- a tradition that attracts top-level
scientists and researchers to serve on USNCs. International Unions affiliated
with ICSU facilitate the exchange of scientific information, forge international
agreements on standards and measurements, act as scientific advisers to
intergovernmental agencies, and promote the right of all scientists to
participate in their activities without political or any other form of
discrimination. This project engages the U.S. research community in
international activities by providing opportunities for colleagues from around
the world to meet on common ground, builds partnerships, and discusses
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
