9400672 Hosmane Southern Methodist Univ. Dr. Narayan Hosmane, Chemistry
Department, Southern Methodist University, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for an investigation into the
preparation and chemistry of complexes of small carborane ligands. Coordinately
unsaturated lanthanacarboranes will be prepared and utilized as precursors to
14-electron metal alkyl derivatives. The reactivity patterns of "carbon
separated" six-atom carboranes will be established with main group, early
transition, and lanthanide metals and comparisons will be drawn with related
"carbon apart" derivatives. Neutral, zwitterionic, and/or ionic, 14-electron
carborane and mixed ligand complexes will be prepared and evaluated as Ziegler-
Natta olefin polymerization catalysts. In order to utilize metal ions in many
important applications, it is often necessary to contain them in molecular
assemblages which permit them to interact with other species in a controlled
fashion. A common way of achieving this goal is to utilize groups (ligands)
which may be attached to a metal in order to create a specific desired
environment about the metal. In this project compounds a relatively unstudied
class of "ligands", the six atom carboranes, will be studied to learn their
ability to stabilize electron poor metals so that they may form valuable
catalysts.
