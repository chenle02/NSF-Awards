This workshop seeks to develop a vision of next-generation wireless broadband,
specifically looking at the research topics that need to be addressed to get
wireless functionality in the range of one gigabit per second by the end of this
decade. The workshop will also explore how federal, state, and local policies
impact or encourage that development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
advance knowledge and understanding of the challenges in using wireless for one
gigabit per second networking infrastructure. Wireless will need to play a
pivotal role as part of a next-generation broadband strategy, and hence the
capabilities and limits of high-speed wireless networking technology and
relationships to policy need to be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will provide a strategic overarching vision, a roadmap for wireless technology
development, and a focused target to stimulate wireless networking
research.&lt;br/&gt;
