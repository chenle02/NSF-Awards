9521098 Archer This project will generate global maps of deep-sea calcite burial
over the last 30,000 years, using fluxes of calcite calculated from 230-Th
accumulation. The results combined with models of alkalinity will be used to
evaluate the role of deepsea burial of calcite in the global carbon cycle. ***
