This RAPID project will produce, pilot and evaluate a prototype exemplar, an
innovative web-based platform designed to help teachers better understand the
incorporation of practices into the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).
The NRC produced a framework for the NGSS and the first draft of the NGSS has
been released for public comment. The project is an appropriate RAPID as twenty-
six states have now signed on as lead states to implement these standards when
the final version is released in January 2013. States, districts and schools are
anxious for materials that help them think about implementing these new
standards. The standards represent a significant departure from current practice
in K-12 science education. The rapid prototyping exemplar proposed here will
help school leaders and teachers better understand what alignment with these
standards looks like through the repurposing of existing classroom videos that
incorporate the use of modeling practices and effective argumentation into K-12
science content.
