Gap junctions are comprised of membrane channels that allow the diffusion of
small molecules between cells. Studies of gap junctional communication in the
early mouse embryo have shown that cells in the embryo exhibit preferred
pathways of exchange that effectively subdivides the embryo into discrete
domains or communication compartments. The spatial organization of these
compartments correlate with ongoing differentiation and cell lineage segregation
events. These observations together with the finding that the inhibition of gap
junctional communication can lead to developmental perturbations suggest that
gap junctions may play an important role in mouse embryogenesis. To evaluate
this possibility, in this study the embryonic stem cell approach will be used to
target the disruption of the endogenous gap junction gene encoding Cx43, as Cx
43 transcripts are observed to be differentially expressed within the context of
these communication compartment domains. Once such targeted ES cells are
obtained, they will be used to generate chimeras, from which embryos and mice
that are heterozygous and homozygous for the Cx43 null allele will be obtained
and analyzed. A detailed histological analysis will be carried out to examine if
development is perturbed. The gap junctional communication properties of these
embryos will be monitored by ionic and dye coupling studies. Of particular
interest would be the finding of perturbations in heart development, and the
development of the central nervous system, the segmented vertebral column, limb
morphogenesis, etc., as in situ hybridization studies have shown that Cx43 is
expressed in a striking spatially restricted pattern in conjunction with
development in these regions of the embryo. The results of these studies should
provide valuable insights into the possible role of Cx43 in mouse development.
