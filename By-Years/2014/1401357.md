NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden
participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering. The
fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the
future. This fellowship to Maria Vasquez supports a research and training plan
at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the laboratory of Lars Tomanek and includes a
plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The
research examines how heat and hyposalinity stresses affect both native and
invasive species of mussels in field and laboratory experiments. The research
introduces the Fellow to molecular genetic and proteomics techniques and
provides research mentoring to undergraduate students, including those from
groups under-represented in STEM fields.

Intertidal marine organisms inhabit a stressful environment with multiple
environmental stressors that can perturb physiological tolerances thereby
shifting species ranges of both native an invasive species. This research
utilizes proteomics, a method to observe global protein abundance, to understand
tolerance limits and potential environmenatl impacts on two intertidal mussel
species by testing responses to multiple environmental stressors. In addition,
the potential role of sirtuins (involved in post-translational modifications) as
a mechanism in the stress response of marine intertidal invertebrates is being
investigated. The research integrates both complex methodologies and
experimental designs to better simulate the multiple stressor environment
inhabited by marine intertidal species.
