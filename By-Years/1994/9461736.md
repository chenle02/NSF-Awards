Software tools for efficient programming and scientific computing are two
technologies labeled as `critical` to this nation's security and industrial
growth. Object-oriented programming (OOP) offers a partial solution to
increasing productivity during software development. OOP emphasizes modular and
incremental development of applications. OOP enhances maintainability and
reliability because changes that are needed in an implementation can be
localized to a specific component. Object-oriented development also fosters
reuse of software assets. Reuse leads to increased reliability, decreased
development costs, and increased productivity. The cost of adopting an object-
oriented, framework- centered approach is the run-time overhead imposed by
object-oriented languages. Languages such as C++ provide a wide-spectrum of
support to a programmer, but little assistance to compilers that must generate
fast and efficient code. This research approaches the specification and
implementation of class-specific program optimizations- optimizations defined by
the user of an object-oriented programming system and attached to object types.
By associating optimizations with classes, one preserves the class-oriented
style of object-oriented programming while providing optimization information at
a level of specification convenient to the developer. To implement the class-
specific optimizations, Object Science Corporation proposes to draw on
techniques for tree-rewriting systems. The work will be validated by inserting
the optimizer into an existing C++ compiler.
