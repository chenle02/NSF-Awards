This research focuses on the maturational sequence of the B lymphocytes which
express lambda light chain proteins, and the mechanism by which the expression
of lambda light chain genes is controlled. Immunoglobulins secreted from plasma
cells contain either kappa or lambda light chains, but not both. That is, in
these cells productive kappa and lambda genes are mutually exclusive. This
phenomenon has been termed kappa/lambda isotypic exclusion. At the level of the
genes, kappa-producing cells have rearranged kappa genes, but the lambda genes
are in germline configuration. In most lambda-producing cells, however, the
kappa genes are either nonproductively rearranged or deleted. These observations
have led to a "sequential" model which postulates that kappa genes rearrange
first and, only if both kappa alleles are aberrantly rearranged or deleted,
lambda genes become accessible for rearrangement. The studies proposed here are
designed to test an alternative hypothesis, that cells which express lambda
light chains constitute a unique developmental lineage of B lymphocytes. This
lineage is characterized by an intermediate cell type that coproduces kappa and
lambda light chains and fails to turn off immunoglobulin gene rearrangement.
First, fluorescent-labelled antibodies and a fluorescence activated cell sorter
will be used to determine whether B cells which coexpress kappa and lambda are
present in normal mice and to determine whether the expression of lambda
positive cells is restricted to any previously defined B lymphocyte population.
Second, a rearrangement-dependent drug resistance gene, pHRD, will be tested in
lambda and kappa hybridomas to determine whether the B cells that express lambda
have an increased ability to rearrange immunoglobulin genes compared to B cells
that express the kappa light chain. The results of this research should provide
significant new information on the mechanisms which control immunoglobulin light
chain gene expression and, more generally, on the mechanism of regulation of
gene expression.
