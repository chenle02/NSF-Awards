9509060 Ramanujan In this SBIR Phase II project, Architecture Technology Corp.,
under the direction of the PI will develop a Distributed Shared Memory multi-
computer system using a network of workstations. During Phase I, analytical
models were developed to establish the potential of Network Shared Memory (NSM)
clusters for achieving significant cost/performance advantages over other
approaches. In Phase II, the analytical results will be validated by
implementing an actual NSM and measuring performance for various parallel
applications. The prototype NSM will be based on commodity components. ***
