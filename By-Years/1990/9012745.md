The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei in the brain with major responsibility
for causing movement of body parts. To date, neuroscientists have been able to
collect anecdotal data from these motor nuclei by recording either electrical or
chemical events from single cells within the basal ganglia. However, this
approach does not tell us what ensembles of cells within the nuclei are doing at
one instance to effect a movement. Thus, it is necessary to create and develop
recording devices which will allow scientists to measure electrical and chemical
events from multiple sites within a nucleus of cells if we are to fully
understand how neural circuits operate to cause an arm to move for example. Dr.
Greg Gerhardt is taking the initial steps in the development of solid-state
microsensors that can be used to monitor the neurochemical substratum of motor
regulation. He plans to develop and test biosensors to monitor chemical and
electrical events in "real time" in the extracellular environment of striatal
neurons. He proposes to develop multichannel silicon-based biosensors for the
rapid determination of dopamine, glutamate, and acetylcholine activity in the
basal ganglia of laboratory animals. This work is extremely important, being at
the cutting edge of research which will allow us to understand the neurochemical
mechanisms that underlie execution and control of brain motor circuits.
