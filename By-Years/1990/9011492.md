While considerable research has been done on the politics, economics, and
cultural implications of technological change, most such work does not integrate
either the various facets of technological change or the technological artifact
with its dialectically-linked social meaning. In this study of technology,
productivism, and consumerism in interwar France, Dr. Frost is utilizing an
integrated theory and methodology to explain the emergence of a set of
technologically linked cultural images and the social impact of technological
discourse within French society at a time when the breadth of technological
change was slight. This research focuses particularly upon the contradiction
between an emerging modernist view of "progress" and a genuine lack of concrete
technological change. An integrated approach like the one that Dr. Frost is
using offers an opportunity to observe and define the mutual prestructuring of
technological text and social context. Techniques for this study therefore
stretch from technical design analysis, through micro- and macroeconomic
calculation, to the analysis and interpretation of technological discourse--from
economics to semiotics--using a range of sources from demographic and economic
statistics to trade fairs and advertising brochures. this study is developing
conclusions about the processes of innovation and diffusion, the invention of
new social roles concurrent with the invention f artifacts, the economics and
finances of innovation, and the fracture between technological images and
artifacts in interwar (1919-1930) France. The results should prove
extraordinarily helpful in pointing the way toward a comprehensive approach to
the study of the processes of technological innovation.
