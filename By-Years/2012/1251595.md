PROJECT SUMMARY Science in Action: Understanding and Sustaining Student
Engagement in Environmental Science in Urban, Poverty-Impacted Schools is a
proposal to the Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering
(REESE) program to study how domain knowledge, literacy, and the social context
of classrooms and schools afford and constrain student engagement and learning
in a project-based environmental science course in urban, poverty-impacted high
schools. The course concerned, Project-Based Learning Advanced Placement
Environmental Science (PBL-APES), was co-designed with a suburban school
district. The investigators propose in this (2.5 year, medium empirical) project
to study the migration of PBL-APES to two diverse, poverty-impacted urban
districts. A design-based implementation research approach will be employed to
develop and test specific supports for productive disciplinary engagement that
address the wide range of student literacy and domain knowledge that the
investigators and others have observed in urban settings.
