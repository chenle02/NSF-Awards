OIA-0116554 PI: Chen Abstract

Funding is requested for the development of a non-contacting ignition system for
polymer combustion studies. The system will consist of a high-power lamp and
associated optics, a pyrometry system for measuring surface temperature, and a
heat flux sensor to monitor the uniformity of the heating system. A supporting
numerical model will also be developed to validate the system. The ignitability
of plastics as determined by this system should be extendable to other geometry,
energy input and oxygen level through a suitable analysis.
