The ribosome is a ribonucleoprotein assembly made up of two structurally and
functionally distinct subunits. In Escherichia coli it includes three RNA
molecules and over fifty different proteins. This project involves determination
of how the RNA molecules are folded within each subunit and the placement of
specific proteins on the subunit surface. Each question will be studied by
electron microscopy of specific antibody-subunit complexes.
Oligodeoxynucleotides that complement specific sequences of ribosomal RNA will
be chemically synthesized and modified at one or both ends to incorporate
antibody-recognizable non-complementary markers: dinitrophenol at the 5'-end,
and isopentenyladenosine at the 3'-terminus. m Conditions for optimal binding
will be determined, and target site specificity will be verified. Marker-
specific antibodies will be allowed to interact with oligonucleotide-subunit
complexes and freed of non-specific IgG by HPLC. Electron microscopy of
antibody-oligonucleotide- subunit complexes will permit visualization of the
site of oligonucleotide binding and hence the localization (and perhaps
orientation) of the complementary RNA segment within the subunit. Ribosomal
proteins will be localized in a collaboration involving Dr. R. R. Traut.
Monoclonal antibodies directed against defined epitopes of ribosomal proteins
will be used to localize the protein epitopes on the subunit surface.
Interference caused by oligonucleotide or antibodies in protein synthesis assays
will used to relate structural studies to ribosome function.
