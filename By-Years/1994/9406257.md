9406257 Constable The PIs will visit Sao Miguel in the Azores to collect samples
for paleomagnetic study from the dated lava beds. These measurements will be
used to investigate the local behavior of the geomagnetic field over the last 4
million years. The data will also be used to improve the spatial and temporal
resolution of existing global field models. ****
