This project continues mathematical research focusing on complex analytic
methods applied to the analysis of convolution equations, integral geometry and
systems of algebraic equations. Earlier work on interpolation problems in spaces
of entire functions has led naturally to questions concerning multidimensional
convolutions equations. One is actually interested in the question of
deconvolution. Many physical realizable systems such as transducers and sensors
can be modeled as convolution with distributions. This gives rise to a scheme to
estimate signals such as images, radiation, acoustics, etc. The data are given
as a convolution plus noise and the reconstruction process in this project
consists of finding systematic ways of constructing deconvolvers. In pursuing
this work, several mathematical problems arise which are treated as distinct
objectives. They include finding the degrees and height in the algebraic Bezout
equation, obtaining new properties and representations of residue currents
(multidimensional residues) and questions in integral geometry related to the
Pompieu problem. The Pompieu problem actually covers a vast array of questions
concerning integrals of a fixed function over various congruent configurations.
If the integtrals equal zero on a class of congruent sets, one is interested in
knowing whether or not the function must be zero. Most of this work is set
within the framework of several complex variables. Techniques of analytic
function theory and harmonic analysis are predominant. Diverse applications to
systems theory and engineering are expected.
