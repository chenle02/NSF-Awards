This award is being used to conduct a review of the GLOBE program data
collection protocols, instrumentation specifications, and associated Teachers
Guide, which was last re-written in 2003. This effort builds on a panel convened
in January 10-11, 2011, which reported that the science content of the GLOBE
protocols is overall still quite relevant, but in need of minor updating (as
opposed to a complete overhaul). The Teachers Guide is being reviewed on an
investigation area by investigation area basis, in order to better identify
specific areas that need addressing. Five sub-groups addressing major sections
of the Teachers Guide related to Atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;Hydrology, Soil, Land
Cover, and, Earth as a System/Phenology are meeting meeting virtually through
web conferencing tools. These sub-groups consiste of discipline and program
experts with considerable expertise and insight into the working and
implementation of these protocols. Each sub-group is reviewing the state of the
science protocols within that topic area and identifying those that need
updating or long-term augmentation; prioritizing the proposed modifications; and
assessing the suitability of protocols for on-line as opposed to hands-on
training, as well as the need for more customized training requirements. A panel
report addressing these topics will be issued by July 6, 2012. A revised GLOBE
Teachers Guide will complement and better integrate with the revised GLOBE web
site and database as well as prepare the program for new mobile technologies and
the 2013 renewal of the GLOBE management contract.
