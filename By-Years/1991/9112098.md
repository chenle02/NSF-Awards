An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) surface analysis system will be
purchased and constructed to support a number of studies of diamond film growth.
The equipment will permit in situ studies of the nature of the chemical bonds
which form during film growth for diamond films grown by hot filament and DC
plasma co-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The results will be used to
determine the growth mechanisms and details of the surface properties.
