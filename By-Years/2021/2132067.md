The Symposium on the Strategy for Resilient Manufacturing Ecosystems through AI
is a series of three workshops that convenes the advanced manufacturing research
and practitioner communities, relevant companies, federal agencies and national
laboratories and the Manufacturing USA Institutes and experts in artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, information
technology, and computer science to comprehensively assess the role of AI in
manufacturing competitiveness. The workshop series, held under the auspices of
the Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing and the Subcommittee on Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence of the National Science and Technology
Council, seizes on an accelerating convergence of the digital transformation of
the manufacturing industry and the increasing power of artificial intelligence
and machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two researched workshops build on
a successfully completed first Workshop on Aligning AI and U.S. Advanced
Manufacturing Competitiveness and build on the report of that workshop. They
will be conducted using a professionally-managed, virtual teleconference that
will emphasize the four strategic priorities identified in the first workshop:
AI for the Factory Floor, AI for Industry-Wide Data Sharing, AI for Discovery of
Capabilities and Solutions, and AI for Building Resilient Supply Chains. The
second workshop will identify R&amp;D recommendations for AI solutions in each
strategic area and determine how they integrate into an adoption cycle and the
third workshop will organize R&amp;D and implementation priorities into a
national strategy in the form of primary workstreams and critical elements for
advancing the adoption of AI in Advanced Manufacturing and maximizing its value
for U.S. industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
