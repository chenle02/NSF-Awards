This research deals with improving the computational efficiency of existing
power control algorithms for wireless systems, as well as developing new
computationally efficient algorithms. Power control helps minimize transmitted
power, and is important as it enhances battery life for mobile terminals and
extends the life of the wireless network. In a multiuser environment power
control contributes also to minimizing interference and increasing system
capacity.

The investigators study the use of iterative methods for improving the
computational efficiency of existing power control algorithms, with emphasis on
game theoretic approaches. At the physical layer power control is combined with
codeword adaptation and new algorithms for joint codeword optimization and power
control are developed in which target signal-to-interference ratios (SIRs) are
achieved with minimum transmitted power by decreasing effective interference
through codeword adaptation. Codeword adaptation is based on greedy interference
avoidance methods which are also investigated from a game theoretic perspective.
