9623299 Warren Impurity-species nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will be used to
investigate the local atomic and electronic structure of impurities in
crystalline semiconductors. Our previous variable-temperature studies of the
donor and acceptor bands in Si(P) and Si(B) in the range 100 - 500 K will be
extended to liquid helium temperatures. The group III impurities Ga and In in
II-VI materials will be studied by conventional impurity-nucleus NMR in the
presence of persistent photoconductivity at low temperatures. An attempt will be
made to observe optical nuclear polarization in ZnO and related II-VI materials.
The effect of optical excitation on the local atomic structure of impurities
such as Ga in CdTe will be examined as a test of the "DX model" of these
materials. %%% Impurity atoms play a critical role in technologically important
semiconducting crystals since they introduce the charged carriers necessary for
the materials to conduct electricity. Despite their importance, the atomic-scale
environments of many important impurities are still poorly understood. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) provides a highly local, chemically-specific probe
which will be used in this research to investigate the structural and electronic
environments of selected impurities in materials such as CdTe and Si. The state
of atoms such as Ga and In in CdTe and related materials will receive particular
attention in an attempt to understand why these impurities, contrary to
conventional behavior, do not introduce carriers. In Si, NMR will be used to
clarify the way in which interactions between P or B impurities influence the
carrier mobility and hence, the performance of silicon-based devices. ***
