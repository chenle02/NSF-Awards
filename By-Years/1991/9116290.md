The proposed three year investigation is a request for a continuation of an
international exchange research program between the University of Hawaii and the
University of Lecca, Italy examining the comparative physiology of intestinal
nutrient transport in fish of economic importance in both countries. Hawaii and
Italy both have extensive fish aquacultural activities currently underway to
help meet the burgeoning human need for protein. A serious problem to fish
economic development is the production of an artificial diet that is nutritious
and inexpensive. The requested extension of this previously highly successful
research effort will use several in vitro laboratory methods to elucidate the
mechanisms of sugar, amino acid, peptide, and short chain fatty acid transport
in the intestines and associated diverticula from herbivorous and carnivorous
fishes at the two laboratories. The novel information resulting from these
physiological studies may be important in the future development of artificial
diets for these respective fishes and may reduce the time necessary for each
species to reach their full aquaculture potential.
