9624151 Matthew This career development plan contains both research and
education activities. The objective of the research is the development of cell-
seeded tubular prostheses that will allow for the proliferation of smooth muscle
in its matrix and endothelial cells on its luminal surface. The primary chemical
constituent of the matrix will be glycosamioglycans, a biologically active
polysaccharide from connective tissues. The research will focus on
characterizing the physicochemical properties of the prostheses, evaluation of
the growth of vascular cells on these materials, and the development of a
simulated in vitro system for overall evaluation. The goal of the education plan
is to engage in curriculum development with an emphasis on Problem-Based
Learning and Group Learning, and to foster minority student recruitment,
retention and mentoring activities. ***
