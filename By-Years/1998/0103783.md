&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is a comprehensive inventory of
the approximately 6,000 vascular plant species of Pakistan. This will be
accomplished primarily by completion of the remaining family-level treatments of
the published Flora of Pakistan, and all funds granted for this project are
directed toward preparation of those treatments by Pakistani botanists and their
international collaborators, including Pakistan's senior botanist, Dr. Syed Ali,
who is co-principal investigator. Treatments of 203 families are already in
print, leaving only 10 to be published. However, these include large families
for the region such as Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, and Scrophulariaceae, and include
an estimated 25% of all the species. Work supported with other funding will
assemble the published information in a web-accessible relational database of
all plant species in Pakistan. The ultimate goal of the project is a complete
modern flora of a large but relatively poorly studied region of South Asia, and
the first complete floristic database for the region.&lt;br/&gt;Completion of
the Flora of Pakistan is an essential first step to understanding, managing, and
preserving the biodiversity of Pakistan. Information from the project will
provide scientists and government officials with critical data for resource
management, including selection of areas for conservation priority and of plants
for use in restorations for erosion control and reforestation. &lt;br/&gt;
