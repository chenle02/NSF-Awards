This research project studies spacetime singularities in the solutions to the
Einstein vacuum equations, a system of nonlinear partial differential equations
that describes gravity in locations devoid of matter. Solutions to this system
of equations can develop singularities from regular initial data; some such
singularities are inside a black hole event horizon. A fundamental mathematical
question concerns understanding how such singularities arise from generic
initial data. In particular, this project explores questions that include: What
does the boundary of the interior of black holes look like? Are they always
singular? Are there singularities that are not in the black hole regions? These
are questions that the strong and weak cosmic censorship conjectures in general
relativity seek to address -- study of those conjectures is the central
motivation for this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A particular focus of the
project is to understand the singular boundary of the interior of black holes
and also to understand sharp criteria under which trapped surfaces (structures
closely related to black holes) may form. Recent work of the investigator and
collaborators provides a resolution of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture
for the Einstein-Maxwell (real) scalar field in spherical symmetry, showing that
solutions arising from generic data have singular black hole interiors, in the
sense that the spacetime metric cannot be extended in a suitably regular manner.
This project aims to extend these results to settings without symmetry
assumptions, in particular to give a complete description of the boundary of
black holes that arise from perturbations of the explicit Kerr solutions. In a
different direction, this project also aims to establish criteria that guarantee
that trapped surfaces form, as a step towards understanding the weak cosmic
censorship conjecture in general relativity.
