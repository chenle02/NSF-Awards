This project will stimulate a new international research initiative between
Howard University, the Los Angeles Counnty Museum of Natural History, and the
Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (CAS), Beijing. It
leverages expertise and specialized skills, facilities, and/or other resources
of the foreign collaborator(s) and access to the collections at the Natural
History Museum of Ethiopia. Chinese colleagues are seeking funding from the
Chinese Natural National Science Foundation to facilitate their research on this
project and for the training of a Chinese national student at Howard University.
PIs will develop web content and e-exhibits on hipparion evolution, biogeography
and paleodiet for all involved institutions at Howard University. The innovative
high risk-high return nature of this proposal makes it a suitable fit for an
EAGER. Letters of collaboration and permission for access to relevant Ethiopian
museum collections are provided.
