9351895 Engstrom A chemical microscopy facility for undergraduate laboratory
instruction is being developed. Polarized light microscopes are being used in
the early part of the undergraduate curriculum, while existing departmental
equipment is being used in upper division work. The entire curriculum consists
of several experiments with optical chemical microscopy, followed by infrared
microspectro-scopy, fluorescence microscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy.
The experiments are carried out in general chemistry (both "majors" and "non-
majors"), organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and instrumental analysis.
Additional use of the polarized light microscopes is being made in student
research, by geology students, and in a chemistry high school outreach program.
The program in chemical microscopy is providing students with the opportunity to
visualize matter and reactions in unique ways, while exposing them to a wide
variety of problems and materials relevant to the marketplace. ***
