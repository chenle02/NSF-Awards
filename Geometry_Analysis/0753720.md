Abstract

Award: DMS-0753720 Principal Investigator: Shrawan Kumar, David A. Vogan, Nolan
R. Wallach

This award provides partial support for US-based students and junior researchers
attending a conference in May 2008 at the Pacific Institute of Mathematics
(PIMS) in Vancouver, B.C. The meeting is devoted to Lie theory and related
subjects, including invariant theory, representation theory in several aspects,
symplectic geometry, Kac-Moody Lie algebras and structures associated to them
such as groups and flag varieties, quantum cohomology of homogeneous spaces, and
Dirac cohomology.

This international conference is devoted to topics of current interest that owe
much to the work of Bertram Kostant, who is to be honored at the meeting. Many
of the conference presentations and much of Kostant's long research career have
been devoted to exploring and exploiting symmetries of geometric objects. The
Lie groups cited above, named for 19th-century mathematician Sophus Lie, are
continuous collections of symmetries, exemplified by the full group of rigid
motions of the Euclidean plane, or by the group of all rotations of a three-
dimensional sphere. The web site of the conference host, the Pacific Institute
