This project consists of a series of workshops to be hosted jointly by the
University of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis during the
summers of 2003, 2004 and 2005. Each workshop is one week long, concentrating on
theoretical issues in macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling. These
workshops continue the series sponsored by the NSF at the University of
Minnesota during 2000-02 and at Northwestern University during 1990-99. Specific
topics for the three years will vary, depending on research interests of the
participants. Topics in recent years have included: monetary theory, searching
and matching models of labor market dynamics, technical change and technology
adoption, asset pricing, macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions and
financial market incompleteness, fiscal policy, business cycles, government
policy in the absence of commitment, methods for analyzing models with
heterogeneous agents, and political economy issues in the choice of aggregate
policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This series has provided a
valuable forum for researchers working on substantive and methodological issues
in theoretical macroeconomics, broadly defined. It has provided both an outlet
for the formal presentation and intensive discussion of recent papers and an
opportunity for informal discussions outside the seminar room among researchers
working in related areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The organizers
have made a concerted effort to choose program committees each year that will
reach a broad spectrum of theoretical macroeconomists, and the program
committees have made a strong effort to identify and include young researchers.
This workshop series is one of the few with an emphasis on the theoretical side
of macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling, and provides a useful
opportunity for discussions among researchers representing somewhat distinct
intellectual traditions. &lt;br/&gt;
