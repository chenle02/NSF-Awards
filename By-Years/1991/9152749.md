The Department of Geography is purchasing an X-ray sysyem and seismograph for
use in a series of physical geography courses which emphasize the collection and
analysis of data in both the field and laboratory. Activities include: mapping
of bedrock river channel and an associated set of river terraces; mapping a
delta island and collection of subsurface samples for soil and sediment
stratigraphic analysis in the field; laboratory analysis of sediment, soil and
microfaunal characteristics of a core sample from local wetlands. The students
are gaining an appreciation for the rigors of field work and the importance of
accurate laboratory analysis while also developing confidence in their ability
to pose and answer pertinent problems.
