The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is
the development of computationally efficient simulation-based optimization
techniques for three types of urban transportation problems: (i) dynamic, (ii)
large-scale, and (iii) reliable. The techniques enable state-of-the-art urban
traffic simulators to address a variety of continuous, nonlinear, constrained
and high-dimensional optimization problems. They combine ideas from the fields
of metamodel simulation-based optimization, transient finite capacity queueing
theory and traffic flow theory. Their performance is evaluated by considering
urban traffic management problems for three road networks in the United States,
Europe and Asia.

This project will be carried out in collaboration with a transportation agency
in the United States. The techniques will support their ongoing planning and
operational efforts. Numerous transportation agencies and consultants around the
world use these traffic simulation tools to inform their planning and operations
decisions. The techniques will enable practitioners to identify transportation
strategies that provide both local and network-wide improvements. If successful,
these techniques contribute to improve the management of transportation systems,
mitigate peak-hour congestion, and thereby reduce its economic and environmental
impacts. They also contribute to providing an improved urban mobility experience
by identifying traffic management strategies that lead to more reliable
transportation services. Enabling the use of microscopic simulators to
efficiently identify network design improvements may also lead to substantial
savings for infrastructure projects. The ideas and results of this project will
be discussed with the main simulation software developers. Through various
educational activities, this project will involve, encourage and train
underrepresented students in conducting engineering research and problem
solving.
