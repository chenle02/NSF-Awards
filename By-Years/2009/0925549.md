"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;We
develop an electrically pumped microcavity exciton-polariton laser as a novel
coherent light source based on the exotic quantum nature, Bose-Einstein
Condensation (BEC) of microcavity exciton-polaritons. In a monolithic
semiconductor structure, half-light and half-matter exciton-polaritons will emit
spontaneously a single-mode, tightly-focused and monochromatic coherent
electromagnetic wave via BEC process; consequently, the laser will operate at a
much lower external pump power without population inversion. An electrical
pumping scheme can build the polariton laser in a compact format towards various
practical applications. Our approach is (1) to design and to fabricate an
optimized p-i-n microcavity structure with multiple quantum wells through high-
quality molecular beam epitaxy method, and (2) to characterize the performance
of the aforementioned laser device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Such novel and efficient laser would advance progresses in
optical communication and data storage, and optical interconnect circuits. It
also serves as a testbed to study the fundamental physics of microcavity
exciton-polariton systems: BEC mechanisms under electrical pumping and the phase
diagram of standard photon laser, microcavity exciton-polaritons BEC and BCS in
terms of light-matter coupling strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Our proposed research will be a driving impetus to show that
validated physics would lead to unprecedented, efficient and advanced
engineering applications. Thus, we highly anticipate that postdoctoral scholars,
graduate and undergraduate students will grasp both comprehensive knowledge of
fundamental science and the development of associated engineering devices using
the advanced optical and device processing technologies. We will continue to
outreach and educate broader audience with our research activities through
diverse communicating channels as to the progress of our research activities.
