This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of creating a system that automatically generates personalized
broadcasts from a library of audio / video (rich media) content. Such a system
is needed because individuals are overloaded with rich media content and lack
advanced tools for navigating this deluge of rich media. Building upon
StreamSage's existing expertise in dealing with rich media information,
StreamSage's research will alleviate this problem by creating a system capable
of creating "personalized rich media broadcasts" that automatically characterize
the gaps between disjointed segments of content and fill these gaps with
bridging text that provides necessary background and structure to the segments
from multiple rich media files. The effort in Phase I will expand the current-
state-of-the-art by developing algorithms capable of automatically identifying
the types of gaps between the rich media segments and by establishing methods by
which the information necessary for coherently bridging these gaps can be
automatically extracted from the rich media files. The personalized broadcast
system created by this research would greatly improve end-user interactions with
the rich media content by intelligently ordering and bridging the content pushed
or pulled to the end-user. Additionally, an automated personalized broadcast
system would enable the pushing of rich media content on a large scale, which
has been impossible to date because of the tremendous manual intervention
required to create a broadcast of usable quality.
