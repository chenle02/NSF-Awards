A new water quality analyzer, a turbidity meter, a fluorometer and a submarine
photometer will be purchased to be used in field and laboratory work for
students in the aquatic biology program. The students will all have hands-on
experience with these state-of-the-art pieces of equipment. The equipment will
be used by both majors and non-majors in four courses: Aquatic Biology,
Limnology, Ichthyology, and Oceans and Estuaries. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
