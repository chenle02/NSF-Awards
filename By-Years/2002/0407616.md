Abstract

Ensign wasps (Hymenoptera: Evaniidae) are colorful, frequently collected, and
recognizable parasites of cockroach eggs, yet they have been relatively
neglected by systematists and evolutionary ecologists. The main obstacle to
future research on evaniids is the current classification, which is outdated and
inadequate. The intent of this project is to overhaul evaniid taxonomy,
investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the family and between it and
other major Hymenopteran groups, and to use the relationships to examine several
phenomena in an evolutionary context. In part I, a revision of evaniid genera
will be conducted based on examination of a large body of material already
assembled, and the new classification used to structure a world catalog of
species following examination of type specimens in several major museums. In
part II, phylogenetic relationships among the genera will be estimated using DNA
sequence data from five genes (16S, COI, 28S, LW Rh, and one new gene) along
with morphological characters. In Part III, the relationships between Evaniidae
and other Hymenopteran superfamilies (emphasizing Evanioidea) will be estimated
using DNA sequence data from three genes that have already been widely used
across Hymenoptera (16S, COI and 28S). The results of Parts I through III will
but useful not only for proposing new and more predictive classifications, but
also for investigating the evolution of oviposition behavior in these wasps, as
well as their biogeographic history. A promising young systematist will be
trained during this dissertation project, and the results of the work will also
have immediate impact on the larger NSF-funded Assembling the Tree of Life
project on the megadiverse insect order Hymenoptera. The new generiuc
classification for Evaniidae will open up this fascinating group to further
taxonomic and ecological study.
