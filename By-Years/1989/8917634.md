This award is in support of the Seismic Experiment-Ross Ice Shelf (SERIS), a
seismic study of the plate boundary between East Antarctica and the Ross
Embayment. The first year involves acquisition of a 150-km-long multichannel
seismic reflection line starting on the Ross ice shelf and entering the
Transantarctic Mountains front through one of the outlet glaciers. A reversed
refraction profile and several wide-angle reflection profiles will be collected
along the multichannel seismic line. Interpretation of the data, flexural
modeling of the uplift and the subsidence, analysis of the seismic stratigraphy
and modeling of the gravity will be carried out in the second year. This study
is a joint project between scientists from Stanford University of Ohio State
University, the U.S. Geological Survey at Menlo Park, and the Geophysics
Division, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in New
Zealand. The experiment is designed to serve as a prototype for large-scale
seismic experiments in the interior of Antarctica in the next decade.
