Abstract

Award: DMS-0335481 Principal Investigator: Jindrich Zapletal

This award provides partial support for the annual Southeast Logic Symposium
(SEALS), to be held at the University of Florida in March 2004, 2005, and 2006.
These are weekend conferences that emphasize set theory and bring together
established logicians and set theorists, junior researchers, and graduate
students. The emphasis of SEALS 2004 will be on the interaction between
descriptive set theory, cardinal invariants, Borel equivalence theory, pcf
theory, and determinacy.
