This project studies mathematical problems involved in combining probability
judgements based on many different items of evidence and bearing on many
different but related questions. Such combination is often infeasable unless
computations can be carried out "locally", on only a few variables at a time.
Several methods of local computation will be investigated, including the
exploitation of tree like structures, Monte Carlo simulations, and iterative
methods.
