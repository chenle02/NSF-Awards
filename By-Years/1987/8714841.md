This project is aimed at developing new predictive models for the thermodynamic
properties of complex supercritical fluid systems. Lattice-gas models are
developed for systems in which multiple fluid phases are formed. The effects of
polar and hydrogen-bonding solvents and solutes are modeled by the use of
orientationally asymmetric interaction energies. New methods are used to compute
the models' properties and to account for the far-reaching effects of the
critical anomalies in these systems. These methods are based on mean-field
renormalization techniques that will, for the first time, be extended to
molecular models in which size and orientational effects are present. In this
research, the PI identifies the sources of error in existing group-contribution
models for mixture properties. Furthermore, the PI develops, using interaction-
site potentials, rigorous group-interaction models for predicting the excess
properties of aqueous solutions of hydrocarbons and organics when experimental
data are unavailable. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations are used.
Although the focus of this work is on mixtures at moderate pressures, the group-
interaction models are also applicable at high pressures. In particular, they
can be used to predict significant physical properties, such as limiting
infinite dilution activity coefficients. In the research, these "data" are used
to determine the parameters in the lattice-gas models, thereby yielding
predictive methods for complex supercritical fluid systems.
