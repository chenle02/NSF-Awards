This engineering education research project seeks to create a theoretical basis
that can be used to guide interventions to engage under-represented students in
engineering and build their self-efficacy. The project, based on Social
Cognitive Career Theory, will measure the self-efficacy of minority and majority
students at predominately white institutions to determine the types of
interventions that are best able to improve minority students' self-efficacy.
Self-efficacy is a strong predictor of academic career choice and persistence.
The knowledge gained from this investigation will be used to design a research-
based intervention to improve minority students' self-efficacy. Dissemination of
the results of this project can inform intervention and outreach strategies
aimed at under-represented students at other institutions, and may have lasting
impact on the number of engineers who come from currently under-represented
groups.
