9320537 White This project builds on recent research that demonstrated that the
nebulosity surrounding the familiar Pleiades star cluster results from an
accidental encounter between the cluster and an interstellar cloud. The
interaction creates a unique laboratory for the study of astrophysical processes
in the interstellar medium. Dr. White will observe narrow absorption lines
produced by the interstellar gas in the spectra of stars in and near the cluster
to probe and analyze the cloud-cluster interaction. This award falls within the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at NSF.
