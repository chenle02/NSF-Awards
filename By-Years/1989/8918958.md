Plants display a remarkable diversity of mating systems. Plant species that
have mixed mating systems (e.g., both self- fertilize and outcross) provide a
special opportunity for studying how natural selection molds the mating system.
Some controversy surrounds this issue because different theoretical models make
different predictions concerning which factors are important. The proposed
research will use the common annual, Impatiens capensis, to examine whether
inbreeding depression increases or decreases with a history of inbreeding in a
population. Using electrophoresis, the investigator will analyze the sources of
inbreeding and genetic structure in several natural populations. This
information will be compared to levels of inbreeding depression and genetic load
in each population derived from competition experiments. This should reveal
whether the genetic load increases due to drift and mutation, or is purged via
selection when inbreeding occurs. The results of this research should help
determine which possible genetic effects steer mating system evolution. In
addition, it should identify the sources and consequences of inbreeding in
natural populations. This information will help illuminate the genetic hazards
faced by the small populations of rare and threatened species and may help guide
artificial selection and plant breeding in agricultural programs.
