AST-0302095 Rhode, Katherine

Dr. Rhode is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at Yale and Wesleyan
Universities. She will address the fundamental problem of understanding how
galaxies form. In particular, she will address the formation of elliptical
galaxies through observations of globular star clusters (GCs). The GCs act as
probes of the formation history of galaxies. Their heavy element content,
spatial distributions, and kinematics provide important clues to the conditions
present in a galaxy at the time of their formation. Dr. Rhode has already
surveyed a large sample of GC systems around both elliptical and spiral
galaxies. With her fellowship, she will obtain spectroscopy of these GCs to
measure their kinematics, heavy element content, and ages. These data will
provide further constraints on how giant galaxies are formed. She will also
compare her wide-field optical images with space-based X-ray data to explore the
connection between GCs and X-ray emission from discrete sources in normal
galaxies.

In addition to her research, Dr. Rhode will develop laboratory exercises, aimed
at non-science-majors in undergraduate astronomy courses, that involve observing
with a small telescope and Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras. These labs will
provide students first-hand experience with the tools used in modern astronomy.
After being tested and refined, the labs will be disseminated to the community
via a web site and presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.
