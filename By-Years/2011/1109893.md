This award funds an observational effort at the University of Hawaii that will
explore stellar variability on various time scales in the Orion Cluster, is a
nearby star forming region. The project will build upon previous NSF investments
in the VYSOS (Variable Young Stars Optical Survey) project. The focus of this
proposal is to understand how brightness variations reveal circumstellar
accretion, giant star spots, magnetic flares, occultations by orbiting dust
condensations, and eclipses by companions. The brightness variations will be
compared to the predictions of magnetohydrodynamic codes that model the
accretion process in young stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support
education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, along with
education and outreach efforts to local high school students, some of whom will
also be involved directly in the project. The data and data products from this
survey available to the astronomical community in collaboration with the US
Virtual Observatory.
