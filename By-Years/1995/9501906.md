9501906 Culver This is an award to provide the support this investigator
requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program which has the intent of encouraging
the early development of academic faculty as educators and researchers. The
research this investigator plans to conduct is directed toward establishing an
efficient optimal design algorithm for decontamination of water in aquifers that
have been contaminated with hazardous materials. The investigator's education
plan involves development of effective skills for teaching engineering courses
and to use those skills to enrich courses she will be responsible for teaching.
Her goal is to bring students to a level of understanding that allows them to
analyze problems relating to decontamination of aquifers and to design
appropriative engineering solutions to those problems. Results of this
investigator's research are likely to improve the approaches taken toward
engineering design of procedures for decontaminating groundwater. Her teaching
plan is expected to result in increased participation in engineering by women
and under-represented minorities. ***
