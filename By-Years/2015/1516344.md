Interfacial phenomena are common in nature. They occur whenever there is a
substance that can exist in at least two different phases and there is some
mechanism that generates a spatial separation of these phases. For most
substances there are at least three phases (vapor, liquid, and ice for water,
for example). The interfaces that separate different phases may evolve with
time. A typical two-phase transition is the solidification process of a liquid.
A classical multi-phase transition arises from evolutions of grains in a
polycrystal where alignments of atoms in different grains do not match at grain
boundaries. The growth of a solid polycrystal from a liquid involves a two-phase
transition between liquid and solid and a multi-phase transition among grains.
To date, a significant amount of knowledge has been accumulated on two-phase
transitions. For multi-phase transitions, however, rigorous mathematical studies
are far from complete. The objective of this project is to provide a systematic
study of multi-phase transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are macroscopic
free boundary models, which are based on observable quantities and are needed to
deal with singularities due to topological changes of free boundaries, and
microscopic continuum models, derived at the molecular level and (always) well-
posed. One goal of the project is to derive critical information from continuum
models for free boundary models when the latter become indeterminate. Another is
to develop new microscopic continuum models for phase transitions among phases
such as solid/liquid and different grains in a polycrystal. The main tools used
here will be theories of partial differential equations, singular perturbations,
asymptotic expansions, complex analysis, bifurcation, center manifolds, global
analysis, dynamical systems, and geometric measure. Computer assistance will be
needed to first simulate, then validate, and further extend theoretical
conclusions. The project includes training of undergraduate and graduate
students through their participation in research.
