Mobile devices such as smartphones, netbooks and laptops are increasingly
beginning to store vast amounts of personal information, such as email, friend
lists, current location, and passwords to online banking websites. They are
therefore swiftly becoming prized bounties for malicious entities. This project
is investigating new techniques to detect malicious software on mobile devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is investigating three key thrusts (1)
energy-aware malware detection, (2) malware detector protection using a new
hardware architecture called Limited Local Memory, and (3) collaborative mobile
malware detection in a social network environment. The first thrust develops a
framework to quantitatively investigate how the energy-constrained nature of
mobile devices impacts their ability to run malware detection tools. It is then
using the framework to explore energy-aware malware detection. The second thrust
explores how emerging multicore technology on smartphones can be usefully
leveraged for security if each core is equipped with a small amount of private
memory. The third trend explores how the convergence of smartphones and social
networking can enable better malware detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
contribution of the project is in acknowledging the need for novel approaches
for mobile malware detection. As we increasingly rely on our smartphones to
support our daily activities, their security becomes paramount. The outcomes of
the project are being disseminated to increase public awareness of mobile
malware and anti-malware. In addition, course material related to the project
will be incorporated into the Master's degree curriculum at Rutgers.
