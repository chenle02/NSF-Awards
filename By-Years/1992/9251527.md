The Department of Geology is purchasing equipment to support field work in
hydrology. The equipment is enabling advanced students to undertake the
extensive field work required in modern hydrology studies and integrate the
results of field work with existing data from the region. A strong research
approach to teaching hydrological principles and procedures is incorporated into
all upper division groundwater and hydrology courses.
