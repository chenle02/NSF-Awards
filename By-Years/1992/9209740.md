9209740 PANG Vacuum devices, although still in the development stage, have
already show significantly promise in a number of applications. Besides being
able to operated at very high frequency and immune to radiation, it has been
recently demonstrated as a product for flat panel display in France. One of the
major drawbacks for vacuum devices is related to the fabrication technology. A
number of issues have yet to be resolved before the devices can achieve its full
potential. The emitters properties including their electrical, thermal,
mechanical stability are often not optimized. To improve the performance of
these devices, alternative materials and new fabrication technology have to be
developed. In this project, field emitter arrays for vacuum devices will be
fabricated. Two new materials will be tested as emitters, including WSi2 and
InP. For Wsi2 emitters, it will be formed by either sintering W deposited on Si
emitters or by patterning WSi2 that is deposited directly on the substrate. High
resolution patterning techniques including electron beam and masked ion beam
lithography will be used to define emitters with submicrometer dimensions in
resist. Wet chemical etching and dry etching techniques will be for generating
vertical profiles for the emitters. The emitter tips will be sharpened by
various dry etching conditions after the vertical emitters are formed, including
faceting, undercutting, mask erosion, and dopant dependent dry etching. In order
for the vacuum devices to be operational in air, a sealed triode structure will
be fabricated using double angle evaporation. ***
