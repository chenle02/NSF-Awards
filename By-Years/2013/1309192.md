A large-scale, experimental test of how habitat fragmentation affects trophic
structure, species niches, and extinction risk

Fundamental properties of populations and communities are affected by habitat
loss and fragmentation--pervasive threats to many ecosystems. Because effects of
landscape alteration are complex and intertwined, a central goal of landscape
ecology is to tease apart the mechanisms through which populations and
communities are altered by changes of habitat patches. Manipulative experiments
provide a means to this end. The fellow will assess impacts of fragmentation on
a diverse community of beetles in a large-scale experiment, the Wog Wog Habitat
Fragmentation Experiment in Australia. Specifically the project focuses on
determining: 1) How fragmentation affects trophic structure and 2) the niche
space of beetle species; 3) Whether a given beetle species? niche space predicts
its extinction risk in fragments. The fellow will use beetle carbon and nitrogen
stable isotope ratios (ä13C and ä15N) to address these questions. In addition to
providing a mechanistic understanding of how fragmentation affects a diverse
arthropod community, these results will serve conservation biology by predicting
which species are most at risk by fragmentation.

This fellow will be trained in quantitative skills, stable isotope analysis,
teaching, and mentoring. The fellow is committed to education and providing
research opportunities to undergraduate students, especially those from
underrepresented groups, and to being a role model in the classroom, laboratory,
and field. The teaching components of this project will include developing
course material in collaboration with Science Teaching Fellows in University of
Colorado's Science Education Initiative (a STEM initiative) and developing K-12
material in collaboration with undergraduates.
