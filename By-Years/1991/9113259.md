The overall objective of the proposed California Minority Graduate Forum is to
increase the number of minority students from Southern California who eventually
enroll in graduate school. The Forum is being held for approximately 500
juniors, seniors and master's minority students throughout Southern California
who have indicated an interest in attending graduate schools. We have a
commitment and from the participating colleges and universities that half of
these students will be from disciplines which the National Science Foundation
traditionally supports. Students interested in going to professional school such
as law or medicine will not be allowed to participate. Representatives from 100
graduate schools throughout the United States will participate and the students
will be able to discuss opportunities for graduate study with these individuals.
Several workshops will be given on topics ranging from financial aid to taking
the GRE examination. Details on how to prepare for the exam as well as specific
test-taking strategies will be discussed in the workshops. There will also be
some motivational speeches by minority faculty role models and minority students
who are currently in doctoral programs. Representatives from NSF will also be
invited to speak or participate in the forum panels and workshop.
