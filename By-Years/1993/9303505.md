This proposal is concerned with bounds for mean values in additive number
theory, and the local solubility of simultaneous additive equations. The
principal investigator intends to improve estimates in Vinogradov's mean value
theorem by incorporating the ideas behind the new refinements in the
corresponding work in Waring's problem. These improvements will have
consequences beyond additive number theory. This is research in the field of
number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as
the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields
of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in
developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes
for electronics.
