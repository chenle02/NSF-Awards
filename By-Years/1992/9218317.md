Theoretical research will be conducted on the electronic properties of organic
conductors. Three areas of emphasis will include: (i) dynamics of spin density
waves including the effect of the long range Coulomb potential; (ii) anomalous
quantum oscillations in organic conductors (Lebed resonances); and, (iii)
unconventional superconductors having relevance to superconductivity in organic
conductors and heavy fermions. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted on the
properties of organic conductors. These are highly unusual materials which
normally are not conductors of electricity. However, under certain circumstances
and in certain materials, this class of materials exhibit a spectrum of unusual
properties including superconductivity. This research has ramifications for a
variety of issues in contemporary materials science and condensed matter
physics.
