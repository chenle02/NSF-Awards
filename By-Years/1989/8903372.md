This is Phase II of an SBIR project to improve integrated circuit metrology.
The need to enhance critical dimension measurement and quality control will
become acute in the next few years as integrated circuit features begin to
approach the .25 micron size. This project is to use numerical inverse
scattering theory with laser interferometry to overcome some of the problems
associated with conventional metrology. The feasibility of this approach was
demonstrated during Phase I of the grant and a prototype Numerical Microscope is
currently being developed.
