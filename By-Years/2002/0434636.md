This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "Development and use of statistical learning tools for
assessing models of neural spiking." Statistical learning tools, such as
boosting, are used for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications. This
research is developing both general purpose statistical learning tools and tools
specifically designed to assess the assumptions inherent in models for visual
neuroscience. These tools are designed for use in the study of the input-output
relationship of neurons in the visual cortex or the
retina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training goal is to learn the biology
underlying how the brain processes visual information, through weekly lab
meetings, lectures, classes, and conferences. Collaborations are being
established with experimentalists at neighboring labs at the NYU Center for
Neural Science, as well as applied mathematicians at the Courant Institute and
Princeton University. Broader impacts include working with the Program for Women
in Mathematics at the IAS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
