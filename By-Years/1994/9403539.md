BOWEN 9403539 This Interagency Agreement supports activities of the Interagency
Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead agency role.
These activities involve editing and preparation of the camera copy of the
Spring and Fall 1994 issues of the Journal, Arctic Research of the United
States. The journal serves an essential step in fulfilling the requirements of
Public Law 98-373, the Arctic Research and Policy Act. It contains information
on research activities of the Federal agencies involved in the Arctic and
reports and minutes of meetings from the Arctic Research Commission and IARPC.
This action provides support for preparation of the Journal and documentation of
the interagency programs for the 1990's. ***
