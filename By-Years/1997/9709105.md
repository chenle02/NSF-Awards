This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
with a contribution from the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities for instrumentation supports research in the
laboratory of Alvin L. Crumbliss in the Department of Chemistry at Duke
University. The proposed work will explore the effects of second sphere
coordination on the chemistry (transport properties, reduction potentials and
substitution kinetics) of iron siderophore complexes. Siderophore complexes are
responsible for transporting iron from the environment into bacterial cells.
Through a collaborative effort, pendant ligands would be attached onto a number
of siderophores or synthetic hydroxamic acids in order to study specific second-
sphere effects. Complexes will also be enclosed into micelles in order to mimic
the effect of cell membranes. The chemistry of iron siderophores provides
insight into how iron is transported into cells in the environment. This
research explores how interactions through ligands that are not directly
attached to the iron affect the uptake, release and transport across cell
membranes of this essential element in all living systems.
