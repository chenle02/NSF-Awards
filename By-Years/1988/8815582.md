The Combustion Institute International Symposium is a biennial event which
brings together about one thousand specialists in the multifaceted field of
Combustion. This forum (and the subsequent proceedings) are a choice place for
exchanging and recording the latest accomplishments in the field. Thus it
contributes to the diffusion of the results and ideas which evolve from the many
awards granted by NSF in this area, as well as redefining the direction of their
future work. To be noted also is the massive participation of other nations,
some of them extremely active in this field (Japan and Western Europe, in
particular). The grant of $5000 to help the University of Washington host this
important event is a worthwhile investment for the Foundation.
