The major objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovak cooperative research project
between Dr. Rustum Roy of the Pennsylvania State University and Dr. Jan Mailing
of the Slovak Technical University is to study the basic thermal, mechanical and
dielectric properties of a family of ultra low expansion materials, known as the
NSP-family (nasicon type termary and quarternary systems.) The researchers
intend to em phasize phase equilibrium studies, drawing upon a compatability
computation method developed at the Slovak Technical University. Its use should
shorten time for systematic experimental study of such complex systems. Results
should yield a systematic phase diagram and lead to our ability to characterize
these NZP-type materials for their sintering behavior in controlled furnace
atmospheres (i.e., oxygenic, reducing and humid, respectively.) This project in
materials research fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.//
