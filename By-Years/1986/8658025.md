The area of nonlinear optics has seen increasing attention because of relevance
to signal processing using lightwave technology. Since light is uncharged any
interaction between light beams must occur through such interactions. Crystals
exhibiting the largest interactions thus far have been the so-called photo-
refractive crystals and have consequently been very widely used in such studies.
Several striking developments have occured in recent years to focus attention
upon this area. The area of optical computing, that of optical neural networks,
and that of optical phase conjugation to correct distortion of optical beams are
among these. This is a direction with a lot of potential both from the point of
view of the optics involved and from the point of view of the development of
better materials.
