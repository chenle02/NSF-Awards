A program in experimental medium-energy nuclear physics at Arizona State
University will be continued. The goals of the program are to seek a description
of the interaction of medium- energy pions and protons with the nuclear medium
in terms of the elementary pion-nucleon and NN interactions and to learn about
the modifications of these fundamental interactions by the nuclear medium.
Experiments will be conducted at LAMPF, TRIUMF, IUCF, Saclay (France), and other
major international laboratories. The scientific program will include (1)
continuation of studies of pion single and double-charge-exchange reactions; (2)
new studies of the deuteron and in complex pion absorption processes in nuclei;
(3) studies of pion elastic-and inelastic-scattering reactions with new
experimental apparatus; (4) development of programs with polarized nuclear
targets and medium-energy probes; and (5) development of an experimental program
in heavy meson production with hadronic and electromagnetic probes. The ASU
group will contribute to the planning activities of the CEBAF laboratory,
including the design and planning of experiments and detector devices.
