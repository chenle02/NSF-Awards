Cells release various products to the outside through a process called
exocytosis. In the nervous system, exocytosis mediates the release of chemicals
including neurotransmitters, and a number of highly conserved proteins have been
shown to control this process. In this project, a hypothesis will be tested that
one protein originally discovered in yeast, VSM-1, may regulate exocytosis in
the nervous system of multicellular animals. To test this hypothesis, the impact
of mutating the gene coding for VSM-1 will be examined by studying the resulting
changes at the level of molecules, cells, and whole organisms in C. elegans. At
the cellular level, it will be determined if communication between neurons is
impaired in mutants lacking the gene. Finally, whole mutant animals will be
examined using pharmacological tests and fluorescent microscopy. Preliminary
unpublished data showed that C. elegans strains containing the mutation in the
VSM-1 gene are hyperactive and have more nerve endings than wild type animals.
Insights into the mechanism of VSM-1 from this proposal will advance
understanding of the nervous system of higher animals, including humans, because
there are no reports yet on the function of VSM-1 in multicellular animals. The
proposed research will also significantly enhance and promote students' training
in the field of neuroscience since it will primarily be conducted by
undergraduate students enrolled at Southwestern Oklahoma State University
(SWOSU), a teaching institution in rural western Oklahoma with a growing
commitment to research.
