The Symposium NM4: Atomically Thin, Layered, and 2D Non-Carbon Materials and
Systems? will take place from November 26 to December 1, 2017 at the Hynes
Convention Center and Boston Sheraton Hotel in Boston, MA. Topics to be
addressed include two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices, the latest
developments in science and engineering and advances in the material and device
applications with non-carbon 2D materials. The Symposium seeks financial support
to support student and junior researcher participation, as well as invited
speakers. It will host world-renowned scientists in the area of two-dimensional
(2D) materials science and technology as invited speakers, whose expertise range
from synthesis, characterizations, device development, theory and applications.
There will be a vigorous exchange of new ideas on device and fabrication
technology, and a huge opportunity to initiate and strengthen national and
international collaboration, which will be of enormous benefit to students and
young scholars in their pursuit of high-quality research.
