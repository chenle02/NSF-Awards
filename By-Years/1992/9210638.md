The objectives of this research are to explore the dynamic molecular structure
of liquid crystals by using two-dimensional Fourier transform ESR and high-field
ESR techniques. Detailed relaxation data are acquired to infer both the long-
time and short- time molecular motions. The description of molecular motions in
liquid crystals are enhanced by studies of transnational diffusion of the probes
both at the molecular level and the macroscopic level. These studies are of
special value for characterizing structure and dynamics of ordered systems.
