Language, thought, and culture are intricately connected, but the way this
relationship plays out over the lifespan of an individual, especially a
bilingual person, is not well understood.  Bilinguals constitute a large portion
of the US population and around the world. This project researches the language
of bilingual speakers in Russian immigrant communities to gain a better
understanding of fundamental properties of linguistic knowledge, language
acquisition and maintenance, the nature of language variation and change, and
stability of native speaker knowledge. Studying the language of immigrants is
also important, because it will help build understanding and respect for these
often stigmatized linguistic practices. The large, open-access database of
bilingual and monolingual Russian speech created during the project will allow
education policy makers and practitioners to make appropriate decisions
concerning bilingual children in American schools and to create educational
resources for heritage speakers of Russian who are an invaluable language
resource for the country. Ultimately, this database can also help natural
language processing applications for Russian, such as enhancing opportunities
for cross-cultural communication online, and making new and less available
publications quickly accessible through summarization and machine
translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will construct an open-access
online database documenting the speech of two types of bilinguals: émigré adults
and young bilingual children in Russian-speaking families in the US and Germany,
with a control group of monolingual families with small children in Russia. This
first-of-its-kind database will serve as a tool for comparing linguistic
behavior across populations and over time, investigating correlations between
grammatical, lexical, and sociolinguistic variables. It will contain audio-
aligned transcripts and will be annotated for morphology (e.g., "feminine noun")
and syntax (e.g., "relative clause"), which will allow researchers to study
frequencies of constructions in both the parents' and children's speech. The
database will enable researchers to tease apart several possible causes of the
differences between the home language of bilingual children and adults, and the
speech of monolinguals: normal processes of language change or the influence of
the majority language and culture; incomplete learning or forgetting of the home
language; or universal cognitive and linguistic principles.
