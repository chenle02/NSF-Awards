Most explanations of the attitudes and behavior of impoverished segments of the
public in third world nations emphasize the influence of economic considerations
on levels of political support. There is increasing evidence, however, that the
core values and beliefs of even the poorest segments of society are critical
determinants of political attitudes and behavior. This award supports doctoral
dissertation research that seeks to explore the relative effects of economic
conditions and basic values on the political attitudes and behavior of the poor
in developing nations. Specifically, this project surveys the political
attitudes of six carefully selected economic groups in Nicaragua. These groups
differ in their economic status and vulnerability as well as in their basic
values and beliefs. Thus by comparing their levels of political support the
relative effects of economic conditions and personal values can be measured.
Nicaragua is chosen as the site for the study because its recent transition from
an authoritarian to democratic regime allows respondents to be asked about their
attitudes toward these very different political systems. When completed this
dissertation research should expand our understanding of the values and behavior
of those large segments of the public in many third world nations that live in
or on the edge of poverty. If the thesis is correct, the research should point
the way to new approaches to dealing with problems of political instability in
these nations.
