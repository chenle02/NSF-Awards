It is widely believed that many contributions to political campaigns view their
contributions as a kind of investment, expecting some private benefit in return
for their money. This benefit might be a special tax reduction, a profitable
contract to provide some goods or services to the government, or perhaps an
official position. The benefit need not be forthcoming or even precisely defined
at the time the contribution is made. Rather, the contributor may simply expect
that , sometime in the future, the recipient will be able and willing to provide
some desired service. This project continues the development of a model of
campaign funds in which the market for political "favors" is treated as an asset
market. This model captures many of the essential features one would expect of a
market for quid pro quo contributions, and yields a number of interesting and
strong hypotheses which are empirically testable about the pattern of
contributions across elections. The extensions that are being developed for the
current project include: (1) detailed investigation of races with incumbents,
(2) explicit consideration of the dynamics involved in reaching an equilibrium,
(3) allowing contributors to supply votes as well as money in exchange for
political favors, and (5) modelling small, individual contributors, perhaps
treating their contributions as a kind of consumer good. Empirical tests involve
data on campaigns for the U.S. Congress and the California Legislature.
Campaign-financing issues are under continuous public policy debate. A better
understanding of the campaign-financing process is essential for the
construction of sensible public policy.
