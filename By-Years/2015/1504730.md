First year students who are not ready for calculus represent a group of college
students at high risk of leaving engineering. These students join an academic
institution not only with weak math skills, but they also are less exposed to
engineering upon entrance, in comparison with calculus ready students. This lack
of engagement in engineering lead to confusion, frustration, and a loss of
interest in engineering. This project supports an engineering track for those
students that are not calculus ready but are interested in engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the development and implementation of
a course to teach engineering concepts to first year engineering students who
are not yet ready for calculus, while reinforcing critical thinking skills. The
course will assist these students in their preparation for calculus by
reinforcing concepts needed to succeed in math. The long term goal of this
project is to decrease attrition and to increase the critical thinking skills of
these engineering students. Another goal of the project is to promote the
development of an engineering identity in first time engineering students. A
mixed-methods approach will be used to assess the development of critical
thinking skills and an engineering identity in students enrolled in the course.
