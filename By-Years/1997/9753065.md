Reconfigurable Network Interfaces Networked computing environments composed of
commercial, off-the shelf (COTS) workstation clusters are increasingly being
used to implement scalable multiprocessor architectures. As new interconnect
protocols emerge for clustered workstation environments, the interfaces between
the hosts and the network facilitating interprocessor communication must be
better defined. The investigator explores the performance of various hardware
and software alternatives which support real time and fault tolerant
communication using a reconfigurable interface in a clustered workstation
environment. A multiprocessor testbed along with field programmable gate array
technology are used to design hardware that emulates a set of fault tolerant,
dynamically reconfigurable hardware interfaces capable of injecting various
faults. The interfaces are evaluated in both fault-free and faulty environments
with a suite of real time applications selected from a number of areas,
including autonomous spacecraft navigation and onboard data processing.
