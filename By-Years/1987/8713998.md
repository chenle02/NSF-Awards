The proposed research is concerned with singularly perturbed nonlinear delay-
differential equations with one delay. The objective is to analyze the behavior
of periodic solutions for small values of the perturbing parameter and to
discuss the boundary layer phenomena that arise on certain intervals of
asymptotic length zero. In addition, certain singular systems that can be
approximated by finite-difference equations will be investigated from the point
of view of singular perturbation. This project is part of ongoing efforts to
understand the dynamics of nonlinear delay-differential equations that model
many phenomena in optics, physiology and population biology.
