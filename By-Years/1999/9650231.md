Introductory astronomy students frequently have difficulty connecting the
theoretical knowledge presented in lectures with astronomical observations.
Another difficulty is in making the connection between the `Copernican` view of
astronomy, dominant in lecture courses, with the `Ptolemaic` view of the sky
manifest to the Earth-bound observer. This course combines interactive
planetarium simulations with telescopic observation in order to bridge these
gaps in understanding. With modern technology, planetarium simulations are
devised in which students mark significant events in the sky with light pens and
trace out important sky motions. These movements are measured against simulation
time which is provided by computer to each student group. The astronomical
observations emphasize simplicity and complement the planetarium simulations.
The primary objective is to provide students the means to connect a thorough
observing experience with the wealth of astronomical knowledge presented in the
companion lecture course. The techniques and instrumentation developed are
readily transferable to other institutions.
