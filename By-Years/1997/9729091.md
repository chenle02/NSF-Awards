ABSTRACT EEC-9729091 RINGO Direct conversion receivers for wireless
communication require less components and eliminate the need for bulky image
rejection IF filters. This is joint "TIE" project linking the research
capabilities of two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) to
study techniques for on-line adaptive digital compensation of the imperfections
of analog components of mixed-mode transceiver circuits. The research site will
be conducted at Oregon State University, the research site of the I/UCRC for
Design of Analog Digital Integrated Circuits, and the University of California,
San Diego I/UCRC for Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems.
