9318675 Karasov Feeding and digestion rates of some birds are particularly high
during fattening prior to migration, during wintertime exposure to low
temperature, and during postnatal growth. The PI will study how the avian gut
adjusts to high feeding rate because it is important and has been little
studied. The adjustments are important because they might influence stop-over
times during migration, wintertime distribution of birds, and the evolution of
growth and development patterns. Study of the gut adjustments of birds will also
complement similar kinds of studies in mammals that have biomedical
significance. Finally, knowledge of digestive capabilities and limitations
should help in the design of artificial diets for animals in captivity, and
hence improve husbandry practices for both endangered species in zoological
parks and animals with economic value. The PI will study gastrointestinal
adjustments to high feeding rate in several avian species during migration, cold
acclimation, and postnatal growth. The PI will test for changes in digesta
retention time, amount of gastrointestinal tissue, and tissue-specific levels of
digestive enzymes and nutrient absorption. These features are chosen because
they determine features of whole-animal nutritional performance such as
digestive efficiency and rate. ***
