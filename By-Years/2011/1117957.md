A new class of estimation methods are developed that can optimally utilize
minima resources for high-precision pose tracking. This project develops the
first formal methodologies for providing selections of parameters (e.g., camera
frame rate, image resolution, number and type of detected features) for small
portable devices to delay depletion of the battery. The approach is based on a
rigorous study of the properties of the pose tracking problem with visual and
inertial sensors and (1) identifies the fundamental limits of the attainable
estimation accuracy, and (2) allows the analytical prediction of the accuracy as
a function of the use of the sensing and processing resources. This makes
possible the development of algorithms that optimally allocate system resources
whose design relies on an optimization framework where the estimation errors
constitute the cost function to be minimized, the resource limitations are
explicitly modeled as constraints, and all the relevant design parameters (e.g.,
camera frame rate, number of features used) are the optimization variables. The
immediate impact of this research effort is the increased cost efficiency and
accuracy for navigation tasks in diverse applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
developed technology is available to the wider community through open-source
position-tracking software for mobile phone devices and provides useful
assistive technology. We engage K-12 students at local outreach events and
introduce them to engineering as well collaborate with MESA, a long-standing
program at the University of California at Riverside with a proven record of
attracting underrepresented minority students to science and engineering.
