This is a request from the Department of Chemistry of the State University of
New York, University Center at Binghamton for funds to purchase a computer
graphics workstation for molecular modeling. Molecular modeling has become an
indispensable method in a number of research groups within the Chemistry
Department, and the addition of a computer graphics workstation to the
Department's instrumentation capabilities will significantly enhance both
current and future research efforts. The instrument is needed by members of the
Chemistry Department for research in the areas of: (1) Molecular modeling of
carbohydrates. (2) Molecular modeling of tubulin-colchicine interactions. (3)
Molecular modeling of C-disaccharides. (4) Mapping membrane fluidity
