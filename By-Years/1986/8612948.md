Recently, considerable attention has been given to problems related to the
robust control of systems whose mathematical description includes uncertain
parameters. This type of uncertainty arises in a diversity of application areas
such as flight control, process control, vehicle control, and network design.
Several fundamental issues related to this topic will be explored. The
contention here is that many problems of this type (such as stabilization,
tracking, compensation against parasitics, etc.) can be reduced to more basic
questions about polynomials. To this end, this research first establishes a
solid connection between robust control problems and a special class of
polynomial problems. The resulting polynomials turn out to have a special
structure which will be heavily expoited in the proposed research. The unifying
polymial framework readily accommodates changes in order and uncertainties which
range over a continuum rather than a finite set. The intention is to develop
specific compensator design procedures. Much of the impetus for the development
of numerical methods is derived from a recent breakthrough in the theory of
interval polynomials by Kharitonov.
