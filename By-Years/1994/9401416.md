This award supports research in commutative algebra. The principal investigator
will study the rigidity question for finitely generated modules over a
noetherian local ring. He will apply this work to the problem of determining
when the tensor product is torsion-free. He will also work on the classification
of local rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type and will try to determine the ranks
of the indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over these rings. Finally,
he will study the arithmetical properties of Picard groups of algebraic
varieties and several related questions concerning the multiplicative structure
of fields. This research is concerned with a number of questions in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families
of polynomial equations. One can either study the geometry of the solution set
or approach problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the
solution set that form what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective
creates a close connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
