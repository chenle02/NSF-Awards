It is proposed to develop computer simulations of two optical systems based on
solitons. The first is a long-distance communication system, and the second is a
node in an ultra-fast ring network. The system simulation codes will be built in
a modular way so that scientifically interesting and technologically useful
results can be extracted at every stage of their development. Development
scenarios and the scientific questions which will be addressed are described in
the proposal. The value of the proposed work lies both in the codes developed
which will be made generally available to members of the scientific community,
and in the scientific issues which we intend to resolve. Our work will be
characterized by close cooperation with appropriate experimentalists.
