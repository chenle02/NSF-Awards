Laboratory experiments are proposed to study the effects of simulated buoyancy
reversal, radiative cooling, and latent heat release on transport and mixing by
buoyant flows. Experiments will be performed in water tanks, using regular and
fluorescent pH indicators in conjunction with acid-base reactions to determine
optically the location and amount of mixing. Transport of fluid parcels will be
measured using ordinary and fluorescent non- reacting dyes.
