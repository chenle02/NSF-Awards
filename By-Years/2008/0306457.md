ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0306457&lt;br/&gt;New Mexico State University&lt;br/&gt;Cook,
Jonathan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this age of information, computers have entered
virtually every aspect of society and life, and&lt;br/&gt;the future holds
expectations of ubiquitous communicating computers, from the PDA-cellphones
on&lt;br/&gt;the belt, the desktops at work and home, the traveling laptop, and
the smart car. In this alwaysnetworked&lt;br/&gt;world, it is to be expected
that these systems will automatically receive and utilize software upgrades, new
software applications, and the like. Today's software has taken the tentative
first steps towards automatic, component-based software evolution, but in these
mechanisms there is no real control over the evolving software components.
Rather, users are quite familiar with the problems of mis-matched, wrongly timed
changes in system components. Overcoming these problems will be crucial to
developing the \always-on" future of ubiquitous computing. This project will
take advantage of the rise in dynamic, distributed, component-based software
architectures, and will pursue active techniques to help maintain reliability
during system execution and throughout system evolution.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically,
this research will investigate dynamically combining and controlling multiple
versions&lt;br/&gt;of components to increase the overall system reliability
throughout its evolution. The goal is to provide a framework where component
versions can be inspected, managed, and manipulated. Such a framework will allow
new versions of components to be brought into a system to introduce
enhancements, while still keeping older versions on-line to protect the system
against accidental faults that break existing functionality. In addition, it
will enable basic component management facilities that will allow self-checking
of components and enable basic reasoning about the dynamic version dependencies
that exist in the system.
