This research is set in the context of mathematical models related to the
quantum mechanical foundations of quantum computing and quantum information
theory. The project focuses on the quantification and characterization of
entanglement, the key property distinguishing the quantum mechanical model of
computation from the classical model. The major theme of the research is to
exploit the inherent geometry of the model in order to classify and quantify
different kinds of entanglement, to provide criteria for the detection of
entangled quantum states, and to motivate and refine new mathematical techniques
for the study of quantum information theory.

Continued reduction of the size of components in computers necessarily leads to
a consideration of quantum mechanical effects and, potentially, to the
development of a computer that can solve problems inaccessible to current
technology. An important aspect of developing the required technology is the
detection and measurement of putatively entangled states in the laboratory. A
key goal of this project is to relate the mathematical theory directly to the
design of laboratory protocols for the detection of such entanglement. In
addition, greater insight into the nature of entanglement will suggest both new
experiments and different approaches to issues of quantum computation and
quantum communication.
