Aquatic Hemiptera are a worldwide group with a relatively mature taxonomy,
which permits use in addressing questions of evolution and zoogeography.
Although richly represented in all tropical regions, they attain their greatest
diversity in the Malay Archipelago between Asia and Australia, where they have
radiated to produce numerous locally endemic species. Within this archipelago,
the island of New Guinea is of particular zoogeographical interest due to its
composite geological and biological nature. The island was formed through
tectonic suturing of disparate parts, essentially the opposite of fragmentation
and vicariance, and the fauna is derived from both temperate Gondwanian and
tropical Laurasian sources. As a result, its faunal relationships have been
difficult to depict on simple dichotomously branching cladograms. The intention
is to address this problem by combining classical cladistic biogeography with a
relatively new method involving cladogram character analysis to investigate the
composite nature and relationships of the Papuan fauna. The proposed study will
be divided into five separate phases that form a logical continuum: Faunal
survey, systematic revisions, character analysis, phylogenetic analyses, and
zoogeographical hypothesis testing. During the granting period, the plan is to
complete revisions and cladistic analyses of 19 genera in 4 families, containing
a total of approximately 300 species. These taxonomic works will concentrate on
groups that are most informative from a biogeographical standpoint, and will use
extensive recent collections from New Guinea combined with collections from
other museums. The zoogeographical analysis will rely on both previously
published studies and the new phylogenies to be generated during the course of
this project. Several explicit zoogeographical hypotheses will be tested
regarding the relationship of New Guinea to Australia, the Philippines, New
Caledonia, and the central Malay Archipelago. The basic data on systematics and
distribution generated by this study will be of use to scientists interested in
taxonomy, biodiversity and conservation. The comparison of methodological
approaches will provide new insights into the analysis of zoogeographical data,
and the zoogeographical conclusions will be of interest to those concerned with
faunal interchange and distribution in areas of tectonic plate collision.
Finally, the results will provide useful comparative information for geologists
studying the tectonic evolution of the Malay Archipelago.***
