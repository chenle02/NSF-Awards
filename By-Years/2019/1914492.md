This award is to support travel by up to 50 student participants to attend the
2019 Spring School on Medical Robotics. All of the supported students are
attending US institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is a conference
support grant for the expenses of up to 50 selected U.S. trainees (PhD students
and post-doctoral fellows of various disciplinary backgrounds pertaining to
medical/surgical robotics, image-guided interventions, surgical simulation and
training, biomechatronics, rehabilitation robotics, and medical devices)
attending the 5th North American School on Medical Robotics - "2019 Spring
School on Medical Robotics". The School will be held at the Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, from April 1-2, 2019 to introduce and educate
trainees on the ground- breaking research and opportunities in surgical
robotics, image-guided medical interventions, surgical simulation and training,
rehabilitation robotics, etc. Organized in part by the Georgia Institute of
Technology, the school focuses on providing a forum to exchange scientific
findings, discuss recent research progress, identify areas requiring greater
emphasis, set research goals for collaborations, recognize outstanding
achievement in the field, and promote the study of medical robotics to young
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
