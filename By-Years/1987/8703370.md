The proposed research is on the combinatorial and algebraic theory of smooth
piecewise polynomial functions over polyhedral subdivisions and its relationship
to the theory of facial enumeration in convex polyhedra. A particular emphasis
will be given to the problem of determining a simple generating set for the
algebra of all smooth splines, as was already done in the case of continuous
piecewise polynomials, and to the problem of determining for which subdivisions
does this algebra have a free basis over the ring of global polynomial
functions. The PI has shown these problems to be related to certain enumeration
questions for convex polytopes, and he hopes to develop this connection further
here. Piecewise polynomial functions have long been used for solving partial
differential equations by the finite element method: this work was originally
motivated by questions arising in this context. More recently, they have found
extensive application in the area of surface modelling for computerized design
and control. As a result of earlier work on this project, they are now beginning
to find new applications in the theory of structural rigidity.
