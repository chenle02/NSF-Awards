This award supports the research of Professor L. Billera to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate polyhedral subdivisions and their
relationship to convex polytopes and multivariate splines. He also intends to
continue the study of fibre polytopes with a view to further developing their
applications to computational algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. The
research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.
And, so it is extremely important to modern communications, for example the
design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in
computer science.
