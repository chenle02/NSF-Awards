This program has pioneered the use of computer modeling for investigating the
physics of plasmas. The program is based on the philosophy of using computer
simulation as a general tool to gain fundamental understanding of plasmas, to
explore phenomena which are difficult or impossible to investigate in other
ways, and to study interesting and potentially useful plasma behavior. A two
year program is proposed to pursue studies of basic plasma physics, to
investigate properties of plasma lenses and accelerators, to investigate the use
of plasmas as radiation sources, to study dynamic Debye clouds in magnetized
plasmas, to investigate lasing mechanisms which may have been operative in the
early universe, and to develop diagnostic tools for plasma research.
