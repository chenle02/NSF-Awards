Algebraic geometry and number theory are both concerned with systems of
polynomial equations. The former seeks to understand the shapes they define, and
the latter seeks to understand the set of (say) integer or rational solutions to
the system. One of the most important themes of 21st century mathematics is the
interplay between these two viewpoints: the properties of the shape in question
influence, and are in turn influenced by, the arithmetic of the equations. This
project seeks to understand this fundamental interplay through a study of the
arithmetic of fundamental groups of algebraic varieties.

Specifically, this project is concerned with (1) an analysis of the
representation theory of arithmetic fundamental groups, taking as input the
geometric Langlands program, tools from p-adic analysis, and p-adic Hodge
theory, and (2) an application of these results to concrete problems in
arithmetic and algebraic geometry: for example, the geometric torsion
conjecture, the non-abelian Chabauty-Kim method, and the section conjecture. The
project aims to expand on new techniques developed by the author and
collaborators to investigate these difficult open questions.
