This award provides funds to the State University of New York, Stony Brook to
continue a summer program designed to immerse a small group of undergraduate
students in an active research environment spanning the areas of behavioral and
cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology and the experimental study of decision,
choice and self-control. The goal underlying this initiative is to introduce
students who are not currently involved in a laboratory research program to
state-of-the-art psychological research in some of the most interesting and
important areas of experimental psychology. This program is intended to foster
interest in, and an appreciation of, scientific research, especially for those
students who might not otherwise have an opportunity to participate in this type
of activity. Students will participate in an intense eight-week "hands-on"
research experience where, in addition to learning specific laboratory skills,
they will be exposed to all phases of the research process. They will also
receive academic counseling and have access to a variety of support services.
Undergraduates will conduct independent research projects in one of eleven
active research laboratories in the Department of Psychology. They will be
closely supervised by faculty but will be encouraged to take as much
responsibility as possible for these projects. To supplement the laboratory
experience, a variety of group activities are planned such as visits to other
research laboratories, laboratory meetings, "brown bag" lunches, seminars and a
mini-symposium, that will broaden students knowledge of contemporary psychology.
These activities are designed to facilitate student interactions with the
faculty mentors, as well as provide opportunities to share experiences with one
another.
