The project examines a new pressure-swing membrane permeation process, which
can achieve separation beyond the steady state permselectivity of membranes
possessing opposite diffusivity and solubility characteristics toward a gas
pair. By operating a membrane permeator under a cyclic pressure swing mode, the
opposite mobility and solubility seletivities of the membrane can work
synergistically to accomplish a degree of separation beyond the steady membrane
permselectivity in the following manner. Along the flow direction in the feed
channel, the gas mixtures is separated chromatographically by the selective
adsorption of gases into the membrane; and across the membrane, the gas mixture
is separated by the diffusivity selectivity of the membrane. Since all of the
effluent streams are collected as products, the new process does no suffer the
low productivity shortcoming of the previously proposed pressure swing membrane
process. The new process condition accentuates both the solubility and the
diffusivity aspects of the membrane transport mechanism. It is also particularly
suitable for elucidating non-ideal membrane transport mechanisms. The
mathematical model developed for this new process is very effective for the
identification of complex membrane transport mechanisms.
