This conference on neural development will focus on cellular and molecular
mechanisms which are essential for the development of the system. It is the
objective of this program to bring together some of the most active research
scientists in areas related to this main theme, as well as a group of some 100
additional scientists with interests related to the topic. Not only will these
participants present their most recent findings, but they will find new insight
from other presentations and numerous discussions in this informal setting.
Hopefully, some totally new approaches to studies of neural development may be
formulated based on collaborative ventures established at this conference. The
multidisciplinary approach will be emphasized by an organization in which there
is a progression throughout the conference starting with a discussion of
mechanisms involved in the process of induction, particularly neural induction.
This will be followed by sessions on cell lineage and determination,
neurotransmitters as developmental signals, formation of neural pathways and
targets, and neural crest development. Each topic will occupy a whole day
(morning and evening) with the afternoon free for informal interactions and
discussion.
