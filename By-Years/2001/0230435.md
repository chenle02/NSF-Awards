This proposal will advance the state-of-the art of evaluation by applying
theory-based evaluation in STEM education. The grant will design and refine a
theoretical framework for an innovative evaluation design of STEM education
programs and provide meta-analyses of how different approaches in teacher
professional development affect teaching practices and student learning.
