Recent advances in spatial analysis and related methodologies such as
geographical information systems have pointed up the need for a better
understanding of the statistical properties of spatial correlation and
autocorrelation. Failure to take spatial autocorrelation into account can lead
to serious errors in model interpretation. Spatial modeling must not only take
account of dependence structure and heteroscedasticity, but it must also assess
the effects of spatial scale. This research focuses on a new family of spatial
association statistics, G, by experimentation on spatially distributed variables
in different situations, especially with small samples. The ultimate objective
is to incorporate the G statistics into geographical information systems in
order to explore the influence of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity
on a variety of analytical models. Geographers, geologists and econometricians,
among others, have used a variety of statistical techniques for measuring
spatial association. This research project will add a more powerful tool for the
analysis of spatial distributions, because of its direct application at a
variety of spatial scales. Integration of the G statistics into geographical
information systems will permit more rigorous analysis of spatial distributions
at different levels of spatial aggregation, thus extending their utility to many
different problems.
