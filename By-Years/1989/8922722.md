This summer FASEB conference on Folate, Vitamin B12 and One- Carbon Metabolism
is held every two years; this year it will be held at Saxtons River on 7/29 -
8/3/90. There have been exciting new developments in each of the nine areas to
be discussed at the conference. Previously unrecognized roles of folates and
folate analogs have been delineated, as have previously unrecognized roles for
non-cobalamin corrinoids, cobalomins and particular intermediates in one carbon
metabolism. New discoveries in intermediary one carbon metabolism in anaerobes,
particularly steps involving folate and B12, have altered the field. New
knowledge has emerged on the nature of the involvement of folate and corrinoids
in the integrity of the nervous system; on the role of vitamin transport,
delivery, and storage proteins in mediating folate and cobalamin metabolism; and
on the roles of these vitamins in mediating the production of their delivery
proteins and receptor proteins. Cloning of the genes for these proteins is
playing an important role.
