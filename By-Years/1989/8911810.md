The upper Oligocene to Miocene section of the U.S. middle Atlantic is ideally
suited for the study of changes in relative sea level recorded in passive margin
sediments. This award supports a high-resolution multichannel and single channel
seismic study of the upper Oligocene to Miocene section along the middle
Atlantic continental shelf and slope. These seismic data will be integrated with
biostratigraphic and Sr-isotope stratigraphic studies of coastal plain outcrops,
slope canyon outcrops, wells, and boreholes. The objective will be to determine
the geometry and age of Oligocene to Miocene depositional sequences, and to
evaluate the role of relative sea- level changes in developing this record. We
will evaluate possible causal links between ice-volume (glacio-eustatic) changes
inferred from the deep sea 8180 record and depositional sequences dating from
this Oligocene to Miocene "ice house world" will be evaluated. This project will
provide the data base needed to plan a continental shelf to slope drilling
program that will define precisely the age of these depositional sequences and
test models of sedimentation and relative sea-level changes.
