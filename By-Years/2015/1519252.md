The proposal requests travel, housing funding and conference registration for
US-based doctoral students selected to participate in the Doctoral Consortium
(DC). The DC is co-located with The 25th International Conference on Automated
Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), which will be held in Jerusalem in May 4-8,
2015. ICAPS is the main international conference on automated planning. The
ICAPS DC aims at broadening the participating of US-based PhD students into the
planning area as well as improving the retention of these students.
