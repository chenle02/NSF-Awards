This research consists of two related projects. The first is a theoretical and
empirical investigation of the connection between investment flow, employment
growth, and productivity growth at the plant level, as well as the consequent
aggregate implications. This research will include the development of
theoretical models and an empirical evaluation of the resulting propositions
using the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Important issues to be
investigated include: the relevance of non-convexities in the capital and labor
adjustment process, the connection between these factor flows and productivity
growth and associated aggregate i implications. The second topic analyzes
financial markets and the flow of inputs across plant sits. The theme here is
that the financial markets facilitate the flow of capital across production
units due to differences in productivity at the various sites. Theoretical
models stressing the implications of plant and sector specific shocks will be
analyzed under alternative assumptions about the structure of factor and
financial markets. The LRD will then be used to evaluate implications of the
models developed under these alternative hypotheses.
