Dr. Giovanetti and his undergraduate students from James Madison University
(JMU) are participating in the construction, and ultimately the usage, of the
CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at the newly operating Continuous
Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) in Newport News, VA. Presently the
group is constructing and testing a system to monitor the gains of a major
detector system for CLAS (&gt;1000 photomultiplier tubes). The CLAS detector
should begin to operate next year, and the JMU group will participate in
experiments to study the quark gluon structure of baryons. This program provides
excellent opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in forefront
research. The close proximity of JMU to CEBAF also provides the students rather
extensive involvement in the research by permitting a number of visits to the
lab in a cost effective manner.
