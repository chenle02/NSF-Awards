This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the critical
substrate issue in the development of ZnSSe blue-green LEDs and Lasers.
Recently, there has been much interest in the research and development of blue-
green LEDs and laser diodes due to the tremendous market potential for their
applications in displays, electronics, communications and information storage.
Among all the semiconductors, ZnSe based semiconductors are one of the prime
candidates for the fabrication of blue-green lasers. Although ZnSe based LEDs
and laser diodes have recently been produced, their lifetime has been a critical
issue. One of the major causes of the insufficient lifetime is the lack of
device quality ZnSe substrates. After analyzing past and current ZnSe crystal
growth techniques and II-V1 semiconductor compound defect chemistry, Fermionics
Corporation proposes an innovative method to grow ZnSe crystals at low
temperatures. They plan to not only grow ZnSe single crystals, but also produce
crystals with the lowest crystalline defects. In addition, they will study the
feasibility of producing high conductivity p-type ZnSe by in situ impurity
doping. In Phase I, the feasibility of growing high quality ZnSe single crystal
will be demonstrated. In Phase II, large ZnSe crystals will be produced, and
ZnSSe LEDs and laser diodes will be fabricated. Finally, in Phase III, these
products will be commercialized.
