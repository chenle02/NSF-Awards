Paterson will investigate the long-standing problem of higher dimensional
cohomology for operator algebras, and clarify the difference between amenability
and strong amenability for C*- algebras. He will also study amenable C*-algebras
in terms of complete boundedness, and investigate the role of amenable
foliations in understanding the C*-algebras associated with groups. This work
will be based on the recently discovered equivalence of amenability of
C*-algebras and the existence of a right invariant mean on a certain space of
functions on its unitary group. The general area of mathematics of this project
has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators
can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special
types of operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally called an
operator algebra. These abstract objects have a surprising variety of
applications. For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is
currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental
importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming increasingly important
in physics.
