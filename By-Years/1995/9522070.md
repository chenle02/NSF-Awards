This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota acquire upgrades for
three existing liquids NMR spectrometers that will be used in research
investigations in the following areas of chemistry: organic chemistry (natural
products synthesis, development of synthetic methodology, drug design, and
chiral catalysts), inorganic chemistry (organometallic chemistry, metal
clusters, and bioinorganic chemistry), and biological chemistry (oligopeptide
structure, methods for oligosaccharide sequencing, metalloprotein structure, and
protein-DNA/RNA interactions). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
