This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will investigate ways to determine the sequence of
fundamental building blocks of small proteins using a variant of mass
spectrometry. Potential applications include diagnosis of some genetic diseases,
and monitoring of metabolic irregularities. %%% Research, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will use
laser desorption mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation to study
the fragmentation of vaporized peptides. Fourier Transform mass spectrometry
will allow many sequential collision/measurement cycles, so that one may step-
wise decompose the peptides. Both atomic and molecular collision species will be
tested.
