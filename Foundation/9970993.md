9970993 Hamkins Professor Hamkins will continue his research on the
indestructibility phenomena of large cardinals. This work, lying at the common
focus of two broad set-theoretic research efforts, namely, forcing and large
cardinals, seems particularly promising in light of the recent advances that
have emerged from his earlier work with gap forcing and the lottery preparation.
Specifically, Professor Hamkins will investigate a series of open questions
concerning the extent to which indestructibility is possible with various kinds
of large cardinals, with a particular focus on the strongly compact cardinals.
In addition to this work, he will continue his work on two other projects, the
automorphism tower problem and the new theory of infinite time Turing machines,
a model of infinitary computation. Professor Hamkins' research involves the
study of the sublime, inaccessible notions of mathematical infinity, which have
fascinated mathematicians for centuries. In the twentieth century, particularly
in the past thirty years, set theorists have gained a profound understanding of
the largest of these transfinite numbers, large cardinals. Professor Hamkins has
been particularly interested in how large cardinals are affected by forcing, the
technique invented by Paul Cohen by which set theorists have had glimpses into
alternative mathematical universes and realized the rich diversity of
mathematical possibility. Much of his work therefore lies in the common focus of
two major set-theoretic research efforts, namely, forcing and large cardinals.
He will endeavor to investigate the curious indestructibility phenomena of these
cardinals, by which their largeness survives in a wide variety of mathematical
universes. ***
