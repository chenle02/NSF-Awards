ECS-9712923 Kumar Over the past fifty years a meticulous theory of systems and
control has been developed. During this time researchers have delved into and
employed tools from many branches of mathematics, from algebraic geometry to
martingales. The result is well founded mathematical system and control theory.
The rich vocabulary of concepts developed by systems and control researchers
integrating dynamics, stability, optimization, uncertainty and information - has
the potential to pay rich dividends if it is further nourished carefully and
properly harnessed. Thus we are at an exciting time which is opportune for a
"Workshop on Future Directions in Systems and Control." Systems and control
researchers with to key qualifications - accomplishment as well as vision - have
been invited. They have been instructed to present their work, which is well
motivated technologically, based on a system theoretic foundation, and has and
extrapolation which is inspiring. The collection of these strands of excellence
will inspire the collective by example, and serve as a catalyst for future
directions.
