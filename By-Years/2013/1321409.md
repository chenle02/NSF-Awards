A planning workshop is proposed whose first day is focussed on defining the
needs in the Polymer Science curriculum in the 21st century and establishing a
network of polymer science faculty to advance the curriculum. Strategies will
also be considered for engaging high school students with research-based polymer
experiments . On the day following the workshop, and as a prelude to student
reseach presentations, faculty attendees will deliver a session to
undergraduates designed to help them better understand and explore research
presentations and publications.
