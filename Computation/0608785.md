This is a research project in Computational Mathematics. Our goal is to use new
algebraic ideas for the development of algorithms to solve discrete optimization
problems. Discrete optimization is the study of optimization problems in which
there are a finite (but usually very large) number of potential solutions. These
are not enumerated but rather defined implicitly by equation or inequality
constraints, e.g., linear or nonlinear relations. We focus in non-linear integer
programs with polynomial constraints which are notoriously difficult and we
explore several non-traditional tools for solving them, including multivariate
rational functions and complex analysis, polynomial Hilbert's Nullstellensatz
certificates, and new canonical reformulations for integer linear programs. We
are also interested on closely related problems in computational convexity.
Including the computation of polyhedra related to optimization, the practical
approximation of regions by unions of polyhedra and the solution of geometric
problems using convex programming methods.

Software and algorithms for solving discrete optimization problems has
potential applications to many fields of huge practical importance, such as data
mining, finances and economics, transport scheduling (e.g. crew scheduling
problems), and circuit design. Examples of discrete optimization problems
include the minimum spanning tree problem of selecting the least expensive
network connecting given sites or the traveling salesman problem (TSP) consists
of selecting the least expensive tour of a given set of locations. Since most
discrete optimization problems are useful but very difficult to solve,
researchers have explored special structures to be able to solve them in
practice (e.g., in the case of the TSP) or settle for algorithms that compute
near-optimal solutions. In our project we try non-traditional tools based on
recent mathematical progress as a way to approach these very difficult problems.
We also have a strong educational component for this project. Several graduate
and undergraduate students will all play important roles in the project's
development.
