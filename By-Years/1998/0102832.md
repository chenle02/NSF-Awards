Two institutions in Miami, Florida International University (FIU) and Fairchild
Tropical Garden (FTG), plan a multidisciplinary, two-year program to mentor 27
upper-level students in tropical environmental biology. The program involves 13
FIU faculty and an education specialist from FTG. The immediate objective of the
program is for students to develop careers in biological sciences relating to
the environment. To achieve this objective the PIs will direct a mentoring
program on the natural history, marine and terrestrial environments, and
conservation biology of the Caribbean region. To attract high-quality students,
the program will provide: stipends, three new upper-level courses, field courses
(in the Bahamas and Panama), Florida field trips, laboratory rotations, research
supplies, travel to a professional meeting, and career orientation activities.
Mentors will offer academic, research and career advice. Each student will
produce and present a research project. The program will have internal and
external evaluations by a steering committee, two outside evaluators and an
advisory committee.

FIU is one of the leading U.S. research universities in recruiting students from
groups that are under-represented in science (71% are African American or
Hispanic). In the long term, this program will produce well trained
environmental biologists who will have a positive impact on the conservation of
fragile environments of the Caribbean - South Florida region.
