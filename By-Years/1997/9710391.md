Abstract ATM-9710391 Lorenz, Edward Massachusetts Institute of Technology Title:
Predictability of the Atmosphere and Other Systems at Longer Ranges This
proposal is to continue investigations into the fundamental aspects of
predictability of the atmosphere and other complex non- linear dynamical systems
at longer ranges. This will be done by taking recourse to simple forced, non-
linear, dissipative, dynamical system equations as before. Some of the scales
are undoubtedly more predictable than the others in some systems and the PI will
examine this property and the conditions under which such predictability exists
at longer ranges. This research will certainly shed new light on predictability
problem and may reinvigorate national effort in exploiting the predictability of
certain features in the highly complex climate system.
