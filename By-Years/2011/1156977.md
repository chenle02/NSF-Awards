This funding renews a successful CISE Research Experiences
for&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Texas at
Dallas.&lt;br/&gt;This site focuses on Software Engineering research related
to&lt;br/&gt;Software Safety. Students will evaluate the strengths
and&lt;br/&gt;weakness of existing methodologies and current practices
for&lt;br/&gt;safety assurance, as well as investigating issues such as
how&lt;br/&gt;the introduction of software safety requirements may
affect&lt;br/&gt;the software lifecycle and how software processes,
methods&lt;br/&gt;and tool support should be adjusted. In addition to
research,&lt;br/&gt;students will take field trips to industrial partners and
attend&lt;br/&gt;mentoring workshops on technical writing and oral
presentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will allow students, especially
those from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups or universities with limited
research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities, to experience cutting-edge research in
software&lt;br/&gt;safety --- critical to the prevention of catastrophic
accidents&lt;br/&gt;and safe operation of software-dependent systems. It will
also&lt;br/&gt;encourage these students to continue into graduate programs
and&lt;br/&gt;careers in science and technology research. Students will
gain&lt;br/&gt;proficiency in a broadly applicable skill set including
oral&lt;br/&gt;and written communication, research methods, critical
thinking,&lt;br/&gt;and problem solving.
