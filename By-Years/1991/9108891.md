The objective of this RIA research is to improve the elevated temperature
fracture resistance of alumina ceramics by adding various amounts of glass-
forming silica to the composition. It is expected that the glassy phase will aid
in crack bridging at elevated temperature and thereby improve toughness. A
detailed study of elevated temperature fatigue and creep crack growth will be
made and the results correlated with microstructure and composition in order to
identify the governing mechanisms.
