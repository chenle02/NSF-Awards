9508645 Colucci The purpose of this research is the explore the feasibility of
applying current ensemble weather forecast methodologies to predicting the
sensible surface weather for forecasts of 0-2 days (i.e., short-range ensemble
forecasting, or SREF). The primary research goal is to characterize if and when
the existing perturbation methodology may be used for SREF. The principal
datasets to be employed in the study are produced routinely by the National
Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The usefulness of the ensembles will
be judged by comparisons of the 80 km eta model ensemble output with the single-
run, high resolution (29 km) eta regional model forecasts and Model Output
Statistics (MOS) from the Nested Grid Model (NGM). The focus will be on
determining under what conditions the use of current methodologies is effective
and when other methodologies might be employed instead. This award provides
support for a doctoral research project that also has considerable potential for
improving operational short-term forecasting. ??
