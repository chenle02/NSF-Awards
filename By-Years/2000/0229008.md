AST-0229008&lt;br/&gt; T. G.
Phillips&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory employs a precision 10.4-meter-diameter telescope operating within a
dome to observe the sky at submillimeter wavelengths. This award will continue
funding for the next three years for observatory operations, staff and student
support, and for instrumentation development. Areas of research will include
studies of molecular gas and dust in distant primeval galaxies, large-scale
imaging of star-forming clouds using powerful new bolometer cameras, and
observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in a large sample of distant galaxy
clusters. Instrumentation will be developed to increase overall system
sensitivity and mapping speed. The CSO trains many undergraduate students,
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, in both observational science and
instrumentation development. A considerable fraction of telescope time is
allocated to students, both at Caltech and at other institutions; overall, more
than 50% of telescope usage is by astronomers from outside of Caltech. The CSO
is noteworthy for its pioneering research in astronomical receiver technology,
which is used at many other observatories both national and worldwide.
