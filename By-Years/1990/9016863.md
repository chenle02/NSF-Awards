This project is supported under NSF Announcement No. 90-23, "Repair and
Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of Structures." The two primary
goals of this research project are the evaluation of: 1) the lateral strength
and drift capabilities of older reinforced concrete slab-column frame buildings
and 2) the use of ductile steel bracing for seismic upgrading of such
structures. This research is intended to contribute to a methodology for
evaluating the lateral strength and deformation capacity of older slab-column
concrete frame structures which are located in regions of potentially high
seismic activity, but were not designed and detailed for significant lateral
strength and ductility. This will be achieved by conducting laboratory tests of
a 2 bay by 1 bay 2-story reinforced concrete slab- column frame specimen. Design
criteria will be developed for strengthening such structures with ductile steel
bracing members. These tests should make a significant contribution to the small
amount of information now available on the lateral load behavior of concrete
frame structures strengthened with steel bracing members.
