PI John Shareshian studies problems in combinatorics that arise in or have
consequences for other fields of mathematics. Combinatorics is the study of
discrete, typically finite, mathematical structures. Such structures arise often
in mathematics and the natural and social sciences, leading to various
applications. For example, networks of various types are modeled by
combinatorialists as graphs, which are simply collections of points, some pairs
of which are considered to be related. Despite the simplicity of such models,
mathematicians have derived many deep and applicable theorems about them.
Perhaps surprisingly, there are close connections between combinatorics and
other fields of mathematics in which non-discrete objects are studied, including
topology and geometry. The work of PI Shareshian involves the close study of
such connections, with the aim of solving problems about both discrete and non-
discrete structures.

PI Shareshian studies connections between combinatorics and other fields of
mathematics, including algebra, topology, and geometry. In joint work with
Michelle Wachs, he aims to prove that the graded Frobenius characteristic of a
refined version of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function for a unit interval
graph is in fact the cohomology of an associated regular semisimple Hessenberg
variety, and to use such a result to attack a longstanding conjecture of Stanley
and Stembridge about such symmetric functions. Shareshian studies connections
between the structure algebraic objects and the combinatorial structure of
lattices naturally associated to such objects. For example, he aims to provide a
result on Lie algebras roughly analogous to his earlier result that a finite
group is solvable if and only if the order complex of its subgroup lattice is
shellable.
