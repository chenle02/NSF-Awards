Multiprocessor systems use synchronization primitives to coordinate
the&lt;br/&gt;activities of multiple threads of control. Spin locks in
particular are&lt;br/&gt;widely used in multiprocessor operating systems and in
scientific&lt;br/&gt;appliactions. With the proliferation of multiprocessor
servers, these&lt;br/&gt;locks have come to be widely used in commercial
applications as well.&lt;br/&gt;The multiprogrammed nature of server workloads,
however, requires that&lt;br/&gt;threads be able to "time out" and abandon an
attempt to acquire a lock.&lt;br/&gt;Timeout is easy on small machines, which
can use traditional&lt;br/&gt;"test-and-set" spin locks, but these locks do not
scale to large&lt;br/&gt;machines. The principal alternative--scheduler-based
locks such as&lt;br/&gt;those provided by Java--has also proven to be
prohibitively expensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to
address the cost of user-level&lt;br/&gt;synchronization in multiprocessor
servers by means of two principal&lt;br/&gt;techniques: (1) the incorporation of
timeout in scalable queue-based&lt;br/&gt;locks, and (2) the development of
practical mechanisms for the&lt;br/&gt;construction of lock-free data
structures. These techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;evaluated with respect to each
other and to existing techniques, and&lt;br/&gt;will be incorporated into
threaded run-time systems such as the Java&lt;br/&gt;Virtual Machine.
