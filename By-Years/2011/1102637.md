The Center for Sustainable Materials Chemistry will focus on fundamental aspects
of the aqueous chemistry of inorganic nanoclusters and their transformation to
solids. It will explore new approaches to synthesizing inorganic clusters and
how to tune their reactivity by coupling theory with experiment. It will prepare
from the clusters dense and porous thin solid films with minimum energy input
and unprecedented control, emphasizing the so-called green elements in the
periodic table. The chemical transformations leading to these high-quality films
will be investigated with various techniques offering near-atomic resolution
capabilities. By applying the film chemistry to lamination, the center will
study and tune reactions -neutralization, metathesis, interdiffusion, and redox
- providing insights on basic chemistry processes involving these materials. By
pushing the film chemistry to ultra-thin limits (< 1 nm), the center will open
new opportunities to synthesize targeted compositions and structures Beyond the
Molecular Frontier. This research holds promise of transforming current
technologies to produce high performance materials at dimensions < 10 nm with
potential broad applications from electronic device fabrication to optical
coatings and use in energy storage materials and applications using
environmentally benign methods.

The center is committed to education at all levels. Graduate students and
postdoctoral associates will have access to professional development
opportunities in entrepreneurship, teaching, immersion courses, and public
communication. A pilot effort to a high school with a diverse population will
promote learning through a graduate-student-in-residence program. It will
develop a web-based public outreach initiative and accompany this with outreach
events across Oregon to build awareness of how chemistry research contributes to
a healthy economy and societal well-being. Activities of the center in these
areas as well as its science initiatives will be monitored by an external
advisory board and evaluation consultants.

The Center for Sustainable Materials Chemistry is funded as part of the Centers
for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.
