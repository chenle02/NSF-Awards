94180730 Fall Research conducted with earlier grants has resulted in the
discovery of major fluxes of methanol and other volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) from vegetation to the atmosphere. It is now proposed to use sensitive
and specific enzyme/fluorescence methods to measure the emission of methanol and
other oxygenated hydrocarbons containing one carbon from major forest tree
species and crops, and establish the role of leaf bacteria as sinks for these
compounds. The data obtained will be used to develop emission algorithms that
will be validated in field experiments and in the future might be used as the
basis of a US emissions inventory of biogenic C1-oxHCs. Plant C1-oxHC fluxes to
the atmosphere may be very large, both regionally and globally, with long range
transport of methanol and a variety of impacts on atmospheric chemistry.
Currently there are large uncertainties in these flux estimates. This project
will contribute to a more complete picture of the biogeochemical cycling of
methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid between the biosphere and atmosphere,
and help establish knowledge of natural sources and sinks of these C1 compounds.
The specific goals of the proposed work are: (1) to perfect enzymatic and
fluorescence methods for analyzing methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid
emissions from vegetation; (2) to define the "drivers" of plant C1-oxHC
emissions and collect a large data set of oxHC fluxes in laboratory and
greenhouse experiments; (3) develop emission algorithms for biogenic C1-oxHCs;
(4) to establish the role of leaf bacteria as sources and/or sinks of
atmospheric C1-oxHCs; (5) and to validate laboratory emissions algorithms by
appropriate field measurements of C1-oxHC fluxes.
