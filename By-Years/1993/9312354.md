9312354 Schwenz This project connects the west campus of the University of
Northern Colorado to NSFNET. The connection is through the main campus of the
University, which already reaches NSFNET through Colorado Supernet. Faculty and
students at the west campus will benefit from access to the resources of the
Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able
to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit
of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the
project for one year. ***
