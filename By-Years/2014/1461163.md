The goal of this project is to establish a multi-institution research experience
for undergraduate students (REU) in the mathematical biosciences, facilitated by
the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) at The Ohio State University. The
objectives of the program are: (1) to introduce undergraduate students at all
levels to the field of mathematical biology; (2) to encourage students to pursue
graduate study in the mathematical biosciences; and (3) to increase the number
of students who enter the workforce with training in this field. Students will
work on applying mathematics and statistics to research in areas such as
molecular evolution, neuronal patterns, cancer modeling, epidemic models and
vaccination strategies, and models of sensory systems, such as vision and smell.
The infrastructure provided by the MBI gives the necessary resources to
accomplish these goals by providing both an authentic research experience as
well as exposure to the field of mathematical biology
broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program consists of three components. The
first is a week-long Overview of Mathematical Biosciences, which consists of
lectures by experts in the field, laboratory tours and field trips, and computer
exercises using the Matlab software. This is held at the MBI in Columbus, OH
annually in the second week of June. Following completion of the one-week
overview session, the students will travel to one of MBI's Institute Partners to
participate in an 8-week mentored research experience at the host institution.
Finally, the participants will join other students doing research in the
mathematical biosciences and present their results at a Capstone Conference
hosted by the MBI. Throughout the program, a cohort will be maintained by weekly
virtual seminars and discussions among participating institutions. They will
work in pairs under the guidance of one or more mentors to make genuine research
contributions in these areas, often leading to publications in peer-reviewed
journals and presentations at conferences. The student participants will develop
skills needed to continue work in these areas and to pursue graduate study.
Their involvement in this research will expand the group of students trained to
work in the field of mathematical biology.
