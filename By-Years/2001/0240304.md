This pilot research will develop a web-based survey on questionable research
practices and test it on faculty and students at two universities. Besides
providing a preliminary test and assessment of this web-based technique, the
pilot begins to examine the role of differential association in the diffusion of
research misconduct and other questionable research practices. The pilot project
design allows the investigators to address core methodological issues regarding
the web-based survey and the randomized response technique with skip patterns,
as well as the core substantive issue regarding differential association
(contagion). The pilot sample size will allow a peer-reviewed publication on the
methodological issues: web-based survey or randomized response technique. On the
substantive issue, the sample size may allow pilot analyses, depending on
exposure rates, although generalizability will be limited. If the pilot is
successful, it would provide the basis for a full-scale project to test the role
of differential association in research misconduct and other questionable
practices, as well as roles of ethical climate and neutralization in moderating
its effects.
