Human colonization of the Americas has been an important and controversial
issue. This is particularly true with regard to the Clovis expansion shortly
before 11,000 years ago. New dates suggest that one large mammal, the moose,
followed the same route as humans from Siberia into Alaska. Since human bones
have never been found in either region from this time period, the presence of
large numbers of moose bones offers an opportunity to analyze the timing and
ecological limits of these co-travellers. Sixty radiocarbon dates from
northeastern Siberia, Alaska and the Yukon will provide an indirect indicator of
the extent of the woodland environments and human/moose co-expansion into the
New World.
