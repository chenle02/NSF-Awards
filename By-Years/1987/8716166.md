In regions of copious precipitation, the wet deposition is the primary
mechanism in removing trace gas constituents and aerosol particles from the
atmosphere. Most of the world's precipitation falls to the ground as rain,
although the clouds themselves frequently have temperatures below freezing. The
ice crystals play an important role in the cloud development; however, their
role in scavenging is not well known. Under this research project, Professor
Lamb will conduct laboratory experiments on the adsorption of gas on the surface
of ice crystals, the entrapment of gases in rime ice, and the inhibition of
secondary ice splinter production by ammonium. The results should give us a
better understanding of the interaction between ice crystals and chemical
species in clouds, and thereby improve the modeling of scavenging in cloud
models.
