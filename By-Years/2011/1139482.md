The Network Science project is a three year ITEST strategies project designed to
engage 120 disadvantaged high school students (grades 10-11) and up to 30 high
school STEM teachers from Boston and New York urban schools in a network science
research based program, using cutting edge computer modeling research
technology. Working with graduate student mentors, Network Science students and
teachers will: (a) learn about the emerging discipline of network science, (b)
construct and analyze science networks using computations and data
visualizations, (c) use networks to solve problems across STEM domains (e.g.,
energy, communications, and diseases) through collaborative research projects
and integrated technology, and (d) present their research at an annual Network
Science research conference. Three cohorts of students and teachers will
participate in a two week residential summer camp at Boston University, an
intensive summer research experience (4 weeks), an academic yearlong program
(continued research, industry lab tours, workshops, virtual visits), and an
annual Network Science Research conference. Student participants will also
receive internship opportunities by industry partners after the culminating
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boston University and the New York Hall of
Science will work collaboratively to implement all phases of the project.
Advisors from ten partner research laboratories will play an integral role in
the development and implementation of the program. In addition, formative and
summative evaluations will be conducted using a mixed method approach by an
experienced external evaluator. The ultimate goal of the project is to attract
disadvantaged youth to careers in IT and STEM through positive IT research
experiences, internships and mentoring.
