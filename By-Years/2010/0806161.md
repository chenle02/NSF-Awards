The Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP) science goals are to
validate and improve Arctic Ocean models in a coordinated fashion and
investigate variability of the Arctic Ocean and sea ice at seasonal to decadal
time scales, and identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. The
project?s practical goals are to maintain and enhance the established AOMIP
international collaboration to reduce uncertainties in model predictions (model
validation and improvements via coordinated experiments and studies); support
synthesis across the suite of Arctic models; organize scientific meetings and
workshops; conduct collaboration with other MIPs with a special focus on model
improvements and analysis; disseminate findings of AOMIP effort to broader
communities; and train a new generation of ocean and sea-ice modelers.

The major AOMIP activities will include synthesis (to identify consistent errors
across models, propose solutions, and find the most suitable and reliable
coupled ice ? ocean models for use in fully coupled regional and global climate
models) and process studies (to improve models, investigate processes using
model results and observations. In particular, AOMIP will focus on how to better
model the arctic halocline which creates the stratification necessary to
insulate perennial sea ice from the Atlantic Water layer, how to avoid restoring
and flux correction, and the role of different mechanisms influencing heat
fluxes in the ocean - sea-ice - atmosphere system. Investigation will continue
of the tidal role in arctic climate, parameterization of stress-driven and
convection-driven mixing and the role of small meso- and large-scale turbulence
(eddies and gyres).
