This research project is jointly supported by NSF in the US and EPSRC in the UK.
The PIs, one in the US and the other in UK, will work on questions at the
interface of graph theory and theoretical computer science. The line of inquiry
that guides this research project is the following: what is the global
difference between general graphs and graphs that do not contain particular
configurations (known as an induced subgraphs)? This is a fundamental question
and the mathematical understanding of it is very limited. The project will study
the impact of the absence of those configurations on algorithmic properties of
the graph: what questions (that are known to be difficult in general) become
tractable if we are given this kind of additional information about the input?
This project will also provide graduate student training both in the US and
UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years significant progress has been made in
the theoretical computer science community toward designing methods that address
NP-complete problems in graph theory when certain restrictions are placed on the
input. These are beautiful and powerful results that have significantly deepened
the understanding of the limits of efficient algorithms. This project aims to
combine the power of structural graph theory with these recent developments and
apply them to several longstanding open questions. The project will study the
impact of excluding an induced subgraph on the complexity of such well-known
algorithmic tasks as finding the chromatic number, the stability number, and the
clique number of a graph (as well as their weighted analogues). Progress on any
of these aspects will advance the understanding of the structure of families of
graphs defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, contribute to answering important
open questions, and have significant algorithmic
consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
