Plant cell walls play crucial roles in the development of plants, their
resistance to diseases, and communication between cells. A fundamental
understanding of cell wall biosynthesis has potential practical applications,
including the development of crops plants better able to fend off pathogens and
of plants that provide enhanced nutritional attributes or new polymer products
for various industrial uses. This project is aimed at understanding how
hemicellulosic polysaccharides, a particular class of polymers found in plant
cell walls, are synthesized. Cell wall biosynthesis requires hundreds of
enzymes, but only a few of these proteins and the genes that encode them have
been identified and characterized. Through strategies employing the tools of
genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, the principal investigators will
identify candidate genes involved in the synthesis of plant cell walls and
evaluate their function. The studies will be conducted in three plant systems:
cotton fiber cells during a period of development in which large quantities of
primary cell wall components are manufactured; developing nasturtium seeds that
store large quantities of xyloglucan, a major cell wall component; and rice
tissues undergoing rapid growth. Rice is chosen as one of the plant systems
because the recent completion of the rice genome sequence will aid in matching
the proteins linked to cell wall biosynthesis with their respective gene
sequences. The principal investigators expect to identify genes involved in many
aspects of cell wall biosynthesis and will make their results and resources
freely available to researchers in the plant biology community. The project will
provide valuable training for undergraduates, graduate students, and
postdoctoral research associates. It will also provide summer laboratory
experiences for underrepresented students.
