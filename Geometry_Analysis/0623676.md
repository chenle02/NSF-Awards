This proposal requests funding for the organization of the conference
"Riemannian Topology and Geometric Structures on Manifolds," to be held at the
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, Oct. 10-14, 2006. The objective of this
meeting is to provide a forum for the discussion of recent advances in the areas
of positive sectional curvature, Kaehler and Sasakian geometry, and their
interrelation to mathematical physics, especially M and Superstring theory. We
intend to create and provide a platform for the discussion of these fundamental
ideas, the growth they have experienced in the recent past, and the open
problems of interest.

The conference plans to unite a range of worldwide experts, members of the local
group at UNM, and graduate students and young mathematicians from across the
country and beyond, to create an interactive environment for the discussion and
understanding of advances in these various branches of mathematics and
theoretical physics, for the firm grasp of their many recent results, and for
the discussion of plaussible approaches to attack a number of interesting open
questions. Strong effort is to be made to encourage the participation of
mathematicians from all over the nation, and in particular those belonging to
the large minority population of the Rocky mountain area. The impact of this
activity is expected to be made long lasting by the prompt dissemination of its
results, presenting the scientific community with the Proceedings of the
conference shortly after its completion.
