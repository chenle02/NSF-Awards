The objective of this project is to support the direct expenses of young
faculty, postdocs&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students from the US for their
participation in the International School on Physics&lt;br/&gt;of Indirect
Excitons that will take place on July 26 - August 1, 2014, in the Ettore
Majorana&lt;br/&gt;Center, Erice, Italy. We propose supporting about five or six
junior scientists, graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, and postdocs from US
institutions. This International School is an excellent
opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for junior scientists from the US to learn about world-
class research.
