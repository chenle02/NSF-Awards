Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Modern supercomputers are complex, hierarchical systems
&lt;br/&gt;consisting of huge numbers of cores, systems for disk storage,
&lt;br/&gt;and nodes for I/O forwarding. These numbers continue to grow and
&lt;br/&gt;the need for tools to understand the behavior of the system
&lt;br/&gt;software becomes paramount: without these tools it is impossible
&lt;br/&gt;to effectively tune that software, and high degrees of efficiency
&lt;br/&gt;is unattainable by applications. This project addresses the
&lt;br/&gt;challenge of understanding the behavior of complex system
&lt;br/&gt;software on very large-scale compute platforms, like the current
&lt;br/&gt;petascale computers. In particular, this project is developing
&lt;br/&gt;software infrastructure to provide end-to-end analysis and
&lt;br/&gt;visualization of I/O system software. Specifically, the
&lt;br/&gt;objectives are to develop, improve, and deploy (1) end-to-end,
&lt;br/&gt;scalable tracing integrated into the I/O system (MPI-IO, I/O
&lt;br/&gt;forwarding, and file system); (2) information visualization tools
&lt;br/&gt;for inspecting traces and extracting knowledge; (3) testing
&lt;br/&gt;components that drive this system to generate example patterns,
&lt;br/&gt;including a component to generate anomalies; and (4) tutorials
&lt;br/&gt;and tools for helping other system software developers
&lt;br/&gt;incorporate this analysis and visualization system into their
&lt;br/&gt;production software. The software and techniques developed in
&lt;br/&gt;this project will be directly applicable to and useful in other
&lt;br/&gt;system software libraries which perform complex interactions on
&lt;br/&gt;large systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the
