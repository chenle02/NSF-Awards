9422817 JAROSZ Although considerable attention has been given to globalization
of manufacturing industries, dramatic changes also have transformed agricultural
enterprises. Global food productive systems now are characterized by vertical
and horizontal integration of multinational corporations and by capital- and
labor-intensive production, processing, and distribution networks. This Research
Planning Grant will enable a productive female investigator to continue
development of an international comparative research project. This project will
explore how changing divisions of labor in the apple industries of the U.S.,
France, and South Africa have evolved over recent decades as industries in all
of these regions have become competitors for Asian and European markets. The
research will rely on historical and archival research as well as focus groups
and interviews with owners, operators, and workers in different facets of the
industry. This award will facilitate refinement of research plans in South
Africa and Washington state. This award will continue the development of a
research project with great potential. The project will compare the ways that
changing divisions of labor among different class, ethnic, and gender groups are
related to globalization of agricultural industries in different regions.
Through these analyses, more complete understandings will result of the
opportunities and constraints facing each of the regions as they try to develop
socially and environmentally sustainable agricultural systems that are
economically competitive in global markets.
