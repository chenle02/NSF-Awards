We will study applications of Index Theory and Coarse Geometry to orbifolds and
Z_k-manifolds. In particular we will carry out a preliminary investigation of
the following two questions (1) Index Theory on complete orbifolds and Z_k
manifolds (2) E-theoretical Index Theory for orbifolds and Z_k-manifolds
