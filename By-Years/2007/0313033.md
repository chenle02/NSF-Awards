The Java programming language made writing multi-threaded programs a mainstream
activity. Subtle issues arise in how to compile these multi-threaded programs so
that common compiler optimizations are allowed while simultaneously ensuring
that actions in one thread are viewed by other threads as occurring in a legal
order, i.e. one that follows the programming language consistency model. Because
previous languages either did not define a memory model or were not widely used,
and because multi-threaded programming was done by a small number of experts,
the trade-offs between memory model ease-of-use and the ease of compilation were
not extensively investigated. In this project, we are building a compiler that
will accept as input a programming language memory model definition, a hardware
consistency model definition, and an application program. The compiler will then
optimize the application program while abiding by the constraints of both the
memory and consistency model, allowing the trade-offs between ease of use and
compilation to be studied. It will also allow new memory models to be
investigated, which will lead to the design of easier to use languages that can
be effectively compiled, and used to produce more robust, safer software.
