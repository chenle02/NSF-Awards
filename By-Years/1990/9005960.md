Professors Thomas Hayden and Judith Shelling are jointly supported by a grant
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, the Applied
Mathematics Program, and the Division of Instrumentation and Resources to
develop new approaches to the determination of macromolecular structure in
solution through the use of 2-D NMR and distance geometry. This research will
provide important new insights into biological structural problems. Professors
Hayden and Shelling will develop improved computational algorithms for finding
the coordinates of points in Euclidean space that generate distances which
approximate those found experimentally from NMR spectroscopy. Recent advances in
the theory and geometry of distance matrices have resulted in efficient
algorithms for solving this problem. Additional algorithms based on these
theoretical results will be investigated, and these algorithms will then be
applied to the determination of conformations of molecules of biological
interest.
