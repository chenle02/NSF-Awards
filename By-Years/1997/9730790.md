Funds are provided for a high-resolution multi-channel seismic survey of
tectonically active area in northwestern Gulf of California. The Gulf of
california is one of the very few accessible areas where the transitional crust
from continent to ocean can be studied in a region of oblique estension. Most
models of the region show a single, simple plate boundary, due to lack of deeper
understanding. Two end-member models are possible: diffuse deformation in a
broad active zone, and localized slip in two separate zones in the northern
Gulf. The key to discriminating between the two models lies in shallow Gulf of
California. The PIs will use the LDEO portable high resolution MCS system on a
Mexican research vessel to obtain seismic reflection profiles of active
tectonics, augmented with sonobuoy refraction profiles, to image the young
faults, transform faults and the spreading center. Modeling will quantify
estimates of kinematics of the current plate motions and strain partitioning and
lead to an understanding of the organization of the strike-slip and rift
segments during transition from a continental to an oceanic system.
