0115882&lt;br/&gt;Scheel&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
Alaska Pacific University will provide support for development of an autonomous
underwater vehicle for study of marine animal behavior. In collaboration with
researchers from University of Arizona and Colorado School of Mines, the team
will develop a remotely-controlled vehicle for following and recording by video
technique the behavior of tagged individuals of the Giant Pacific Octopus,
Enteroctopus dofleini. Once developed and tested, it is expected that this
instrumentation may be applied to behavioral and ecological research on a wide
array of marine organisms, many of which are very difficult for humans to
observe directly in their native habitats. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
