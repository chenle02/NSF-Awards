The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer
(FTIR) to improve intermediate and advanced laboratory instruction and to
enhance undergraduate research capabilities. In the instrumental analysis
course, students study the quantitative capabilities of FTIR spectrometry by
determining the amount of carbon monoxide in automobile exhaust. In the organic
chemistry course, they conduct computer-based spectral searches of an unknown
alcohol, aldehyde or ketone. In the physical chemistry course they observe and
measure isotope and quantum statistical effects in the rotational fine structure
of diatomic and some polyatomic gases. Undergraduate research projects involving
structure determination and the study of complex samples, such as polymers and
films, are also carried out.
