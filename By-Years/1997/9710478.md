9710478 Christensen This grant provides partial support of a technician's salary
for a three year period. The technician will be responsible for the operation
and maintenance of a newly established high pressure- high temperature facility
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This facility incorporates the rock
physics laboratories of Nik Christensen (just starting at Wisconsin after 13
years at Purdue University) and Herb Wang and the hydrothermal labs of Lukas
Baumgartner and Reid Cooper. The research foci of these PI's includes studies of
the seismic properties of geologic materials at lower crustal and upper mantle
pressures and temperatures, investigations of the poroelastic properties of
rocks in the upper crust, studies of the solubilities and thermodynamics of
solid solutions and the behavior of synthetic materials at elevated temperatures
and pressures. More specifically, the technician will directly support these
PI's in a diverse array of research projects including laboratory studies of the
seismic properties of lower crustal rocks from the Sierra Nevada and Basin and
Range provinces, measurement of the solubility of synthetic pelites and studies
of the thermodynamics of olivine solid solutions. ***
