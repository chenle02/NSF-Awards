The 3rd Duke Mathematical Journal Conference will be held at Duke University
Friday, April 23 through Sunday, April 25, 2004. The goal of the conference is
to bring young mathematicians together for a weekend of high quality
mathematics. There will be talks by eight leading young mathematicians on
diverse subject areas which are regularly represented in the journal.

Prior to the Conference, speakers will distribute introductory material related
to their talks via the conference web site. All talks will be videotaped and
made available on the Web, along with the speakers' notes. This will benefit the
participants as well as the broader mathematical community. The conference will
also benefit the mathematical community in the south-eastern US by providing a
high-quality mathematical experience.
