1402846&lt;br/&gt;Cote&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to
develop a transformative low cost, high quality, noninvasive, cellphone-based,
optical polarimetric imaging system for point-of-care applications. The specific
aims are to design, model, build, and test the system and to develop android
based applications for controlling cell phone camera features and perform image
processing. This system will utilize a single lens on-chip white light polarized
imaging to aid in the diagnosis of several diseases through the detection of
variations in the linear states of polarized light as it passes through tissue
or blood sample. There are many conditions that induce changes in polarized
light and the device is meant to assist medical professionals in the clinic and
in low resource settings in the proper diagnosis of these conditions. The
initial applications for developing this device include in vivo diagnosis of
skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), melanoma, and squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and in vitro detection of malaria in the lab or in the field.
