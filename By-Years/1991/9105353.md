The project goals of this research proposal are: 1) to clone and sequence the
cDNAs for the two subunits of wheat germ eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F
(p220 and p26) and the two subunits of its isozyme form, eIF-(iso)4F (p82 and
p28). 2) to identify the m7G cap binding site of p26 and p28 by comparing the
sequences of these polypeptides to each other an to m7G cap binding proteins
from other cells (yeast, mouse, human). In addition, a comparison of the
sequences of p220 and p82 will be made in an effort to identify the ATP binding
site, mRNA binding and RNA helicase domains of these peptides. 3) to clone an
sequence the cDNAs for eIF-4A and eIF-4B, to compare these sequences to those of
obtained from other eukaryotic cells, and to attempt to identify functional
domains. 4) to use the wheat cDNA clones to determine the number, location and
sequence of the genes in Arabidopsis for eIF-4A, eIF-4B and the subunits of
eIF-4F and eIF-iso)4F. 5) to use the wheat cDNA clones for eIF-4A, eIF-4B and
the subunits of eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F to determine the level of expression of
these genes during various stages of plant development. To achieve these goals,
various methods to screen a wheat cDNA expression library will be used.
Antibodies to the initiation factors are available, as well as some knowledge of
peptide sequences which will be used to design oligonucleotide probes. DNA
sequencing, Southern and Northern blot analysis and quantitation of mRNA will be
carried out by established techniques. It is not known what structural features
of eIF-4A, eIF-4B and eIF-4F are important for their function. Completion of
these goals will provide valuable information with regard to the structural
features of these polypeptides that are important for the recognition of the 5'
m7G cap of mRNA, for binding to mRNA, for ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity
and for binding of mRNA to ribosomes.
