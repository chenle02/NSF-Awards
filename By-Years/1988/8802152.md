The specific goals of this proposal are: 1) To achieve, using newly developed
immunocytochemical techniques, a detailed picture of both nuclear and
cytoskeletal organizations present in Drosophila embryos during the cleavage
stages of development. 2) To critically analyze the exact details of how the
cytoskeletal elements tubulin and actin reorganize as the cleavage nuclei enter
the periphery. These results will be augmented with real- time observations of
living embryos viewed with Nomarski DIC optics and documented with video
technology. These results, in conjunction with the previous work will provide
the descriptive foundations for which many known Drosophila mutations affecting
early development can be analyzed. 3) To examine in greater detail the effects
mutations in the engrailed and even-skipped genes have on early development.
Mutations in these two genes are lethal to the embryo, and disrupt segmentation
in a reproducible and spatially specific manner. This proposal is designed to
further our understanding of the relationship between these genes and
cytoskeletal elements in the embryo that provide structure and movement, with
special emphasis on the actin and tubulin-based cytoskeletons. In the long term,
an understanding of how these and other genes act to build the body plan of
Drosophila should tell us how similar genes work in higher eukaryotes including
humans. %%% Fertilization of an egg by the sperm initiates a developmental
program that results in a fully viable adult animal. This developmental program
is completely specified by the contents of the fertilized egg, and the challenge
facing developmental biologists is to decipher exactly how the information that
is present in the egg is first stored, and then subsequently utilized and
processed as the embryo develops. Dr. Karr's work will provide key information
about the very earliest events following fertilization.
