This award is to The University of Colorado to support a workshop to investigate
and report on the issues associated with advancing high -performance
architectures on campus. The workshop has three goals: 1. bring in recent grant
awardees of high-performance network connections in the NSF connections programs
to be informed of the issues and approaches in engineering connectivity between
qualified researchers and the vBNS. 2. bring together campus networking leaders
to discuss their views and approaches to the more general issues of deploying
the next generation campus network. 3. assembled the combined material in a
report and a web site to disseminate broadly to the higher education community.
