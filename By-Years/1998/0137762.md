ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Edwards&lt;br/&gt;OPP-01-37761&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award is being made an a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). The
Principal Investigator will modify existing software tools to produce three-
dimensional charts of the arctic ice canopy using acoustic data collected during
the 1998 and 1999 SCience ICe EXercises (SCICEX). Maps of ice keel/lead
locations and ice thickness can resolve the ongoing debate regarding whether the
mass of the arctic ice canopy is, like the extent of sea-ice cover, measurably
decreasing, and can improve climatic modeling. The Principal Investigator will
use a unique dataset that has been collected and provides a rare opportunity to
channel expertise and technology that have been developed in one field of
research (seafloor mapping) to a very different set of scientific problems. In
addition, the proposed project has practical applications for the U.S. Navy's
nuclear submarine force and could engender future SCICEX seafloor mapping
collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
