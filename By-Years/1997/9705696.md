9705696 Baer Development of layer-multiplying devices permits continuous co-
extrusion of polymer sheet or film with hundreds or thousands of alternating
layers of two or more materials. Layer thicknesses from the macroscale (tens of
microns) to the microscale (several microns) and finally to the nanoscale (tens
of nanometers) can be created. Motivated by the need for new processing
technologies for creating engineered microstructures of incompatible polymers, a
microlayer facility was created at CWRU during the previous grant period. This
unique facility includes a two-component process that produces sheet or film
with alternating layer of polymer A and polymer B, and a second system that adds
a third "tie" layer (polymer C) between A and B. A research program to study the
advantages that can be achieved with this versatile process will be initiated.
New opportunities will be addressed in two broad areas: (1) Fundamental studies
of adhesion, diffusion, and crystallization utilizing model systems created by
microlayer coextrusion, and (2) creation and characterization of new materials
that exhibit synergistically enhanced properties where the properties might be
mechanical, optical, barrier, electronic or combinations of these. %%% This
project will provide fundamental understanding of novel processing technologies
for the generation of mechanically improved materials based upon multiple layers
of different polymers. ***
