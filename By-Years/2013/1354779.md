Katharine E. Lewis&lt;br/&gt;Coordinating Developmental Gene Expression in
Myxococcus xanthus (IOS-1354779)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacterial
development yields a remarkable array of complex multicellular forms. Arguably,
one of the most interesting and important forms of bacterial multicellularity is
the biofilm. Mature biofilms are complex and often contain structural features
such as towers of cells. In this mature state, biofilms are highly resistant to
toxic chemicals such as those found in household cleaners, to chlorine, which is
often used to treat water, and to many of the antibiotics commonly used to treat
human infections. A fundamental goal in microbiology is to identify the genetic
elements that control the formation of stress-resistant bacterial biofilms. This
project focuses on a regulatory protein that is crucial for biofilm formation in
the bacterium Mxyococcus xanthus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When starving, M.
xanthus forms a biofilm containing a thin mat of cells and multicellular
structures containing a highly resistant cell type. The enhancer binding protein
(EBP) ActB, which is a transcriptional activator, is required for the formation
of a mature M. xanthus biofilm and for production of highly resistant cells. The
primary goal of this project is to understand how ActB regulates the formation
of a mature biofilm by identifying and characterizing its target genes. In
particular, this project will identify biofilm genes that are directly regulated
by ActB, elucidate how ActB regulates these genes, and determine whether the
target genes are important for the formation of a mature biofilm. The project
will support training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students
including members of groups that are under-represented in sciences and students
from a predominately undergraduate college, and will be the basis of outreach to
local high schools.
