Academic Research Infrastructure: Development of a Distributed High-Performance
Computing Environment for Research in Science and Engineering This Academic
Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high speed network
and high speed computational workstations to build a high performance
distributed computing environment. The research projects supported by the
equipment include: 1. Development of distributed parallel processing techniques
for scientific computations. 2. Application of distributed parallel computing to
support research in the areas of material processing, multiscale failure
analysis, and multiphase flows. 3. Development and application of virtual
reality techniques to investigate the results of large scale simulations and to
interactively steer the simulations. 4. Research , development, and evaluation
of student mobile computing for delivery of anywhere, anytime instruction. 5.
Research and development in advanced networking, and the development of an ATM-
based network to support all facets of this program.
