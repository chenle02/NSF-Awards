This project will undertake an investigation of the response of flexible tubes
to transverse impact. The resulting deflections will be studied in both filled
and unfilled tubes. The applicability of the data to the field of solid
mechanics is clear; for filled tubes, the data are important to understanding
blood flow in flexible arteries.
