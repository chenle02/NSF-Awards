9423666 Cronin-Golomb The object of this research is to investigate the use of
plasma enhanced metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) grown electro-
optic and photorefractive thin films as nonlinear optical waveguide devices.
Potential applications include compact self-aligning reconfigurable optical
interconnects and switches and compact high speed electrooptic modulators. This
Tufts University/NZ Applied Technologies project will be performed as a
collaboration between university researchers with expertise in photorefractive
nonlinear optics and researchers in industry with expertise in perovskite PE-
CVD. The first part of the project will be devoted to developing PE-CVD grown
epitaxial films of the ferroelectric perovskites barium titanate and strontium
barium niobate. The films will be evaluated as waveguides, figures of merit for
photorefractive and electro-optic response will be determined, and their use as
phase conjugate mirrors and beam couplers will be studied. The films will be
grown on various substrates to determine those which might be suitable for
direct integration of photorefractive thin film devices into optoelectronic
integrated circuits. ***
