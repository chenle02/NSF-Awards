The object of this study of the photosynthetic reaction center structure is to
establish the molecular basis for its function in solar energy conversion. This
involves an investigation of the natue of the binding site for cytochrome on the
reaction center using site specific mutagenesis and the realtionship between
reaction centers in bacteria and the ones in Photosystem II. Photosynthesis is
the process used by plants and photosynthetic bacteria to convert sunlight into
chemical energy. This process involves light initiated electron transfer
reactions which takes place in a protein complex called the reaction center
which is a membrane bound bacteriochlorophyII-protein complex. The reaction
centers from photosynthetic bacteria have been extensively studied and well
characterized by a variety of biophysical and structural techniques including
X-ray crystallography which have opened up new areas of research.
