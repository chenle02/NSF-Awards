This is a two year collaborative project by Drs. Winona Barker, H.R. Chen and
David G. George, National Biomedical Research Foundation and Professors Tang
Yougi and Xu Xiaojie, Peking University to establish an international protein
structure database. A protein sructure database system has substanially
benefitted molecular biological research in the United States. Many correlations
and identification of protein sequence have been made based on the available
information on secondary and tertiary structures in the Protein structure
database. This project will make available the protein structures solved by
Chinese scientists, which are now inaccessible to the U.S. scientists. Similarly
it will allow the Chinese scientists make use of this database to advance their
work on protein sequences. This project is complimentary in nature and can
substanially enhance research in protein structures.
