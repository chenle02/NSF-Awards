This award constitutes partial support for the Eighth International Congress of
Arctic Social Science (ICASS VIII), which will be held in May 2014 at the
University of Northern British Columbia, Canada. ICASS brings together scholars
and other researchers interested in issues of the North. The focus of this
Congress will be on "Northern Sustainabilities" and the requested funding will
be used to support the participation of early career scholars, indigenous
scholars, as well as northern indigenous community members. The organizers,
Andrey Petrov (member of the organizing committee of the International Congress
of Arctic Social Sciences), and Gail Fondahl (President of the International
Arctic Social Science Association) will help build interdisciplinary capacity
and scholarship by supplementing support increased participation in the
Congress. This in turn will provide new insights in to key areas of concern both
from scientists and the public on the long term sustainability of northern
development and community well-being.
