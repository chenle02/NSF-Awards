The digital era has created new opportunities for data storage and access,
leading to an atmosphere and expectation for open data sharing that will benefit
the broader scientific community. For the field of animal behavior, data sharing
and access presents a range of challenges due to the collection and use of
numerous data types, the need to address standards, and a common strategy for
archiving some key data types. For example, audiovisual recordings require
substantial "hands on" time for processing, large storage capacity for large
files, rich descriptive metadata, and constant migration to new formats as
technologies change. As a consequence, these behavioral data remain
prohibitively under-curated and broadly inaccessible to the biological research
community. Yet, at the same time, biologists and other researchers are
collecting vast amounts of such data, and this trend is increasing as recording
technologies become more sophisticated and inexpensive. These data will remain
generally inaccessible if the challenges of archiving digital media are not
addressed.

This award funds a workshop to be held at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in
2016. The meeting will bring together experts from a number of relevant fields
to discuss preservation and accessibility of samples relevant to research on
animal behavior and physiology. Representatives and experts from several
stakeholder communities will come together to document the challenges of making
behavioral data broadly accessible, and to develop a framework that prioritizes
the key issues. Outcomes will be published in a white paper and a formal
publication. The meeting will be relevant to the development of methods and
approaches to citizen science projects that emphasize the use of digital media.
Graduate students and postdocs will participate in the meeting itself, providing
a valuable experience and enhancing their training and background in data
archiving and accessibility.
