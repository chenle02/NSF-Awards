Professor Klaus Schmidt of Warwick University in England will be principal
lecturer at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at the University of
Washington in Seattle in July of 1989. The lectures will focus on algebraic
ideas that have played a central role in the development of ergodic theory and
that is at the forefront of current research.
