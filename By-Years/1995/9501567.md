9501567 Powers This is an award to provide the support this investigator
requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program which has the intent of encouraging
the early development of academic faculty as educators and researchers. The
research this investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving our
understanding of nonaqueous phase liquid entrapment and dissolution processes in
heterogeneous subsurface systems, to formulate conduct mathematical models and
experimentally verify them to test hypotheses descriptive of the dissolution
processes. Her education plan involves using the results of the research to
formulate open ended problems and using them as a basis for providing
experiential learning opportunities for students. Results are expected to
provide a more fundamental understanding of phenomena associated with movement
of nonaqueous fluids through porous media than now exists leading to an
improvement in models used in engineering design of remediation processes and
systems for decontamination of soils contaminated with these types of fluids.
The teaching plan this investigator plans to pursue is likely to produce
innovations in the use of computer programs as tools for engineering analysis
and design. ***
