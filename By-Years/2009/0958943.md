This project will study the impact of an outbreak of the forest tree caterpillar
(Malacosoma disstria) on tree seedling establishment, productivity and community
structure of temperate forests. Outbreaks of insects that defoliate whole forest
canopies occur sporadically and may last only a year or two. For this reason,
they have received limited study. However, considering the long lifespan of
trees, defoliation events may be an important factor determining the long term
dynamics and succession within forests. Prior research has focused on the
negative impacts of defoliation on tree growth and survival; far less attention
has been given to the positive impacts on tree seedling establishment associated
with increased understory light and soil nutrients. This project takes advantage
of an ongoing, massive outbreak of forest tree caterpillars in a section of
lower Michigan that encompasses previously established long term research sites.
The data on tree dynamics from the long term study provide a rare baseline
against which the impact of the insect outbreak can be compared. It is critical
that this research start immediately in order to collect data during the peak of
the defoliation event. Consequently, this project is being funded as a grant for
rapid response research (RAPID).

Climate warming has resulted in longer growing seasons and milder winters in
temperate forests, which should lead to more frequent outbreaks of insect
defoliators. This project will provide important information on the consequences
of such change to forest dynamics. This research will be conducted in the
Manistee National Forest and has important implications to the management of
this forest and similar forests in the temperate zone. The project will provide
research training for a postdoctoral scholar and for graduate and undergraduate
students. Local K-12 school teachers and students will also be engaged in the
field research.
