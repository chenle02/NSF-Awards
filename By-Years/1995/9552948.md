9552948 DeLoatch Morgan State University proposes to again collaborate with NSF
in the implementation of the student component of the NSF fourth National
Conference on Diversity in the Scientific and Technological Workforce, which is
scheduled in Washington, DC on September 22-23, 1995. Grant activities would
include, in conjunction with NSF, the selection of approximately 400 student
participants in HRD and other NSF-funded research projects to attend the
conference in Washington and present findings from their research activities.
The university would host the student orientation, prepare abstracts of student
presentations, and design and schedule activities to encourage student
interactions with role models and other students, leading to the formation of a
support group to reinforce student selection of science, mathematics,
engineering and technology (SMET) majors and careers. Grant activities also
would include scheduling student travel and hotel accommodations, and arranging
transportation to the conference for local area precollege and college students
and teachers.
