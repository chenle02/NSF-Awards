International Responsible Conduct of Research Education
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;OISE-0940073&lt;br/&gt;Nicholas H.
Steneck&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to
provide researchers with formal training on professional responsibility became
widely accepted in the US following the publication of the 1989 Institute of
Medicine Report, The Responsible Conduct of Research in the Health Sciences.
During the 1990s, courses, textbooks, other teaching resources, and training
programs proliferated, making it possible for most research institutions in the
US to offer some formal responsible conduct of research (RCR) education. Similar
developments have been slow in coming outside the US. Countries that have in one
way or another addressed the issue of research integrity frequently mention the
importance of RCR education, but to date no countries have followed the US lead
and adopted formal requirements. Consequently, formal RCR education is not
available to most research students or new researchers outside the US. The
immediate goal of the International RCR Education Workshop is to bring together
an international group of RCR educators and others interested parties to address
the need for improved consistency and availability of RCR education for students
and researchers on a global basis. During the Workshop participants will
endeavor to come to some agreement on international guidelines for RCR education
as well as develop plans to communicate and share materials after the workshop.
Planning for the Workshop will take into account efforts underway at the
National Science Foundation to enhance RCR education in response to the American
Competes Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More consistent, well-thought-out RCR
education will make it easier for researchers to work with colleagues in and
students from other countries. It will also facilitate international study by
making sure that students and mentors share common understandings of
professional responsibility. To the extent that education can influence
behavior, global guidelines for RCR education should promote higher standards
for integrity in research by reducing the small-but-common lapses of integrity
that result from poor or inadequate training in professional responsibility. The
benefits of higher standards for integrity in research are significant and far-
reaching, ranging from better protection for human subjects to less waste and
careless practice, enhanced objectivity, more accurate publications, properly
managed conflicts of interest and a sincere interest on the part of researchers
in working for the greater public good. &lt;br/&gt;
