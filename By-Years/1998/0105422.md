The proposed research investigates new methods for symbolic analysis
to&lt;br/&gt;improve various restructuring compiler optimizations. A new algebra
on&lt;br/&gt;functions is investigated to manipulate, simplify, and derive
normal forms of&lt;br/&gt;scalar functions and (generalized) induction variables
in multi-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;loops. The derivation of normal forms for
intermediate program constructs&lt;br/&gt;enables reasoning about the semantics
of a program under analysis. This is&lt;br/&gt;extremely useful to improve
various compiler optimizations to effectively deal&lt;br/&gt;with symbolic
expressions in real-world applications. More specifically,
the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research aims to improve symbolic analysis methods such
as&lt;br/&gt;generalized induction variable recognition, linear and non-linear
data&lt;br/&gt;dependence analysis, value range analysis, global value
propagation, and&lt;br/&gt;counting the number of solutions to systems of
constraints. The effectiveness&lt;br/&gt;of parallelizing compilers depends
heavily on the accuracy of these methods.&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in
the ability of compilers to more effectively&lt;br/&gt;handle symbolic
expressions and constraints. Current methods are not always&lt;br/&gt;effective,
resulting in considerable performance losses caused by worst-
case&lt;br/&gt;assumptions or when program analysis has to be performed at
execution time.&lt;br/&gt;
