9421002 Howell The goal of this project is to identify genes responsible for the
role of the host in the movement of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and in the
process to find plant genes that confer virus resistance. Two approaches are
proposed. 1)Virus resistance mutants of Arabidopsis will be isolated and
characterized and 2)Arabidopsis suppresser mutants susceptible to defective
plant viruses will be selected. The second approach is novel in that it allows
positive selection for susceptible plants that suppress mutations in any chosen
viral gene or in any particular function of a given gene. If successful, it will
open new avenues for the selection of genes important in plant disease
resistance. %%% This proposal describes a novel approach to the study of plant-
virus interactions and the identification of host functions involved in virus
replication and movement in plants. Arabidopsis plants that are susceptible to
infection by defective CaMV will be selected. Because the interplay between host
and virus is most apparent in virus movement, mutations that disable the CaMV
movement protein will be created. In addition, virus resistant mutants will be
selected and a virus-resistant trait, apparently a one-gene trait, which has
been shown to block long-distance virus movement will be characterized. ***
