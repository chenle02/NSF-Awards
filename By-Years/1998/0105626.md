General purpose processors (GPPs) are designed to implement on fixed
configuration that is good on average but may not be well suited for individual
applications. In fact, applications can have drastically different execution
characteristics (e.g. branch prediction technique preference, cache
configuration and policy preference, low-power opportunities). This suggests the
use of device reconfigurability, but generic reconfigurable logic of any
substantial scale (e.g. most field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology) is
slow, lacks density, and is power-hungry. Yet many processor structures are
easily adaptable to a wide variety of configurations. This research will develop
dynamic, small-scale, partial reconfigurability for such structures. This
"Dynaptable" approach has the further benefit that it integrates work at the
architectural, logic, and circuit levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dynaptable
approach consists of three key elements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. Flexible
structures: designing key processor structures with judicious amounts of
reconfigurable hardware to provide flexibility in a low-cost, non-invasive
way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2. Run-time monitoring: determining the current
configuration's performance or effectiveness compared to other possible
competing configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 3. Dynamic reconfiguration:
using the results of run-time monitoring to adapt to a new configuration that
improves the chosen figure of merit (e.g. performance, energy-delay product,
fault tolerance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will identify the most
profitable places for adding small-scale reconfigurability, design the requisite
reconfigurable elements, and develop the most effective and lowest-cost
techniques for dynamic monitoring and adaptation. This work will have an impact
on the design of a variety of processor components (branch predictor, cache,
datapath, etc.) for a range of processing environments (embedded systems,
superscalar, SMT, etc.). The final goal is to develop a consistent methodology
for dynamically adapting GPP microarchitectures for improved performance, lower
power, and increased fault tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;
