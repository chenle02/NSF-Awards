Research focuses on the development of algorithms to determine the normalizing
constant in product form multiclass and multirate circuit-switched networks
using Monte Carlo summation. Further, gradients will be obtained. Efficient
variance reduction techniques are to be developed and application of the Monte
Carlo summation method to parametric optimization and dynamic control of
stochastic networks investigated. Research should produce significant new
discoveries in adaptive optimization algorithms and yield queueing network
analysis tools that can be applied in a diversity of disciplines.
