The main thrust of this proposal is the study of k-point configurations in
discrete, continuous and arithmetic settings. The basic question is to determine
how large a subset of a given vector space needs to be to ensure that it
determines a substantial proportion of all possible finite point configurations
up to congruence. The research involves a tight interaction between analytic,
number theoretic and combinatorial methods in a seamless symbiosis that allows
for a deeper understanding of the associated techniques and ideas.

The techniques and ideas of the proposal do not only involve interaction between
different areas of mathematics. They also involve ideas from theoretical
computer science with potential applications to data mining, coding, signal
processing, bioinformatics and many other areas of modern science. Modern
harmonic analysis, which is PI?s main area of expertise, is a treasure trove of
techniques and ideas that have found relevance in virtually every scientific
disciplines and this influence will continue to grow in the years and decades to
come.
