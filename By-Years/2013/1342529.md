With this EAGER award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor K.C.
Nicolaou of Rice University to attempt to develop the first viable catalytic,
asymmetric olefin dichlorination. Though clearly of high risk, success across
any of the olefin classes to be investigated in this study, would represent high
reward, with a likely impact on natural product, medicinal, process and
combinatorial chemistry endeavors. The Nicolaou group will explore complementary
organocatalytic and organometallic avenues toward the title transformation, with
cinchona alkaloids among the chiral scaffolds expected to impart asymmetry, and
with both relatively non-polarized alkenes and polarized alkenes of the
alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl variety to be explored.

If successful, a catalytic asymmetric dichlorination tranformation is expected
to have broad scientific impact, across both academic and industrial settings.
Given the diverse array of organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistries to
be explored, students are expected to benefit from this broad synthetic
training. The PI plans to work to include women and chemists from traditionally
underrepresented groups in this research team undertaking.
