The Duke University Marine Laboratory has requested several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the R/V CAPE
HATTERAS, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by Duke University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1988 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -shipboard computer for
the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, -additions to the SAIL shipboard data
logging system, -a deep water CTD system for collecting precision temperature
and conductivity data as a function of depth, -digital data recording system for
seismic system, and -additional spare circuit boards and parts. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the organization
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
