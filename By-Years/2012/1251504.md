This project is to support student involvement in the IEEE Engineering in
Medicine & Biology Society (EMBS) conference "Translational Engineering in
Health & Medicine: The Intersection of the Lab, the Clinic and the Community",
to be held in Houston November 7-9, 2012. This conference provides and
opportunity for physicians, engineers, and health professionals to share their
knowledge and issues, and to work together on innovative solutions. It is the
only meeting specifically designed to outline the key engineering imperatives in
medicine and biology for the next several years and work toward achieving this
future. The goal of this project is to facilitate meaningful involvement by
students in all facets of the conference, from meeting planning to presentations
and session leadership to post-conference evaluation.
