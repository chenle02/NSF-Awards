0128823 Slavin This award supports Andei Slavin and students from Oakland
University in a collaboration with Burkard Hillebrands of the Physics Department
at the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany. The project is supplementary to
the ongoing award from the Division of Materials research on the "Dynamics of
Linear and Nonlinear Spin Waves in Magnetic Films." The aim of the international
project is to develop a complementary research collaboration between the
theoretical research group in the US and the German experimental group to work
on solutions to problems involving confinement of linear and non-linear spin
waves in magnetic films and particles. Such solutions will have important
applications in magnetic recording, and will advance the state of our
fundamental understanding of magnetic excitations. The work plan provides for
extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and
research.
