The research covers aspects of holomorphically convex domains in several
complex variables and complex geometry. Particular questions relate to the
topology and geometry of classes of covering spaces of complex manifolds and
their related function theory. The topics covered in the proposal cover several
important aspects of the analysis of several complex variables and related
geometry. Besides their relevance to other areas of mathematics, the techniques
have by tradition had applications to mathematical physics and several branches
of the engineering sciences such as elasticity theory and aerodynamics. ***
