This award will support the participation of U.S.-based researchers at the
Eighteenth Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic (the Simposio Latino
Americano de Logica Matematica, or SLALM) at the Universidad de Concepcion in
Chile on December 16-20, 2019. The SLALM series was conceived by Abraham
Robinson in the 1960's, and SLALM meetings have been held intermittently since
then, usually every two to four years, always in Latin America. These meetings
have been instrumental in the growth of the discipline of logic in the region
during that time, and also in encouraging cooperation between the logic
communities in North and South America, as researchers from the U.S. and Canada
frequently attend the SLALM. With the expansion of this contact has come
fruitful exchange: the very top ranks of logicians in the U.S. these days
include researchers born in Brazil and Uruguay, while U.S.-born logicians have
taken permanent jobs in countries such as Colombia, and a substantial further
number of researchers have traveled between the regions for postdoctoral
positions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This particular NSF award will support the
attendance of eight to ten US-based logicians at the 2019 SLALM, with an
emphasis on students and junior researchers, and with preference for researchers
from groups underrepresented in mathematics. The award will be administered by
the Association for Symbolic Logic, which has supported the SLALM series since
its inception and which recently made the SLALM an official ASL meeting,
providing financial support for it to invite prominent speakers, in recognition
of the growth of logic in Latin America. The 2019 SLALM will include eight
plenary talks, four mini-courses, and four special sessions: computability and
computer science; model theory; philosophy and non-classical logics; and set
theory. The special sessions include prominent invited speakers and also
contributed talks in which younger researchers will have the opportunity to
present their work. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SLALM website:

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
