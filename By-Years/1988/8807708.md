The Conference, which is open, will stress topics which are of great current
interest and of importance to both the particle physics and nuclear physics
communities. It will concentrate upon mutually beneficial cooperation between
particle and nuclear physics in Science, Technology, and in the Facilities
through which such endeavours are being pursued. The Conference will highlight
the importance and diversity of nuclear and particle physics in the 1 to 100 GeV
energy range. Particular emphasis will be placed on reaching out beyond the
present frontiers of physics through high intensity and high precision
experiments as distinct from those efforts which intend to roll back the energy
frontier (through the Superconducting Super Collider).
