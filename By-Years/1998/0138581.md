This interdisciplinary study combines scientific ecological knowledge (SEK) and
the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of the Inupiat people regarding
Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. The research will focus on developing an ecological
profile of the nearshore Kotzebue Sound and testing three hypotheses regarding
food webs, sewage impacts, and ecosystem change. Common methods of ethnography
will be used to elicit TEK, and standard oceanographic techniques will be used
for the SEK portion of the study. The project includes outreach to local schools
and will bring local students of all ages into the data collection process.
