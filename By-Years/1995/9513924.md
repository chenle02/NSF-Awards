9513924 Chant Accelerator based research in intermediate energy nuclear physics
of a University of Maryland group will be supported primarily at CEBAF utilizing
electromagnetic probes. There will be a major contribution to the commissioning
of CEBAF as well as initiation of new experiments with CEBAF. The research will
include a measurement of the polarization of the recoiling deuteron from e- d
scattering and studies of parity violation in the scattering of polarized
electrons from helium nuclei. Specialized detectors will be developed for use in
these and other experiments at CEBAF. Continuing researah using hadron probes
such as pion- induced reaction studies on a polarized Li target at IUCF and
(p,pN) experiments at TRIUMF will be carried out by the group ***
