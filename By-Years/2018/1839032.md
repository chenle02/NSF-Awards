Disciplinary (non-institutional) data repositories have much higher rates of
adoption than Institutional Repositories (IRs) in part because they are directly
integrated with key points in researcher workflows, particularly during the
publishing of scientific articles. But community repositories lack partnerships
with institutional expertise found in librarians and data curators. This project
addresses researcher need through taking the first steps in an open, community-
supported initiative in research data curation and publishing. To effectively
leverage institutional knowledge and serve researchers as end users, more and
varied types of institutions need to have a say in the values and necessities.
To build broad community support, this invitational workshop will explore
community requirements, identify impediments, study sustainable business models,
and make recommendations regarding the widespread promotion and adoption of
effective, scalable, and sustainable institutional data publication
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the National
Science Foundation?s Public Access Initiative which is managed by the NSF Office
of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
