Geometric functional analysis is concerned with various geometric properties of
infinite dimensional linear spaces through their finite dimensional subspaces, a
good analogy of which is a CT scan in medical imaging. This project aims to
deepen our understanding of existing, as well as to develop new methods, heavily
involving probabilistic and analytic ideas, in order to study quantitatively the
said geometric properties. A vital part will be student training at both
graduate and undergraduate levels and educational activities that will
result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, there are three fundamental
questions this project aims to tackle: sharp bounds on Gaussian measures of
dilates of symmetric convex sets, volumetric bounds on sections of convex
bodies, and quantitative aspects of concentration with concrete applications to
convex geometry and geometry of numbers. The focus is on new methods,
particularly, the Fourier approach to geometric tomography, blended with the
novel reverse HÃ¶lder inequalities for negative moments, as well as applications
of entropy to quantify concentration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
