0201438&lt;br/&gt;Findley&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Miami's
Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences provides instrumentation to
improve the shared-use scientific instrumentation available to researchers using
three research ships operated by University of Miami and the Harbor Branch
Oceanographic Institution. These three vessels, R/Vs Seward Johnson, Seward
Johnson II, and Walton Smith, are all operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The specific
instrumentation supported by this award includes a phased array, 75 kHz acoustic
Doppler current meter for installation on R/V Seward Johnson II, and a multi-
corer device for collecting undisturbed seafloor samples from any of the three
ships. These new capabilities will be of substantial advantage to marine
scientists using the ships in their research during 2001 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;
