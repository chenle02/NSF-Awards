This project aims to advance neural data analysis and image processing by
exploiting the structure in multivariate phase representations. Combining
insights from neural computation with advances in multivariate statistics,
mathematical signal analysis, and machine learning, the project aims to build
multivariate statistical models of angular variables that capture the
dependencies between complex and hypercomplex phase variables. Recursive
estimation techniques will be developed to allow for optimal estimation of
distributions from noisy data and prediction of their temporal evolution. The
models developed in this proposal will be applied to current problems in
neuroscience and image processing.

As a foundation for the application domains, a recently developed method for
estimating the parameters of stationary multivariate phase distributions will be
generalized to situations in which the parameters are time-varying and the
measurements are noisy, linear mixtures of the underlying sources. A recursive
filtering model, similar to the classical Kalman filter, will be developed, that
produces an optimal online estimate of latent phase variables in response to a
sequence of noisy measurements.

In the first application domain, this model will be used to infer connectivity
and temporal interactions among populations of neural oscillators from
physiological measurements. The model will also be used to detect transient
changes in connectivity by utilizing a mixture model of phase dynamics. These
estimation techniques will be evaluated on simulated data and then applied to
the analysis of neurophysiological recordings to better elucidate network
dynamics.

In the application domain of natural image statistics, the model will be
extended to handle hypercomplex phase variables in order to model the phase and
orientation of edges in natural images, which contain rich information that may
be exploited for image analysis and object recognition. The project aims to
develop a model that describes the spatial dependencies among these variables as
a nonlinear mixture of multivariate phase distributions.
