In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability
Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Alice B. Kelly from the University of
California - Berkeley will investigate the ways in which crime, both resource
related and non-resource related crime, serve as threats to ecological and
recreational sustainability in the Nation's National Parks. This award has
support from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Directorate for
Geosciences and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kelly will study the correlation of crime
rates with: (1) the geographic location of each protected area; (2) the extent
of government and external funding for national parks; (3) specific Federal and
State laws/policies that impact National Parks; and (4) the ecological condition
and visitation rates of specific parks. Research will concentrate on National
Parks in the western United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like
that proposed in this work is to develop improved policies to guarantee the
long-term sustainability of the Nation's National
Parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kelly will be working with collaborators Prof.
Maggi Kelly of the Department of Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management
of UC-Berkeley as well as Rene S. Buehl of the National Park Service. Dr. Kelly
will also work with software developers and other professionals in the
Department of the Interior to improve the current Incident Reporting System to
include the kind of GIS data that will be produced in this
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science,
Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program,
with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that
lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the
necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this
project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves
in an independent research career related to sustainability.
