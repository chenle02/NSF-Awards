The equipment purchased from this grant will serve as a part of a general
purpose computer-controlled acquisition system. The system will be capable of
measuring both the admittance and network parameters of various devices, such as
diodes, MOS capacitors, bipolar and MOS transistors, inductors, etc. The
acquisition system will support a number of research projects primarily in the
area of semiconductor devices. The examples of the projects include the
investigation of heavy-doping effects in semiconductors and the development of
models for computer-aided design of bipolar and MOS devices.
