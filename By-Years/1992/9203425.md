This proposal is for partial support of the twelfth conference in a series
whose purpose is a review of the latest experimental measurements in elementary
particle physics at the highest energies. The conference format is a single
plenary session of 40 minute review talks, and has particular pedagogic value
for student and junior postdoctoral attendees as well as others. New results on
electron-antielectron collisions from SLAC, LEP and Cornell should be reviewed.
Also, considerable interest will focus on new experimental results from the
proton-antiproton colliders at Fermilab and CERN and from new electron proton
collider at HERA. Data from the other experiments in which various projectile
collisions with a variety of nuclear targets have recently been completed at
Fermilab are likely to be available in preliminary form.
