The proposal describes a new of nondestructive testing and characterization for
semiconductor and high Tc superconductor devices. The technique involves Low-
Frequency Noise (LFN) measurements performed at different temperatures and bias
conditions to characterize the mechanism(s) generating these fluctuations.
Measurements on three different devices are proposed here. The first one
involves that characterization of electromigration parameters and prediction of
the life-times in VLSI metallization layers and vias. By performing LFN
measurements in accelerated electromigration (EM) conditions such as elevated
temperatures and at stressing current densities, one can evaluate the EM
parameters like activation energy and current exponent. Then, these parameters
are used to establish a correlation between the life-time of the metallization
layer and the LFN the film exhibits, which in turn can be used as a predictor of
life-time. These measurements will be performed on multi-layer metallization
layers of TiW/W/A1 and via/stud structures. Secondly, LFN measurements will be
utilized to characterize YBaa2CU3O7-8 thin films and to determine the quality of
the film related to its composition, crystallinity, Resistance- Temperature
(R-T) characteristics, and the critical current. LFN measurements will be
performed also on HgCdTe MIS photodiodes to characterize the insulator-
semiconductor interface and to enhance the noise performance of these devices as
infrared detectors. The significance of the noise characterization techniques
lies in their ease, flexibility and most important of all, nondestructiveness.
