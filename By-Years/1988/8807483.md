This research is concerned with the development of new and extremely fast
algorithms for a large class of symmetric matrix eigenvalue computations. The
underlying bases of the methods are the techniques and ideas that grew out of
intermediate problems. These techniques promise significant improvements over
the fastest computational procedures known for a large class of problems and
also the methods will be very suitable for parallel computation.
