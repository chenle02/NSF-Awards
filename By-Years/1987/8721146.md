This project calls for the design and fabrication of a downhole
temperature.measuring system to be employed in drillhole investigations. Partial
funding is also provided to purchasea gamma ray detector, sonic velocity tool,
and cable. The purpose of the instrumentation package is to upgrade and
modernize the downhole logging system of the Department of Geological Sciences
at Southern Methodist University. The equipment will be used in scientific
research on regional heat flow, the thermal state of the Earth, investigations
of geothermal systems, and the thermal evolution of sedimentary basins.
