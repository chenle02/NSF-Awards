This collaborative Pathways II proposal provides continued funding for the
Chemical Education DL. The Chemical Education DL is unique among the Pathways as
it is a collection of digital assets, not a collection of links. Consequently,
they are not subject to URL decay as many portions of NSDL content are.

The goals of the Chemical Education DL are: 1)Support students, teachers, the
public, and members of the ACS by making available content, pedagogy,
communication tools, and professional development resources; 2) Leverage
resources of the world?s largest scientific society and foremost chemical
education journal to develop and support communities of users, teachers, and
developers; 3) Enhance awareness, usage, and development of digital resources
through outreach to the K-graduate educational community; 4) Collaborate with
the NSDL and its constituent projects to expand NSDL services and promote usage
of NSDL resources.

In addition to furthering the original goals, during the continuation phase the
underlying technical/architecture will be strengthened and fully integrated.
Other major enhancements include 1) movement of additional content to the DL
from the Journal of Chemical Education, the ACS Education Division and the ACS
Division of Chemical Education, 2) development of "more effective means of
evaluating the efficacy of the Chemical Education DL resources."
