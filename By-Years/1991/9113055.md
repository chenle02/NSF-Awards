This award from the Office of Special Projects will enable the participation of
twelve young U.S. chemists in an NSF-Science and Engineering Research Council
"(SERC) "Workshop for Younger Chemists" in the area of dynamics of molecule-
surface interac- tions. The three-day workshop will be held July 22-24, 1991 at
the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, England. The workshop will expose
chemists in the field of molecule-sur- face interactions to the broader
community of international scholarship for the purpose of establishing long-term
bridges for productive research collaboration and knowledge exchange. All
participants have made significant contributions to this field. The number of
participants is limited to 24, 12 from each side. Through an open discussion of
ideas and unpublished results, the workshop will provide a perspective of the
important problems in the field and establish a solid foundation for future
significant research.
