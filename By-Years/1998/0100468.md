Our Intermediate Energy research group at Boston University consists of
three&lt;br/&gt;faculty, two postdoctoral fellows, four graduate students, and
several&lt;br/&gt;part-time undergraduate students. In the next three years, we
will:&lt;br/&gt;1) Continue to work on the Muon g-2 experiment. The muon is
like&lt;br/&gt;a heavy electron but is unstable and decays like a radioactive
nuclear&lt;br/&gt;isotope. Because it has both spin and charge, it behaves like
a microscopic&lt;br/&gt;bar magnet, whose magnetism we measure in our experiment
(g-2). Our latest&lt;br/&gt;value, based on a small part of our data, disagrees
with the Standard Model&lt;br/&gt;(a theory which describes the particles in
nature and the forces between them)&lt;br/&gt;prediction by several times the
error. If this disagreement persists after&lt;br/&gt;we analyze all of our data,
it will be very exciting since it suggests the&lt;br/&gt;existence of new
physics beyond the standard model. We plan two other&lt;br/&gt;experiments using
the same large storage ring magnet which is used for&lt;br/&gt;g-2, the
measurement of the muon electric dipole moment(EDM) and the&lt;br/&gt;direct
measurement of the muon neutrino mass. The EDM is expected in&lt;br/&gt;theory
to be smaller than we can measure, while indirect measurements&lt;br/&gt;from
other experiments suggest that the neutrino mass is not zero.&lt;br/&gt;2)
Measure the muon lifetime, which determines the strength of the&lt;br/&gt;weak
interaction within the standard model.&lt;br/&gt;3) Measure the muon to electron
conversion rate to unprecedented accuracy,&lt;br/&gt;a process which is
forbidden by the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;All of these measurements directly
test the Standard Model. Any&lt;br/&gt;significant deviation of the experimental
values from theory would imply&lt;br/&gt;that there is physics beyond what we
already know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
