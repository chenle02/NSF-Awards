The goal of this research is to characterize the mechanosensors on the first
antenna of calanoid copepods and evaluate their importance for prey and predator
detection. Behavioral and morphological analyses have indicated that
mechanoreception may be critical to pelagic copepods for prey detection,
predator avoidance and mate recognition. Yet mechanoreception in copepods has
not been studied physiologically. Dr. Yen and collaborators at the University of
Hawaii will combine expertise in copepod ecology and crustacean neurophysiology
to investigate the sensory capabilities of copepods physiologically, and to
integrate the sensory physiology with data on their ecology. The basic
objectives of this project are: 1. To characterize the physiological responses
to quantified mechanical stimuli. 2. To relate the physiological data to the
external and internal morphology of the sensors. 3. To determine intraspecific
differences in physiological properties and relate these to differences in
species ecology. 4. To measure behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli and
relate these to the physiological properties and the species ecology.
