This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant focuses on a church- based
process of electoral mobilization among black women. Although religion is
thought to be a force that influences political action, it is only recently that
political scientists have attempted to build a theoretical and empirical base to
study the subject. As a consequence of this dearth of research there is no
tradition of research in this field that can act as a guide for analyzing the
electoral mobilization of religious black women. Thus, this research has as its
main purpose the development of a convergent picture of how the black church
acts as an agent of political socialization, thereby politically mobilizing
black women. The research will examine data from five existing data sets. The
first three (the National Survey of Black Americans, the Three Generational
Family Study, and the National Black Election Study) are national representative
samples of the black population. The second two (the 1980 and 1984 National
Election Studies) are representative samples of the general population. The
latter two data sets will be used to compare the relative impact of religion and
church life on the political mobilization of white females. By having both a
within- group and racial group comparative research framework the investigators
hope to learn more about how and why religion influences the political actions
of black women.
