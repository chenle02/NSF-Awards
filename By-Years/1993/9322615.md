Pruess The investigator develops and analyzes stable methods for generating
approximants of high global accuracy to functions defined essentially by highly
accurate interpolatory data. Several numerical algorithms for estimating the
solution of an ordinary differential equation can produce highly accurate
approximations at a finite set of points. It is often desirable to construct a
closed form approximation based on this data; however, the obvious piecewise
polynomial interpolants frequently do not work, especially for highly nonuniform
meshes. An interpolant based on local collocation seems to be stable but further
analysis and algorithms are needed. A related problem is that of finding
interpolants given accurate discrete data for Sturm-Liouville eigenfunctions: it
is desirable to retain the accuracy with an interpolant having the correct
oscillation properties. The problems to be studied are a natural outgrowth of
prior work that resulted in a widely used software package. Advances in both
theory and computer implementation are sought. Applications are to
representation of curves arising in computer graphics, and to producing
graphical representations for solutions to problems arising in quantum chemistry
and physics.
