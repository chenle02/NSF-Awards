Many multicellular animals require specialized molecules to transport enough
oxygen in their blood to metabolizing tissue. Metabolic demands of the tissues,
however, often change in response to environmental perturbation, which can in
turn modify the microenvironments in the blood and thus the functional
properties of the oxygen carriers. For several decades it has been known that
the oxygen transport system in some animals can adapt to metabolic demand and/or
environmental change by responding to extrinsic molecular cofactors. Only
recently has it been shown that intrinsic molecular change is also a mechanism
of adaptation. The proposed research will further elucidate the nature of the
intrinsic molecular changes that permit the commercially important Chesapeake
Bay blue crab to adapt to changes in environmental salinity and temperature.
This investigation will also determine the extent to which intrinsic molecular
changes accompany speciation and thus permit closely related species of crabs to
adapt to different environments. Finally, because material from a "living
fossil" unexpectedly became available, the oxygen transport properties of the
blood of a rare fish and its close relatives will also be elucidated.
