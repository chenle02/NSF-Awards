ABSTRACT

PIs: Steven Hofmann, Loukas Grafakos, Alex Iosevich, Igor Verbitsky Proposal:
DMS-0222187 Institution: University of Missouri at Columbia



This proposal requests funding for a conference on Harmonic Analysis and Partial
Differential Equations to be held in Columbia, Missouri during the period May 8
--11, 2002. The conference will last 4 four days and is expected to have 70-80
participants among which 20 will be invited speakers. Several world's leading
experts in the emerging connections between combinatorics, analysis and PDE will
speak at this conference. NSF funds will be use to support travel expenses and
room and board for thirty graduate students.
