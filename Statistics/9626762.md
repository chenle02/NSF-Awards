DMS 9626762 Ruppert The research is on nonparametric estimation of conditional
expectations, conditional variances, and conditional densities, i.e., estimation
without assuming that these functions belong to a parametric family. The work
uses local regression, a particularly simple and effective nonparametric method,
where one fits parametric models locally at each point in the domain of the
function in order to estimate the function at that point. By varying the point
one achieves a globally nonparametric estimator. The degree of "localness" is
achieved by a bandwidth or smoothing parameter. The work includes (a)
multivariate local polynomial regression where the local neighborhoods are
determined by a symmetric, positive definite bandwidth matrix that must be
estimated; (b) non-polynomial local models for estimating functions with poles,
jump discontinuities, or discontinuous derivatives; and (c) semiparametric
estimation of correlation functions and other functions of scientific interest
by local fitting of estimating equations. %%% Present applications of this
research on nonparametric estimation are mostly in engineering but include
nutrition. These applications include density-estimation radiosity in computer
graphics, analysis of simulation data from the pdf method of modeling
turbulence, estimating volatilities in financial engineering, combining local
regression smoothing and kriging for spatial data analysis, and modeling the
correlation between nutrient uptake as measured by both food frequency
questionnaires and more accurate, but also more expensive, food records. In the
strategic area of environmental science, this work has been applied to two very
different methods of monitoring air pollution, LIDAR and biomonitoring. ***
