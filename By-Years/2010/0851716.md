Proposal: 0851716&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Anderson, Kimberly
W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year REU Site program at the University of
Kentucky Research Foundation will provide undergraduate students with a
multidisciplinary research and education experience in the area of Engineered
Bioactive Interfaces and Devices. The students will learn about three cross-
disciplinary research themes that form the foundation of research in this area.
These include: 1) Novel Bioactive Architectures; 2) Cell/Protein interactions at
Interfaces; and 3) Integration into Therapeutic and Diagnostic Devices. The
specific objectives of this program include: 1) providing the students with
interdisciplinary mentoring and research training; 2) stimulating the students'
interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field
trips, and interactions with both graduate students and faculty; and 3)
developing the students' independence and confidence through participation in
research, journal clubs, in-house presentations and scientific
meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited from various
undergraduate disciplines including engineering, biology, chemistry and physics.
The PI will make special efforts to attract women and minorities to this
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;?This site is co-funded by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.?&lt;br/&gt;
