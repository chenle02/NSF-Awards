This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project will continue work on the further development
of Ir(I)-catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative allylic amidation reaction
and the corresponding intermolecular allylic amidation reaction, with particular
emphasis on their synthetic utility and potential. Particularly interesting to
study is enantioselective (decarboxylative) allylic amidation of allylic diene
systems, which can generate a broad range of optically enriched 'orthogonally'
protected 1,2-/1,3-/1,4-diamines/aminoalcohols, for which no general synthetic
method exists. Also demonstrated is that the developed (decarboxylative)
enantioselective allylic amidation reactions, in conjunction with
enantioselective (decarboxylative) allylic etherification, stereoselective
intramolecular amidomercuration, and olefin metathesis reactions, can provide
extremely general and efficient strategies for the asymmetric synthesis of the
core structural motifs of many biologically significant and synthetically
challenging compounds such as (polyhydroxylated) pyrrolidine and piperidine
rings, (polyhydroxylated) indolizidine and pyrrolizidine rings, and aza-C-
glycosides.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Hyunsoo Han of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Texas at San Antonio. Professor Han's research efforts revolve
around the development of enantioselective (decarboxylative) allylic amidation
and etherification reactions for the formation of C-N/O bonds. Considering the
ubiquitous presence of C-N/O bonds in almost all biologically significant
organic compounds, successful development of this project will have an impact on
synthesis in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, and agricultural industries.
