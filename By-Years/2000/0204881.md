NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0204881 Mathematical Sciences: Pulse propagation and
capture in Bragg grating optical fibers

Abstract

0204881 Goodman

This project studies the interaction of waves with localized structures,
through mathematical analysis, asymptotics, and numerical simulation. Motivating
this study are simulations in which light, travelling through a specialized
Bragg grating optical fiber, is stopped upon reaching a specially engineered
defect at a given location in the fiber. A heuristic hypothesis has been put
forward to explain how and why this trapping of light occurs. The project aims
to understand the mechanism behind this light capture, and to use this
understanding to improve the efficiency and usefulness of this process. A main
tool is the derivation and analysis of ordinary differential equations that
model the interaction of the light pulse with the localized defect. In order to
gain intuition about this physical problem, the project will look at related
problems in other nonlinear wave equations.

In modern optical communications, information is sent as pulses of light through
glass fibers. To process the information requires light pulses to be manipulated
or redirected as they travel. This project investigates the possibility of
"trapping" light at a given point in an optical fiber, which could be useful as
a component of optical communication devices, for example as a component in an
optical memory unit. The project will also look at similar problems of wave
trapping in physical systems that are described by similar underlying equations.
