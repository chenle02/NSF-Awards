B. Holly Smith SBR- 9408408 A comparison of the pattern of human development
with that of other primates and mammals shows that our "life history" is
particulary extreme, characterized by prolonged juvenile development, long life,
extremely helpless infants, and a short duration of breast feeding, among other
features. Classic work in primatology suggests that the dentition is closely
adated to growth rate and other life cycle characteristics. This research
project will, by establishing a large comparative data set on the development of
the teeth in primates and other mammals, establish a framework that will allow
the retrieval of the evolution of life history descriptions from the fossil
record. Research will investigate how the state of the dentition at birth,
sequence and age of tooth emergence, are related to precosity of the young at
birth, age of weaning, overall growth rate in sepcies, and so on. It is a novel
and important approach to old questions. P\anthro\jfried\9408408.abs
