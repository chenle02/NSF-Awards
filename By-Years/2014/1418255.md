This project is to develop theoretic foundations and practical algorithms for
geometric analysis of massive, weighted graphs arising from computer networking
applications. The main challenge of understanding large scale computer
networking is the decentralized management and operations on the network. How
the global behaviors (for example, congestion) emerge from decentralized, local
operations (routing) is still a mystery. Differential geometry studies the
connection of local structures (such as curvatures) and global properties (such
as topology and geodesics). Geometric analysis theorems often naturally lead to
distributed algorithms that achieve global objectives, which is ideal in
networking applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project generalizes classical
geometric analysis methods to massive graphs, the theoretic exploration focuses
on the curvatures on graphs and the heat kernel estimates, relation between
optimal transportation on graphs and curvatures, Ricci flow on graphs, and
homology/cohomology/homotopy groups on directed graphs. The theoretic results
will be applied for studying fundamental problems in computer networks,
including: 1) Geodesics and network congestion: which aims to understand the
connection of network congestion (e.g., on the Internet) with network curvature,
and try to apply Ricci flow to alleviate network congestion by modifying local
curvature; 2) Graph embedding and efficient routing: which investigates how to
find an embedding of the network in geometric space in order to support greedy
routing; and 3) Resource allocation in wireless networks: which applies optimal
transport theory to the problem of capacitated base station allocation. The
research results will be useful for applications in a broad range of fields,
from pure mathematics research to theoretic physics, from telecommunication in
engineering to brain imaging in medicine.
