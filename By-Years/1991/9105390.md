The polydeformed metasedimentary rocks of northern New England have a complex
history of ductile deformation that occurred during the Devonian Acadian
Orogeny. New models for the sequence of deformations have been proposed, and
this project will test them using exposures in the Presidential Range of
northern New Hampshire where the possible root zone for Acadian thrust-nappes
occurs. The pressures and temperatures during deformation will be determined and
the timing of deformation will be constrained by radiometric age techniques.
Results, in conjunction with other studies in New England, are expected to
clarify the complex late Paleozoic polydeformations that affected New England.
