0424799: "Dynamics of Low-Frequency Modes of the Atmospheric
Circulation"&lt;br/&gt;Fei-Fei Jin, Albert I. Barcilon, and Ming Cai, Florida
State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will explore the interaction between synoptic scale transients and
lower-frequency planetary scale flow anomalies, such as the North Atlantic
Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, Antarctic Oscillation, and Pacific North
American anomaly. This involves sets of equations for the slowly varying flow
and the anomalies superimposed upon it, and includes a closure scheme for the
eddies. A hierarchy of dynamical models, including quasi-geostrophic and
primitive equation models, together with reanalysis data sets, will be used to
systematically study the proposed synoptic eddy and low-frequency flow feedback
and the dynamics of the low frequency modes. Building upon the success of the
dynamical closures of this feedback mechanism, the atmospheric response to the
sea surface temperature anomalies, and the role of extratropical air-sea
interaction in the persistence of the low frequency modes, particularly the
North Atlantic Oscillation, will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The low-
frequency variability of the atmosphere has important consequences for the
everyday life of citizens and the fate of businesses, corporations, and
ecosystems, and this project is expected to benefit all these communities.
Support is provided for one post-doctoral associate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
