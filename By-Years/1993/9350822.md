9350822 Mertzman The EDAX Component of a Scanning Electron Microscope An energy
dispersive x-ray microanalytical system (EDAX) for a scanning electron
microscope is being used by the students in the geosciences department and to a
lesser extent by students in physics and biology. The curriculum is being
impacted by this instrumentation throughout the four year undergraduate
experience. To get the students excited about science and to show them what is
possible in order to fire their imaginations, students are making use of the
instrumentation at least twice in each of the introductory courses, dynamic
earth and oceanography. Sophomore and junior required geosciences courses,
particularly the lab experiences in sedimentology, mineralogy, petrology,
structure, and paleontology are being modified considerably in light of access
to this instrumentation. The microworld is now accessible to chemical
characterization in addition to the macroworld. The breadth of experience, the
depth, and the sheer number of undergraduate research opportunities is being
substantially increased. Students from outside our institution are being
impacted by this improvement, too, through our very active participation with
eleven other geology departments in the Keck Geology Consortium. ***y
