The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Hoggard in an
investigation of the electronic spectroscopy of metal complexes. The positions
of sharp electronic absorption features in coordinated metals depend sensitively
upon the exact geometry not only of the nearest coordinating atoms, but also of
atoms further removed from the metal atom. Experimental and theoretical
developments in this research are characterizing and interpreting these effects,
yielding structural information for a variety of complexes both in crystals and
solutions. Eventual extension to the gas phase or to surface-adsorbed complexes
is possible. The initial work will use various convenient transitions in
chromium(III) to determine bite and twist angles in bidentate chelate complexes,
to examine phase coupling between coordinated atoms connected by a conjugated
pi-electron system in a chelating ligand, and to pinpoint bonding geometry two
atoms removed from the metal center in appropriate ligands.
