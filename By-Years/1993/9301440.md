9301440 Terray The project goal is to study the physics of the coupled air and
water surface boundary layers. The study is based on analyses of existing data
collected during two prior experiments (WAVES and SMILE). Some of the important
research topics to be undertaken in this project are: (1) the research is
pertinent to an improved understanding of the microscale features of air-sea
interaction, (2) the research is potentially beneficial to the improvement of
the formulation of air-sea fluxes in coupled models of atmosphere- ocean
systems, and (3) the research seeks to address fundamental issues about
processes critical to the physics and biology of the ocean-atmosphere interface.
