This award will support a combined theoretical and observational program to
study supernovae, which are the explosive events accompanying the death of
massive stars. The particular focus of this project is a new class of
hyperluminous supernovae, of which five are known. There are currently several
possibilities for the sources of these supernovae, including massive pair-
instability supernovae or the interaction of the explosion with a dense
circumstellar shell. Dr. Wheeler and his group will develop new techniques to
fit models of the evolution of supernova brightness with time in order to learn
about mass loss from the progenitor stars. They will also explore Type Ia
supernovae with optical spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry in order to
understand progenitor evolution, the physics of the explosions, and the use of
supernovae for accurate cosmological measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is expected to have a broad scientific impact in the areas of stellar
evolution, galactic evolution, and cosmology, and will contribute to the
Nation's scientific future by integrating research and education by training
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Dr. Wheeler will also continue his
efforts to communicate scientific results to the public.
