This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
support for fifteen young scientists to participate in the International
Symposium on Photochemistry and Photophysics to be held in Summer 1997 at Saint
Michael's College in Vermont. Graduate students, postdoctoral students, and
assistant professors otherwise unable to attend the conference will be supported
to make an oral or poster presentation at the conference. The prestigious
biennial conference is being held for the twelfth time, but only the second time
in the United States. A distinguished group of internationally-known chemists
from around the world will participate. Proceedings will be published in the
journal `Coordination Chemistry Reviews.` The U.S. organizers of the conference
are Dr. John C. Van Houten of Saint Michael's College, Dr. Richard Eisenberg of
the University of Rochester, and Dr. Morton Hoffman of Boston University.
