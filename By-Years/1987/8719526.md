Relativistic nuclear field theories are being studied as an alternative to the
description of the nucleus as a classical quantum many-body system. Particular
effort is being directed at the problem of accurately calculating quantum
corrections to the mean field equations and identifying signatures of such
corrections in experimental data. The problem of correctly incorporating the
pion into quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), where the fundamental constituents are
taken as baryons and mesons, is also a major objective. This problem is closely
related to the calculation of quantum corrections, and it provides a vehicle for
exploring several nonperturbative approaches. This research is directed toward
the development of a description of the nucleus which properly incorporates
subnucleonic particles and interactions discovered in high reactions and seeks
to unify nuclear physics to the unifying theory of quantum chromodynamics.
