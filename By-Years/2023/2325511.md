Understanding the close interconnection between turbulence and reconnection has
been of increasing importance to the broader heliospheric community. Turbulence
is a fundamental physics process of transferring energy from large-scale motions
to small kinetic scales where the turbulence energy is dissipated as plasma heat
and particle energization. Magnetic reconnection is a universal physical process
that converts magnetic energy to plasma kinetic and thermal energy. Both
processes critically influence the dynamics and energetics of systems such as
the solar corona, solar wind, and planetary magnetospheres. The goal of this
project is to improve the understanding of the interconnection between
reconnection and turbulence. The project will support the research of a female
scientist PI, provide research opportunities to undergraduate students at
Dartmouth College, and create education resources for high school students.

Magnetic reconnection has been observed in turbulent environments such as the
solar wind and the Earthâ€™s magnetosheath. In the magnetosheath, recent detection
of electron-only reconnection has motivated increasing research in heliophysics.
Electron-only and standard reconnection have been suggested to contribute to
energy dissipation of the turbulence and changes in the turbulent cascade by
spacecraft observations, simulations, and theory. Our knowledge on the physics
underlying how reconnection influences turbulence and vice versa is at the early
stages of development. The main goal of this project is to develop a new method
for identifying and examining electron-only and standard reconnection using
gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. This will be achieved through
addressing three science objectives. The first objective is to identify
electron-only reconnection in fully nonlinear kinetic turbulence. The second
objective is to examine the evolution of electron-only reconnection in Alfvenic
turbulence. The third objective is to assess the role of electron-only and
standard reconnection in the energy dissipation of magnetized turbulence.
