This conference presents research on language users' knowledge of speech sounds
and rules, known as phonology, and how phonology is put to use by brain
mechanisms during speaking and listening - with a focus on measures of
electrical activity in the brain related to these cognitive functions. The
research presentations contribute to a deeper understanding of how the brain
supports the use of language. By holding the conference at the Linguistics
Society of America (LSA) Summer Institute, the project effectively supports
attendance by students who are already participating in the summer institute and
helps to make such research accessible to a broad audience of both undergraduate
and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG)
measures the electrical currents and oscillations generated by cognitive and
sensory processes during language processing. Experimental paradigms such as
Mismatch Negativity have elucidated which aspects of linguistic representations
must be put into a brain-language model of how the sensory and cognitive system
detects linguistically relevant information in the acoustic signal and
translates it into discrete mental representations of linguistic units. This
conference synthesizes EEG research with work in phonological theory, creating
new avenues for linguistic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
