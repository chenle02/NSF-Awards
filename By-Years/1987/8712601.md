This project is form the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics. Research experience is
provided in the areas of nuclear physics, particle physics, and solid state
materials and surface technology, infrared spectroscopy, and environmental
physics. About a dozen faculty members are involved with the student
participants. All student participants will attend a seminar series designed for
the program and will present talks on their summer activities. This project is
supported under the Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help
ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the future.
