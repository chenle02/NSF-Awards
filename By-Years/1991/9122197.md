In this project, Dr. Henryk Matyja of the Warsaw University of Technology
Institute of Materials Science and Engineering will perform materials research
in cooperation with Dr. Takeshi Egami of the University of Pennsylvania under
the US-Poland Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund on "Pulse Annealing of Metallic
Glasses." Metallic glasses, being thermodynamically unstable, undergo structural
changes upon heating, involving relaxation and crystallization. The researchers
will focus on the effect of rapid Joule heating on the following properties: (1)
viscosity, relaxation and glass transition; (2) crystallization behavior; and
(3) atomic structure. This project in materials research fulfills the program
objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
