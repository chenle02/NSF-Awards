The general objective of this research is to advance our understanding of the
chemical processes controlling trace element distribution and mobility in
tropical surficial environments. Specifically, an integrated field and
laboratory study is proposed to examine the hypothesis that adsorption processes
and vegetative uptake are dominant chemical controls in humid, lateritic
terrains. This research will involve close cooperation between Brazilian and
American researchers. The field site is in an undeveloped region of Brazil
containing Cu, Mo and Au mineralization. The field sampling strategy is designed
to determine the distribution and dispersion of these elements in the soils,
waters and vegetation of the area. The mineralogy of lateritic terrains is
dominated by Fe and Al oxides, kaolinite and quartz which makes adsorption
processes, in principle, less difficult to assess than in soils containing a
more complex mineralogy. To this end laboratory studies will determine
parameters necessary to model adsorption processes including ambient pH, pHzpc,
and surface area in addition to conducting adsorption experiments, investigating
trace element phase associations using selective dissolution analyses and
modeling these results with available adsorption models. Lateritic soils occupy
large areas in tropical and sub-tropical regions and our study will increase our
understanding in several areas related to the use of these terrains including
soil fertility, pollution episodes, weathering regimes and rates, and
geochemical exploration.
