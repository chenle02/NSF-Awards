The Museum of Science is initiating a unique approach to its permanent exhibits
which concentrates on the process of learning science rather than on the facts
to be learned. The first stage, development of "Seeing the Unseen", one of six
activity centers, is the focus of this proposal. Guided by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science's call for reforms in science
teaching and by recent research on learning styles, the Museum will organize its
exhibits around six "activity centers". Each center introduces a basic skill,
such as observation or experimentation, and prompts a visitor to use the new
method in special surrounding exhibits. The project is a breakthrough approach
to science learning in the museum setting because it encourages visitors to
discover for themselves characteristic scientific activities and habits of
analysis. Although the Museum will use many current exhibits in the layout of
the new plan, many others will be created which engage visitors interactively in
learning science. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $18 million.
