Evolutionary patterns and processes are imprinted in the three-dimensional (3D)
structure of nucleic acid molecules. In this project, an approach that embeds
structure and function directly into phylogenetic analysis is used to search for
these patterns and processes in the structure of several functional RNA.
Structural features are treated as ordered multi-state cladistic characters, and
the transformation from one character state to another is 'polarized' by
invoking an evolutionary tendency towards molecular order. This novel approach
allows reconstruction of evolutionary histories directly from topological,
thermodynamic and statistical features in molecules. This makes possible a
'direct' evolutionary tracing of functional properties linked to structural
characteristics. The project addresses basic questions such as the origin and
diversification of life and the genetic code, and the role of lateral gene
transfer in evolution. Its ultimate goal is the identification of processes
driving the evolution of RNA structure. Specific objectives include (1)
phylogenetic analysis of RNA at different evolutionary levels in molecules such
as transfer (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA); (2) evolutionary tracing of
geometric and statistical characters describing functional and statistical
mechanical properties; (3) phylogenomic analysis of RNA structure using a
molecular morphospace that describes the architecture and biophysics of RNA at a
universal level; and (4) development of evolutionary models inferred from
patterns of character change.

The goal of the project is to establish direct evolutionary links between
structure and function in macromolecules, focusing on RNA. This knowledge should
provide manifold benefits for the biological sciences. RNA molecules are
important catalysts and play crucial roles in cellular processes, such as the
modulation of gene expression by noncoding RNA molecules, the translational
tagging of proteins, and the targeted degradation of mRNA. RNA structure is also
crucial for sequence selection in antisense targeting applications.
Understanding the evolution of RNA will ultimately help investigators to
understand the history of our natural world and to address issues concerning its
future.
