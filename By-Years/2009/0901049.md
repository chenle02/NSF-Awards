"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's research areas are
number theory and representation theory.  In particular, the investigator
studies p-adic Galois representations and p-adic Hodge theory, with an eye
towards applications to the modularity of Galois representations and the
Langlands program.  The PI will undertake several projects organized around the
theme of p-adic representations and their reduction modulo p.  He will study the
weight in Serre's conjecture for arbitrary split reductive groups and arbitrary
number fields, with the goal of giving an explicit Serre weight recipe in
considerable generality.  The investigator will produce evidence for
generalizations of the Breuil-Mezard conjecture, and will prove some cases of
such a generalization, with applications to the Langlands program.  Another
component of the project involves the explicit reduction modulo p of certain
p-adic Galois representations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is one of the
oldest branches of mathematics.  At its most fundamental, number theory is the
study of whole number solutions to equations, although sophisticated modern
techniques can sometimes give the appearance of being rather far-removed from
this goal. In recent decades, number theory has had revolutionary applications
to the fields of cryptography (creating codes) and cryptanalysis (breaking
codes). For instance, most cellular telephone communications are protected by a
cryptosystem based on elliptic curves, one of the primary objects of study in
the investigator's field. The PI is one of the directors of Canada/USA Mathcamp,
a summer program for mathematically talented high school students, and believes
it is vital that research-active mathematicians participate in such
endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
