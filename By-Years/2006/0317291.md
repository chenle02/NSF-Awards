This project focuses on the study of basic kinetic processes in strongly non-
equilibrium, high-pressure molecular plasmas. Unlike ordinary thermal plasmas,
which are formed by simply heating a gas to high temperature, non-equilibrium
plasmas are formed by the input of energy into specific internal energy states,
in this case, molecular vibrations. This provides a unique plasma environment in
which the degree of ionization is significant, yet the temperature is quite low
(order room temperature). This low temperature enables a wide variety of
practical engineering devices and processes including, to name only a few,
plasma chemical reactors, pollution control systems, and molecular lasers.
However, achieving the full commercial and/or military potential of such high
pressure non-equilibrium plasma-based systems requires that the overall input
power be reduced by at least one to two orders of magnitude below that presently
required. Fundamentally, the power requirements are high because the rate at
which electrons are dissipated in the plasma, by recombination with positive
ions and/or attachment to neutrals is quite rapid, particularly in the presence
of oxygen. The traditional approach for overcoming this rapid loss of electrons
is to increase the input power, in order to increase the rate at which electrons
are produced. The goal of this study, however, is to explore kinetic mechanisms
for reducing the rate of loss. Specifically, experimental measurements will be
performed in an crossed electron-beam / CO laser non-equilibrium plasma
generation apparatus, and will feature utilization of a full suite of diagnostic
and computational tools, including a high sensitivity spectrally filtered
Thomson scattering instrument for determination of spatially and temporally
resolved electron density and temperature. This project is jointly funded by the
Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by
the Chemical and Transport Systems Division in the Directorate for Engineering.
