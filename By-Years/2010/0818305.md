Carlson, Bruce A IOS-0818390 Collaborative Research: Mechanisms of Signal
Diversity in Electric Fish Communication In this collaborative project,
researchers from Cornell University in Ithaca and Washington University in St.
Louis will explore the mechanisms responsible for the large-scale
diversification of animal communication signals. The mormyrids are a diverse
group of fishes from Africa that communicate using species-specific electric
organ discharges (EODs) that are essential for species recognition. However,
some species are polymorphic, with different individuals having distinct EOD
forms and correspondingly different electric organ morphology. This project will
focus on the polymorphic species Paramormyrops kingsleyae as a microcosm of
electric signal evolution throughout the mormyrids. The researchers will use a
combination of field work, molecular genetic techniques, electrophysiology, and
behavioral playback experiments to determine the genetic basis for electric
signal diversity in P. kingsleyae, and the importance of this diversity in
driving reproductive isolation between populations and adapting different
populations to their particular environments. The results of these studies will
lead to specific hypotheses about the root causes of electric signal
diversification throughout the mormyrids, which the researchers will test using
similar techniques across a wide range of species. This research will prove
broadly applicable by providing a mechanistic understanding of how animal
communication signals diversify, as well as insight into the ultimate causes for
this diversification and the resulting consequences for speciation and the
evolution of communication behavior. Broader impacts: The project includes an
educational outreach program for public school students, which uses electric
fish to provide hands-on demonstrations for linking basic concepts in the
physical sciences and biology. In addition, the researchers will create an
online searchable database of electric signals that researchers, students, and
the general public will be able to access. This database will be used to archive
and catalogue thousands of EODs collected during more than 20 years of field
work in Africa.
