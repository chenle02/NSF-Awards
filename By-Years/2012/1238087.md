Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Arthropod Management Technologies

The proposed Center for Arthropod Management Technologies (CAMTech) will
streamline and link the efforts of industry and academia toward effective
management of arthropod pests through a formalized and extended research
partnership. The research efforts will be anchored by Iowa State University
(ISU) as the lead institution, partnered with the University of Kentucky (UKY).

The proposed Center comprised of Iowa State University and the University of
Kentucky will serve as an incubator for novel technologies. CAMTech will provide
the basic research foundation necessary for the applied research goals of
industry and will extend the utility of current arthropod management practices.
An interdisciplinary team of 26 faculty members has been assembled with UK
researchers extending and complementing the skills and expertise of ISU
researchers. The goals of CAMTech will be to (i) conduct pre-competitive
research and transfer knowledge to industrial partners for in house development,
(ii) optimize and extend the versatility of current technologies, and (iii)
train undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars for
potential future employment within industry.

The diverse team of researchers will provide knowledge of fundamental systems
relevant to arthropod management, including those of hemipteran pests, allowing
Center members to derive value from fundamental research and to expand the
utility of current approaches. Students and postdoctoral researchers within the
proposed Center will receive outstanding professional development training at
both ISU and UKY. Center trainees, including minorities and underrepresented
groups, will be drawn from diverse backgrounds. Research findings will be
disseminated internationally. Establishment of this Center will enhance the
partnerships between industry and academia toward a common goal, and will have a
significant broader impact through technology transfer. Society will benefit
directly from the expedited development of novel arthropod management
technologies and from well trained personnel for industrial positions.
