Kenneth Showalter of West Virginia University is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program and the Applied Mathematics program for
research on spatiotemporal dynamics in chemical systems. Three main areas of
research are being carried out: controlling and characterizing stabilized
reaction-diffusion waves in a distributed photosensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky
medium; modeling disease spread using addressable excitable media; and studying
spatiotemporal behavior in the Peroxidase-Oxidase reaction. The research
involves a combination of experiment and numerical simulation. The work will
have an impact on other areas of science, particularly the understanding of
excitable media and epidemiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded
by the Applied Mathematics program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division
under the umbrella of the NSF-wide Mathematical Sciences Priority Area.
