9414740 Kumosa This research will investigate mixed mode fracture and failure
mechanisms in polymer matrix composites and adhesively bonded polymer composite
systems subjected to biaxial loading conditions. This research will
significantly contribute to the understanding of high temperature mixed mode
micro- and macro-fracture mechanisms in unidirectional polymer matrix composites
caused by biaxial loading and provide new insights into the mixed mode failure
of adhesively bonded polymer composite systems tested under static and cyclic
loading conditions under biaxial loading. A possible practical significance of
the proposed work is that the biaxial test method being proposed can become a
standard test for mixed mode fracture analysis of many advanced composite
systems over a wide temperature range. ***
