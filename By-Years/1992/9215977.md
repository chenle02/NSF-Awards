This award supports planning activity to develop a continuing grant proposal
for the Institutional Infrastructure-Minority Institutions (II-MI) program.
During the period supported, an advisory panel of professionals from academia
and industry will be formed to advise on the development of computer science and
engineering education and research, trips will be made to some of the
institutions holding II-MI grants, and relationships will be established with
three of the high performance computing centers. The main research focus will be
in the area of advanced scientific computing. The outcome will be the
preparation and submission of a comprehensive five-year proposal.
