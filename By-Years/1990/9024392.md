The Southern Oscillation (SO) and the equatorial quasi- biennial oscillation
(QBO) are related to significant interannual variability in the extratropical
winter troposphere and especially, stratosphere. This research will examine the
relative roles of the QBO and SO in crating winter-season climate anomalies on
interannual timescales. A "deep" 26-level climate version of the NCAR general
circulation model (Community climate Model) will be used to examine the
trosphere-stratosphere system with the object of providing a unified view of
interannual wintertime climate variability and its relation to the SO or QBO.
The SO and QBO are viewed as interannually varying external forcing agents for
the extratropical winter hemisphere. Since winter-season interannual variability
is grater in the stratosphere than the troposphere, the research will
concentrate on the stratospheric climate anomalies. By using a general
circulation model, it is intended to isolate mechanisms capable of communicating
the tropical forcing anomalies, SO or QBO, to the extratropical winter
atmosphere, and two such mechanisms are proposed. Separate winter season
integrations under opposite extremes of the SO or QBO will be performed to
determine the atmospheric responses to the SO and QBO. Such information is
especially important in the stratosphere where it has not been possible to
distinguish clearly between the effects of the SO and the QBO in the
observational climate record.
