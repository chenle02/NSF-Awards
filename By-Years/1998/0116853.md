With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Los Angeles will
acquire a 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out studies on a) oligosaccharide-based glycodendrimers; b) synthesis of
specific molecular probes; c) complex natural products and analogues; d) modular
synthesis and polyhedral surface modification of carboranes; e) endohedral metal
complexes of fullerenes; and f) interlocked molecules in electronic devices.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular nanochemistry.
