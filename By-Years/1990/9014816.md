The purpose of this research is to perform a systematic study of drawing-
augmented hydrostatic extrusion for the production of ultrafine wire from soft
materials on an existing unit. The program will include: (A) Stability
optimization of the 63,000 pound per square inch laboratory unit for augmented
hydrostatic extrusion of ultrafine wires; (B) Upper-bound analysis of the
process including hydrodynamic lubrication effects; (C) Demonstration of unit
capabilities for extruding ultrafine aluminum, aluminum-silicon, and gold wire
and for cladding of ceramic super-conductor wires, including experimental
studies to determine the effects of reduction ratios, die angles, speed,
potential lubrication/pressure media and other variables on the process. The
combination of both the experimental and analytical work is fundamental to the
program. The analysis will improve the understanding of the process, while the
experimental phase will demonstrate the utility of new information and improved
process capability. The complete program will provide a definition of the
capabilities and limitations of augmented hydrostatic extrusion for the
production of ultrafine wire. This research will extend the upper limits on
speed and reduction through the development of the understanding of the process.
This understanding will lead to the development of algorithms for the control
system, as well as to its implementation.
