This project involves a two day workshop in Atlanta for Chairpersons of Computer
Science or Computer Engineering Departments from all minority institutions which
grant a baccalaureate degree in computer science or engineering. Further, one
additional person (e.g., the Academic Vice- President) from each institution
will be invited using institutional funds. The purpose of the workshop is to:
Acquaint the participants with relevant support programs in the Computer and
Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate of the National Science
Foundation. Seek advice on support programs needed by predominantly minority
institutions to strengthen both research and academic programs in activities
supported by the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.
Conduct an intense proposal writing and evaluation workshop using draft
proposals developed prior to the workshop by participants and evaluated by
participant reviewers and NSF staff.
