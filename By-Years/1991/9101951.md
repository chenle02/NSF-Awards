This applicant proposes to study cellular and molecular mechanisms for memory
storage in the brain. Specifically, the study is expected to focus on the role
of the calcium-calmodulin complex in regulation of the gene expression of
proenkephalin and the induction and maintenance of mossy fiber long-term
potentiation. The work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Joe
Martinez at the University of California, Berkeley.
