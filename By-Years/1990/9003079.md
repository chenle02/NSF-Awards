Interspecific, environmental and development differences in biotic and chemical
defense systems of myrmecophytic Cecropia trees will be studied in relation to
plant associations with herbivores and symbotic ants in Amazonian rain forest.
Seedlings of six Cecropia species will be grown from seed under high and low
light regimes in temperate greenhouse and transplant gardens in southeastern
Peru'. Ant attracting traits, leaf tannin concentrations, and toughness will be
monitored in relation to plant performance, especially growth rates and leaf
lifetimes (thought to determine the pattern of investment in chemical and ant-
defense). Performance data on transplanted seedlings with and without herbivores
will test specific hypotheses for habitat specificity in these trees. Short-term
experiments with cultivated seedlings will test for 1) habitat and host
specificity in four specialized symbiotic ants; 2) rates of host resource supply
to ants as a determinant of the species composition of symbiotic relationships:
3) habitat and species specificity in effects of different ants on herbivory
rates, host performances, and colony growth and reproduction. Natural seedling
populations are used to investigate species specificity in host choice by queens
and host mechanisms for excluding certain ants. Results of studies will be
synthesized to test hypotheses that: plant resource environments determine
predictable patterns of investment in alternative defense systems and patterns
of defense investment determine the species composition of ant-plant
associations. Findings will contribute to basic ecological science and will also
add to the knowledge base on the biodiversity of tropical forests. //
