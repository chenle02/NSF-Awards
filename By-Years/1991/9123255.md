It is generally agreed that there is a better than 50% chance that a very severe
earthquake will strike somewhere in the United States within the next thirty
years. The vulnerability of the eastern portion of North America is of
particular concern. Since very few structures in the East have been designed for
earthquakes, and there are more tall buildings in the East than in the West, the
subject is very urgent. This project by the Structural Stability Research
Council is to examine earthquake stability problems in Eastern North America
through the holding of a Technical Session in Pittsburgh 7-8 April 1992, the
dissemination of findings through a set of Proceedings to the public research
domain, and through eventual recommendations for research studies and design
approaches. The Technical Session will include the presentation of reports on
current stability-related research projects. A special feature will be the Theme
Session and Panel Discussion which will address the topic of "Earthquake
Stability Problems in Eastern North America." During the Theme Session, invited
researchers will present the results of their recent investigations. The Panel
Discussion involves a group of engineers who will discuss issues related to
consideration of earthquake stability problems in design practice. State-of-the-
art design specifications and issues not specifically addressed by design
specifications will be discussed. The technical program will focus on the topics
of P-delta effect, dynamic effects, connections, shells and tubes, plate
structures and electrical transmission. The completion of this project shall
constitute a significant step toward the identification and resolution of
Eastern North America earthquake stability problems.
