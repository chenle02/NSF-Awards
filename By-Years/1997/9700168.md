9700168 Wang Researchers will study spin dependent tunnelling junctions
consisting of two ferromagnetic electrode layers separated by an insulating
barrier layer. The growth, structure and performance of such junctions
fabricated from Heusler alloys will be investigated. These devices have
significant technological potential in magentic RAM, sensors and recording
heads. ***
