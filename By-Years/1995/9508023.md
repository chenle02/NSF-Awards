9508023 Kay One of the big stumbling blocks in understanding Central Andean
magmatic source regions has been the lack of chemical constraints from
primitive, mantle-derived basalt. Analyses from basalts of this type have been
touted as the required ingredient in making progress. Within this framework, the
recent discovery of two Pleistocene primitive basaltic lavas is extremely
significant. The major objective of this project is to collect and "completely"
analyses a suite of the mafic lavas outcropping in the southern Central Volcanic
Zone. Mapping and sampling is being supported by Chilean and Argentine agencies
in collaboration with South American colleagues Mpodozis and Coira. A "complete"
analyses means determining a full range of major and trace element by INAA, ICP-
MS, XRF and microprobe techniques, as well as Pb, Nd and Sr isotopes. These
analyses will fill an important gap in compilations of primitive mafic lavas in
arcs and provide a basis for beginning to unravel the complex mantle processes
occurring beneath the thickened Andean Crust.
