A large portion of this proposal considers L-functions attached to geometric
Galois representations arising from families of exponential sums. Previous
studies have focused on techniques from l-adic representation theory since they
are especially amenable to degree computations via Euler characteristic and
bounds for the weights of the zeros and poles. The PI proposes a p-adic study of
such L-functions using techniques inspired by Dwork, Adolphson, Sperber, Robba,
Wan, et al.. This would be a general study including many common archetypes,
such as the generalized Airy family, the hyper-Kloosterman family, and the Dwork
family. Other aspects of the proposal focus upon a continuation of the p-adic
study of the zeta function of divisors, and a&lt;br/&gt;continuation of the
study into the arithmetic similarities and differences of mirror
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Galois representations encode many deep and
significant problems within number theory. In fact, it was through their study
that the celebrated Fermat's Last theorem was finally settled in the affirmative
by Wiles et al. in 1995. More recently, Serre's conjecture, which implies
Fermat, and the Sato-Tate conjecture, also came down to statements about Galois
representations. Galois representations are frequently studied by their
associated L-function. This is simply a function which encodes much, if not
essentially all, of the Galois representation. Even the most elementary
questions about these L-functions are still largely unknown. For instance, the
Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture describing the precise location of the zeros
of the L-function attached to a specific Galois representation. In this
proposal, the PI plans to study Galois representations which arise from
geometric situations using, and extending, tools from p-adic analysis.
