Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches - The objective
of this research is to advance the solution processed hybrid triple-junction
photovoltaic technology to 15% efficiency. The approaches are comprehensive and
include: design of organic donor and acceptor materials with high efficiency and
spectrum-matched absorption; a solution processed inorganic solar cell to cover
the near-IR spectrum; novel interlayer and hybrid tandem solar cells; and novel
transparent electrodes to realize all solution processed hybrid tandem solar
cells. 15% efficiency will be a milestone for low-cost high efficiency solar
cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit - Renewable energy is crucial for
sustainable economic development and environmental protection. The proposed
research represents a new front in solar cell research and integrates both
chemistry and materials science to generate new perspectives in science and
offer solutions to challenging sustainable energy issues. We aim to contribute
to our national energy security and a greener economy by achieving a
breakthrough in solution processed high efficiency solar cells. This project
will not only give us device success, but enrich our understanding of
fundamental physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts - The proposed
research will impact the national and global effort in developing new
sustainable energy strategies and technologies, thus impact our nation?s economy
and improve environmental quality by reducing the use of fossil fuels. This
project offers students (from high school to graduate-level) the opportunity to
learn the skills to face future scientific challenges. The team has strong
partnerships with the private sector through patent licensing, which will
continue and greatly benefit the US economy.
