An extensive body of research indicates that following central nervous system
injury, there is often a naturally- occurring compensatory reorganization of
surviving neural pathways. The behavioral consequences of such reorganization
are largely unknown, although some types of reorganization seem to contribute to
functional recovery. In these cases, however, it is not clear exactly how the
reorganization contributes to the recovery that occurs. Dr. Steward's research
program, which has been supported by the National Science Foundation for the
past 13 years, has evaluated the functional consequences of the reorganization
which occurs in the hippocampus of the rat after damage to the entorhinal
cortex, one of the principle inputs to that brain region. The currently proposed
experiments will evaluate three hypotheses: (1) that fibers reinnervating the
hippocampus contribute to behavioral recovery as a result of the information
they convey, (2) that behavioral recovery results from a return of excitatory
driving and the consequent increase in activity of the denervated cells, and (3)
that behavioral recovery depends on both the restoration of excitatory drive and
on the information conveyed by the reinnervating fibers. This research will
determine whether neural activity plays a role in inducing synaptic
reorganization. It represents an important step toward understanding how to
manipulate the response of the nervous system to injury.
