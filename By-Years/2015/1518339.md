Brown dwarfs are key laboratories for understanding the differences between the
smallest stars and the largest extrasolar planets. This program will expand our
understanding of the coldest known brown dwarfs through a major observational
program to determine their physical properties down to about 5 times the mass of
Jupiter. Undergraduate and graduate students will develop expertise in two key
areas of ground-based astronomy, namely wide-field astrometry and laser guide
star adaptive optics. In parallel, the PI will formalize and enhance a
professional development initiative to teach graduate students the soft skills
needed for long-term success. This effort is geared towards enhancing students
as budding researchers, helping them navigate the complexities of academia, and
increasing retention along the career pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
observational program will use high-precision infrared astrometry to measure
distances, and thus absolute magnitudes and luminosities, for a well-defined
sample of the coolest brown dwarfs. High angular resolution adaptive optics
imaging will establish the multiplicity properties of these objects and yield
the coolest known binaries. Follow-up characterization of the binaries will
result in resolved spectrophotometry and dynamical masses, enabling the
strongest tests to date of substellar evolutionary models and ultracool
atmospheres.
