In this proposal, the investigator studies and develops a new, emerging
generation of discontinuous Galerkin methods characterized by being easier to
implement, by having enhanced stability and convergence properties, and by
displaying an improved flexibility for handling arbitrarily-shaped domains. The
investigator will focuses his effort in four particular problems. The first is
in the area of fluid flow and consists in establishing a general theory of very
competitive numerical methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The second is in the area of continuum mechanics and consists in the study of
optimally convergent methods for fourth-order problems in order to pave the way
to the devising of numerical methods for non-linear shells. The third is in the
area of non-linear conservation laws and consists in the introduction of new
techniques geared towards overcoming the two main difficulties that have dragged
down for more than a decade the development of efficient, high-order accurate
methods for these useful equations. The last is in the area of techniques for
handling curved boundaries and consists in replacing the traditional paradigm of
meshing the domain with high accuracy by the new approach of using a very simple
mesh of a box containing the domain and employing special approximation
techniques near its border.

The computer simulation of physical phenomena is a highly valued tool of
practical interest in a wide variety of applications in Engineering and Physics.
The investigator studies an emerging and promising technique of carrying out
these simulations with highly accurate and more efficient algorithms for a wide
range of problems of practical interest. They include many applications to
Aerospace and Mechanics (incompressible fluid flow, subsonic and supersonic
flow) as well as to Civil Engineering (solid structures).
