There has been exciting recent work involving interactions among Schubert
calculus (intersection theory on Grassmannians and related flag varieties),
eigenvalue and singular value problems in linear algebra, representation theory,
geometric invariant theory and related symplectic geometry. In addition to
solving the Horn conjecture about eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices, a
variety of related problems have been raised and are being solved. There are
quantum analogues of many of these problems, which are part of this project. The
project also involves a problem of enumerative geometry, and a more difficult
problem of constructing moduli spaces of subvarieties to resolve away multiple
components. Three writing projects, on stacks, toric varieties, and curves, have
each already led to some new research.

The proposed research concerns nine topics, most on the borders of algebraic
geometry with other areas. Much of algebraic geometry concerns the geometry of
quite general spaces. This research, however, concentrates on a collection of
special varieties which have a rich structure that one can hope to analyze in
detail. These arise in neighboring areas of mathematics, especially
representation theory, but also linear algebra, combinatorics, commutative
algebra, and symplectic geometry. For example, although the notion of quantum
cohomology -- which came from physics -- make sense in great generality, few
spaces have had their quantum cohomology thoroughly worked out, and we plan to
expand this knowledge in this project. Three book-writing projects are in
progress, two of which should be useful to graduate students in algebraic
geometry; the third is aimed at undergraduate mathematics majors.
