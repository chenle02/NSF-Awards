9321395 Hafner Pocket gophers and their louse parasites have been shown to have
similar phylogenetic (genealogical) histories. The proposed study analyses this
relationship in detail by examining pocket gophers and two groups of chewing
lice that parasitize the gophers. In addition it examines the historical
relationships between gophers and an internal parasite, the whipworms. The study
will compare phylogenies of gophers and their parasites using mitochondrial DNA
nucleotide sequence differentiation. These data offer an opportunity directly to
quantify the genetic change associated with the host and parasite phylogenies,
and to evaluate the historical importance of vertebrate host-parasite
associations.
