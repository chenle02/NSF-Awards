In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Thomas Farrar of
the University of Wisconsin will use NMR relaxation techniques to investigate
liquid phase interactions and hydrogen bonding between solvent and solute and
their effects on structure and dynamics. Experiments include measurements of the
temperature and solvent dependence of nuclear quadrupole coupling constants in
simple systems, characterization of spin coupling effects and their application
to solution phase structure and dynamics, and NMR and infrared studies to
determine the relationships between chemical shift tensors, quadrupole coupling
tensors, and force constants. Theoretical studies will also be conducted to
interpret these measurements in light of existing NMR relaxation theory and to
test the limits of current models. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies have
already provided a great deal of information on the way molecules interact with
one another in the liquid phase. Professor Farrar's work will help extend our
understanding of these interactions to more complex systems such as those
involving hydrogen bonding. Systems such as these are common in biochemistry,
and the results of this work may have important ramifications in this area
