9403053 Winker This U.S.-Mexico award will support Dr. Kevin Winker of the
Smithsonian Institution in a research collaboration with Dr. Patricia Escalante
of the Instituto de Biologia of the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The
researchers are conducting research on the population dynamics, systematics, and
habitat selection of neotropical birds in southern Veracruz, Mexico. For this
project, they intend to establish a broad network of researchers along the coast
by attracting and training young scientists and initiating timely, standardized
research on the avifauna of the region. The network's geographic scope will help
to establish a coastal database on avian distribution, abundance, habitat use,
and species-and subspecies-level systematics. Through this network of
collaborators, trained in modern, appropriate methods, significant progress can
be made in addressing the larger issues (coastal distribution, systematics,
habitat selection, and movement) that make this region very important from the
perspectives of avian evolution and conservation. ***
