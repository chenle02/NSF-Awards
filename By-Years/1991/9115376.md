This award supports a two year program that will use a technique known as
Doppler imaging to study the surface structure on certain types of stars. The
investigators will derive images of large star spots (analagous to sunspots on
our Sun) on cool binary stars. These spots trace the emergent magnetic flux and
the distribution and evolution of these spots over time provides fundamental
information on magnetic and convective processes in these stars. The research
program will continue to improve the Doppler imaging technique and provide long
term monitoring of several different stars and stellar systems.
