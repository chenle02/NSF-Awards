Mathematical research on computational group theory will be carried out by six
students in this Research Experiences for Undergraduates project. Students will
learn to apply the high level programming language CAYLEY in their
investigations into group structure. This language is designed around algebraic
concepts of structure, set and mapping. It contains an extensive data base of
group theoretic and geometric information. Students define structures and then
extract information about the structure. For example, a small finitely presented
group (of order less than 20,000) can be completely analyzed by CAYLEY:
conjugacy classes, subgroup lattice, normal subgroups and automorphism group.
Work will focus on two areas, typical values and counting in groups. The former
concept arises in probability when studying random samples. The sample means for
subsamples may form groups with respect to symmetric differences. If the
subsample means, or typical values, do form a group, then the intervals formed
by the means contain the true mean with a known probability. The commutativity
of group elements. This is a concept not usually accessible to researchers using
CAYLEY. Questions such as counting the number of group elements which commute
and calculating the probability that two elements commute will be taken up.
Follow-up will provide encouragement and assistance to help students with
publication and presentation of their results. Most will participate in the
annual Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Conference, begun in 1984.//
