Mathematical analysis provides quantitative tools that underpin other parts of
mathematics (linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, numerical
analysis, number theory). Among the most fundamental and widely applicable of
these tools are the Fourier transform, which implements the wave-particle
duality of quantum physics, and the concept of convolution. This project brings
together five themes. (i) The quantitative natures of the Fourier transform and
of convolution are expressed by various mathematical inequalities. (ii) The
Fourier transform is a manifestation of certain symmetries, and in turn is
governed by symmetries. (iii) Nonlinear partial differential equations, which
are ubiquitous in mathematical description of self-interacting physical systems,
often involve multilinear functionals. (iv) Multilinear functionals are often
governed by combinatorial issues, that is, by sophisticated counting problems.
(v) Natural laws are often expressed as minimization or maximization principles.
(For instance, general relativity posits that light travels along paths that
are, in a sense, shortest routes between spacetime points.) The project focuses
on a circle of topics in mathematical analysis in which these themes interact.
The goal is to discover and rigorously establish new inequalities, and
refinements of existing inequalities.

The goal of the project is insight into linear and multilinear functionals,
especially those manifesting Euclidean or other Abelian group structure.
Prototypes include the inequalities of Riesz-Sobolev, Brunn-Minkowski, Young,
and Hausdorff-Young. Both a priori upper bounds with nonexplicit constants, and
inequalities with explicit optimal constants, will be investigated. Special
attention will focus on the nature and quantitative properties of functions and
sets that maximize such functionals, or that nearly do so. Refined inequalities
will be developed, incorporating extra terms measuring structure, rather than
size; arithmetic progressions, intervals, ellipsoids, and convex sets are
fundamental structural objects. Extensions involving entropy and related
quantities will be investigated. Monotonicity of functionals under deformations
will be exploited, where available. Among the specific foci of attention are
stability of Holder-Brascamp-Lieb (HBL) multilinear inequalities, variants of
the Rogers-Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger functionals under relaxed symmetry
hypotheses, Schatten norms and mixed-norm versions of HBL inequalities, and
multilinear inequalities for compact and discrete Abelian groups.
