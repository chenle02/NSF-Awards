Cosmological observations using of a variety of different techniques have
provided consistent measurements of the density of mass and energy in our
Universe. These observations support a model of the universe in which the
present amount of nucleons (or baryons) accounted for is only a fraction of the
total amount of nucleons, the nucleons are only a part of the total amount of
matter, and matter is only a part of the total mass-energy of the universe, most
of it being in a mysterious form. Where are the missing nucleons? What is the
non-baryonic matter? What constitutes the rest of the energy? These questions
are the so-called dark matter and dark energy problems. The identification of
dark matter and the understanding of dark energy are among the major open
questions in physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The research outlined in this
proposal addresses theoretical and phenomenological aspects of these two
problems using several tools: finding new models to explain the nature of the
dark energy and ways to discriminate among them, studying the prospects of
detecting non-baryonic dark matter in the light of recent astrophysical progress
in the theory of galaxy formation, examining the formation of high
concentrations of dark matter around galactic black holes, and using
gravitational microlensing of unresolved stars to search for compact baryonic
objects in nearby galaxies. The dark matter and dark energy problems provide
abundant educational opportunities outside the traditional university setting.
First, cosmology has always been of great appeal to the general public. Second,
the research outlined in this proposal will use results from the largest galaxy
surveys and will deal with modelsof black holes. Both topics can be used to
produce attractive but scientifically sound visualizations of our location in
the Universe and of a journey into a black hole, respectively. Such
visualizations will then be in planetariums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
