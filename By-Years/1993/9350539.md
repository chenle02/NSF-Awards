93-50539 Shreeve Idaho Systemic Improvement Plan The state of Idaho has a
strategic vision - a clear image of what it wants to achieve - and a strategic
plan to reach its goals. The vision is simple, confident and reality-based: a)
to identify and develop a research capability in areas where Idaho
scientists/engineers can first establish regional preeminence and subsequently
to use that research strength and capacity to emerge as a national leader; b) to
have its institutions of higher education gain a national reputation for their
educational superiority based upon a foundation of individual fulfillment in a
dynamic environment which promotes growth in science, engineering and
mathematics education and research; and c) to have a network of activities which
provides for human resource development and which introduces faculty/student
research - and the knowledge that the research generates - to the region's
private sector industries and federal laboratories. The years of the Idaho NSF
EPSCoR I program (FY 1989-92) were extraordinary in terms of positioning the
state to reach these goals. EPSCoR I has helped Idaho to help itself. As a
result, the state is now fully committed to a systematic, systemic improvement
program for continuous development - in quality and quantity - in science and
engineering (S&amp;E) research and education at each of its institutions.
