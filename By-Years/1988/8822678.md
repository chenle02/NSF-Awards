In order to understand the interaction of the particles from the magnetosphere
of the earth in the terrestrial atmosphere both observations and theoretical
studies are important. The aurora that occurs primarily at the poles is a
manifestation of that interaction and theoretical considerations on the
mechanisms that produce the aurora are required. This project deals with various
wave-wave interactions that affect the particle energy and distribution in the
evening auroral acceleration region. Numerical modeling and analytic
calculations will be used to investigate the energy transfer between wave modes
by coherent and incoherent three-wave decay. The results of this study will
increase the understanding of plasma species temperatures, drifts and densities
related to the excitation of those waves in the auroral region. //
