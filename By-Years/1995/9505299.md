Jarrard 9505299 The hippocampus and adjacent brain structures (subiculum,
entorhinal cortex) have been implicated in the processes underlying learning and
memory. With this award, Dr. Jarrard will lead a group of undergraduate students
in studies of these brain regions. Selective inactivation will be used to test
the role of each structure in several different learning tasks. This work will
expand our understanding of the interconnected brain systems that subserve
different forms of memory. Furthermore, the project will provide valuable
training for young scientists in training. ***
