ABSTRACT An extension of a meshless method for the numerical solution of partial
differential equations based on radial basis functions is proposed. In
particular, the combination of (1) radial basis functions, (2) compact support,
and (3) multilevel algorithms is suggested for the collocation solution of
nonlinear partial differential equations. In this manner accurate and
computationally efficient algorithms can be designed. The research focuses on
the implementation of these algorithms, as well as the investigation of some
related theoretical issues such as convergence rates and well-posedness.

Partial differential equations play an important role in many areas of science
and engineering. They are at the core of many mathematical models used, e.g.,
meteorological models, molecular simulations in chemistry and physics,
simulations in such areas as semiconductor modeling, study of materials, fluid
dynamics, etc.. In this project we focus on the design of algorithms potentially
applicable to any of these areas. Algorithms for high-performance parallel
hardware are also considered. The tools employed (radial basis functions) are of
fairly recent origin (1980s), but are slowly being accepted by a growing number
of scientists and engineers. Their main advantage is that no complicated (and
expensive) underlying mesh structure is required as is for the standard finite
element or finite volume techniques.
