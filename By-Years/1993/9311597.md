9311597 Nocera This proposal is motivated by the challenge of rationally
designing magnetic substances. This research will exploit the structural control
available in layered materials to study the interplay between molecular
interactions and magnetic coupling. The intracrystalline environments of
phosphate layered hosts will provide the scaffolding to position organic
inorganic intercalants in well-defined relationships to the layers and to each
other. Magnetic intercalates of layered phosphate and phosphonate hosts will be
synthesized by redox and ion-exchange intercalation methods. Insertion of
specially designed isostructural organic and inorganic sets of para- or
diamagnetic guests will permit the probe of intralayer, layer-guest, guest-
guest, and higher order magnetic interactions. In the case of paramagnetic
intercalants, the roles of the open-shell orbitals' shape and alignment relative
to the layers can be assessed in connection with quest orientation within the
galleries. Finally, an exploratory path is outlined to assemble magnetic host
layers about paramagnetic quests. As this proposal addresses structural issues
of magnetic coupling, new strategies for the rational design of materials with
magnetically tailored properties will emerge. Additionally, the structure-
magnetism correlations assembled in this layered magnetic materials synthesis
program will provide impetus for the development of new predictive structural
theories of magnetism. Although the primary focus of the proposed work is
synthetic, development of mechanistic models will be pursued as needed within an
established collaboration with the condensed matter physics group at the
University. ***
