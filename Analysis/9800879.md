DMS-9800879 Gigiola Staffilani Abstract of the Research Project My research
involves the study of certain Dispersive Partial Differential Equations. I
concentrate my work on the Cauchy problem for two particular dispersive
equations: the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the generalized Korteweg-de
Vries equation. The first question I address in my project is the following:
given a dispersive equation, how much regularity does one have to assume for the
initial profile (initial data condition) in order to be able to insure existence
and uniqueness of the wave solution at later times? Such a question becomes more
complicated to answer when one also imposes boundary conditions. At the moment,
the techniques available (Harmonic and Fourier Analysis) only apply to the case
of periodic boundary conditions. The second question I address is how certain
regularity properties of the wave solution are preserved in time, once it is
assumed that the wave ``lives'' for all times and it is smooth. More precisely,
under these conditions, I study the asymptotic behavior of the size of the wave
measured taking into account the order of differentiability. This is a very
different problem than the one described above. Nevertheless the techniques I
rely upon to answer both questions are very similar in their nature. Dispersive
partial differential equations are introduced to model many wave phenomena that
occur in nature. Some examples are, for instance, propagation of signals in
optic fibers, nonlinear ionic-sonic waves in plasma in a magnetic field and long
waves in plasma. In my work I improve and develop some abstract mathematical
tools in order to obtain from general properties of the initial profile of the
wave information about the evolution of the wave itself. This information
regards the time of existence of the wave, the persistence of certain
properties, the behavior near singular points, and the energy carried by the
wave. In some cases part of this information can be recovered by conducting
experiments in laboratories. Conversely, the results I obtain provide
mathematical justifications for certain empirical observations.
