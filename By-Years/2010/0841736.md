Funds are provided for the PIs to evaluate preliminary proxy records for the
Indian Ocean Monsoon by using cores collected from the Arabian Sea and the Bay
of Bengal and made available by the joint US and Indian Gas Hydrate Program. The
PI will perform dating and analysis of sea surface temperature, salinity,
sources of surface water, and continental vegetation types. This analysis will
extend the existing dataset from 15 Ma to up to 30 Ma and lead to a greater
detailed understanding of the Paleo rainfall record of the Indian and Asian
continents. These cores are unique and the record goes back to the Miocene - the
potential initiation of the monsoonal circulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts include involvement of a graduate student and a post-doctoral fellow.
This project will foster greater collaboration with Indian counterparts and
could also lead to future drilling expeditions by IODP in the area.
