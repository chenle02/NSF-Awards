The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) will work with a
national group of high school chemistry teachers to develop two modules - one on
chemical bonding and the other on solvation - based on interactive scientific
visualizations and animations under student control. The students will use
microcomputers in the classroom for visualization and will use a phone modem to
access simulation software developed at NCSA, under separate funding, for
research projects. The goal of the project is to enhance the chemistry
curriculum by enabling students to manipulate visual representations of abstract
concepts and explore these concepts, thereby bringing the studying of chemistry
closer to the doing of chemistry. The modules will allow educators to explore
and evaluate new pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning chemistry at
the pre- college level, taking advantage of the dynamical, three- dimensional
nature of the subject and of advances in technology.
