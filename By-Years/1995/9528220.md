ABSTRACT CTS-9528220 Funding is requested for developing a new method to
transfer of knowledge and technology between university and industry by
establishing a Virtual Technology market on Internet, with application in the
area of particulate and multiphase flow research. The research will include
investigation of user needs, development of system design and implementation,
system of maintenance, data collection and analysis. If successful, the proposed
project will have a significant impact on developing the communication between
academe and industry in the area of particulate and multiphase systems, and
establishing a system that will continue to operate after the life of the NSF
award. ***
