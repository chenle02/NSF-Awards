Research in the biological and health sciences has been characterized by the
introduction of novel technologies for investigations of molecular machineries,
where a huge amount of data coming from experiments or medical practice has been
stored in novel databases; new algorithms for studying functions, structures,
interactions of proteins and genes, and classification of patients into disease
subgroups that shares a common biological basis of diseases have been
introduced; and almost all "omics" areas have been touched by new data sources
with large repositories, new computational tools and applications powered by new
algorithms. The ACM Special Interest Group on Bioinformatics, Computational
Biology, and Health Informatics (SIGBio; http://www.sigbioinformatics.org/) was
instituted in 2010 with the aim of focusing on research on bioinformatics data
management topics, with a focus on bridging computational, statistical and
mathematical sciences with biology and biomedicine. The ACM-Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology meeting will provide a platform for researchers to bridge
interdisciplinary research and also provide mechanisms to promote diverse and
broad participation, especially through travel support for graduate students and
young investigators.
