This laboratory program for advanced undergraduates is designed to provide
students with a sound understanding of basic concepts of modern physics and to
teach them to use new techniques complementing the physics they learn.
Experiments include thin film growth and characterization, surface science,
electronic and magnetic properties of metals and semiconductors, and nanometer
scale measurements. Proficiency in one of these areas resulting in publishable
results is encouraged.
