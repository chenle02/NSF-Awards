The RAPID project Using Research to Target Title I Needs in Mathematics, led by
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, is producing research syntheses
that summarize and make available to practitioners results from research on
effective mathematics curricular interventions, teaching practices, and teacher
professional development that have been designed to improve achievement by
students in Title 1 programs. The proposal addresses the second challenge under
the DR K-12 solicitation: How can all students be assured the opportunity to
learn significant STEM content?

The target audience for the project includes state- and district-level leaders
who must make important decisions about uses of Title 1 funding in low-income,
often high-minority schools. The overall goal for the project is to bring
together the best resources in both mathematics education and Title I so that
programs are better able to serve the mathematical learning and instructional
needs of Title I schools.
