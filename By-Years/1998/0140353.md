This award provides funding for the continuation of a research project in the
study of Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation in cold lithium atoms. Both Li-6 and
Li-7 and mixtures of these two isotopes will be studied. BE condensation in Li-7
is particularly interesting because one of the spin states has attractive
interactions, and some of the work will focus on the continuation of studies of
this condensate, particularly the effect of the application of a magnetic field
to produce Feshbach resonances. A Feshbach resonance will also be used to tune
the interaction in a pair of Li-6 spin states, with the goal of producing an
s-wave Cooper pairing phase transition. Finally, two-photon photoassociation to
a molecular ground state in Li-7 will be used to change the interaction strength
with the goal of producing and trapping ultracold molecules of diatomic lithium
that may then undergo BE condensation.
