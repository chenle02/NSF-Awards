The ability to detect and rapidly respond to changes in the environment is
evolutionarily conserved across the animal kingdom. Yet, the neural computation
underlying novelty detection have not been precisely defined or quantified. Drs.
Wu (Georgetown University), Ding (University of Florida) and Chou (University of
California, Los Angeles) will test the hypothesis that dynamics in neuronal
activity at the tissue level play a two-step role in novelty-detection. First, a
constant or repetitive stimulus establishes a spatiotemporal pattern of neuronal
activity that stores an expectation of regularity within the system. Second,
stimuli that violate the expected regularity are registered as changes in the
patterns of neuronal activity, triggering a response. The research team will use
voltage-sensitive dye imaging, optogenetics, high-density EEG, and fMRI, to
measure brain activity maps resulting from a common stimulus sequence. The
expected neuronal activity and the novelty response to changing the stimulus
will be measured in turtles, mice, and humans. The investigators will then
quantify these activity maps using mathematical/statistical analysis and develop
physically-motivated theoretical models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
expected to provide the initial identification of shared computational
principles as well as species- and system-specific implementation of such
mechanisms. Results from this research may shed light on a wider range of
cognitive functions that rely on novelty detection and novelty-controlled
neuromodulation, including attention, learning and memory, and decision-making.
Given the importance of such cognitive functions, the proposed research may
potentially have long-term, broad societal impact. For example, the opportunity
to relate novelty detection capacity of college students to their classroom
performance may lead to the development of novelty-stimuli based tools for more
effective classroom education. Moreover, the comparative investigation of
different species may provide insight into the evolution of learning capacity.
