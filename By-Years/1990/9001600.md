The following are topics to be discussed at the Optical Society of America
sponsored conference on Integrated Photonics. (A) Photonic devices and circuits
to guided-wave devices, circuit integration, fiber and waveguide coupling,
semiconductor lasers and amplifiers, quantum well waveguide devices, signal
processing and sensors. (B) Nonlinear guided- wave phenomena, nonlinear
phenomena, stimulated scattering, photorefractive phenomena, multiphoton
processes, squeezed states, solitons, pulse compression, third-order all optical
switching phenomena, nonlinear couplers and spatial solitons, second harmonic
generation and nonlinear waveguide materials. (C) Modeling, numerical
simulation, and theory, modeling, numerical simulation, or theory of photonic
devices and materials. (D) Physics, materials, technology, and characterization.
Electrooptic, optic-optic, acoustooptic, magnetooptic mechanisms, optical
interactions in semiconductor interaction between optical radiation and
electrical carriers in semiconductors; new materials structures and
compositions; new materials growth, diffusion, ion-exchange, etching techniques;
and new techniques for characterizing photonic devices or processes or materials
used to fabricate them.
