Florida International University The research analyzes the effects of integrated
conservation-development projects (ICDPs) on rural property relations in two
communities within the Selous Game Reserve buffer zone, Tanzania. The intent is
to explain how such organizations affect property relations and investigate the
process by which customary rights are identified and impacted upon. The work
will advance the area of political ecology theory by showing how local
struggles, negotiations, and contests over property rights interact with
globally oriented strategies for biodiversity conservation. The research is also
designed to provide a comparative analysis of the communities as well as
evaluate the effects of conservation interventions over time. Methodologies
include interviews, participant observation, land use surveys and mapping, and
archival research.
