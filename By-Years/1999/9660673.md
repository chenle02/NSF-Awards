This Small business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a novel
tertiary recycling process as an economical means for recycling scrap automotive
plastics and composites. The goals for the Next Generation Vehicles program
require that significant vehicle weight reductions be attained. Weight
reductions will likely involve increased use of engineering plastics and
composites that are difficult to recycle using conventional technologies. To
address that problem, a more effective process for recycling scrap automotive
plastics and composites is needed. Early development work on a process for
recycling scrap aerospace composites and scrap electronics shows that a variety
of polymers and composites can be converted into low molecular weight
hydrocarbons at temperatures below 200+C. The hydrocarbons produced can then be
reused as chemicals, fuels, or monomers. Metal, glass, fillers, and fibers are
separated from the hydrocarbons during the process and can be reclaimed or
landfilled. Initial laboratory feasibility studies have shown that the a
catalytic conversion process is applicable to plastics and composites used in
automotive parts. This process does not require presorting of plastic wastes and
allows fibers and fillers to be reclaimed for reuse. This research will study
the application of this tertiary recycling technology for recycling of
automotive waste plastics and composites with a bench-scale continuous process
to identify design issues for the construction of a large-scale demonstration
unit in Phase II. If the research is successful, the recycling process will
allow waste automotive plastics and composites currently being landfilled to be
converted into valuable hydrocarbons for reuse as chemicals, fuels, or polymers.
Recycling machines based on this process may be scaled to use requirements of
large and small cities, government installations, and industrial plastic scrap
generators.
