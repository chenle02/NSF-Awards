Lee This research deals with design methodology for heterogeneous
implementations of signal processing systems. Some signal processing algorithms
consist of highly repetitive, predictable computations on streams of samples
with hard real- time constraints, and are amenable to synchronous dataflow
representations and static (compile-time) scheduling. Other algorithms involve
some decision making or run-time control flow, and can be accommodated
efficiently by a broader dataflow model that includes run-time flow control.
When such algorithms are combined into complete systems, more dynamics must be
supported, and discrete-event principles, or real-time operating systems must be
included. This research is looking at ways to combine diverse semantics, and is
pursuing co-simulation techniques and understanding of the interaction between
what formal methods are available within each model of computation. A design
framework (called Ptolemy) that supports all these models, individually or in
combination, is being developed as a testbed.
