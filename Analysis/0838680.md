This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The UCLA Analysis Research and Training Groups (RTG) program
consists of a variety of initiatives with the common aim of increasing the
number of US citizens and permanent residents who study mathematics and then go
on to careers in mathematics, including university teaching and research. These
initiatives include: recruitment and training of graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars in the area of mathematical analysis, taken in its
broadest meaning; better preparation of these students and postdocs for their
future careers through a series of participating seminars, research workshops,
and intensive summer school programs; increasing interest in mathematics among
undergraduate students by creating new junior-senior level undergraduate seminar
courses in analysis and involving undergraduate students in an annual
Mathematics Summer Camp; and showcasing mathematics to school children and
giving graduate and undergraduate students experience working with school
children through the continued operation of the Los Angeles Math Circle.

The initiatives supported under the RTG grant will strengthen the department's
research and training program in analysis as well as our training and outreach
programs at all levels -- from middle school through postdoctoral scholars. The
outcomes of these programs -- attracting, training, and supporting students to
create a mathematically skilled workforce -- represent the national and state-
wide effect of this grant.
