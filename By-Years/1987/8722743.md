"Warm rain" in cloud physics refers to the development of precipitation in
clouds in the absence of ice crystals. Cloud droplets grown primarily through
coalescence. The droplet size spectra observed in nature have shown both bi-
modal and tri-modal distributions. Professor Brown has successfully explained
the cause of such distributions by modeling both coalescence and the breakup
process when droplets collide. Under this grant Professor Brown will further
consider the effects of evaporation and the initial droplet size spectra in the
evolution of the spectra. Since convective cloud models frequently cannot
explicitly take into consideration the complex coalescence and collision-induced
breakup, a refined parameterization, hence professor Brown's work, becomes even
more important.
