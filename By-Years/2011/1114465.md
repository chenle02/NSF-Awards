K&amp;A Wireless has requested support for a one year membership to the New
Mexico Technology Ventures Corporation that was recently selected as the
recipient of the Economic Development Administrations Region 5 i6 award. The
focus of the I-6 effort will be on developing a short range wireless video
system that is capable of distributing the power requirements of the CLIR-View
algorithm to market segments where handheld thermal imaging devices are
required, like firefighting and military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This development
and commercialization will utilize interns from the University of New Mexico and
New Mexico State to provide real world experience to these undergraduate
students. In addition, the intent is to create a position for one of the
students on a full time basis after graduation at the end of the program. In
addition, the focus is to bring a new hardware product to market which will help
in the economic development of the region.
