The plant specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) is a master regulator of the
vital switch from vegetative to reproductive development. It has a second role
in patterning of the reproductive structures, the flowers. Despite its central
role in the organism, the direct events set in motion by this transcription
factor are as yet poorly understood. Two general approaches will be taken to
address this problem. One is a genetic analysis of the biological role of direct
LFY targets the investigators previously identified using expression arrays.
This study will reveal the regulatory logic connecting known components of the
network downstream of LFY. The second approach will use sensitive genomic LFY
binding studies to identify missing targets of LFY during the switch to
reproductive development and in flower patterning. In addition to advancing our
understanding of the events set in motion by LFY in these two processes, this
approach will define the binding motif of this master transcription factor with
great precision and thus may reveal new roles of LFY. Finally, by comparing LFY
binding and activity at two developmental stages (during the switch to
reproduction and during flower patterning), this study will provide first
evidence as to how LFY activity is regulated during development. Conclusions
derived from these experiments will provide much needed insight into a
fundamental developmental switch and key patterning events in Arabidopsis. Based
on the conserved role of LFY, these findings will likely also contribute to
understanding of the onset of reproduction in other flowering plants. This
knowledge is of high potential importance for agriculture, plant breeding, and
biofuel production. In addition, an important aspect of this project is
mentoring and training of students as well as outreach to local schools.
