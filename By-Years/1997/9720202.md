The widening disparity between computation and input/output rates is now a major
impediment to achieving high performance for a wide range of national challenge
applications. This is especially true for emerging multidisciplinary
applications with dynamic, irregular behavior and time varying input/output
demands. An extensive analysis of application and physical input/output patterns
by multiple research groups has shown that no single parallel file policy is
likely to yield high performance for all input/output patterns. Instead, it will
be necessary to aggressively exploit input/output access pattern knowledge in
caching and prefetching systems to obtain a substantial fraction of peak
hardware input/output performance. This project will explore the research issues
underlying creation of (a) automatic behavioral classification techniques to
identify and group application resource request patterns, (b) flexible file
system policies that can trade storage space for increased input/output
bandwidth and balance conflicting resource demands within and across
applications, and (c) a set of fuzzy logic decision mechanisms for selecting
file system policies based on application input/output requests and input/output
system responses.
