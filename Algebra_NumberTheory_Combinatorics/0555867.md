The PI is proposing to investigate geometry of the moduli space of principally
polarized complex abelian varieties. He proposes to undertake (together with
collaborators) a study of the cone of effective divisors on the moduli space, of
the intersection theory of divisors, and of the compactifications induced by
vector-valued Siegel modular forms. The PI further proposes to examine the
geometry of Kummer varieties, and in particular of their secants, generalizing
and extending the earlier work related to the trisecant conjecture, to define a
natural stratification of the moduli space. To this end, he also proposes to
investigate the geometry of the 2Theta linear system, aiming to get a
description of base loci and singularities generalizing Riemann's theory for
Theta. The PI proposes to combine methods of algebraic geometry, number
theory/modular forms, and even integrable systems to undertake this study.

Abelian varieties and their moduli spaces are one of the classical central
objects in algebraic geometry and number theory. An abelian variety is an
algebraic variety with a group structure, i.e. essentially it is a geometric
object on which the operation of taking a sum of two points is defined. The
complex dimension one case - elliptic curves, which can also be thought of as
cubic curves like y^2=x(x-1)(x-a) - gives rise to many beautiful classical
geometric constructions: for example, to compute the sum of two points one draws
the line through these two points, take its third point of intersection with the
graph and change the sign of y. In every dimension there are many different
abelian varieties (varying "a" above gives different objects). Understanding the
geometry of the moduli space - the set of all possible abelian varieties of a
given dimension - could yield insights in topics as varied as algebraic
geometry, number theory, integrable systems, and string theory.
