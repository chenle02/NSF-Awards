With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at Eastern Michigan University will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This instrument will permit the initiation of
projects not possible currently and will lead to greater interaction of faculty
in Chemistry with those in the College of Technology and Biology. Research
projects to benefit from the NMR spectrometer include studies on nitrogen-
phosphorus flame retardants, natural product synthesis, nitrogen heterocycle
synthesis, and organic and heterocycle synthesis. This instrument will help
attract research-oriented faculty and improve the learning experience for
graduate and undergraduate student researchers. The formal teaching program will
be immediately and positively affected in a senior laboratory class on synthesis
and a "Spectrometric Organic Structure Determination" graduate class.
&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most
powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research.&lt;br/&gt;
