This action will provide funds for three investigators at the University of
Illinois at Chicago to continue their investigations in elementary particle
physics. They have been performing, with other collaborators, a comprehensive
study of the scattering of muons from protons and various heavier nuclear
targets. The experiment, E665 in progress at Fermilab, will result in the study
of the constituents of the elementary particles. Other NSF grantees are among
the collaborators. Toward the end of the grant period, new activities with
colliding beams will be started. The investigators are working on design studies
for the upgrade of the D0 particle detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider
and for the MARS particle detector under consideration at the Brookhaven
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
