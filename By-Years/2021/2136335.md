The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a curative therapy
for spinal muscular atrophy using a novel and proprietary precision gene editing
technology. The proposed technology will increase the safety and efficacy of
gene editing by optimizing the precision of editing to correct the disease. This
technology can be used to improve and even cure patients of genetic
disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will develop and validate a curative therapy for spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA) using a novel and proprietary CRISPR-Cas precision gene
editing system. Manipulation of the human genome using CRISPR-Cas gene editors
has been validated in early clinical trials to correct genetic diseases.
However, application of this technology has been limited by the high degree of
unintended 'off-target' editing events. This problem is particularly acute for
in vivo therapies where the editing system will be delivered systemically or
directly to the target organs, eliminating the ability to screen cells for
unwanted editing outcomes. High precision gene editing technology must be
developed to ensure the safety and efficacy of in vivo gene editing therapies.
This project will develop an engineered anti-CRISPR (ErAcr) protein to eliminate
unintended off-target editing. The ErAcr protein will be paired with a novel
CRISPR-Cas nuclease and developed into a therapy for SMA&gt; The therapy will be
packaged into an adeno-associated viral vector and tested for editing and SMA
disease correction in patient-derived cells and in an SMA mouse model. Effective
editing will lead to disease correction in both patient cells and mice with no
observable off-target editing events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
