This award provides three year support for the high energy physics group at
Rutgers University New Brunswick. The Rutgers effort is focused primarily upon
CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN., but
also includes the completion of physics programs at the Tevatron (CDF and D0)
and a technology development project for diamond-based high luminosity beam
monitors for the LHC (previously supported by an NSF MRI award). This mix of
projects exploits the varied expertise of group members while balancing their
responsibilities to bring existing efforts to a natural close, to provide thesis
opportunities for graduate students, to have a major impact upon LHC physics
analyses, and to pave the way for future activities. The broader impacts include
holding QuarkNet Summer workshops for high school teachers, participation in the
annual Summer Research Program for high school students, work with environmental
activists across New Jersey, and continuation of activities in accelerator
physics, particularly with undergraduate students.
