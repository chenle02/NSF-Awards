9353958 Lim In the past few years, object-oriented technology has become one of
the dominant technologies in the computing industry. In a recent survey, it was
reported that over 75% of the Fortune 100 companies have adopted object
technology to some degree for their computing needs. This is in response to the
increasing software maintenance cost and backlog that is so prevalent in the
software industry. Because object-orientation is becoming one of the primary
means for problem solving, the need to teach object-orientation in undergraduate
curriculum is growing. The purpose of this project is to provide a two-week
summer workshop for faculty who are from institutions which lack computing
facilities to teach object-orientation and thus do not have any formal training
in this area. The objectives are to introduce (1) object-orientated analysis and
design, (2) object-oriented programming, (3) object oriented databases, (4)
integrating object-orientation into computer science/information system
curriculum, and (5) teaching object- orientation to undergraduates. The workshop
includes lectures and laboratory sessions in which participants have hands-on
exercises on each of the above main topics. Participants also plan a course or
course unit utilizing object-oriented technology at their institutions during
the subsequent academic year. The tools used in the workshop include inexpensive
or free software that are easily obtainable by most universities and colleges.
