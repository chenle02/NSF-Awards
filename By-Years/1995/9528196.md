This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University in the
purchase of an SGI Power Challenge and Indy workstations. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) theoretical
and computational chemistry, and (2) solid-state and materials chemistry. A
workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer network`
also serves as a developmental environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and
supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. f8
