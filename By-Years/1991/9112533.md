Labor issues concerning public school teachers represent one of the most
interesting and important areas of applied research in labor economics. In an
era of shrinking supply of teachers, the educational system is also confronted
with an alarming rate of teacher turnover. The purpose of this research is to
analyze teacher compensation and mobility. A theoretical model is developed of
the hiring and retention of overlapping cohorts of teacher. By studying a
bargaining model of contract determination in which the preferences of the
union's median voter plays a crucial role, it is possible to focus explicitly on
the role of unions in the bargaining process. The model will be tested using an
unusual data set of public school teachers in Pennsylvania. The data includes
information on 100,000 teachers by school district, along with information on
collective bargaining contracts by school district. By including all 501
districts in the state throughout the 1980's, a large and detailed set of panel
data has been created which provides an extraordinary opportunity to examine
empirically the link between mobility and collective bargaining. This research
is important because it will shed new light on the effectiveness of education
reform measures aimed at attracting and retaining better teachers in the public
schools.
