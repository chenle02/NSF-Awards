This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project purposes to
develop a new treatment for osteoarthritis, a debilitating joint disease
characterized by significant tissue degeneration within the joint, significant
pain, and loss of function. At the end stage of this disease, the only option is
a total joint replacement using artificial materials, which is not appropriate
for younger patients. The overall goal of this work is to utilize principles of
regenerative medicine and engineering to develop a joint resurfacing implant to
replace and regenerate the entire damaged articulating joint surfaces.
Particularly, this project will study the infusion of an ultra-tough gel into an
anatomically shaped, high-performance, three-dimensionally woven implant. The
potential benefit of this technology is that it avoids costly and extensive
culture time by improving the immediate properties of the scaffold to mimic the
properties of native tissues. The research objectives are to develop these
composite implants to match that of the native tissue using a variety of
formulations and then examine their ability to integrate into living tissues
over long-term culture.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the estimated
$65B cost to the economy imparted each year by hip arthritis. After a patient
fails conservative treatment, the standard surgical treatment is a total joint
replacement, where the joint is replaced by artificial materials. Unfortunately,
artificial joints have a lifespan of only 15-20 years and then typically require
a revision surgery, which is complicated by high failure rates, making them a
poor option for young patients with end-stage osteoarthritis. There are
currently approximately 1 million patients younger than 65 with activity
limiting hip osteoarthritis with no effective surgical therapies to treat them.
Therefore, even conservative estimates of the addressable market size for the
proposed product are calculated at $164 million today. This is expected to
increase to at least $563 million in 2018 due to projected growth of the target
demographic, market penetration, and an increase in the price of hip prostheses.
If efficacy is demonstrated, it stands to reason that this technology, which
satisfies an unmet clinical need, would be rapidly adopted and would therefore
have tremendous clinical and economic impact in the US as well as enriching
understanding of joint resurfacing technology in the scientific community.
