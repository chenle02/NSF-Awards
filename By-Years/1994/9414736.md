9414736 Maxwell As part of a series of relativistic studies in nuclear physics,
two major calculation projects will be undertaken: (1) the development of a
phenomenological, relativistic, energy-dependent nucleon-nucleon t-matrix and
(2) the continuation of relativistic studies of the (p,2p) reaction conducted in
collaboration with Dr. E.D. Cooper. ***
