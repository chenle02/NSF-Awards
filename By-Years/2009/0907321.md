This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's three-year research program
will investigate fundamental aspects of random variables which can be understood
within the framework of Wiener spaces. Specifically, in the context of the
Wiener process W (standard Brownian motion), if a random variable X can be
written as a function of the path of W which is differentiable in the sense of
Malliavin, meaning that its Frechet derivative DX in the direction of any
appropriate perturbation exists, then it is possible to form a function g, equal
to an averaged inner product of DX and of an exponentially correlated copy of
DX, and use this function g to write estimates for the tails and even the
density of X. An indication of this methodology is recorded in an article by the
PI and Ivan Nourdin. The PI plan to apply the methodology to find sharp upper
and lower bounds on densities of random variables of interest to probabilists,
including the maxima of Gaussian fields, and also to tackle related problems
such as small ball probabilities for fractional Brownian motion. A connection
between Malliavin derivatives and Stein's method, which was discovered by
Nourdin and Peccati, will also be investigated, and may help in analyzing random
variables whose behavior is closer to non Gaussian distributions, including
Gamma distributions, within the so-called Pearson
class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader scientific significance of the proposed
research begins with applications to the effect of chaotic environments on the
stabilization or destabilization of physical or chemical systems, including
polymers in random media. There should be a range of spatial correlation lengths
in the medium which imply a continuum of behaviors, exhibiting richer phenomena
than what theoretical physicists have predicted. Taking the modeling further,
the PI plans to analyze the practical consequences of the project in those areas
where long memory is an empirical fact, including financial econometrics,
internet traffic, and climate prediction. Ph.D. students will take part in the
fundamental aspects of the research. Some theoretical quantitative issues, such
as small ball constants, fluctuation exponents, and long-memory parameter
estimation, will be complemented with numerical simulations conducted by MS and
undergraduate students. Involving students in fundamental research with real-
world applications will broadly disseminate scientific
understanding.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will encourage students from underrepresented
groups to join this research program.
