At the Asilomar Workshop on Rock Magnetism (September 16-19, 1986) it was
unanimously agreed that the next generation of paleomagnetic problems which
impact on geomagnetic field generation and reversal, tectonics of continental
margins and Precambrian continental drift requrie a major increase in our
knowledge of the effects of time and temperature on the magneti>zation of pure m
agnetite and titanomagnetite. The PIs have d a materials synthesis technique,
the glass-ceramic method, which produces uniform grains ranging in size from 50
nm to 100 um in a state of low internal stress as seen from their magnetic
hysteresis and thermoremance properties. They study the effects of applied
field, temperature and internal stress on the acquisition and stability of
thermo-viscous magnetization. The results will be specially relevant to test
whether domain wall/stress interaction through "disaccommodation" or
"aftereffect" phenomenon is important for terrestrial samples and may lead to
methods for removing undesirable but relatively stable viscous magnetization.
These studies will be comple>mentary to those now being carried out by Halgedahl
and Moskowitz on the role of domain wall generation and movement in viscous
magnetization.
