Optimal transport is a study of ways of moving large numbers of objects from one
place to another while minimizing cost. For example, in 1781 French
mathematician Monge considered the problem of moving piles of dirt to fill holes
in an optimal way. This area has since developed into a thriving mathematical
field with connections to probability theory, stochastic analysis, differential
equations, and many other fields. The current project aims to develop optimal
transportation techniques in the context of Voiculescu?s free probability
theory. A distinctive feature of the theory is that the variables no longer
commute: the order of their multiplication matters. This results in an extremely
rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects
such as partial differential equations, Brownian motion, and so on. This award
supports the proposer's research in this area and contributes to US workforce
development through the training of graduate students.

This project deals with the emergent use of PDE methods to produce results in
operator algebras and free probability theory. These methods allow us to
construct free transport maps and prove isomorphism and decomposition results
for operator algebras; they give new insights into Voiculescu's theory of free
entropy and free stochastic calculus; and strengthen the connection between
random matrix theory and free probability theory. We propose a mixture of
problems, some coming from existing research directions and some exploring new
lines of inquiry.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
