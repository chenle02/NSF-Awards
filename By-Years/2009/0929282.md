This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a significant
area of uncertainty in our understanding of biogenic sources of gases and
aerosols to the atmosphere by updating a 3-dimensional global model (Community
Atmospheric Model - Chemistry coupled with Community Land Model). Emissions and
processing of several sesquiterpenes will be explicitly simulated and possible
new isoprene reaction mechanisms will be considered in the context of secondary
organic aerosol formation. These mechanisms have important ramifications for the
oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and will help to reduce uncertainties about
sources, distributions, and composition of atmospheric organic
aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will include traditional student
training and course development. An undergraduate will be recruited via the
Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program,
which provides an opportunity for students of historically underrepresented
groups in science to participate in summer research activities. Traditional
avenues of peer-reviewed journal articles and conference presentations will
enhance scientific understanding. The societal benefit of this work will derive
from improved understanding of how the Earth system currently functions and from
an improved model framework for simulations of future climate scenarios.
