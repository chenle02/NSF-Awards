In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, The PI will carry out a research program to investigate the
effects of correlation and exchange on the solvation dynamics and adiabatic
couplings that control electron transfer. Ongoing work on the charge-transfer-
to-solvent (CTTS) reaction of solvated alkali metal atoms will be continued with
femtosecond techniques. New pump-probe experiments will be used to identify the
transient intermediates formed during CTTS and for mapping out the dynamics of
solvent dissipation. The research will be conducted with the assistance of
graduate students. They will be trained in a forefront area of contemporary
physical chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the
country's workforce.
