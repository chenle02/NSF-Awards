The Educational Film Center, in collaboration with Dr. Roald Hoffmann, Nobel
Laureate and John A. Newman, Professor of Physical Science at Cornell
University, will produce THE MOLECULAR WORLD, a series of three one-hour
specials for Public Television. The specials will outline this "century of
synthesis," the historical contribution of chemistry to our everyday lives. They
will further highlight the future impact of chemistry on new materials for
transportation and communication, and ont he rational design of effective
medicines. The programs respond to the need for public awareness about the
molecular and chemical make-up of the natural world around us and within us. The
public also needs to appreciate better the continuing role of chemistry in
producing the new molecules which change our world. THE MOLECULAR WORLD is
designed for a national television audience complementing the recently completed
college telecourse "The World of Chemistry" and its High School adaptations. The
National Science Foundation award constitutes 15% of the total cost of the
project.
