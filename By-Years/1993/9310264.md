9310264 Newton This project is to investigate the thermodynamic stabilities of
many different major minerals, including silicates, oxides, hydrates and
carbonates. The data to be acquired are of crucial importance to the erection of
thermodynamic datasets for calculation of the stabilities of natural mineral
assemblages. The concentration will be on important mineral species whose
thermodynamic properties are still uncertain. Because of the interdependent
nature of mineral properties in the self-consistent datasets, insertion of
accurately-measured free energies, enthalpies and entropies of key minerals will
force changes of the thermodynamic parameters of most of the other minerals of
the datasets. Free energy data of solid solution will be measured for several
important mineral families. Methods to be used are simple-system phase
equilibrium measurements at elevated temperatures and pressures, including
experiments in the presence of a single-component or mixed vapor phase and with
polyionic oxide melts, and solution calorimetry. Major improvement in the
ability to calculate heterogeneous equilibria of earth processes will result
from accurate definition of the thermodynamic formation and solid solution
properties of key garnets, pyroxenes, feldspars, micas and carbonate minerals.
