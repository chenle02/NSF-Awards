Dusty plasmas occur in many space and astronomical environments, among them
planetary atmospheres and rings, asteroid zones, comets, protostellar and
protoplanetary clouds, supernova remnants, the interstellar medium, and the
Earth's ionosphere/magnetosphere. The objective of this research is to conduct
exploratory theoretical studies of the basic and applied collective physics of
dusty plasmas which are pertinent to astrophysical and space environments.
Exploratory pilot calculations of waves and instabilities in dusty plasmas will
be performed, using a kinetic approach, which would include some of the unique
properties of cosmic charged dust such as grain size distributions. The effects
of charged dust grains on collective plasma properties will be examined for
various astrophysical and space regimes, and exploratory studies of theoretical
techniques to treat those effects will be conducted. This is a Career
Advancement Award under the Research Opportunities for Women program.
