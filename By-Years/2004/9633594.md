*** 9633594 Lindell This research will assess differences in the extent to which
social units located in areas with different levels of seismic vulnerability
vary in their adoption of earthquake hazard adjustments, and also will identify
variables predicting these differences in adoption behavior. The study will
examine measures that function actively (preparedness), as well as passively
(mitigation), at the time of earthquake impact to minimize deaths, injuries,
property damage, and loss of function. The study will involve two different
types of social units--households and complex organizations, with the latter
category divided into private businesses and government agencies. Government
agencies will be divided further into those with an emergency component in their
mission statements (e.g., fire and police departments, emergency management
offices) and those without such a component (city manager's offices, finance
departments, social services, etc.). The research project also will address
characteristics of the physical and social environment affecting each of these
types of social units. Variations in the physical environment will be examined
by studying social units at high (southern California) and medium (western
Washington) seismic risk.***
