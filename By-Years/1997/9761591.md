*** 9761591 Vempati This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I deals
with ZSM 5 synthesis, a siliceous and hydrophobic zeolite, from rice hull ash.
Environmental pollution associated with burning rice hulls, coupled with
scarcity and landfilling cost, creates disposal problems to rice mill owners.
Rice hull ash (RHA) is siliceous and contains some aluminum, and therefore, it
is a natural candidate for ZSM 5 synthesis. This project will explore ZSM 5
synthesis from RHA in the absence of templating species, i.e.,
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide or bromide for industrial odor control. Templating
species account for as much as 50% of production cost because of chemical and
disposal costs and calcination of the synthesized product. Preliminary analysis
indicates that ZSM 5 derived from RHA and without templating species may cost
1/3 as much as activated carbon and non-RHA ZSM 5. Further, modified hydrophilic
zeolite uses environment unfriendly chemicals for dealumination. A commercially
attractrive new source ZSM 5, i.e., manufactured from RHA, may have a potential
for applications in permeable barriers for organic compounds and capture of
volatile organic compounds. This research is expected to ameliorate
environmental problems and expand markets in the rice milling industry. ***
