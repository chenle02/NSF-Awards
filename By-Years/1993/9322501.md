This project focuses on problems in two interrelated areas: (1) algorithms for
graph problems, and (2) the design of data structures. The common theme is the
investigation of efficient computation in these areas. The project is to
generate improved techniques, and characterize significant complexity
relationships. A central issue is the efficient coordination of the acquisition
of information during a complex computational task.
