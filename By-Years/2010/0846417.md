The three elements that form the basis of any decision are (1) The alternatives,
or what we can do; (2) The information, or what we know; and (3) The
preferences, or what we like. A probability distribution captures the
information element of the decision and a multiattribute utility function
captures the preferences in decisions with multiple objectives (attributes). The
construction of a multiattribute utility function is therefore a fundamental
step in decision analysis. Unfortunately, it is also a difficult task to perform
in practice if we wish to capture the interactions (utility dependence
relations) among the different attributes. We might, for example, have a
different attitude toward placing some of our wealth at risk if we were healthy
and expected to live a long time than if we were ill and expected to die soon.
It is therefore important to capture this dependence relation between the two
attributes if we wish to provide an accurate representation of our preferences
in this decision problem. Otherwise, we may end up making the wrong decision.

The objective of this research project is to provide a general framework for
constructing multiattribute utility functions that capture the utility
dependence relations among the attributes in decisions with multiple objectives.
The research will be validated by applying it to a variety of practical
applications such as the automobile industry, global warming decisions, as well
as medical decision making. The research results will be disseminated through
conferences and journal papers. The algorithms will also be made available to
the public through a web-based decision support system to help with decision
making. In addition, the award will help provide decision training to teens at
the Juvenile Detention Center in Champaign County, IL, and will also help train
a group of Teens, the Peer Ambassadors group, who will learn decision skills and
teach it to teens of their same age at the Juvenile Center.
