This project studies protocols for admitting and routing calls in distributed
networks, and for tolerating failures in these networks. Its goal is to
understand how to best use high-speed networking technology, such as ATM, to
support parallel supercomputing, and to advance the NII (National Information
Infrastructure) initiative. In the supercomputing domain, it seeks to develop
network structures, routing algorithms, and mechanisms for tolerating faults
that are both practical and provably effective. In the realm of the NII, it is
analyzing the behavior of simple algorithms, including greedy algorithms, for
admitting calls in wide-area integrated-service networks.
