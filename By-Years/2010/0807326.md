AST-0807326&lt;br/&gt;Feldman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmologists look forward
with great excitement to the next generation of cosmological surveys, but need
the analytical and statistical tools to complement the observations. This
project will develop formalisms to exploit to the fullest the upcoming
observational data and to bring new understanding to the frontiers where large-
scale structure, cosmology, and particle physics, all overlap. The research will
produce elegant and powerful statistics to analyze peculiar velocity samples,
virtually the only dynamical probe of cosmology, and will use them to study
large scale structure, neutrino mass estimation, and the matter content of the
Universe. Velocity fields sample the mass distribution directly and are less
susceptible to problems of bias and conventional priors as compared to other
probes such as the cosmic microwave background, redshift surveys, or
gravitational lensing. This work will allow peculiar velocity surveys to re-
emerge as a useful and unique tool to investigate the large-scale mass
distribution on various cosmological scales. The statistical, analytical and
numerical methods developed in this project will be valuable for probing
cosmological data sets to gather information about fundamental
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, these statistical tools will help
to extract relevant information in many areas of research whenever the data are
noisy and unwieldy. The PI is deeply involved in the important work of outreach
and the introduction of scientific innovation to the public, travelling widely
to lecture to diverse groups, from elementary to high school students, to
churches, special interest groups and professional societies. Other serious
efforts to be continued are those involving public science advocacy and state
public school science standards.
