This award provides funding to the University of California, Davis (UCD), to
upgrade the experimental capabilities of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) geotechnical centrifuge facility at UCD
that will be operated by NEES Consortium, Inc., as a national shared use
facility during FY 2005 - FY 2014. The major equipment at the UCD NEES site
includes the 9-meter geotechnical centrifuge, 2D shaker, in-flight robot, hinged
plate container, flexible shear beam container, large inventory of transducers,
imaging equipment, and distributed high-speed wireless data acquisition system.
Under this award, the following equipment will be purchased for this site:
wireless master radio, amplifiers, and researcher PC worktablets. The master
radio, the second one at this site, will be used in the model preparation area
to enable NEES researchers to communicate with the wireless communication
module/sensor manager independently of ongoing experiments on the centrifuge. It
will enable researchers to calibrate sensors in the lab and take data during 1g
testing processes such as consolidation. This system will be left connected to
the network to support remote training so that researchers can learn to use the
software and hardware independently of the primary centrifuge system. UCD will
purchase 96 amplifier modules to support strain gauges, load cells, displacement
sensors, and other miscellaneous transducers that will be used in model testing.
The two tablet PCs will be available for use by researchers during model
preparation and testing. These tablet PCs will be configured with software to
access the centrifuge data acquisition systems, as well as the data repository
and site specifications database via the wireless network. This equipment will
be available to the earthquake engineering research community through the NEES
Consortium, Inc., UCD NEES facility. This award is funded by the NSF NEES Major
Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project and is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).
