With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the
research of Professor Abigail G. Doyle of Princeton University to invent new
reagents and strategies for nucleophilic fluorination. The first objective of
this research is to develop Lewis base-catalyzed hydrofluorinations using
benzoyl fluoride as a latent fluoride source. The second objective is to design
catalytic methods for the regio- and stereoselective synthesis of allylic and
benzylic fluorides. The research is expected to facilitate the discovery and
manufacture of pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and functional materials by
enabling the preparation of novel fluorinated building blocks using inexpensive
and readily available fluoride sources. Knowledge accrued through these
investigations should give way to a better understanding of the impact of
aliphatic fluorine substitution in biomedical and basic research and afford new
opportunities for reaction design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Doyle will
also be initiating educational outreach projects that interweave research and
teaching. The impact of the education plan will be to broaden participation in
STEM fields, particularly by underrepresented minorities and women, through
early engagement of these students in hands-on research activities. One program
involves providing students from a Trenton-area community college that serves a
diverse population, including underrepresented minorities and low-income
students, the opportunity to pursue research as part of their honors chemistry
curriculum in Professor Doyle's laboratory. Second, the student invited lecture
series at Princeton will be expanded to include speakers from industry,
primarily undergraduate institutions, and government agencies to expose students
to more varied career opportunities in the STEM disciplines.
