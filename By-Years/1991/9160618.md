Bio-Eng is developing a continuous flow reversed micellar-organic phase (RM-ORG)
process for the initial fractionation or purification of recombinant-DNA
therapeutic protein intermediates which are harvested from a fermentation broth.
The proposed RM-ORG process will not compete with, but will rather complement
high resolution chromatographic purification steps. RM-ORG fractionation would
increase throughput capacity by reducing the loading on higher resolution
chromatographic purification steps, and would thus reduce production time and
costs. Modest to high improvements in specificity (2 to 10 fold) and high yields
(95 to 100%) are anticipated. Other intrinsic benefits to the RM-ORG process
such as process stream clarification, concentration and buffer exchange are also
anticipated. Potential advantages of RM-ORG over existing primary purification
processes include selectivity, speed of processing, preservation of protein
integrity, and scalability.
