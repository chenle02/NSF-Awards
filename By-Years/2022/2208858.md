This planning proposal looks to enable the engagement of academic researchers
and coastal community stakeholders around Alaska. The community stakeholders
include tribal entities, community member harvesters, and mariculture farmers.
The team will use the planning process to begin discussions around workforce
development and diversity activities to be included in the future EPSCoR Track-1
Glaciers to Gulf (G2G) proposal. The G2G proposal will address aspects related
to: Terrestrial Export, Marine Resources, and Human Dimensions. The topics are
aligned with Alaska's Science and Technology Plan. The primary desired outcomes
from the planning grant activities include: 1) a team science collaboration plan
outlining best practices for stakeholder engagement and co-production of
research; 2) an assessment of existing strengths and weaknesses with respect to
the research themes and jurisdictional capacity (SWOT analysis); 3) an
evaluation of the existing gaps in jurisdictional expertise and knowledge (gap
analysis); and 4) a draft of a logic model to ensure success of
G2G.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
