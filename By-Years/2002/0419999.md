This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing large-throw, optically flat, high
resolution and fast response-speed deformable mirrors (DM). The DM is a critical
component in adaptive optics, which can be applied to improve medical imaging
technology. The device consists of Segmented Membrane Arrays (SMA) and bottom
electrodes with Backside Solder Bump (BSB) fabricated by micromachining
technology. The design will use arrays of mirror pixels to eliminate the cross
talk between adjacent elements. The mirror pixels will be made of stress-free
single crystalline silicon (SCS) to ensure optically flat surfaces.

The commercial application of this project will be in a number of areas,
including bio imaging instruments, telescope systems, 3D data storage systems
and free-space optical communications.
