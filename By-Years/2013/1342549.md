This research asks what relationship extremist ideologies and militarization
have to protracted displacement. This project has chosen a Chechen exile
community in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan as the research site within which it will
explore this question. The research comes in the wake of the violent acts
committed by Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the "Boston Marathon bombers," who
were ethnic Chechens born and raised in Tokmok. There has been widespread
speculation about their motivations that reflect the larger debate among social
scientists about the root causes of extremism. This research explores the role
of protracted displacement in ethnonationalism and potential extremism.

More than a million people from the Caucasus region displaced since 1944. Yet,
little is known about how protracted displacement in the Caucasus is related to
nationalism and extremist ideologies. This project investigates three
hypotheses: (1) that displaced Chechens in Kyrgyzstan are socially isolated from
the Kyrgyz and Russian communities; (2) that social isolation, unemployment and
uncertainty resulting from dislocation lead to a pervasive sense of waiting,
stasis and "nothingness" in the present rather than a sense of development and
progress; and (3) that the experience of exile leads to a historical narrative
that frames current dispossession and precarity in terms of future control over
disputed territory.

To conduct the research, the PI will travel to Kyrgyzstan to accomplish four
tasks: (1) interviewing the Chechen community about the history of forced
migration and conditions of protracted displacement in Kyrgyzstan; (2)
Conducting path analysis to determine how isolated the Chechen community is in
Kyrgyzstan; (3) interviewing Chechens, particularly young men, about daily
activities, including participation in street corner gatherings where young men
discuss politics, religion, and violence.

This research will shed light on the experiences of the Chechen community, now
seen as the major source of political conflict in the former USSR. More
importantly, it will create a framework for understanding why forced
displacement so often gives rise to violent political movements.
