Washington College request support from NSF for connection of their campus
network to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southeastern
United States. It will provide operations management and information services
and it will give Washington College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The University needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***//
