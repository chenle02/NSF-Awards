9625340 Sinkovich The objective of this research is to determine the nature and
behavior of quasiparticles in strongly correlated electron systems, where band
formation plays an important role. Conventional difficulties in analysis of spin
polarized photoemission from non-ferromagnets will be circumvented by combining
the spin analysis with circularly polarized soft-x-ray radiation in the vicinity
of the transition metal 2P (L3) photoabsorption edge. These photo emission
measurements will for the first time extend the application of spin-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to all transition metal materials irrespective of
their magnetic state (ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, etc.). The new
techniques will be applied to simple transition metal oxides, high-Tc
superconductors, and narrow band ferromagnets. The experiments will use state-
of-theart third generation synchrotron radiation sources in Europe and the
United States. %%% The fundamental understanding of magnetic materials remains
incomplete, particularly for the class of materials in which the magnetic
electrons interact strongly with one another. These are highly correlated
electron systems, and include the high temperature superconductors. This project
exploits state-of-theart synchrotron radiation sources to produce photoemitted
electrons from magnetic materials. An analysis of the magnetism (spin
polarization) of the photoelectrons yields crucial information about the
magnetic materials themselves. The results of the project will test current
theories of the origin of magnetism in highly correlated electron systems. The
information is primarily of fundamental interest and the results may lead to
development of new magnetic and superconducting materials. ***
