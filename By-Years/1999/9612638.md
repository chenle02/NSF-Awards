This project continues studying the theoretical effects that plasma and neutral
gas transport processes have on the ionosphere. Spanning three years, this
research involves model/data comparisons, theoretical studies of ionospheric
dynamics and electrodynamics, polar wind studies, and high-resolution
thermosphere studies. The PI will consider the ionosphere as an integrated
system, interacting with both the magnetosphere and thermosphere. Almost all of
the major ionospheric regions will be studied: E-region, F-region, and topside
ionosphere at equatorial, middle and high latitudes. Using mainly current
models, the PI will use data from several ionosondes, incoherent scatter radars
and satellites. Specifically, the research involves: (1) modeling/data
comparisons in support of the CEDAR/PRIMO initiative to explain storm enhanced
densities, model the plasma density cliff observed in the southern hemisphere,
and validate the predicted climatology for the topside F-region; (2) modeling
ionospheric dynamics studies, emphasizing global ionospheric response to gravity
waves, problems associated with coupling global ionospheric and MHD
magnetospheric models, and interpretation of incoherent scatter radar spectra
with neutral networks when ion distributions are non-Maxwellian; (3) studying
ionospheric electrodynamics of polar cap arcs, emphasizing on the cross-flow and
time delay associated with the formation and decay of arcs; and (4) studying
polar wind the effects of centrifugal acceleration, polar rain electrons,
precipitating magnetospheric ions, and ionospheric molecular ions on temporal
behavior of the flow; and (5) studying the high-resolution thermospheric
response to flux-transfer events, with consequent cusp convection jets and
plasma patch formation.
