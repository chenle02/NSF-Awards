930259 CHISHOLM Planktonic size spectra (the distribution of total biomass among
different size classes) are a manifestation of the structure and function of
pelagic ecosystems. As such, they embody information which could be useful for
understanding the regulation of productivity in different biogeochemical
provinces of the oceans. They also contain information essential to formulating
algorithms to interpret satellite ocean color measurements. The overall goal of
this project is to study, through observation and experimentation, how the
characteristics of planktonic size spectra vary in different regions of the
oceans and to determine what the underlying mechanisms are that generate and
maintain them. Flow cytometry will be used to develop automated techniques for
the generation of pelagic size spectra in the 0.3 to 100 micrometer size range,
allowing one to measure size and abundance of picoplankton, phytoplantkon,
bacteria, and microzooplankton. Once developed these methods will be applied to
studies in a variety of different oceanographic regimes under a variety of
different conditions. ***
