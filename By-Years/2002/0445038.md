The overall goal of the research project is to evaluate recent greenhouse
warming and the associated sea level rise against the background of long-term
variability in sea level since the last glaciation. Prior results of research
conducted by the current research team and others indicate that at the end of
the last interglacial, sea level dropped at a rate of at least one-half a meter
per century triggered by a postulated seasonal redistribution of solar
radiation. The orbital changes that governed the transition into a glacial
period continue operating today with less than half of their former intensity.

The researchers seek to clarify climate impacts due to the changing strength of
the "insolation beam" during the transitional seasons on ocean heating and polar
ice accumulation. The research will involve the analysis of paleoclimatic
evidence and current meteorological observations, as well as modeling
simulations of past and current climate while focusing on the relationship of
insolation forcing to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO), and the Arctic Oscillation (AO).
