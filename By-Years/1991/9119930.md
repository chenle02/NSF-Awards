This project, to be carried out by one of the leading U.S. experts in neutral
hydrogen studies, seeks to answer some of the many unanswered questions about
the formation and evolution of galaxies from primordial clouds of gas into the
complex systems of stars and gas we now see. This investigation will compare the
structure and dynamics of nearby galaxies with corresponding high redshift
objects of much younger age. By studying the processes which continue to modify
the structure of galaxies, and surveying the distribution of neutral hydrogen in
a sufficiently large volume of space, strict constraints will be placed on the
efficiency of conversion or primordial gas into gravitationally bound galactic
systems.
