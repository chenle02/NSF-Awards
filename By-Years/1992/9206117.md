A series of deep current meter moorings will be deployed in the Brazilian rise
(deep western boundary current) in support of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment's Deep Basin Experiment (DBE). The objectives of this study are (1)
to observe and quantify the deep circulation, (2) to distinguish between
boundary and interior mixing and (3) to study the nature of boundary mixing.
