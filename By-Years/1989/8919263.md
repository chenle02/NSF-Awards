An internal pressurization system will be acquired to conduct cyclic
deformation, fatigue, and fracture testing of alloys and fiber reinforced
composites. The system has hoop stress measurement capability. This is essential
for studies of mechanical behavior of materials in complex state environments.
The system will also be used to measure transverse properties of unidirectional
fiber reinforced composites.
