This grant will continue studies of the geometry of fault gouge to explore the
role of the particle distribution in the micromechanics of fault-zone
instabilities. Previous friction data will be analyzed in an attempt to
correlate the evolution of frictional parameters such as characteristic
displacement and velocity weakening with comminution and the evolution of shear
structures both within the gouge and at the wall-rock interface. These data will
be supplemented by a second series of friction experiments, and detailed mapping
of natural fault zones to search for analogous structures.
