The research activity will be focussed on three areas in the development of
robust, large-scale, flexible automation systems. They are: Fidelity of Device
Response, Level of Device Programmability and Data-Configurability in System
Control. To achieve this end modeling and characterization of quasistatic
volumetric errors in Computer Numeric Control machines will be carried out. Also
under consideration are data-configurable distributed control of flexible
automated manufacturing facilities and the development of a process planning
enabling platform.
