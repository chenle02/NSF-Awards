Bill Sprigg&lt;br/&gt;0224491&lt;br/&gt;.Funds are requested ($22,721) to allow
three U.S. scientists to participate&lt;br/&gt;in the 12th Conference of the
International Soil Conservation Organization&lt;br/&gt;in Beijing, to help
launch research under the Sino-U.S. Centers for Soil and&lt;br/&gt;Water
Conservation and Environmental Protection, and to participate in,
and&lt;br/&gt;report on, the opening ceremonies of the joint Centers in
Yangling, China.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator, the director of the U.S.
arm of the joint&lt;br/&gt;Centers, will also coordinate Centers' research plans
with personnel in&lt;br/&gt;other Chinese ministries and the U.S. Embassy, all
of whom potentially play&lt;br/&gt;important roles in determining the success of
the Centers. The facilitator&lt;br/&gt;for the Centers' Joint Organizing
Committee and a remote sensing specialist&lt;br/&gt;complete the trio. These
funds will ensure participation of non-federal&lt;br/&gt;representatives among a
larger delegation of Federal agency staff&lt;br/&gt;representing the Centers.
