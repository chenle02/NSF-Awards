Graph coloring problems have attracted researchers for more than a century. This
is partially due to their abundant practical applications and their relations to
other fields. For instance, the well-known Four Color Theorem asserts that four
colors is always enough to color the regions of a given map such that each
region gets one color and two regions sharing some border must receive different
colors. This RUI project focuses on intensive research on several graph coloring
and choosability problems, which have been frequently used as models for
practical applications such as scheduling, traffic control, and the channel
assignment problems. For instance, in scheduling final exam times of all courses
at a college, we construct a graph model by representing each course by a
vertex, and connecting two vertices (courses) by an edge if a student is taking
both courses. The chromatic number of such a graph model provides the minimum
number of exam time periods needed in order to schedule all final exams without
conflict. In addition, if some courses set restrictions on certain dates and
times, then it becomes a graph choosability problem. Research suitable for
undergraduates will be incorporated into Graph Theory and Graduate Seminar
courses, providing non-traditional and underrepresented students opportunities
to learn cutting edge research methods, and will involve three graduate students
yearly to work on research projects.

Graphs provide excellent models for various problems motivated by the channel
assignment problem, in which we assign channels to cities or stations such that
interference is avoided and the span of channels used is minimized. This RUI
project focuses on intensive research on graph coloring and choosability topics
with emphasis on utilizing research methodologies and results in number theory,
topology, and algebra. The goal is to bring new insight into, and broaden the
study of, areas of graph theory that are related to number theory, topology, and
algebra, as well as applications to broadcast communication. Specifically, the
PI will investigate distance graphs and number theory problems, topological
combinatorics, graph choosability, and colorings motivated by the channel
assignment problem.
