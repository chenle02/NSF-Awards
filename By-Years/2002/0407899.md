Gliding aerodynamics and the Origin of Bat Flight&lt;br/&gt;By Sharon M. Swartz
and Kristin Bishop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question of how a structure that is
well adapted for one function evolves into a new structure adapted for a
different function without a functional intermediate phase continues to
challenge evolutionary biologists. One example of this kind of transition is the
evolution of flight in bats from a gliding ancestor. One assumption is that
short, broad wings of living mammalian gliders cannot generate enough lift if
they are used in flapping flight. Conversely, few bats glide routinely, a second
assumption, therefore, is that long, slender bat wings do not work well for
gliding. Aerodynamic theory has focused on human-engineered aircraft, so very
little is known about small, flexible, slow moving wings such as those of
mammalian gliders and bats. To better understand the evolution of flight in
bats, the effect of wing shape on the aerodynamics of small, flexible wings will
be tested in the present study by building physical models of wings that span a
continuum from glider-like to bat-like. The lift and drag forces that are
generated at biologically realistic wind speeds will be measured in a wind
tunnel. To determine the origin of flight in bats, it is also important to
understand the mechanisms of gliding in living mammals. Gliding evolved
independently in six separate groups of living mammals that all share similar
body shapes and behaviors. This strongly suggests that any gliding ancestor of
bats also shared these features, and that the study of gliding mammals can give
important insights into bat ancestors. Three-dimensional motion analysis of
gliding in three groups of gliding mammals will be used to learn more about
gliding behavior in mammals. This information, combined with the physical model
data, will allow assessment of the importance of wing shape in a relevant
biological context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
