9400515 Montgomery The research entails differential-geometric techniques
applied to optimization and related problems in control theory. The theory of
distributions is considered as the model of the control system up to feedback
equivalence. Singular geodesics within these systems will be analyzed. The
research has potential applications to micromotor systems and robotic
engineering.
