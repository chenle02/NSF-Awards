9314229 Sager This award will support a detailed geological and geophysical
survey of the Shatsky Rise in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Existing data
provide the basis for a model of Shatsky's formation which indicates that it
formed through coalescence of three separate volcanic phases during initial
melting at a mantle hotspot. The cruise is designed to test this model and to
provide site survey data for a highly ranked drilling proposal submitted to the
Ocean Drilling Program. A major emphasis of the drilling proposal is to examine
the long history of carbonate sedimentation on the Shatsky Rise which may record
oceanographic conditions as far back as the Jurassic. ***
