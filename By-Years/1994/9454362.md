9454362 Cook Description: This 48 month project directly enhances the science
understanding and teaching skills of elementary school teachers by establishing
a network of collaborative linkages between classrooms and the Arboretum through
telecommunications technology, structured science expeditions, student
investigations, and regular opportunities for teacher reflection. The project
goals are: to increase knowledge of botany and zoology; to provide access to the
Internet; to create network communities of students and teachers from resource-
rich and resource-poor schools working with each other and with scientists from
the Arboretum; to support student investigations; to offer a family science
program; to work with and within the SSI and the Boston USI; and to disseminate
the model to other similar centers. These goals are accomplished through summer
workshops for teachers, student field studies, family science programs, and
evaluation/dissemination. Funding is provided for the teacher training in the
summers (with follow up) and the evaluation/dissemination. In its initial
stages, the project works with three school communities adjoining the Arboretum
in Boston, Massachusetts. Two-hundred and seventy elementary school teachers
receive courses, field experiences and direct support from the Arboretum. An
additional 150 teachers, primarily from within the state, receive training
through telecommunications and local support. Cost sharing is estimated at 55%.
