Active seafloor spreading within the Gulf of Aden comes ashore in the Republic
of Djibouti, with the result that many of the manifestations of seafloor
spreading are accessible to direct and detailed analysis. The investigators,
together with French colleagues, will conduct a Global Positioning System
geodetic measurement across the Ghoubbet.Asal Rift. Six to eight satellite
receivers will be used to re.occupy sites where the French have made
measurements over the past 50 years, and to establish a fiducial network at
numerous locations across the Middle East and Africa. The goal is to measure
strains to 1 centimeter accuracy across a grid that extends 60 km from the
central rift. Of special interest is determining the areal extent of 5.6 cm/year
rifting that has characterized the Asal Rift since aresurrgence of tectonism in
1973.
