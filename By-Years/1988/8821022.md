This award is for partial support of the 7th International Conference on Finite
Element Methods in Flow Problems. It is to be held in April 1989, in Huntsville,
Alabama. A special focus intended for this conference is an assessment of the
relative merits of Finite Element versus Finite Difference methods in
Computational Fluid Dynamics.
