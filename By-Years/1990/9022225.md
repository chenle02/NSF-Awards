The overall objective of this research project is to develop improved
amperometric biosensors based on new polymeric electron relay systems, which can
electrically couple flavoenzyme molecules to a conventional electrode surface.
By using the proposed method of facilitating electron transfer from the enzyme
to the electrode, along with novel enzyme immobilization techniques, the
Principal Investigators (PIs) suggest that it will be possible to make
amperometric biosensors for a large number of clinically and industrially
important molecules. These sensors should be highly stable in both continuous
operation and multiple-use applications.
