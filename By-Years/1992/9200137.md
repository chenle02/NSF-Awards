This award supports the activities of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site in Flagstaff, Arizona, which will enable eight to ten undergraduate
students selected in a national competition to do astronomical research under
the mentorship of professional scientists. The research activities will take
place in Flagstaff during the summer months. Under the direction of Dr. Kathleen
DeGioia Eastwood, the principal investigator, several organizations will be
involved in this REU site: Northern Arizona University (NAU), the Lowell
Observatory, the astrogeology branch of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the
Flagstaff station of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Flagstaff is particularly well-
suited as an REU site since it is also the home of the National Undergraduate
Research Observatory (NURO), a nation-wide consortium of undergraduate schools
dedicated to undergraduate research. Supplementing their research, students will
also attend two lecture series related to the science and techniques of
astronomy, for which they will receive university credit. REU sites such as the
one planned in Flagstaff are important in increasing the technical and
scientific skills of the Nation's most talented and motivated undergraduates,
and in enabling those students to experience state-of-the-art scientific
research before they make their final career decisions.
