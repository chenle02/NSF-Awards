Gordon 9601916 The functioning of the nervous system depends on an intricate
network of connections between cells. Much of the communication occurs at tiny
physical contacts between cells called synapses. Learning and memory are thought
to involve changes in the strength of the communication through collections of
synapses. It is therefore important to understand how synapses are built and
function by dissecting them into their component molecules. A well defined model
system for this research is the neuromuscular junction, a large isolated synapse
between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. Several molecules identified
originally at the neuromuscular junction have now been found at synapses
throughout the nervous system, suggesting common molecular mechanisms underlying
synapse formation and maintenance. Dr. Gordon identified chondroitin sulfate, a
carbohydrate component found attached to molecules on the muscle cell surface,
plays important roles in the molecular organization and development of the
synapse. Further studies are examining the role of chondroitin sulfate in both
the structure of the synapse and in signaling required for synapse formation.
The studies provide an exciting opportunity to identify new components of the
synapse and to gain enhanced understanding of the mechanisms governing
communication between nerve cells in the brain.
