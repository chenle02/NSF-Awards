0100915 Tesh This award to Skidaway Institute of Oceangraphy provides computer
hardware and peripherals required to operate the NOAA Scientific Computer System
(SCS v. 3.0) on the vessel Savannah, presently under construction, which will be
operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System

system on the vessel, and will thus be a resource used by all scientific users
of the vessel in their research during 2001 and future years. ***
