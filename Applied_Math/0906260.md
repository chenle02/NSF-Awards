The goal of the project is to design and study greedy type approximation
methods that are practically implementable in numerical integration and learning
theory. One of the biggest challenges of contemporary applied mathematics is
high-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems with dimensions of
hundreds, and even thousands, arise naturally in finance, quantum chemistry,
biology, medicine, and other areas. Typical problems of this kind are numerical
integration and statistical estimation. The fundamental question is how to
construct good methods of numerical integration (cubature formulas) and
statistical estimation. Recent investigations show that greedy type
approximation methods are good for different high-dimensional problems,
including problems from numerical integration and learning theory. The
investigator and his colleagues study application of greedy approximations in
numerical integration and learning theory. Preliminary investigations show that
greedy type approximation methods work well in high dimensions and can be
considered as a constructive deterministic alternative to some powerful
probabilistic methods. The greedy approximation has potential to become a
transformative concept of numerical integration andlearning theory.

Understanding intelligence and how it learns and assimilates information is one
of the great scientific challenges of this decade. It is key to designing
systems to efficiently analyze data and extract essential information. The
scientific discipline that studies this aspect of intelligence is called
learning theory. It has a myriad of existing and potential applications in both
the defense and civilian sectors. For instance, managing large data bases such
as security data bases obtained through surveillance requires classification of
the data sets in order to speed up extraction of significant features or
specific information. Learning theory discovers rules that allow the
classification of new data from past data that have already been classified. A
prototypical application is the search through a large data base (for example
emails) to determine which of these have possible links to terrorist activities.
It is the goal of this project to utilize fundamental concepts in approximation
and statistics to clearly define and quantify the learning challenge and design
new, more efficient techniques (greedy algorithms).
