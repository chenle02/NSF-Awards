This project, developing SENSEI (SENSor Environment Imaging), an instrument that
targets a broad range of big data science and engineering challenges, promises a
unique sensor platform for 2D and 3D recording within dynamic environments.
SENSEI contributes to a broad range of data-driven application domains. These
range from fundamental research in instrument design and development to data
processing, fusion and synthesis, enabling not only the creation of the
instrument, but also its use as a resource for multi-domain science and
engineering on the ground, in the air, and
underwater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, SENSEI is a spherical, (ultra)
high-resolution (9-times-IMAX resolution and ~terapixel/minute flood of
imagery), vision-based capture system capable of video-rate data-acquisition.
The instrument will address domain challenges in science, engineering, medicine,
and beyond by enabling investigation of big data acquisition, streaming,
processing, archiving and access, visualization, and
analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this project will be
felt in a variety of image-intensive scientific disciplines. The areas of
environmental monitoring, remote sensing, situational awareness, homeland
security, and mechanical and structural engineering can greatly benefit from the
proposed instrument. The instrument will be designed for replication by the
global community of researchers and the graduate students. The technology will
be communicated through classes, projects, theses, publications, as well as
museum exhibits and conferences. Special attention has been paid to broadening
participation through the Minority Serving Institutions Cyber-Infrastructure
Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC).
