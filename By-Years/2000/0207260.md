Broad-band extremely low frequency waves (BBELF) are correlated with the heating
of the topside auroral ionosphere. This project will examine BBELF waves from a
theoretical and computational standpoint to determine what role these waves play
in the energization of ions. Results from previous research indicate that the
BBELF waves are driven by plasma instabilities arising from the shear in the
parallel electron currents in the ionosphere. Understanding the characteristics
of the waves will lead to an understanding of the mechanism of transverse ion
energization and the mechanisms that mediate the coupling of the ionosphere and
magnetosphere.
