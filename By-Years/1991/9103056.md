This project spans a variety of fields in ergodic theory. Professor Bergelson
will concentrate on the study of multiple recurrence and mixing in dynamical
systems. The problems to be researched are closely related to combinatorics and
number theory. Professor Rosenblatt research will be in the area of almost
everywhere convergence of various averaging methods. This award will also
support Dr. Ward, a postdoctoral researcher. His work involves the relationship
between positive entropy, mixing of all orders, exponential recurrence, and the
action of the integer lattice on compact groups. Because dynamical systems can
display extremely complicated, even chaotic behavior, it is impossible to follow
the time development of such a system in complete detail. Ergodic theory
involves methods of studying certain average properties of these systems which
contain enough information to nevertheless be useful.
