The PI plans to establish rigidity and finiteness results for infinite groups,
both in geometric and dynamical contexts. In an attempt to broaden the scope of
rigidity as initiated by Mostow, Margulis, Zimmer and others, we aim at results
for very general (finitely generated) groups, notably fundamental groups arising
in geometry. The proposed methods are however also new and relevant for the more
classical study of arithmetic and S-arithmetic groups. There are three aspects
to the project. The first is to construct cohomological invariants
characterizing various geometric situations; a typical example is the
interpretation of negative curvature in terms of bounded cohomology that we
propose with Shalom. The second step is to develop a suitable theory to handle
these invariants in an efficient way, notably by using tools from ergodic
theory. Last, one has to apply this to concrete situations. We focus in
particular on superrigidity and cocycle superrigidity for non-linear groups and
on orbit equivalence of ergodic actions.

The last forty years have witnessed the birth and remarkable development of what
is now called ''rigidity theory''. The first discovery in that field was this:
Even though a flat space (which is the kind of space one thought we live in,
from the ancient Greeks to Newton) can be deformed in many ways, some curved
spaces (whose relevance to our world has been discovered by Einstein) are in a
sense rigid. Later came a discovery regarded as yet much more fundamental: The
most symmetric geometric spaces turn out to be in fact arithmetic objects. The
project under consideration here is to broaden the scope this rigidity theory to
many more geometric spaces, and especially to deal with situations in which the
geometry cannot be reduced to arithmetics. Actually, we propose new methods that
stand out by their abstract nature and allow us to tackle situations which do
not even stem from geometry, but rather regard the study of dynamics. (Dynamics
is the theory of systems that evolve in time, typically ocean currents or
galaxies, and may have chaotic behaviours.) Our project proposes new methods for
obtaining more results both in this dynamical setting and in geometry, and this
in a unified way.
