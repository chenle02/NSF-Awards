Computer controlled and monitored fermentor work stations enable students to
investigate the effects of altered parameters on industrially important
fermentation processes. The project will help prepare students for the
diversified needs of the many pharmaceutical industries and clinical
laboratories in the area. The equipment will be shared with students from other
institutions in the area.
