This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to develop
alternative biofilm control products for preventing biofilm accumulation on a
wide range of household, industrial, and medically relevant surfaces. Biofilm
formation in industrial water systems leads to poor system performance, to
accelerated biocorrosion, and to increased maintenance expense. Microbial
colonization of food processing equipment and medical devices poses a serious
health threat when biofilms harbor pathogenic organisms. Toxic biocides, even at
high concentrations, often fail to control problematic biofilms. The efficacy of
traditional antimicrobial agents would be greatly improved if used in
conjunction with biofilm degrading enzymes. This Phase I project will identify
promising biofilm matrix- hydrolyzing enzyme candidates. The follow on Phase II
project will develop enzyme products that are stable in the presence of chemical
biocides and a variety of adverse reaction conditions. These enzyme formulations
will eventually be tested against mixed-species biofilms.

The commercial applications of this project are in a number of areas, including
water distribution systems, food processing equipment, industrial machinery and
medical devices.
