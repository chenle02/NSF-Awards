AST 0335207&lt;br/&gt;PI Bergin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The birth sites of stars
and planetary systems are dense regions of the interstellar medium, and one of
the major goals of modern astrophysics is to develop a general theory of star
formation. Toward that end this project is probing star forming regions through
a comprehensive program that combines maps of total column density or visual
extinction created using powerful techniques based on wide-field infrared
imaging with observations of molecular lines. This allows for a determination of
molecular abundance profiles as a function of cloud depth. Using a state-of-the-
art chemical model and excitation code, the chemical predictions will be
translated into observables to be compared with the observational molecular line
studies in several star forming regions tracing different evolutionary stages.
The result will be significantly enhanced ability to interpret molecular
observations in star and planet forming regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact. This project is training a graduate student in image analysis techniques
used in infrared and radio astronomy, as well as in theoretical chemistry and
star formation theory. One or more undergraduate students will participate in a
hands-on research project.&lt;br/&gt;
