Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems&lt;br/&gt;Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny,
University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;Next Generation Communication Networks Using
Multicarrier Filter Bank&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to develop an effective solution for next-generation wireless
communications that comprehensively addresses the important issues of efficient
use of the wireless spectrum, user mobility, and multi-access applications. The
approach is to use multicarrier filter banks to minimize the side-lobes of the
filters that constitute the subcarrier signals, thereby alleviating the need for
subcarrier synchronization among different nodes in a network. Freedom from the
subcarrier synchronization should alleviate problems due to Doppler shift under
mobility and, also, enable cognitive radio communication and support
communication among ad-hoc nodes without the need for centralized infrastructure
nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merits of this
research include a thorough analysis and development of the class of
multicarrier systems that use filter banks for subcarrier channelization with
emphasis on networks with high-mobility; development of novel equalization and
synchronization algorithms for multicarrier filter bank modems; and the
development and analysis of novel medium access control protocols that take
advantage of the high spectral containment of subcarrier signals in multicarrier
filter bank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Multicarrier filter banks are
an enabling technology for efficient and complete use of the radio spectrum, so
the research has potential economic and societal benefits related to wireless
communications. In addition to the technological impact, the multicarrier
concepts serve as a catalyst for learning in several active research and project
experiences in signals and systems, software radio, and networking
courses.&lt;br/&gt;
