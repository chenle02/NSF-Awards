Many of the major problems currently being addressed by molecular biology
involve the interactions of proteins and nucleic acids. Viruses provide a
convenient means of addressing some of these questions. In particular, viruses
with their own packaged polymerases provide self-contained systems in which the
interaction of both enzymatic and structural proteins with nucleic acids can be
studied in an easily purified and isolated form. Among such viruses, the double-
stranded RNA viruses are unique in a number of ways. The substrate for their
transcriptase is an entirely double- stranded RNA. The transcriptase and
replicase are located in the same polypeptide. The substrate for packaging and
replication is then viral plus strand. They are multi- segmented and in some
double-stranded RNA viruses, package their RNAs in an equimolar ratio in one
particle. Some of these viruses replicate semi-conservatively and some
conservatively. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus is a simple version of such
viruses, with one essential RNA of known sequence, one major capsid polypeptide,
only one segment of RNA per particle, and only two open reading frames, the
second ready by frameshifting. There are extensive genetics of virus-host
interaction. This is therefore a useful model system studying packaging in
double- stranded RNA virus. The PI proposes to focus on the determination of the
optimal viral binding site and its relationship to viral interference and
packing; and identification of the specificity determinants of viral binding and
packaging.
