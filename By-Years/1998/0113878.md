The Million Book project is a multinational initiative to create a digital
online archive of at least a&lt;br/&gt;million books and manuscripts freely
available to anyone at any time. It will enhance research,&lt;br/&gt;learning
and teaching by making a critical mass of scholarly information freely available
to&lt;br/&gt;read online. It will support the needs of citizens for practical
information and recreational reading&lt;br/&gt;as well as supporting scholarship
and education. India, and possibly China, will supply the manpower&lt;br/&gt;for
scanning centers while the U. S. provides equipment and software. This pilot
project supplies&lt;br/&gt;the startup money for the first few scanning centers.
