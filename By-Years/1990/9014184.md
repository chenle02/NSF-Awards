The Eocene period of earth history was warmer and had lower pole-to-equator
thermal gradients than today. Preliminary modeling results suggest that the only
way to achieve this type of climate is with greater CO2 concentrations in the
atmosphere and with higher poleward heat transport. Thus this interval in earth
history may provide important constraints on the effects of future CO2 increases
in the atmosphere. This proposal requests support to constrain the effects of
higher CO2 and heat transport on this climate using sophisticated General
Circulation Model experiments and new paleoclimate data. This research is
important because it will help to isolate the effects of higher CO2 on climate,
a topic which is very important for understanding the effects of fossil fuel CO2
on future climate.
