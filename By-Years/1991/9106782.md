Aerial plant surfaces support diverse populations of epiphytic bacteria
including ice-nucleation-active Pseudomonas syringae strains. Previous studies
indicate that P. syringae strains compete for the same limiting resource in the
phyllosphere, but exhibit differences in their relative competitive ability and
their degree of coexistence. One P. syringae strain investigated showed a high
degree of coexistence with other epiphytic bacterial species, including
Xanthomonas maltophilia and Erwinia herbicola. The proposed research will
examine the role of resource partitioning in the coexistence of bacterial
epiphytes, particular differential site occupation and different nutrient
utilization. The spatial distribution of coexisting epiphytes will be examined
using immuno-fluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy. Further, the role of
aggregation and site independence will be addressed using a binary sensing
system based on bioluminescence and the diffusion of an activator from one
strain to another. The role of different nutrient utilization in coexistence
will be investigated using naturally occurring P. syringae strain pairs and
isogenic P. syringae strains altered in specific metabolic capabilities. The use
of manipulated isogenic strains will provide a powerful tool in these
investigations of resource partitioning. The investigators will use innovative
and carefully-executed molecular techniques to investigate the importance of
resource partitioning in determining coexistence in bacterial communities.
