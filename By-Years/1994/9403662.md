The primary focus of this research is the number theoretic aspects of
computational problems. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest
in this area. Ancient problems have been solved (e.g. primality testing), new
subdisciplines have been spawned (e.g. public-key cryptography) and deep
mathematical tools have emerged (e.g. Abelian varieties, class field theory).
One area of particular interest is the new ``number field sieve`. This
collection of algorithms, developed by many researchers, is the most significant
advance in integer factoring in the last quarter century. This work continues to
investigate improvements and generalizations of this method, in particular, to
the function field setting. The new ``function field sieve` is used for the
calculations of discrete logarithms over finite fields and shows promise for
supplanting existing algorithms for finite fields of appropriate form. A second
area of interest is the application of recent results to public-key
cryptography. The United States Government has recently proposed a national
``Digital Signature Standard` (DSS). The proposed scheme relies for its security
on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. The DSS is controversial and
this research investigates the potential of several methods, including the
number field sieve and the function field sieve, for breaking the proposed
system or for introducing ``trapdoors`. Another area of investigation involves
the development of new mathematical tools. Finally, the relationships between
biological systems and computation is explored. One aspect of this relationship
concerns computer viruses.
