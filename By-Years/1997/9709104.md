This new award to William S. Buhro at Washingon University is supported by the
Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid-State
Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research. The focus of the
research is the development of the Solution-Liquid-Solid (SLS) crystallization
technique as a general method for the low-temperature synthesis of nonmolecular
inorganic solids. The primary feature of the SLS method is the dispersion of
nonometer-size molten Indium or Indium/Gallium droplets in an organometallic
precursor solution, from which the whisker crystals grow. Catalyzed
organometallic reactions occur at the droplet-solution interface, depositing the
products into solution in the droplet. The droplets become supersaturated,
driving whisker growth. The specific goals of the research are to (1) establish
the detailed mechanism of SLS growth, (2) gain control of nanowhisker sizes and
produce narrow size distributions, (3) gain control of nanowhisker compositions
in ternary systems, (4) investigate fabrication of heterostructured
nanowhiskers, and (5) assess the generality of SLS growth to the synthesis of
III-V nitrides and II-VI chalcogenides. This research will explore the mechanism
and scope of a new low-temperature route to solid state materials limited by
chemical and surface reactivity compared to traditional high temperature methods
which are limited by precursor volatility. Since the new method is kinetically
driven, new solid phases can be expected. Solid state nanowhiskers of controlled
composition and size are likely to be useful in electronic and optical
applications.
