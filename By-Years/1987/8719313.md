Bruenn will continue his theoretical work on the collapse and supernova
explosion of a massive star. Important are an improved equation of state and
better understanding of the role of neutrinos in sustaining the outward moving
shock. The result should be a reliable computation of the explosion all the way
to the time when the shock approaches the surface. The supernova explosion 1987A
was unique not only because it was relatively near and bright but also because
it yielded a measurable flux of neutrinos, the elusive particles that inform us
of the deep interiors of the Sun and now of exploding stars. Thus it is now
appropriate to improve the theories on the origin and effects of the neutrinos
in exploding stars. In particular, the neutrinos may play an important role in
sustaining the stellar explosion, which might otherwise falter unspectacularly.
Bruenn is an expert in the relevant physics and will continue his modeling of
the supernova explosion and its neutrinos.
