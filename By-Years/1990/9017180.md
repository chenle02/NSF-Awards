Interlukins are important substances produced by the immune system. These
substances, first discovered in white blood cells, have been implicated in a
number of basic brain functions, such as sleep, disorientation, the production
of fever and coma. This research will explore the regulation of neuronal
interlukin metabolism, a problem of paramount importance in neuroscience. Dr.
Reichlin will develop separate cultures of neurons and glia cells to test the
effects of molecular probes, and to study the factors which influence the
synthesis and secretion of neuronal interlukins in the brain. Results from this
study will aid in understanding the role of interlukins in the brain.
