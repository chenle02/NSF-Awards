Dissertation Improvement Research: Effects of Glacial-Interglacial Climate
Change on Mass Wasting, Southeastern Minnesota This project will investigate the
effects of glacial-interglacial climate change on processes of hillslope erosion
in a part of southeastern Minnesota that was near the ice margin during the last
glacial period. Study results should be applicable to a larger area of the Upper
Mississippi Valley that is physiographically similar. The project will test the
hypothesis that extensive slope erosion by mass wasting was triggered by
permafrost formation during the last glacial period, but that mass wasting has
been inactive under subsequent interglacial climatic conditions. Radiocarbon
dating and other methods will be used to determine the chronology of past mass
wasting episodes. The results of the study should enhance interpretation of
large-scale changes in sediment movement and storage in the Upper Mississippi
basin over the past 25,000 years. )
