A systematic calorimetric study of 2D helium films in the localized and
superfluid regimes, from 2K down to 50mK, is proposed for a definitive test of
the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory. A variety of substrates will be employed.
Secondly, thermal conductivity measurements will be made on helium in porous
media, as a probe of the mechanism involved.
