AST-0123487&lt;br/&gt;Smith, Ian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sensitive CCD camera
system to enable imaging photometry, spectroscopy and polarimetry of the out
burst and the following brightness decay of Gamma Ray Bursters will be designed,
fabricated, assembled, aligned, tested, integrated and calibrated. In year 1 of
this proposal the instrument will be located at the Coude room of the Air Force
Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on Haleakela Hawaii. During year 2 the
instrument will be mounted on the trunion axle of the alt-azimuth mount of the
telescope. The instrument's operation will be documented to the extent that Air
Force instruments scientists in residence on Maui will maintain the routine
operation of the instrument.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
