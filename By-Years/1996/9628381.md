9628381 Tikoff Major orogenic belts occur at zones of interaction between rigid
plates or blocks which converse or diverge obliquely relative to one another. At
zones of oblique convergence, material accommodates both shortening across the
belt and lateral shearing parallel to the belt. In the upper crust this
deformation is not accommodated homogeneously, with contraction structures
having shortening directions perpendicular to the orogen coexisting with strike-
slip faults oriented parallel to the belt. This phenomena of strike-slip
partitioning occurs at subduction and continental collision zones on a variety
of scales, but as yet does not have a clear mechanical explanation. The
objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that strike-slip
partitioning is inherently related to the nonplane-strain character of
deformation in oblique tectonics. By combining kinematic modeling with a series
of physical and numerical experiments, the dynamics of strike-slip partitioning
will be investigated. Results are expected to improve the understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms of strike-slip partitioning in the upper crust.
