Professor Coppens is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to use synchrotron radiation to determine the locations of
atoms in solids which are superconductors and organic substances which are
conductors. These studies will help us understand why some materials behave as
superconductors at high temperatures and why the organic materials are
superconductors at very low temperatures. The project involves the use of
synchrotron radiation to study the following: Anomalous scattering of X-rays is
used to selectively identify site occupancy, and in combination with high-
accuracy charge density techniques, to site-selectively determine the oxidation
states of atoms in solids. The response of organic and inorganic crystals to an
external electric field is measured and analysed in terms of the piezoelectric
effect and molecular and ionic displacements. Very low temperature single
crystal techniques are used in the analysis of charge densities in crystals, and
in the investigation of the dependence of the structure of low-dimensional
conducting solids on temperature.
