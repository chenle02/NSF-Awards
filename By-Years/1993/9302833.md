General Atomics is establishing a connection to NSFNET via 56,000 bits per
second lines for the San Diego Community College District. The District
comprises three community colleges and eight continuing education centers. The
connection enables the faculties and students to communicate and collaborate
with the international scientific and educational community, and to access
network resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award
funds part of the costs for two years.
