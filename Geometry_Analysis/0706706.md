The underlying theme of this project is to understand in more depth the role of
Ricci curvature in geometry, topology and analysis. The problems to be
considered include how to effectively bring in the Ricci curvature information
when the comparison theorems are no longer applicable; how to understand the
interaction between the Ricci curvature and analysis on manifolds admitting
extra structures; how to obtain sharp dependency on the Ricci curvature of the
solutions to various geometric PDEs.

Ricci curvature, as a way of measuring how space curves, arises naturally from
geometry and physics. It has always been an important subject in geometry to
understand its effect on global shapes of the space. This project is about
looking at, hence gaining new insight into, the Ricci curvature from different
angles via analytical methods.
