Previous power and energy research has focused almost exculsive on battery-
operated devices. In contrast, this research is focused is focused on power and
energy prediction and conservation for clusters of
servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the research are: (1) to develop
a methodology and a tool that combine analytical modeling, experimentation, and
optimization algorithms to predict the power/energy conservation techniques
server clusters; (2) to develop power/energy conservation techniques that can
use the prediction infrastructure to optimize consumption for both curren and
future server cluster without excessive performance degradingl and (3) to
design, implement, and evaluate cluster systems that exploit these
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will allow server cluster to be
engineered to a specific and low consumption. Furthermore, it allow conservation
techniques to make fundamental tradeoff decisions about power, energy, and
performance. These developments will have important implications, given that the
computational model upon which the Internet is oragnized relies on large server
clusters.
