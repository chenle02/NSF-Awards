The number of underrepresented students is increasing and more of these students
are pursuing college degrees, but their completion rate for baccalaureate
science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) degrees still lags the general
population. The Bridges Across Texas LSAMP (BAT LSAMP) Pre-Alliance will bring
together personnel from six institutions of higher learning to develop a plan to
improve recruitment, retention, and graduation of underrepresented students,
with a focus on students transferring from community colleges into STEM majors
at four-year universities. The overarching goal of the project is to strengthen
the pipeline from community colleges to four-year institutions, and address the
growing STEM workforce needs of the State of Texas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Pre-Alliance will focus on evaluating: (i) underrepresented students' attitudes,
barriers, and needs; (ii) existing capacity and gaps in STEM curriculum at
partner institutions; (iii) underrepresented students recruitment and retention
strategies; (iv) transfer barriers at the four-year institution partners; and
(v) infrastructure needs at each partner institution. Over 18 months, the
project will administer student and administrator questionnaires, conduct focus-
group meetings, and hold meetings to identify the barriers faced by and needs of
underrepresented STEM students. The data gathered will inform policy and produce
practices that meet students' needs, with an ultimate goal of increasing
enrollment and completion of STEM degrees by underrepresented students. The
intellectual merit of the project is that it will generate practical knowledge
regarding how relationships between two-year and four-year institutions develop
and strengthen, and will offer insights into how institutions of higher
education can collectively support students' diverse pathways through the higher
education landscape.
