The objective of this proposal is to upgrade the facilities of the Northeast
Science Station (near Cherskiy, Siberia), enabling greatly expanded analytical
capacity onsite. The equipment purchases include a Shimadzu total organic carbon
and nitrogen analyzer, muffle furnace, precision balance, stereo microscope, and
YSI multi-parameter water quality logger. Increased analytical capacity at the
Northeast Science Station will facilitate expanded freshwater, marine, and
terrestrial research opportunities and minimize the logistical costs associated
with international shipping and customs. Many types of analyses are best done on
fresh samples, so the capacity to perform measurements onsite will also improve
data reliability. The upgraded analytical facilities would benefit student
training. The upgrades requested in this proposal would accelerate scientific
progress and allow sampling strategies to be adapted in the field based on
results of recently collected and analyzed samples.
