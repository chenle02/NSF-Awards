While many bacteria are inoffensive or even beneficial to humans, some are
harmful pathogens. Finding a way to kill the pathogenic bacteria without harming
the beneficial microbes could prove a useful tool. Phage research has emerged as
an exciting new frontier in microbiology due to its role in shaping microbiomes
and as a potential therapy against drug-resistant bacterial infections. Phages
identify and interact with their specific bacterial target through a structure
known as the receptor-binding protein. While characterization of thousands of
natural phages have occurred, limited studies have explored the molecular
mechanisms that govern phage-host interactions through the receptor-binding
protein. This research will apply genome engineering, high-throughput DNA
sequencing, and viral metagenomics approaches to elucidate how protein sequences
encode function. The research will be the basis for numerous viral-focused
educational outreach activities, including for middle school classrooms, to
expose a diverse audience to relevant, real-word issues in viral and bacterial
biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Receptor binding proteins mediate the interaction
of a phage with its bacterial receptor(s) and thus constitute key determinants
of a phageâ€™s host range and activity (virulence). Phages exhibit high functional
plasticity through genetic alterations of these proteins to adapt to new host
environments. Despite extensive research to address the mechanisms associated
with this interaction, it remains unclear how receptor binding protein mutations
influence phage activity and host range. This work will examine the molecular
rules of receptor binding proteins of coliphages, viruses that infect coliform
bacteria, and will seek to exploit those rules to engineer synthetic coliphages
with specificity for foodborne pathogens. In addition, the project will study
receptor binding proteins from another group of phages that have a more complex
receptor binding architecture that permits the phage to both enzymatically
degrade the capsule that protects certain bacteria and also to bind to host
receptors. To understand this process mechanistically, mutational and
metagenomic scanning will be used to map and identify the function of every
sequence in the receptor binding protein of a phage with the dual capability.
These mutational studies will inform protein design strategies guided by machine
learning to engineer new phage-host interactions. The project has the potential
to create tools that could be broadly adopted by the research community to study
sequence-function relationships in a variety of phage-host
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
