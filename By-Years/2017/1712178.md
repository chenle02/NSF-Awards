This project focuses on combining solid mechanics experimentation and material
visualization to enhance undergraduate solid mechanics education and assist
students to develop appropriate mental models of abstract engineering concepts
to enhance learning. This effort employs multiple length scale material
characterization and visualization for solid mechanics education, web-based
education modules, and experiential learning. A broad impact of this research is
a contribution to the education of future professional engineers in fundamental
solid mechanics and increase in the critical number of individuals who are
capable of translating STEM advances into engineering
innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is pilot testing the
effectiveness of mechanics education by establishing the relation of material
structure and solid mechanics, which can assist students in understanding
complex and abstract concepts in engineering. To understand whether the proposed
approach can improve student learning and retention of course materials covered,
Primary Trait Analysis, Student Assessment of Learning Gains Surveys, and
individual student interviews are being used to analyze and compare students'
learning outcomes with conventional methods. Changes in Student Mental Model
Representation are being analyzed through a language-oriented methodology for
text and graphical representations of open problems. Pre- and post-experiments
are being used to compare and track changes in students' mental representation.
The measures are also being used to compare control and treatment groups.
Students' perceptual and motivational characteristics are being assessed using a
multi-scale questionnaire instrument previously designed and validated by
project personnel.
