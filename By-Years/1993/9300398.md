This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support for the work of Dr. Gerard F. R. Parkin of the Chemistry
Department, Columbia University, on main group metals. Monomeric complexes
containing poly(pyrazolyl)hydroboratate ligands will be prepared, including
alkyl and hydride derivatives, carbonyl derivatives, subvalent derivatives, and
terminal oxo, sulfido, and imido complexes. Multiple bonding with heavy main
group compounds will receive particular attention. Attempts will be made to
isolate structurally homologous complexes so that comparisons can be made
between the reactions of particular metals. Alkyl derivatives of members of
Group 2 beyond beryllium will be characterized. Synthesis of anionic copper(I)
hydrides will be be attempted, as well as that of new CO complexes of silver and
gold. The reactivity of Zn, Cd, and Hg species will be compared to that of Group
2. %%% Main group metals are used as reagents in organic synthesis and are
important components of ceramic materials, semiconductors, and superconductors.
This work would provide fundamental information about the behavior of these
metals, particularly the heavy members whose chemistry is less well known, and
whose usefulness in materials applications has not been fully exploited.
