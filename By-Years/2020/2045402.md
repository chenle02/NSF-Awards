Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been adopted in a huge number of domains,
helping in making not only predictions but decisions. Many of these applications
do not have training and test data generated via the same process, in large part
because learned models are deployed to make and inform decisions (rather than
just predictions), and the data-generating process involves feedback loops. In
such “high-stakes" processes, predictions or decisions can produce very high-
utility outcomes in some cases and very low-utility outcomes in others. These
large differences in the utility of different outcomes creates additional
concerns not generally present in classical prediction problems. First, large
differences in the utility of outcomes will lead agents subject to these
predictions to try and earn the highest-quality outcomes for themselves; second,
system designers must consider whether their system makes similarly high-utility
predictions for all demographic groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand just
how well ML operates in these environments, this project is studying the
performance of learning systems in the face of strategically generated data, and
the extent to which high-quality predictions can be guaranteed on heterogeneous
data sources, ensuring that the insights from ML will apply to many different
populations rather than just the majority population. Complementing the
technical research of this project are several projects aimed to broaden the
communities entering into computing and machine learning specifically. This
includes the development of drop-in modules for integration into statistics
classrooms, collaboratively with the University of Washington's (UW) K12
Computer Science (CS4Teachers), and a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach with the UW’s Center for Evaluation &amp; Research for STEM
Equity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
