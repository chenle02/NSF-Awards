This Teacher Enhancement project will involve thirty teachers and supervisors in
15 northwestern Louisiana school districts in a program to upgrade both their
mathematics knowledge and their instructional methodologies in the teaching of
mathematics. The program participants will provide 8 inservice sessions for
their colleagues in their schools utilizing materials and strategies developed
during the program. Program staff will provide follow-up activities to assist
the participants in their own classrooms as well as in the inservice sessions.
Future plans include the dissemination of this program to other schools and
school districts using the network established in this program. The program
includes a spring meeting for orientation of participants to the background,
goals and structure of the program. A three week summer workshop will stress
mathematics content in whole and rational number operations, problem solving and
computer applications. Participants will use this knowledge to develop classroom
instructional materials and inservice modules for use in the schools.
Mathematicians, mathematics educators and outstanding teachers will work with
the teachers in the development and evaluation of these materials. Five formal
one day workshops will be held during the following academic year to provide
further assistance in implementation of the goals of the project. In addition,
the Project Director will visit each school site a minimum of three times during
the year. The Project Director is well qualified to conduct this program since
she has been actively involved in the improvement of mathematics education for
some time. An Advisory Council, representing several consti- tuencies, exists to
assist in the planning and implementation of the project and an exemplary staff
has been retained for both the summer workshop and the one day academic year
sessions. An excellent project evaluation plan has been formulated.
