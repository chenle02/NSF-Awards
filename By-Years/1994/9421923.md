ABSTRACT AST-9421923 DePoy, Darren This project supports the use of the Ohio
State Infrared Imager/Spectrometer (OSIRIS) at the Starfire Optical Range (SOR)
1.5 telescope. An internal field derotator will be constructed to allow for long
integrations. The optics will be reconfigured to deliver a 0.10" pixel -1scale.
to the 256x256 detector array. Four scientific projects will be undertaken with
the camera: JHK imaging of HII regions, broad-and narrow-band imaging of the
Orion Nebula, the determination of the stellar luminosity function in M31, and
JH imaging of known T Tauri binary stars. ***
