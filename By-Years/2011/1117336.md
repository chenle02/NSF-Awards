This award is devoted to the studies on the interface of computational and
combinatorial geometry. Specifically, the relevant problems involve geometric
arrangements, which are patterns formed, say, in the plane, when a number of
geometric shapes are overlaid on top of each other. A surprising number of
computational problems can be cast in terms of arrangements. Conversely, a
significant number of combinatorial problems are equivalent to statements about
arrangements. The PI will focus on the interplay of these
two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In slightly more technical detail, the PI
will:&lt;br/&gt;-- push the state of the art in the area of arrangements,
solving some of the challenging open problems in the subject;&lt;br/&gt;--
develop general techniques which will be of independent interest and which will
find applications well beyond the set of problems listed in the
proposal;&lt;br/&gt;-- by looking at classical problems in a radically different
way, find simple solutions and reveal connections between seemingly unrelated
questions;&lt;br/&gt;-- apply the machinery developed for dealing with
arrangements of geometric objects to an entirely new set of
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will supervise a PhD student and a
postdoctoral fellow, guiding them in their research activities and acquainting
them with the latest tools of combinatorial and computational geometry. The
results obtained will be disseminated by participation in workshops and
scientific conferences. Graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced
to a number of current research problems in the subject.
