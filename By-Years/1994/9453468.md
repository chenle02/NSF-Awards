Abstract Winoto My research goal is to understand the molecular and cellular
machinery of how and why cells die. We are using biochemical, genetic, molecular
biological and immunological techniques to study the differences of the
molecular processes between life and death of a cell during development. My
teaching plan is to establish a vigorous interdisciplinary Molecular Biology and
Immunology program at the undergraduate and graduate levels. ***
