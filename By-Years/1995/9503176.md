9503176 Mohan Utility-interactive photovoltaic, wind-electric and fuel- cell
systems are being planned at sufficiently large power levels. The technical and
economic feasibility of such systems partially depends on the reliability,
safety, cost, and the efficiency of their grid interface. A novel interface,
which takes advantage of the system conditions in a utility-scale application is
proposed. Several research tasks are proposed to demonstrate and verify its
performance by means of a 7.5 kW laboratory hardware prototype. The success of
the proposed interface can be a significant step towards the feasibility of
utility-interactive PV, wind-electric and fuel-cell systems. Because the
proposed topology is completely novel, new discoveries are entirely possible
which will also be beneficial to systems other than the proposed utility
interface. ***
