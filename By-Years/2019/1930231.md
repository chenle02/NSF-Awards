This grant provides travel support for up to 15 graduate students from US
institutions to participate and present their work at the 27th European Signal
Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2019). The conference will serve as a valuable
occasion for US graduate students to connect with worldwide leaders in signal
processing research. Outreach to underrepresented groups is integrated through
contacts with the National Society of Black Engineers, the Computing Alliance
for Hispanic Serving Institutions, the Institute for Mentorship for African
Americans in Computer Science, and the Computing Research Association Committee
on the Status of Women in Computing Research. The workshop has also planned
activities directly aimed at student participants, including a Best Student
Paper competition and award, and a "three-minute thesis" in which students have
three minutes to present a compelling oration on their thesis and its
significance, so as to hone their communication skills to broader audiences.

EUSIPCO 2019 is the upcoming edition of this well-established and recognized
conference in the broad field of signal processing that takes place yearly and
gathers worldwide experts. The 2019 edition will have a highly international
profile, featuring plenary sessions delivered by renowned scientists on key
topics of research and development, and oral and poster parallel scientific
sessions, where participants can present their most recent results on the
different topics of the conference

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
