HRD-9350587 Cross, Dolores Chicago State University The Chicago Alliance for
Minority Participation (CHAMP) is a consortium of six Chicago area universities
supported by a network of local businesses, national laboratories, and local
school districts. The six universities are: Chicago State University, DePaul
University, the Illinois Institute of Technology, Loyola University,
Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. These
institutions enroll over 2,000 minorities a year in science, engineering, and
mathematics (SEM) fields. The mission of the Alliance is to significantly
increase the quantity and quality of minority students receiving SEM
baccalaureate degrees and to increase the pool of minority students entering
graduate school. The Alliance will accomplish this goal by replicating
successful programs at new schools, by allowing students to participate in
bridge programs or research experiences outside their own schools, by using the
consortium to test new programs, and by hosting consortium-wide activities such
as an Alliance Student Research Conference. The Alliance partners believe that
such interactive and cooperative activities will give the consortium a synergy
that would not exist if these programs operated in isolation. The Alliance
proposes two bold objectives: (1) to quadruple the output of SEM baccalaureate
degrees awarded to minorities in Chicago so that a minimum of 1,000 minority
students per year will receive baccalaureate degrees in SEM fields by the year
2000; and (2) to place at least 200 minority students per year in SEM graduate
programs by the year 2000.
