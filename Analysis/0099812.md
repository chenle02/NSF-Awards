The research project is focused on the analytical aspects of the theory of
integrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert and isomonodromy methods. The
problems under consideration include the asymptotic analysis of the correlation
functions of exactly solvable quantum field and statistical mechanics models,
the investigation of the double scaling limits in the theory of orthogonal
polynomials, the analysis of the integrable systems describing the distribution
functions of random matrix theory and random permutations, and the global
asymptotic analysis of the solutions of integrable differential equations of the
Painleve' and KdV types.

The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area which plays an
increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical
and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical
physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytic tool for the study of
some of the fundamental mathematical models arising in modern nonlinear science
and technology. Specifically, the research directions indicated above deal with
the mathematical models which form the theoretical basis for the following
fields: condensed matter, high energy and plasma physics, nonlinear
hydrodynamics, and high-bit rate telecommunication systems. A special attention
in the project is given to the analysis of the distributions of random matrix
theory which govern statistical properties of the large systems which do not
obey the usual laws of classical probability. This kind of systems appears in
many different areas of applied science and technology including heavy nuclei,
polymer growth, high-dimensional data analysis, and certain percolation
processes.
