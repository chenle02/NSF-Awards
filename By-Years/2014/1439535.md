This I-Corps team has developed a wireless indoor tracking technology, and its
unique properties will enable a plethora of new applications in many different
areas including intelligent home automation, location based security, sports
training, fine-grained indoor navigation, robotics, digital arts, education,
entertainment systems, and body motion tracking for biomedical applications and
film making.

The existing local wireless tracking techniques are computing and resource
intensive, provide a limited tracking speed, and require a line-of-sight (LOS)
channel for achieving a reasonable spatial resolution. The wireless tracking
technique proposed is unique because of its non-line-of-sight (NLOS) capability,
low power requirement, and excellent spatial and temporal resolutions make it an
excellent candidate for an intuitive 3D man-machine interface in different
applications including home automation, security, robotics and entertainment
systems. Mobile smart devices penetrated the market largely because of their
intuitive and easy-to-use 2D touch-screen interface; however, the industry is
badly looking for an intuitive 3D user interface solution for maximizing user
experience and market expansion. The proposed technology will provide a solution
for a truly natural, intuitive, and immersive 3D user interface.
