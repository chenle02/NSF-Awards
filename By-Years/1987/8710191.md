This Ph.D dissertation project studies the extent to which scientist's judgments
of evidence relevance and quality are affected by the strength and direction of
their prior beliefs and by the degree of their public commitment to a
theoretical position. The research will determine the extent to which scientific
judgments of evidence quality deviate from the judgments of neutral observers as
a function of the extent to which the evidence meets the expectation of the
judge, the strength with which the expectations are held, and the extent to
which the judge is publicly committed to the belief. An important area of
research on judgment and decision making involves ambiguity and uncertainty of
information and how individuals seek, construct and evaluate evidence with which
to reduce uncertainty and how they incorporate uncertainty into their decisions.
Within this context one of the more pressing topics involves the way individuals
perform these tasks unaided and whether performance can be improved through
training, decision aids or other means.
