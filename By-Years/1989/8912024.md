This study examines the effects of child care as a possible constraint on
women's subsequent employment. As women's participation in the labor force has
increased, there has been growing concern about the impacts of the quality,
reliability and cost of child care on women's employment. Using panel data on a
nationally representative sample (the Survey of Income and Program
Participation) and logistic regression analysis, this research will explore the
effects of women's child care arrangements and expenses on the likelihood of
women leaving the labor force or moving from full to part time work. For women
not in the labor force, the investigator will examine the influence of expected
child care expenses, in relation to expected earnings, on the likelihood of
homemakers subsequently entering employment. This study will make an important
contribution to our knowledge of how working families balance work and family
obligations, by documenting the effects of child care costs and arrangements on
women's abilities to maintain an attachment to the labor force.
