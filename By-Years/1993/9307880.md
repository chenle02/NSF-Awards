9307880 Pessiki The objectives of the project are: (l) to develop analytical
models for the hysteretic behavior of precast frames; (2) to develop analytical
models for the hysteretic behavior of precast walls; (3) to perform system
response evaluation studies of precast structures for different seismic zones
with different site characteristics; (4) to develop preliminary design
recommendations for precast seismic structural systems. To achieve these
objectives, the proposed project will design and analyze a set of prototype
structures for ground motions representatives of various seismic zones and site
characteristics in the U.S. The prototype buildings will be frame and frame wall
structures that utilize ductile connection construction. The project will assess
the seismic response of the prototype structures and based on this study
preliminary design recommendations will be made. ***
