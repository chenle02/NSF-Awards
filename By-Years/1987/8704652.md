The nucleation and growth of ternary phases from modulated multilayer thin film
composites will be explored. The first priority will be to synthesize ternary
tungsten and ternary niobium chalcogenide composites, then explore the low
temperature reactions of these composites and generate low temperature phase
diagrams. These composites will be synthesized by evaporation of the elements in
an ultrahigh vacuum environment. The metastable, highly reactive and intimately
mixed starting structure ensures short diffusion pathlengths and significant
reactivity at low temperatures. After transfer to an inert atmosphere, the
evolution of these composites will be studied as a function of temperature and
time via differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy and microprobe analysis. The effects of layer thickness,
registry, and deposition temperature upon the nucleation of compounds and the
evolution of the composites will be explored. The goal is to identify methods of
controlling the reaction of composites through initial deposition conditions
and/or reaction parameters. The synthesis of new ternary compounds at low
temperatures and the synthesis of new metastable materials will be the end
products.
