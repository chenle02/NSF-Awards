ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freedman, Richard&lt;br/&gt;"NStars: Understanding
the L-dwarfs and T-dwarfs"&lt;br/&gt;AST-0086234&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Freedman is producing a model spectral catalog for L-dwarf and T-dwarf stars.
Also known as 'brown dwarf stars,' such objects are below the hydrogen-burning
limit for normal stars. To facilitate the discovery of and subsequent follow-up
research on brown dwarfs Dr. Freedman and colleagues are computing a library of
high-resolution spectra covering the wavelength regime of 0.5-1000 micrometers
appropriate for objects with effective temperatures ranging from 500-2200 K and
metallicities ranging from -2 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.5. The opacity of alkali metals
and the influence of dusty condensates are included in the calculations. The
resulting model spectra are compared to observed spectra of L- and T-dwarfs over
the full range of L- and T-dwarfs. The results are distributed to the scientific
community via the web.&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project was provided by the
NSF Stellar Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (AST/SAA) program through the joint
NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars (NStars)" initiative, and the NSF Mathematical &amp;
Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(MPS/OMA).&lt;br/&gt;
