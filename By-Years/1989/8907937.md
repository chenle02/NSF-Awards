A broad range of problems is studied in theoretical and astrophysical
relativity. The research in theoretical relativity is centered on quantum theory
of dynamical systems with constraints, its ultimate goal being the clarification
of the status of quantum geometrodynamics. The goal of the research in
relativistic astrophysics is the application of theoretical models to
astrophysical and observational issues. Three classes of projects will be
investigated: 1) An improved understanding of gravitational wave generation in
the late stages of gravitational collapse; 2) A Study of gravitational
interactions distorting a black hole horizon; 3) Analysis of astrophysical
sources of ultra high-energy cosmic rays, especially source models involving
strong gravitational fields.
