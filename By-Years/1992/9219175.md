This research will measure and quantify the hydraulics of flow in soil
macropores and the interactions between macropores and the surrounding porous
media. A non-destructive gamma ray tomography unit will be used to obtain water
content distributions in laboratory columns to a resolution of 5 mm during flow
events and 2 mm after redistribution. A variety of pore types will be tested
which will differ in size and method of formation. These direct measurements of
the temporal and spatially varying soil water content will allow the calculation
of flow hydraulics. Those results will in turn, be compared to existing
deterministic theories of macropore flow. Specific assumptions which will be
evaluated are; 1) poiseuille flow within the macropore, 2) hydraulic equilibrium
between the pore and the surrounding porous media, 3) the suitability of
modeling the radial sorption of water from the pore as normal horizontal
sorption, and 4) the effects of surface seals on the entrance of water into the
pore.
