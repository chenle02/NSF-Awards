This project is concerned with the advancing the fundamental knowledge of life-
cycle reliability analysis (LCA) and design optimization with a particular
emphasis on engineering microsystems. The goal is to create a rigorous
computational framework for studying appropriate formulations of LCA. This
framework is a synthesis of (a) reliability analysis and optimization
algorithms, (b) life-cycle cost models accounting for the time-variant non-
deterministic system response, (c) high-fidelity numerical simulation and
sensitivity analysis, and (d) coupled reduced order models. The framework will
be embedded into a design methodology that allows the maximization of the life-
cycle benefits of microsystems while accounting for uncertainties and
reliability constraints. Cost models will be developed that integrate
manufacturing and system design requirements into the formulation of the device
level optimization problem through cost-tolerance and cost-reliability
relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this work will advance the
fundamental discovery and understanding of the life-cycle design of non-
deterministic microsystems, in particular of systems whose complexity results
from the interaction of multiple phenomena. This research will increase the
awareness of the importance of accounting for uncertainties in engineering
design and will provide a formal, mathematical approach for incorporating
probabilistic life-cycle design concepts. The research activities will be
integrated into undergraduate and graduate level courses. An Internet-based
version of the computational framework will be developed, which will allow
students to discover the importance of uncertainties and the concept of life-
cycle reliability in the design process of microsystems.&lt;br/&gt;
