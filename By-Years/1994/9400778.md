9400778 Finn This award supports mathematical research on capillarity theory and
geometrical questions for liquid bridges, for (asymmetric) pendent liquid drops
and for slowly rotating fluid masses. Exotic behavior for surfaces of curvature
type in wedges and proboscis domains and a-priori curvature estimates for
H-graphs will also be studied. Some of these investigations are to be conducted
in connection with space experiments, in cooperation with NASA and with the
European Space Agency. Others relate to the joint Stanford-Lockheed Gravity-B
experiment to use orbiting gyroscopes in a test of the general relativity theory
and a Stanford experiment of the equivalence principle between gravitational and
inertial mass. These studies will include reference calculations, but the
underlying substance of the work will be mathematical. The formal theory is
being developed from a completely rigorous point of view involving analysis of
solutions of partial differential equations from a geometric perspective. The
resulting experiments can be regarded as precise tests of the underlying
physical hypotheses on which the mathematical formalism is based. The physical
problems continue, in turn, to suggest new mathematical questions. ***
