The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptide and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The acquisition of
X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists
to carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at Case Western
Reserve University will purchase a new Single Crystal X-ray Structure
Determination System with support from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation
Program. The new instrumentation will be used to enhance research in areas of
chemistry that involve the following types of materials: 1) conducting inorganic
complexes and their precursors 2) transition metal silicon compounds 3)
binuclear transition metal chelate complexes 4) natural products, their
derivatives, and precursors used in their total synthesis
