A feature of this project is a three-phased introduction to the use of scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) as part of the biology curriculum. The educational
goal of this program is conceptual orientation to the microscopic world. Majors
and non-majors in introductory courses in biology and earth science first
observe demonstrations then participate in instructor-led small group projects
leading to hands on operation using automatic modes of the SEM. They study
experimental laboratory materials which they have prepared for SEM. Emphasis at
this stage is on preparation of materials and presentation of results in the
form of photographs, slides, or videotapes. At an intermediate level more
detailed instruction in the theory and technique of SEM is taught initially as
part of the Biological Techniques, Microbiology, Plant Biology II and
Parasitology courses. The use of SEM at the undergraduate level extends
students' abilities to conduct undergraduate research projects.
