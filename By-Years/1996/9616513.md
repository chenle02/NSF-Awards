9616513 Narayanan, Hari N. Auburn University Rethinking Algorithmic Animations:
A Novel Approach to Designing Program Visualizations for Learning. There is
general belief that visualizations significantly aid comprehension, and that
animations are effective in conveying dynamic information. In the domain of
software, this belief is reflected in the popular use of animations to help
students learn algorithms. Recent research, though, may point to the fact that
algorithmic animations are not as effective as assumed. This project will apply
results from research on how humans and computers reason with diagrams of
mechanical devices to the design of visualization and animations of algorithms
and explore basic questions to frame a longer term research project.
