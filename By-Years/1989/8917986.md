Recent thinking about ocean scavenging models has led to different
interpretations of essentially the same data set. On the one hand correlations
between the Th removal rate constant and new productivity suggest that
biological processes are responsible for removal of metals from solution. On the
other hand many anomalous variations in scavenging variables can be explained by
a Brownian-pumping model that suggests that adsorption by colloids and their
subsequent coagulation is the main process. Field studies will be conducted to
learn more about these two very different mechanistic pathways and distinguish
between them. Work will be coordinated with Dr. Chih-An Huh (OSU) to obtain
Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry analyses of Th-230 and Th-232. New techniques
will enable us to use smaller samples for Th analyses. The use of hollow- fiber
cross-flow filtration techniques will determine how much dissolved Th is present
as a colloidal phase. Recycling rate of Th-234 relative to C, N, Pb-210, Po-210,
total suspended matter and colloid distributions will be studied in the Monterey
Bay/California Current region.
