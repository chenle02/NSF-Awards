The domain inadequacy of current solid modellers can be alleviated by
incorporating the natural quartics - a useful subset of degree four algebraic
surfaces. Such a class of quartics exist in the Dupin cyclides. They can be
rationally parameterized and their offsets are trivial to compute. Furthermore,
they are a superset of the natural quadrics and the torus. The objectives of
this research are: (i) to extend the geometric coverage of solid modellers by
incorporating the natural quartics; (ii) to enable the application of such solid
modellers in automated inspection systems of manufacturing cells employing
coordinate measuring machines.
