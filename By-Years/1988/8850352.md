Biotechnology in Secondary Education is a three-year project which offers
intensive two-week courses to high school biology teachers each summer. Each
year a new group of 80 teachers will take a Bioethics course and either
Biotechnology, Immunology, Human Genetics, or Infectious Diseases. A
Biotechnology Instruction Resource Network, designed to provide longitudinal
contact with Institute participants will be established and run by Master
Teachers who have been participants. An equivalent of 35 percent of the NSF
award is being contributed by the University of Rochester School of Medicine as
cost sharing.
