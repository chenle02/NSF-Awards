This big data project develops tools and algorithms to support users in the task
of choosing one (or a few) object(s) from a very large set, particularly when
there is a great deal of complex data on which to base this
choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider a traveler looking at hotel options on a
travel site, a scientist trying to identify proteins to investigate further
based upon the results of a high throughput experiment, or an intelligence
analyst trying to identify suspected terrorists. In all of these cases we have a
big data challenge in that there are likely to be hundreds, perhaps thousands or
even millions, of options to choose from. While there are some criteria that can
be expressed as simple functions of attribute values, e.g. price for a hotel
room, these criteria capture only a part of the objective function. Other
considerations, such as stylishness of a hotel, can be much harder to determine
as a function of known attributes. The user may be compelled to examine
candidate options individually. The computer's task is to help minimize the
number of candidates examined, and to optimize the order of examination. This
project examines how best to accomplish this
task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Techniques explored include supporting human
specification of information need against a variety of big data sources and
machine presentation of relevant results with the volume of big data. The
broader impact of this project is in effectively harnessing the power of big
data in a variety of applications, including business, science, and national
defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
