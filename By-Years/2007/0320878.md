With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University will acquire a 400
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
research on a) quinone-dependent copper-containing amine oxidases: mechanism and
inhibition; b) asymmetric synthesis with heteroalkyl radicals; c) alpha-helical
peptide nucleic acids; d) organiron complexes in organic synthesis; e) the
integration of inorganic units into conjugated organic polymers to modify
properties of organic light emitting diodes; and f) the synthesis of complex
oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, and the development of carbohydrate-based
cancer vaccines.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry
and materials science.
