This award provides support for a three-year REU Site at Rowan University. Eight
students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for an eight-week summer
experience in research related to pollution prevention and sustainability. Both
of these research areas are intimately related to gaining a better understanding
of the natural environment. A well-qualified, multidisciplinary team of faculty
will serve as mentors to the REU student participants. REU activities will
include not only research but also field trips; seminars; social activities to
build a sense of community amongst the student participants and research
mentors; and technical writing instruction. The program will serve to encourage
undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the
nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents
engaged in research-related careers. It is also anticipated that this REU Site
will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to have broader participation in
the research enterprise of citizens and permanent residents from demographic
groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.
