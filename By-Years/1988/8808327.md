A two-week institute in parallel computing was held in summer 1988. The
objective was to give approximately 25 graduate and post-doctoral researchers a
fundamental understanding of parallel computing. It comprised a series of
lectures on topics including parallel architectures for scientific computation,
software tools to aid in implementing parallel algorithms, use of graphics
representations in the construction of parallel programs, and vectorization.
Participants experimented with test problems and with a specific application
that they brought with them to the institute. Time was provided on the four
multiprocessors in Argonne's Advanced Computing Research Facility. Some class
time was spent reviewing UNIX and discussing the communications facilities
available for local and remote access to these machines. The institute provided
an opportunity for university researchers to acquire knowledge and experience in
the area of parallel computing.
