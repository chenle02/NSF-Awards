The goal of this research is to design, develop, and demonstrate a
microfabricated electrostatic motor. The work will apply technologies of
microelectronics to the fabrication of mechanical devices, especially an
electric motor with a radius of 300 microns capable of 2.4 million RPM. This
research will build on the emerging technology of microsensors and could open a
new area of microactuators.
