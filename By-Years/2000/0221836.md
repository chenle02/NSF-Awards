0221836 Aitken A stable isotope method will be used to prepare heavy DNA from
incubations of mixed cultures and specific C-13 labelled PAH substrates in
completely closed slurry aerobic bioreactors. The bioreactor is fitted with a
gas chromatograph which allows on- line respirometric measurements. DNA and rRNA
will be extracted from the slurry, amplified by PCR, and analyzed on agarose
gels. Comparisons between the DGGE profiles obtainedfrom rDNA (PCR), rRNA (RT-
PCR) and C-13 labelled rDNA and rRNA will provide insight into the metabolically
active members of the community. Selected DGGE bands will be sequenced and
submitted for phylogenetic analysis using PHYLIP software.
