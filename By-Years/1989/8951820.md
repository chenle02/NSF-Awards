This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at Louisiana State
University at Baton Rouge to purchase equipment that will help upgrade the core
biochemistry lab course. This undergraduate Experimental Biochemistry course
will focus on enzymology and molecular biology using a cloned full-length cDNA
of Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to provide experimental
materials. ADH will be purified from E. coli carrying the ADHcDNA cloned in an
expression vector. The purified enzyme will be analyzed to determine the Km
values for primary and secondary alcohols and the Ki values for competitive and
non- competitive inhibitors. Purified ADH will be reversibly inactivated and
reactivated through thio-disulfide interconversion. Effects of Nonsense,
Missense and Deletion mutations will be examined by comparing ADH activity and
antigenic response in the lysates of E. coli carrying the mutated ADHcDNAs. The
ADH insert in M13 phage will be used to teach restriction mapping and DNA
sequencing techniques. The principles of nucleic acid chemistry will be
illustrated by determining the sequences of di- and tri- ribonucleotides with
ribonuclease digestions, chromatography and UV spectra of the products under
acidic, neutral and basic conditions. Denaturation of doubly-stranded DNA will
be examined. Computer analysis and application are emphasized in appropriate
experiments. The grantee is matching with award with non-Federal sources.
