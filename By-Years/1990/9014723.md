The 1990 International Workshop on Defect and Fault-Tolerance in VLSI Systems is
the 4th in a series of meetings which started with the workshop in "Designing
for Yield" held in Oxford in 1987. The workshop is held outside the U.S. every
third year. The 1990 meeting is being held in Grenoble, France. It is co-
sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committees on Fault-Tolerant Computing and on
VLSI and by the IFIP Working Group 10.5. The meeting is an important forum for
the dissemination of experimental data and analytical techniques for
defect/fault control and tolerance for the manufacture and design of VLSI/WSI
systems.
