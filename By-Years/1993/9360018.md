9360018 Zamansky This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation
Research Solicitation. It is a novel approach to the control of nitrogen oxides
from combustion flue gases based upon the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) to
nitrogen dioxide, and removal of the latter in slightly modified calcium-based
sulfur-dioxide scrubbers. Nitric oxide is converted to nitrogen dioxide by
reaction with sulfur dioxide and oxygen in the gas phase; the reactants are
already present in the off-gases from sulfur-containing coal. This effort
provides a laboratory-scale feasibility study of the process at reaction times
and temperatures suitable to application in the flues of boilers and furnaces.
Removal of the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen from combustion flues is essential
to improvement of air quality and reduction of acid rain. This effort offers the
prospect of controlling both sets of oxides at once, with a technology that
might be a suitable retrofit to existing sulfur-control systems.
