Abstract ATM-9305750 Brenner, Mark Title: Paleoclimate of Southwest China:
Development of the Asian Monsoon This award suports a study of sediment cores
from four Yunnan lakes which will be used to reconstruct the paleoclimate of
southwest China from late Pleistocene to present . Long, 14C-dated sections
(>10kyr BP) have been obtained. Contrary to "predictions" from general
circulation models, pollen, diatom and geochemical data indicate a shift from
wet late Pleistocene to drier early Holocene conditions. The sediment record
also suggests lake-level shifts during the Holocene. Chronologic resolution of
paleoclimatic records will be enhanced by close-interval sampling and AMS
dating. Stable isotope and trace metal ratios in sedimented ostracod shells will
be used to test previous paleoclimatic inferences and establish whether late-
Pleistocene, high lake levels were a consequences of glacial meltwater input.
Paleoenvironmental reconstruction will also be based on stable isotope signals
in carbonates and organic matter. Proxy paleoclimatic data from southwest China
will shed light on the development of the Asian monsoon system and can be used
to test moisture simulations from general circulation models.
