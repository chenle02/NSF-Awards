The project will begin the development and demonstration of a new method to
produce quantitative bounds on the risk that can be attributed to a set of
environmental agents in circumstances in which conventional agent-by-agent
"front-to-back" risk analysis produces results with extremely wide uncertainty
bounds. The method will begin by summarizing available toxicological and
epidemiological evidence on the end-point(s) in a form that facilitates easy
comparisons. A constrained sum expert elicitation procedure will be developed
which uses these data, together with expert judgment, to probabilistically
attribute known and suspected causes of the health end-point to the observed
cases. The result of this work should be a &lt;br/&gt;new set of methods which
can be used by the risk analysis community in conjunction with more traditional
risk analytic methods to bound the magnitude of possible health impacts from
some types of environmental risks. &lt;br/&gt;
