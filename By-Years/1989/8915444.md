The great sensitivity of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) detectors makes it possible
to acquire large numbers of images at the telescope, and if care is taken, the
quality of the photometry far exceeds what can be done photographically. On the
other hand, the development of high-speed digitizing equipment has also
dramatically increased the quantity, if not the quality, of digital data which
can be generated from photographic plates. For many types of work, CCD's have
become the detector of choice, but there are still projects for which
photography is well-suited. This dramatic change in the scale and precision of
stellar photometry has opened up new avenues for astronomical research: detailed
comparisons of cluster color-magnitude diagrams with stellar evolution theory,
determination of luminosity functions, and truly large-scale surveys e.g., for
problems in galactic structure, searches for variable stars, and new analyses of
archival plates. At Boston University, much of the needed software exists for
doing digital stellar photometry, but the combination of general growth of the
Astronomy Department and new projects in stellar photometry is about to
overwhelm the existing computing facilities. This award will help complete the
development of an integrated system for CCD photometric reductions and digital
photographic photometry.
