The research involves problems in lattice theory and algebraic combinatorics,
including the conjectures that finite- rank Arguesian lattices with distributive
skeleton are representable, that homomorphic images of representable lattices
are representable, and that the dual of a representable lattice need not be
representable. Other work in lattice theory will involve the investigation of
new continuous analogues of finite partition lattices. The problems in algebraic
combinatorics are to prove a conjectured bijection between shifted standard
Young tableau of a certain shape and maximal-length words in the Coxeter group
of type B(n), and to study the applications of a new combinatorial formulation
of multivariate Lagrange inversion. Lattices appear throughout mathematics,
making lattice theory an important topic of study, not only for its own
intrinsic interest, but for its applications in mathematics and related
disciplines.
