As computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many branches of
science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of the expensive
prototyping and testing phases in manufacturing and in science explorations,
fast and robust numerical methods are becoming an indispensable tool for many
scientists and engineers. The focus of this project is to design fast and robust
spectral-Galerkin methods for solving a large class of partial differential
equations, and apply them to investigate several important problems of current
interest. The proposed research will result in fast and accurate numerical
algorithms for a class of partial differential equations with applications in
acoustic and electromagnetic scattering, fluid dynamics and materials science.

It is expected that the proposed numerical algorithms will allow simulations of
three-dimensional time-dependent problems within a reasonable turn-over time,
and provide capabilities to numerically attack challenging problems arising from
emerging engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the proposed
numerical simulations will contribute towards better understandings of the
complex physical and mathematical problems, and provide valuable information for
the design of advanced materials and on the rheological and hydrodynamic
properties of complex fluids. The proposed research will also generate
opportunities for undergraduate research projects such as software development,
parallel computation and numerical simulation.
