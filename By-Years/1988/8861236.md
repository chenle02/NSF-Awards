The objectives of this research are as follows. (1) To explore "image
compression technologies" to determine the capability of "StyleBits, StyleBytes
and StylePieces" as the means to reduce a complex garment pattern to a
manageable index that can be sorted for databases and be manipulated in an
electronic interactive encyclopedia of apparel information and for Electronic
Data Interchange. (2) To determine the feasibility of "StyleBits, StyleBytes &
StylePieces" as a foundation or base for codification and a language that could
manipulate most style information in the fashion industry. (3) To examine CD ROM
and Hypercard, as the technologies with enough memory and multimedia
capabilities, for being the computer tools to build an interactive encyclopedia
of codified style and fabric information. (4) To study the broad needs of the
whole fashion industry for a language that would enable them to communicate
faster and better with each other. Groups will be utilized that contain every
possible future user of an encyclopedia index of fabric and style information
... such as, consumers who wear clothing and consumers who sew clothing;
retailers, buyers and editors who evaluate clothing; designers, pattern
technicians and production managers who create and produce clothing; consumer
consultants, public and private educators and both vocational-high school and
college level students who train and learn in fashion retailing, manufacturing
or related three-dimensional product industries. (5) To compare the visual and
tactile cognition of fabrics and styles to the most recent discoveries in
cognitive psychology, in electronic pattern recognition and in developments of
Expert Systems that could support interactive decision making with this visual
and tactile information.
