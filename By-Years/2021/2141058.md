The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in significant improvement of
artificial intelligence (AI) systems by acceleration of the model creation,
training, and operation using modern quantum computers. The project's outcomes
can stimulate advances in chemistry, create new materials and new drugs, improve
manufacturing and retail, reduce risks in high-tech, exploration and mission
planning, and improve decision-making in arenas such as the public sector,
banking, and healthcare. The project will nurture a new generation of
entrepreneurs and scientists who can move easily between disciplines as varied
as engineering, physics, computer science, and high-performance
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop an AI-
building software platform that enables training the models “on the fly” on
fast-evolving and fast-growing datasets. This will significantly improve their
prediction and classification functions, reducing training time on large
datasets by ten-fold. With the quantum-accelerated AI, a significant part of
decision-making tasks can be automated to reduce human errors, thereby reducing
mission failure risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
