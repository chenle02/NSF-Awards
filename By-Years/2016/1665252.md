The award studies the structure of Boolean functions - functions of many inputs
whose output is binary. The main goal of the award is to study the influence of
individual inputs on the output, as well as the stability of the output to
random perturbations applied to the vector of inputs. The study of influences
and stability will be used to obtain new algorithms for learning from data and
for analyzing markov-chain sampling procedures using generalizations of the
Fourier expansion. It will be further used in conjunction with tools from the
theory of hardness of approximation to show that for some combinatorial
optimization problems it is computationally hard to find (even) an approximately
optimal solution. A main theme of the award is to obtain new results on the
geometry of the Gaussian measure as a key step for analyzing stability of
Boolean functions. This follows the general philosophy of invariance principles
which argue that in certain situations functions of bits and functions of
Gaussian variables, which are easier to analyze, behave similarly. The award
will support the educational efforts and mentoring of new graduate students by
introducing to them new connections between pure mathematics, theoretical
computer science and their applications.

A key feature of modern computation is its binary nature. The award will
investigate binary and other computational models motivated by the following
questions: How robust are these computational models? How well can they classify
data? How well can they be used to solve large optimization problems? The
approach is based in parts on deep tools from mathematical analysis including
the study of geometric problems in high dimensions.
