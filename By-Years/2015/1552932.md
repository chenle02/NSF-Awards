This project focuses on the development of new tools for designing and proving
the security of advancing cryptographic systems. The need for fine-grained
access control to sensitive data has never been greater, and new paradigms like
functional encryption have the potential to deliver cryptographic systems that
can be tailored to a variety of data uses and privacy needs. However, as systems
have grown more complex, they have naturally grown more difficult to reason
about. By building new frameworks for security reductions and enhancing the
mathematical foundations available to instantiate these frameworks, this project
makes fast progress towards a flexible and more unified theory of cryptography
that can meet these mounting challenges. In particular, the project integrates
recent results in lattice cryptography with new advances in designing security
reductions in order to provide strong arguments for the security of highly
flexible and customizable cryptographic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project results are incorporated into the curriculum of advanced graduate
classes to provide a more integrated view of cryptographic system design
principles. Student researchers at the undergraduate and graduate levels are
heavily involved and gaining valuable research experience. Outreach activities
to younger student populations are also included, namely the production of a
book that introduces middle-grade students to mathematical reasoning through a
fairy-tale setting. In the long term, this project provides new tools for
analyzing and designing flexible cryptographic systems, while also serving as an
entry point and training ground for emerging young scientists.
