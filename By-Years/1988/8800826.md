This research continues the investigators inquiries into the role of computers
and information in productivity growth. The studies include work on the sources
of postwar growth of information activity, on computer-based
technology,occupational mix and productivity growth, and information flows,
trade and productivity convergence among nations.The work relies on extensive
data bases collected, in part, by the investigators' past work, and in part from
collections at the U.S. Government Bureau of Economic Analysis and other extant
data sets. The research on sources of growth asks to what extent the relative
rise in employment in information services represents a redeployment of the
labor force away from manufacturing where productivity increases have reduced
the demand for labor. The study on occupational mix explores whether computer
technology has resulted in an increased level of education and technical
expertise in the labor force or has been de-skilling. The study on trade
explores the role of information transmission and technology diffusion on
economic development of nations.
