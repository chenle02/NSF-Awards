Biological Sciences (61). This project is creating a series of low-cost,
quantitative laboratory experiments that teach students how to perform
investigations using state-of-the-art fluorescent microarray technology; a
technology previously not available to large-scale biology courses. The
microarrays allow students to conduct inquiry-based investigations exploring
plant biodiversity, systematics and evolution. As part of the evaluation
process, undergraduate research students are conducting the experiments to
ascertain the robustness of all procedures, instructional materials and
equipment to ensure wide-scale educational adaptation of this technology. The
microarrays and instruction materials are being made available to the larger
biology community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by funds
from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.
