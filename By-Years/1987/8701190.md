This research effort is designed to go hand in hand with the theoretical work
being carried out under NSF GRANT DMS-8602337, entitled "Theory and Applications
of Multivariate Splines". The aim of this research is twofold. We propose 1) to
translate the theoretical results obtained under the earlier grant into
practical computational algorithms. In particular, software will be developed
for triangulation and tesselation, for storing and evaluating piecewise
polynomial surfaces efficiently, for contouring, for surface-surface
intersection, for interpolation (with and without shape control), for quasi-
interpolation, for fitting surfaces on surfaces, for computer-aided design
schemes, for least squares fitting of scatted data, for evaluation of simplex
splines and for solving boundary-value problems. Secondly, we propose 2) to
develop computational tools which can be used to support our theoretical work on
the dimension, the construction of locally supported bases, and the poisedness
of interpolation problems for multivariate splines.
