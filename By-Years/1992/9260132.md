High quality, epitaxial TlBaCaCuO films on MgO and sapphire substrates will be
prepared. However, some problems exist for such epitaxial growth and it is
proposed to overcome these difficulties by buffering the substrate using an
inert epitaxial layer, which has a close lattice match to the TBCCO structure.
Growth of epitaxial Tl-based films via an established post deposition annealing
process on top of thin, high quality CeO2 buffer layers will be undertaken. If
successful, this process could replace much of the material currently grown on
LaAlO3 for microwave components at high frequencies where frequency settability
is a key issue.
