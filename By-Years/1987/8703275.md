Lisa Koch will carry out research in Cauchy Riemann geometry using techniques
of pseudo-Riemannian geometry. She will study the behavior of chains on some
specific non-flat CR manifolds. Her research will also involve investigations of
a more general correspondence between pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and CR
manifolds. In this context she will study the effect of such a correspondence on
generalized chain-like curves. The study of chains will use a construction of
Fefferman which connects them to light rays on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. One
of the main examples to be studied is the important spiraling chain due to
Fefferman. She will also study the effect Sparling's restriction on conformal
curvature has on the behavior of null geodesics.
