ACM's Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) is funded to provide guidance
and recommendations on the future of computer science in US schools. They will
assemble a panel of US and international curriculum development experts in the
field of computer science. The panel meets during a special session at the 2005
National Educational Computing Conference (June, 2005). In addition to the US
experts, participants from Canada, South Africa, Israel and Mexico are
participating as representatives of countries that have focused efforts to
formalize the computer science curriculum. The goal of the panel is to use the
insights and experiences of the participants to build frameworks and
recommendations to guide current and future development of CS materials in the
US. The panel's dialogue will be transcribed, published and widely disseminated
as a white paper development of curriculum materials.
