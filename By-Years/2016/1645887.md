This grant fulfills a U.S. Government obligation incurred at the Twenty-first
Meeting of the IAI Conference of the Parties, whereby signatories of the Treaty
Establishing the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI)
agreed to contributions towards a research budget supporting the activities of
the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research. This award supports a
series of small projects that will supplement, expand and complete the CRN3
program towards further development of interdisciplinary solution-oriented
science in the Americas. The timeline will allow for coordination with CRN3
activities under a no-cost extension for ongoing CRN projects. Up to 3
international collaborative research networks will be funded for 2 years of
research on the role of ecosystem services in adaptation to global change, a
theme framed to reinforce close collaborations on the human and biophysical
dimensions of global change and sustainability.
