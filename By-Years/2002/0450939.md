This project involves studying critical aspects of the carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen/hydrogen cycles within two developing urban areas: Lagos, Nigeria; and
Mumbai (Bombay), India. A series of gas and aerosol phase carbon, nitrogen, and
oxygen components will be measured during multiple years (2005-2007). Modeling
will be carried out to discern the linkages among developing megacities and the
local, regional, and global environment. The areas to be studied are among the
earth's most populated and rapidly growing areas, and comprise regions where
such measurements are sparse or non-existent.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Virtually
all population growth during the next 30 years will occur in urban areas. More
than ninety percent of this increase will occur in less developed regions of the
world. Increased population, industrialization, and energy use will aggravate
the effect that developing regions have on the earth's ecosystems. Urban areas
are the focal points for the confluence of multiple biogeochemical cycles. The
human influence on these biogeochemical cycles will become increasingly
noticeable worldwide as Asian, African, and South American urbanization
accelerates in the coming decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The information
resulting from this project will be important for defining atmospherically and
climatologically relevant emissions from developing urban regions, estimating
oxidant production, better assessing the potential exposure of the local
population to toxic atmospheric compounds, and providing the basis for comparing
measurements in developing regions with other regions of the world. In addition,
this study will provide data necessary for a more thorough examination of the
potential impacts that these urban areas have on far removed regions, both in
terms of long-range pollutant transport and broad scale effects on the global
oxidizing capacity and climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant component of
this project is education and societal outreach. Close interactions with local
scientists, faculty members, students, and officials in the urban areas studied
will be developed. Local participants will receive training in advanced
techniques used to study environmental issues. A video documentary is planned to
provide information on the study so that interested persons can observe the
study as it progresses. Interactions with local scientists will promote
subsequent collaborations and prepare those scientists for continued study in
their localities.
