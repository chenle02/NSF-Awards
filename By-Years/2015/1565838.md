This award supports travel for US participants in the International Conference
on Evolution Equations held at Vanderbilt University from May 16 to May 20,
2016. Evolution equations are the large class of partial differential equations
used to describe the time development of a wide variety of systems, from
physical systems such as fluid flow and gravitation to models for transportation
and other economic systems. The conference focuses on recent developments in the
analysis of partial differential equations and features presentations by leaders
in the field. The award provides opportunities for early career researchers,
researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without
other sources of travel support to attend and participate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference focuses on recent developments in partial
differential equations connected to evolution problems. Topics include, but are
not limited to, fluid dynamics, free boundary problems, dispersive equations,
parabolic equations, Einstein?s equations, and non-linear wave equations. The
activities include fifty-minute talks by the keynote speakers, parallel focus
sessions with twenty-five-minute presentations, and 10-minute contributed talks.
