With this CAREER award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the
research of Professor Neil K. Garg of the University of California, Los Angeles.
Professor Garg will develop new methodologies for the synthesis of nitrogen-
containing complex molecules. First, methods for synthesizing indolynes, or
aryne derivatives of indoles, will be developed. These efforts will enable
various studies of fundamental indolyne reactivity. Second, Professor Garg will
uncover methods for preparing fused indolines, motifs often encountered in
naturally occurring complex molecules. This latter methodology will be applied
toward the total synthesis of aspidophylline A, an intriguing alkaloid that
possesses a densely functionalized furoindoline core.

Professor Garg will also undertake three educational projects that interweave
research and teaching. The first project involves an outreach program targeting
a local high school that predominantly serves underrepresented groups. The
second educational project involves interactions with the NSF Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, where Professor Garg will serve as
an alumni advisor for the international NSF/REU program. Finally, an extensive
synthetic organic chemistry website will be created that utilizes visual aids to
convey the importance of chemical synthesis and explain various experimental
techniques.
