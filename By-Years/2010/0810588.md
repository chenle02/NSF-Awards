ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;07 April 2008&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0810588
&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Rhode Island&lt;br/&gt;PI: T. Chlaupek
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requested one Shipboard Scientific Support
item for the R/V ENDEAVOR, namely design support to verify the adequacy of
existing support structure and lashing methods for portable scientific lab vans
on the 0-1 deck. Undertaking this study is an important safety item that was
suggested in ENDEAVOR?s last NSF inspection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The R/V ENDEAVOR supports federal and state funded scientific research
on the east coast and exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing
oceanography. ENDEAVOR completed eight NSF sponsored cruise in 2007. &lt;br/&gt;
