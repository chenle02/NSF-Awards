9413384 Woodrow This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
side-scanning sonar system and a seismic reflection profiling system by Hobart
and William Smith Colleges. The two systems generate complementary images of the
subsurface and will be used in the study of sediments and other subsurface
structures in lakes, river and estuary environments. The equipment will be
stored at Hobart and Smith Colleges, and its use and maintenance will be managed
by Hobart and Smith Colleges and Colgate University. The applications of the
geophysical imaging systems will include studies of the Finger Lakes and Great
Lakes in faculty research projects as well as independent student research
projects and use in science training for undergraduate and graduate students.
The equipment will be available for use by faculty and students from a total of
nine upstate New York institutions. ***
