This work will perform a marine geophysical survey of sea floor spreading off
Cape Adare, Antarctica. Magnetic, gravity, swath bathymetry and multi-channel
seismic data will be acquired from the southern end of the Adare Basin to the
northern parts of the Northern Basin and Central Trough in the Ross Embayment.
Previous surveys documented 170 km of regional extension between forty-three and
twenty-six million years ago, which resulted in some seafloor spreading in the
Adare Basin. However, the relationship of Adare Basin spreading to the overall
extension and the southward continental basins of the Ross Embayment has not
been established. This relationship is critical to understanding the tectonic
evolution of East and West Antarctica and linking Pacific plate motions to the
rest of the world. The study will also offer unique insight into rifting
processes by studying the transition of rifting between oceanic and continental
lithosphere. In terms of broader impacts, this project will support two graduate
students and field research experience for undergraduates. The project also
involves cooperation between scientists from the US, Australia, New Zealand and
Japan.
