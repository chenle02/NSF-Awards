Under this award, the PIs propose to continue experimental studies at upper
mantle conditions centered around understanding the mineralogical, petrological,
and geochemical implications of mantle water at low bulk concentration. Specific
goals are to determine the concentration of OH in olivine saturated with water
and the accurate determination of the solidus of slightly hydrous peridotite.
This work will also be extended to pyroxenes, garnet, and low- degree high-
pressure melts, placing each phase on a common calibrated OH concentration
scale. The PIs will test the hypothesis that in undersaturated experiments the
mineral-melt bulk D for water does not follow Henry's law but decreases with
water concentration. The PIs will use a newly developed trace element technique
for studying low-degree melts to study the region below the dry solidus in the
range 2-6 GPa. They will focus first on accurate determinations of the solidus
as a function of water content; second on precise measurement of extents of
melting between the "damp" solidus and the "dry" solidus; and third on
measurements of liquid compositions in equilibrium with peridotite residua at
high pressure, relatively low temperature, and slightly hydrous
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
