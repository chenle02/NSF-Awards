Interdisciplinary (99) Courses for non-science majors and pre- and in-service
science teachers are integrating the sciences and the humanities through the
exploration of a socially and personally relevant issue, the coal industry in
Appalachia. Use of an issue unique to the region that is a part of their
cultural heritage personalizes science for the students. The students are
learning and valuing science as a result of the emotional connection they are
making with it. The project is an adaptation of the learning community concept
in which groups of students are co-enrolled in the interdisciplinary science
course Coal in the Heart of Appalachia and the humanities course, Introduction
to Folklore Studies. The latter course emphasizes the cultural impacts of coal.
A seminar for pre-service, secondary science education majors, Thematic
Integration of Sciences, is improving the students' understanding of the
interconnectedness among the sciences and is enhancing their ability to apply
this knowledge to societal issues. The courses are constructivist-based, promote
civic responsibility and model best practices in science education.
