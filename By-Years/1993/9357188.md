This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of surface chemistry. During
the five-year tenure of this award, Professor Beebe and his students will carry
out a fundamental investigation of the structure and reactivity of molecules
adsorbed on solid surfaces. Ultrahigh vacuum techniques will be used to study
single metal crystals and their reactions with small probe molecules. Scanning
tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy are two additional techniques
that will be used to study molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions
of large molecules, such as DNA. %%% The successful attainment of the goals of
this project should enable broad advancement in the area of surface chemistry,
in general, and the study of molecular interactions on solid surfaces in
particular. These studies will lead to increased understanding of the
fundamental chemistry of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Additionally, this NSF
Young Investigator Award will significantly assist Professor Beebe to establish
a viable, innovative research program at the University of Utah.
