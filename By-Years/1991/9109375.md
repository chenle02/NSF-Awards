Appropriate development and maintenance of the connections and metabolism of
neurons are necessary requisites to all functions of the nervous system,
including the processes of learning and memory and other cognitive abilities.
Knowledge of the substances that regulate these processes in mature neurons and
during development is limited. However, two classes that have been implicated in
the development, survival, and regeneration of neurons in cerebral cortex, the
brain region involved cognitive functions, are the steroid hormone, estradiol,
and the locally-synthesized growth- and survival-promoting protein, nerve growth
factor (NGF). Indeed, Dr. Toran-Allerand has demonstrated that neurons of
cerebral cortex contain receptors for both estrogen and NGF. She will now
investigate in parallel the developmental history of the co-expressed estrogen
and NGF receptor systems in vivo and analyze the cellular and molecular
consequences of estrogen/NGF interactions in vitro. The results of this work
will provide insights into those factors that may be of importance to the
development of brain regions which underlie cognitive functions. Moreover, the
basic information gained from this work may ultimately provide a biological
rationale for clinical investigations into possible therapeutic approaches
involving both estrogen and NGF in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders of
cognition.
