GER-9553465 Levin A new Program in Technologies for Learning will provide an
innovative learning environment for Graduate Research Trainees, who will draw
from five major centers of strength at the University of Illinois: theories of
teaching and learning of science and mathematics; content area studies of
science, mathematics and engineering; technology development; school- based
research; and technology studies. The Trainees, who will be advised by world-
class researchers in these areas, will study and do research within the context
of all five centers of strength, and will serve as mediators for developing both
their own expertise and a broader contribution to the knowledge necessary for
improving science and mathematics education. Trainees will participate in a wide
range of cutting-edge research efforts at the University of Illinois in
technologies for learning, many of which are already supported by NSF.
