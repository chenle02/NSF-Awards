This is a study of ethnic, social and political attitudes among youth in ten
former republics of the Soviet Union. It will survey a probability sample frame
of schools to assess the current attitudes and conditions of youth and to design
future studies of social change and policy impact on this segment of society.
Topics covered will include: strength of group identities, attitudes toward
other nationalities, policy preferences on nationality issues, general political
attitudes, and attitudes toward the commonwealth. Social change and ethnic
relations have long been among the central topics for sociology, and thus this
study will provide a substantial new data base for testing many social-
scientific hypotheses. This research will contribute greatly to our
understanding of the tremendous changes happening in the former Soviet Union,
and it will help scholars and policy makers comprehend the internal conflicts
and international relations occurring among these newly independent states.
