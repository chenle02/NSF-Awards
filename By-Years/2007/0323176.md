Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our purpose is to explore how organizations and
their managers learn from their experience. In particular, we are interested in
how organizations learn dynamic capabilities. Much research on organizational
experience suggests that firms learn as they gain more experience or engage in
similar activities. Strikingly however, most of this research on organizational
experience does not study or measure the process of learning directly, but
instead infers its occurrence based on performance outcomes. Largely unexplored
is an understanding of how this learning occurs (e.g., who learns, what is
learned, by what processes such as improvisation and experimentation does
learning occur). In addition, this research rarely considers how learning occurs
from less frequent, relatively heterogeneous events. In this study, we address
this gap. Given the lack of prior research on how firms and their managers learn
from heterogeneous events, we use an inductive grounded theory-building
approach. Specifically, our research design is an in-depth, nested, comparative
case study of the processes for learning a dynamic capability. The setting is
twelve entrepreneurial firms (4 firms headquartered in each of 3 continents).
The study offers several contributions to the entrepreneurship and international
business literatures. Most significant, it should help to open the "black box"
of learning, and thus fill a significant gap in the organizational learning
literature on understanding how firms actually learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
