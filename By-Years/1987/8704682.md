This project examines the behavior of finished goods inventories both from a
theoretical, as well as from an empirical perspective. The purpose of this
research is to account for the importance of inventory movements in the overall
economy and also in specific sectors of the economy. The research is based on an
inventory model in which the primary source of uncertainty for producers is the
fluctuation in demand for their products. In the model inventories arise because
of the need to produce goods in advance of sales, and because of the need to
hold some positive level of inventories. This research is important because it
will provide a better understanding of inventory and output fluctuations of the
firm. The theoretical part of this project will extend the results of the
inventory model to a general equilibrium setting that would allow for varying
cost structures, intertemporal substitution on the part of consumers, different
source and types of shocks to the economy, and the transmission of shocks across
sectors of the economy. The empirical work involves testing different versions
of the model on inventory, production, and sales data from the U.S. automobile
industry, under the assumption of rational expectations. The work will test the
implications of the motive to avoid running out of inventories including the
basic prediction that beginning inventory stocks are based on efficient
forecasts of demand. The model is also useful for identifying the effects of
interest rates and other factor prices on inventory investment.
