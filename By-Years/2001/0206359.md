AST 0206359&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are direct
and practical reasons for studying the Sun owing to its obvious relationship to
climate and for the effects of solar activity on earth, such as the interruption
of radio communications when we are bathed in particles from solar flares. Solar
magnetism is key to understanding both global and local phenomena in the
atmospheric layers of the Sun. This project will develop new infrared
instrumentation capable of high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of
solar magnetic features from the photosphere to the corona. At the solar surface
they will study the generation and maintenance mechanisms for sunspots and small
scale photospheric magnetic fields. In the atmosphere of the Sun, they will
investigate coronal magnetic fields, filaments, and solar prominences. The
observations will be used to construct magnetic field models for the
photospheric features from which comparisons with theory may be made. In
addition, an education and public outreach program, particularly to be used by
science teachers, will be carried out to raise public awareness of solar
research in Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
