Type Ia supernovae (SN) play an essential role in measuring the accelerating
expansion of the Universe, produce half of the Universeâ€™s heavy metals, and help
astronomers to study cosmology and many aspects of fundamental physics. Although
this type of supernova is known to involve the explosion of a compact white
dwarf star, there is an enormous diversity of variations of Type Ia SNe, and
astrophysicists have developed an even large diversity of explosion scenarios. A
research team at Florida State University (FSU) will incorporate new
observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and ground-based high-
cadence spectropolarimetry programs into new theoretical models that capture the
geometry of Type Ia SNe explosions. For the first time, it is possible to obtain
the full 3-D image of SNe Ia by combining multi-messenger and time-domain
observations from days to years after the explosion Geometry is sensitive to the
companion star and the circumstellar environment, the physics of the ignition
and flame propagation, and models make new and clear new qualitative and
quantitative predictions. Supernovae and cosmology capture the public
imagination and drive forefront science. The FSU planetarium provides an ideal
platform to raise public curiosity about the production of chemical elements in
SNe and their impact on every aspect of human life. A central objective is to
explain how research makes progress through trial and error, models and
experimental tests, etc. The audience are new FSU and middle- and high-school
students, educators, and the public. The presenters will be the principal
investigators, his students and the postdoctoral researcher.

The primary goal of the project is to understand the unique geometrical imprints
of the explosion physics and progenitor systems on the expanding envelope. An
important derivative will be the directional dependence of the brightness, which
is needed for precision cosmology. This study makes full use of time-domain and
multi-messenger astronomy combined with full multi-D non-local-thermal
equilibirum radiation transport, instead of relying on the conventional approach
of spherical averaging. In this way, the information conveyed by the
polarization and asymmetry of line profiles can be exploited. Instead of
indiscriminately covering the vast parameter space populated by medium-quality
data, the project will map the path to a new state of the art of simulations
based on the best available data, namely the few SNe Ia with extent multi-
messenger data plus two specific SNe Ia with ongoing JWST and ground-based high-
cadence spectropolarimetry programs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
