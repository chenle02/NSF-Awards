The PI, Dev Sinha, proposes to investigate a wide range of topics in algebraic
topology. He will make further calculations in the cohomology of symmetric
groups. He will compute equivariant cohomology and K-theory of divided powers
constructions and then extend them to orbifold cohomology and K-theory. He will
develop and compute Hopf ring structures on cohomology, representation theory
and suitable invariants of series of groups. He will unify integrals from Chern-
Simons with the Lie coalgebraic model of homotopy theory to develop complete
rational homotopy invariants of maps. He will generalize the Magnus expansion
and use that to model non-simply connected spaces.

Topology is a fundamental study of shape, and thus has its roots in geometry. As
a subject it has roughly split into point-set topology which considers
foundational questions, geometric topology which studies particular shapes such
as that of our universe, and algebraic topology which ultimately relates shape
to numerical data. It is not typical for researchers to bridge thees
communities. In his previously funded research, the PI applied methods from
algebraic topology to knot theory, which is squarely in the geometric realm. In
this proposal, the PI is using insight from the geometric study of configuration
spaces (collections of particles) to better understand algebraic structures such
as symmetric groups and symmetric functions. He also plans to connect algebraic
topology with Chern-Simons theory from mathematical physics, and to develop a
theory of "linking of letters" to answer basic questions in group theory.
