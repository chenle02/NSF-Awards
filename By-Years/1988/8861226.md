This research will develop a sensor compatible with the hostile environment of
high temperature, pressure and abrasion inside a pultrusion die that will allow
the state of the matrix material to be continuously monitored. This capability
does not currently exist. Data from the sensor could be used by a smart control
system to maintain product quality. The approach will be to combine commercially
available sensor electronics developed by Micromet Instruments for monitoring
composite cure in less hostile environments with a castable ceramic substrate.
The research will lead to the development of methods for transferring the
conductive elements of the sensor to the surface of a mold, establish techniques
for casting a protective ceramic backing, and test prototypes under controlled
conditions.
