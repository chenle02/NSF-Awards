Crustaceans comprise a diverse arrray of arthropods that have come to inhabit
nearly all possible habitats on earth, from mountain soils to the deep sea. Dr.
Lawrence Abele has studied their evolution and ecology using morphological data
from whole organisms and thin sections of tissue, as seen with light and
electron microscopy. More recently, he has learned the most current molecular
techniques for unravelling the evolutionary relationships among different
crustacean groups. Dr. Abele proposes to analyze ribosomal RNA sequences of
representative species from each of the major crustacean groups (including
remipedes, branchiopods, cephalocarids, ostracodes, and crabs, to name a few).
Evolutionary relationships will be reconstructed from these sequence data, and
compared with patterns of relationships inferred from morphological data. The
proposed research would have significant impact on a large and diverse audience
of biologists. Crustacea have evolved a wide array of morphologies, behavior,
and ecological habits, and the molecular study of their evolutionary history
will provide a framework for understanding how, and when, and how often these
various traits have appeared. These new and independent data will open new areas
of research, and will deepen our understanding of the Crustacea and of the
evolutionary process.
