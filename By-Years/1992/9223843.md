A line of cleavage divides social science thinking on "ethnicity," defined as
the genetic and cultural features such as skin color, language, religion, and
homeland by which a person tends to anchor his or her sense of self. On the one
hand are scholars who stress the utility of ethnic identifications in achieving
political goals (the instrumentalists); on the other are those who view
ethnicity much more as an inherent part of individual identity (the
primordialists). The primordialist view would suggest that people join
ethnically based political parties largely for psychological reasons while, for
instrumentalists, the decision to join turns on how efficiently the organization
appears to pursue its economic or political objectives. Employing a mailed
questionnaire, this doctoral dissertation research project tests hypotheses
issuing from the theory of social identity, a theory that promises to provide a
superior grasp of ethnicity's primordial aspect and its relationship to
ethnically based political participation in Germany, Britain and France. If the
hypotheses are borne out, this research will offer empirical evidence in favor
of the primordialist perspective, suggesting that instrumentalists might have to
revise their accounts of the rise and decline of ethnically based political
parties and of ethnic group behavior in general. The research will indicate the
value of the theory of social identity for explaining why people join ethnically
based political parties.
