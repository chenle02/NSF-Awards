Funds are requested for partial support for the 23rd Annual Meeting of the
Northwest Regional Developmental Biology Conference to be held May 10-12, 1990
in the conference facilities at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University
of Washington. The format for the meeting will consist of Plenary session,
platform sessions, symposia, and poster sessions. A major purpose of the meeting
is to provide an educational experience for young scientists. The small size,
informal atmosphere and physical isolation promote communication among graduate
students, post doctoral fellows, and faculty members. It also provides a forum
for graduate students to present their work in a relatively low stress, yet
scientifically rigorous, environment.
