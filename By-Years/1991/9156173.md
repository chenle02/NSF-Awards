"Venture" Courses in Chemistry on Themes of Energy and Life New first year
chemistry courses with laboratory will be developed for potential chemistry
majors. The first two such courses will be titled "Energy and the Environment:
Chemical Principles, Systems and Practices," and "Chemistry of Life: Chemical
Principles, Systems, and Practices." Both courses will be taught in the Venture
format that has been developed at Rochester. In this format, each chemistry
course will be centered on a general theme and will be coupled with a writing
course and a course from another discipline. Initial enrollments will be limited
to 40 students. If successful, enrollments will be expanded to 100 students. The
general themes were chosen to motivate beginning students. The Venture format
has successfully improved the ability of students to see course material in a
larger context, to make connections between disciplines, to interact, and to
think critically. This is the first time the concept will be tested with a
quantitative science course that provides a foundation for majoring in
chemistry.***//
