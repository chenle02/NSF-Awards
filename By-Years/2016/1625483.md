With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Brant Kedrowski from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh and colleagues William
Wacholtz and Sheri Lense have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This
spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that
accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as to
study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the
solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by
undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic
coursework as well as researchers from the University of Wisconsin at Green
Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education
at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) developing synthetic
methodologies and applications for non-natural sterically congested amino acids;
(b) synthesizing and characterizing organometallic charge transfer complexes
with applications for solar energy or optically active molecular switches; (c)
synthesizing and studying organometallic catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction;
(d) synthesizing a potent electron transport chain inhibiting molecule
stigmatellin and its analogues; (e) developing materials for organic solar cell
applications; (f) developing inexpensive photovoltaics for energy harvesting;
(g) analyzing natural carotenoid pigments isolated from local bacteria; and (h)
synthesizing and characterizing a phosphatase inhibitor analogue.
