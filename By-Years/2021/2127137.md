The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to improve the care and quality of life of colon cancer patients
while reducing healthcare costs. The development of a reliable, reversible, and
cost-effective means to protect segments of bowel has potential applications to
treating a number of common disease conditions such as colon cancer, Crohn’s
disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, ischemic bowel disease, and
abdominal trauma. There are more than 120,000 temporary ostomies (surgical
openings) performed each year in the US, and a majority of these can be
eliminated with the development of the funded technology, addressing a $6.4
Billion total market opportunity. This funded device will initially target the
over 40,000 individuals who have low bowel resections, the majority for rectal
cancer. This represents an initial market size of $200 million in US. The
overall impact with full market penetration in just the US rectal resection
market is $2.4 billion in savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the development of a novel
technology to protect segments of bowel. Colorectal cancer is the third most
common cancer with about 30-40% of cases involving the rectum. Rectal cancer is
typically treated with surgical resection. However, anastomotic leaks can occur
in up 10-18% of patients after resection, with an associated high mortality due
to severe abdominal sepsis. Currently, diverting ostomies are typically placed
above the anastomosis to mitigate the severe consequences of an anastomotic
leak, but temporary ostomies themselves are highly morbid, have significant risk
of mortality, are expensive to the healthcare system, and drastically impact
patient’s quality of life. The funded technology is a medical device that
provides temporary, minimally invasive protection of bowel during the healing
process, avoiding the need for a diverting ostomy. This project will perform
design verification testing, end user testing, and large animal validation
testing required for human study approval. The goal of this project is to have a
fully validated (both benchtop and animal testing completed), clinically ready
medical device ready for further development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
