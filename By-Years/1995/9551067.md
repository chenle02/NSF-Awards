Increased interest in undergraduate science research justifies the acquisition
of state-of-the-art facilities in order to attract gifted students toward
careers in neuroscience. Through this project, histological and neuroimaging
equipment are funded to enable students in the Psychology Department to continue
to investigate the influence of certain variables (e.g., stress, fetal-alcohol
exposure, and environmental enrichment) on the nervous system. The new equipment
gives students an opportunity to utilize the most current methodology in their
pursuit of gaining knowledge about the intricacies of the brain. The
neuroimaging/histological equipment is being used in the laboratory component of
the Physiological Psychology course, a new Introduction to Behavioral
Neuroscience course (yet to be approved), as well as other Psychology and
Biology courses (e.g., Cell Biology). The acquisition of the neuroimaging
equipment can introduce undergraduate psychology majors to the "wonder" of the
brain, enhance the chances of undergraduates getting accepted into graduate
neuroscience programs (especially women undergraduates), and motivate precollege
students to consider studying neuroscience in their academic careers.
