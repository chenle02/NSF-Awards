There has been no significant change in the dynamic indexing methods supporting
database systems since the invention of the B-tree over twenty-five years ago.
And yet the whole classical approach to dynamic database indexing has long since
become inappropriate and increasingly inadequate: we are moving rapidly from the
conventional one-dimensional world of fixed-structure text and numbers to a
multi-dimensional world of variable structures, objects and images, in space and
time. This project is based on a new multi-dimensional indexing technology which
rejects conventional benchmark criteria in favor of a natural principle
intuitively understood by users: the more information given to guide a query,
the faster the response - regardless of any particular instantiation pattern. As
a result, conventional relational indexing becomes much more flexible, with some
classes of query improving on average by an order of magnitude, while retaining
the logarithmic storage and update characteristics of the B-tree. But the main
feature of the technology is its applicability to a much wider range of data
types -- from nested relations to logic clauses, and from spatial objects to
pictorial images. Two specific areas show particular promise: the efficient
indexing of large rule bases, and substantially improved performance of very
large and mission-critical GIS (geographic information systems) applications.
Digital libraries will be used as an initial focus for enhanced support and as
testbeds for comparative performance evaluation.
