This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in chemistry
between Teddy G. Traylor of the University of California, San Diego, and Daniel
Mansuy of the Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France. The objective of their
research is to develop effective catalysts using hydrogen peroxide, dioxygen, or
other oxidants. They will examine the potential of catalysts, known as metal
porphyrins, which have electronegatively substituted substituents. These will be
converted into water soluble forms, soap-like materials, and polymers, and then
attached to solid surfaces. The project takes advantage of complementary
expertise of the U.S. and French investigators in both porphyrin chemistry and
in oxidation catalysis. Catalyzed oxidations of organics, as proposed in this
project, have important laboratory and industrial applications. The proposed
research could result in significant new catalysts for the oxidation of organic
molecules using readily available and inexpensive oxidants, such as hydrogen
peroxide.
