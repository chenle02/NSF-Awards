9600266 Olson The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty- four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Martin D. Olson and Dr. Randy Thaman of the University of the South Pacific
in Suva, Fiji. The purpose of this project is to investigate the differences
between environmental policies and practices in various historical, geographic,
ecological and political contexts within Fiji, focusing on governing
institutions, their forms and the ways in which they are politically and
socially constituted, the evolution of their policies and interrelations at
various levels of local, state and regional authority, and their influence in
shaping what people do in land and sea. ***
