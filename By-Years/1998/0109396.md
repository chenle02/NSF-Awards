A joint U.S.A. - Itlay Symposium on Composite Materials in the summer of 2001 is
proposed that will involve young investigators in this area as well as mature
leaders in the field. This symposium, to be based in Capri, Itlay, was the place
for the first NSF sponsored joint U.S.A. - Italy Composite Symposium 20 years
ago by the coauthors. This award will provide partial travel support for
investigators who would not otherwise be able to attend this binational
conference.
