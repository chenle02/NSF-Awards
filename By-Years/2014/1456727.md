While it has long been clear that some humans take more risks or are more
aggressive than others, recent work has revealed parallel, within-species
differences in boldness and aggressiveness throughout the animal kingdom. The
broad goal of the project will be to increase our understanding of how
individual differences in behavior relate to the individual's ecological and
social environment, and how the individual's behavior and its environment
interact to determine the individual's fitness (survival and reproductive
success). Such knowledge will clarify how individual ecological and social
interactions contribute to population level ecological and evolutionary
processes.

More specifically, this project will examine: 1) patterns in individual
differences in behavioral flexibility in response to changing levels of danger
or varying social conditions (e.g., group size, or sex ratio); 2) how individual
differences in both average behavior and behavioral flexibility influence
fitness outcomes like survival and reproductive success in different risk and
social environments; and, 3) individual differences in situation choice (i.e.,
preference for different ecological or social conditions) and relationships
between boldness or aggressiveness, situation choice, and fitness outcomes.
These goals will be achieved by a combination of new analyses of large
experimental data sets collected by the principal investigator over the last 25
years (using sophisticated hierarchical mixed modeling methods), and syntheses
of relevant literature (on all animals, including humans) along with the
development of novel conceptual frameworks for organizing knowledge and
generating new predictions. The project will train several young scientists and
produce both publications in scientific journals and teaching tools.
