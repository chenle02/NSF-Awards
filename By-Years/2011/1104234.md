The objective of iNoVATE, a consortium of five colleges, an ATE Regional Center
and the Florida Department of Education, is to develop a statewide technical
certificate in Network Virtualization. Along with a curriculum framework, this
project delivers student labs, faculty training, and summer programs to high
school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are: (1)
Develop, implement and disseminate curriculum for a Networking Virtualization
statewide technical certificate; (2) Establish networking virtualization labs
where students can access equipment to practice virtualization skills in-person
or remotely; (3) Develop and deliver a series of Network Virtualization Train-
the-Trainer faculty workshops and instructional resources; and (4) Create and
deliver hands-on summer programs to help at least 100 high school students
strengthen their math and science skills and increase their understanding of
virtualization technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iNoVATE's Network Virtualization
certificate framework and the training program is shared by all 28 institutions
in the Florida College System. The project team provides resources for each of
the technical certificate courses and creates distance learning options for
rural technician education. In addition, a series of workshops related to
Network Virtualization increase faculty understanding of this emerging
technology. Project outcomes are disseminated via the Center for Convergence
Technology and its national network of partner colleges. Industry partners,
Cisco, VMware and Citrix, contribute hardware and software, and they assist with
modifying their existing curricula materials so they can be used by iNoVATE.
