9506899 Ho This proposal seeks to understand the development of posterior body
formation in the relatively simple vertebrate system of zebrafish. By using cell
marking and time lapse techniques, a fate map for tail bud development will be
elucidated to test the hypothesis that cells within the tail bud contribute to
the formation of the posterior body in an organized, stereotypic manner. The
cell movements and final cell fates stemming from the tail bud region will be
correlated with specific patterns of gene expression in the tail bud. This
proposal also will determine if an organizer region exists for the proper
development of the posterior body and will determine if this organizer region is
related to the organizer region of the trunk and head regions. ***
