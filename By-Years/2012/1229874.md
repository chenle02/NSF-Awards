Compared to understandings of the social causes of the creation and diffusion of
biological and physical sciences, how social scientific knowledge is developed
and deployed is less well understood. This study fills that gap by analyzing how
training sessions transmit tacit and explicit knowledges, and how that
transmission process feeds back to laboratory and other knowledge production
settings. To do so, a team of interdisciplinary investigators examine a
selection of over one thousand hours of training videos that seek to transmit
psychological science to users. The findings provide new insights about how
varied settings and modes of transmission shape the distribution and uptake of
social science research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project enhances infrastructure for
social science research and education by fostering collaborations between
institutions, and training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers. It
also creates an online database that is available to other analysts of the
dynamics of the creation and deployment of psychological sciences.
