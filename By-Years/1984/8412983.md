Mechanism design has traditionally been a creative process addressed by creative
engineers and designers. Recent efforts to quantify the process have been
partially successful but much remains to be done before efficient schemes become
available for the design of the most general three-dimensional mechanisms. This
project investigates new methods for the simulation and identification of
spatial (three-dimensional) mechanism configurations. Software packages based on
the method are generated for use by the design community.
