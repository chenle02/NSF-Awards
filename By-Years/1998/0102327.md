This project aims at greater understanding of dislocations in GaN. The approach
involves generation of dislocations with known Burgers vectors and known
character, and the study of how these dislocations propagate during thin film
growth. Additionally, the project addresses how dislocation propagation is
influenced by orientation of the growth surface, particularly during lateral
epitaxial overgrowth (LEO). Electrical and optical properties of these
dislocations will also be examined. Specially designed grain boundaries will
consist of ordered arrays of dislocations which are self-aligning and self-
stabilizing. Variation of misorientation angle will be used to give control over
dislocation spacing and character of the dislocations while variation of the
boundary plane will be used for Burger vector control. Having many aligned
dislocations in a single specimen gives the benefit of meaningful statistical
analysis. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses basic research issues
in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. These
studies will improve the fundamental understanding of defects in Gallium
Nitride, which is a key material to advanced microelectronics and photonics. An
important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
significant area, and education outreach activities to promote diversity.
