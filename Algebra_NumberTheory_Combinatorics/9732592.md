9732592 Abhyankar Various Recognition Theorems of Group Theory provide powerful
tools for computing Galois groups. They also provide suggestive guidelines for
constructing explicit equations with assigned Galois groups, i.e., for solving
various Inverse Galois Problems. It is proposed to continue using this method to
get information on the algebraic fundamental groups of algebraic and
arithmetical varieties. Some of these Recognition Theorems are based on the
Classification of Finite Simple Groups. Some others use the Classification of
Polar Spaces. Still some others use the older techniques of finding Limits of
Transitivity. Another fertile application area for these Recognition Theorems is
in Hilbert's Thirteenth Problem about composite functions. Yet another such
application area lies in the direction of Permutation Polynomials and
Exceptional Polynomials. This research is in the combination of the fields of
algebraic geometry and group theory. Although they are amongst the oldest parts
of modern mathematics, both these fields have had a revolutionary flowering in
the past fifty years. In its origin, algebraic geometry treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Likewise. group theory had its origin in the study of symmetries. Nowadays, both
these fields make use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and
topology, and conversely they are finding applications in those fields as well
as in physics, theoretical computer science and robotics. Moreover, an interplay
between algebraic geometry and group theory continues to enrich both these
disciplines.
