9628937 Harrison Theoretical models predict that interspecific interactions,
combined with limited dispersal, may sometimes produce stable spatial patterns
in population densities. This study focuses on a herbivorous insects that tends
to form dense, but very localized, populations within larger areas of its host
plant. Previous work has established that this insects, the western tussock
moth, is a very poor disperser, and that its spatial distribution does not
appear to be explained by variable habitat quality. The present study examines
two non-exclusive ways that the observed pattern could arise from interactions
between the moth and its natural enemies: (1) Predator satiation, in which a
poorly mobile, generalist predator (an ant) inflicts higher mortality on prey
where prey are dense than where they are sparse, and (2) Predator diffusion, in
which mobile, specialized natural enemies (two parasitoids) "spill over" around
the edges of dense prey populations, creating surrounding zones in which
predator-prey ratios, and therefore mortality, are elevated. Preliminary field
results indicate both these mechanisms may be operating, but not whether they
are strong enough to suppress the spread of outbreaks. This study uses field
experiments combined with simulation and analytic modeling to test these
explanations for spatial population patterns. Understanding the factors that
govern population densities remains a central issue in ecology. In particular,
discerning the causes of epidemic densities of pest species, should greatly
enhance the ability to control future outbreaks and thus lessen the ecological
and economic damage from such events.
