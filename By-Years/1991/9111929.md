An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program
(Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth Sciences, 1991) is understanding and
modeling the geospace environment. As part of its contribution to the U.S.
Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation's Division of
Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research initiative, Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal of supporting basic research into the
dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of
a global geospace model with predictive capability. The subjects of the first
GEM campaign are the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and
the connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.
This grant requests support to operate an induction coil magnetometer at
Frobisher Bay, Canada sensitive to magnetic pulsations having periods between
1000 sec. and 0.1/sec. Pulsations in this frequency range could be an important
component of the GEM mapping program since they present a possible opportunity
to sample superthermal and energetic ion populations in their generation region
