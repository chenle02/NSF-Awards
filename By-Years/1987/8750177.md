The introduction of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, integrated with
computer-controlled Gas Chromatography,into the undergraduate chemistry
curriculum at the University of Southern Colorado has provided a major tool for
introducing students to the use of computer integrated instrumentation, database
searching and computer assisted data manipulation. The combination of GC with
FTIR allows students hands-on experience with a system dealing with real world
complex microanalysis problems as practiced in industry and research. Diffuse
reflectance and cylindrical internal reflectance accessories allow students to
explore most modern sampling techniques. Course directly impacted include
Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Advanced Organic
Chemistry and Independent Study. Both majors and non-majors are exposed to this
instrumentation.
