This project is bringing together, in a consortium, faculty from computer
science and math at the university and three private liberal arts colleges with
scientific support staff from the university's Weeg Computing Center. The goal
is to provide the capability and support for undergraduate computer science
education in parallel computing, using the Internet and the Iowa Communications
Network. The university is purchasing a scalable parallel computer, allowing
prototype collaboration through the networks via video software. Student
evaluations and faculty workshops serve to evaluate and disseminate the results
of this project. Course notes and other teaching materials will be available
from the World Wide Web site.
