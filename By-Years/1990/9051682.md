Northland College, a liberal arts/environmental college in northern Wisconsin,
which has a significant population of Native Americans, has made a considerable
investment in improving computer facilities for the Earth Science/Physics
programs and is now enhancing its offerings in environmental modeling classes.
To accomplish this, a satellite downlink (CONTEL) is being purchased to obtain
real- time meteorological data for model inputs.. Also, a LANDSAT data
processing system (ERDAS, Earth Resources Data Acquisition Systems) is being
purchased to improve the skills of students in environmental analysis and
interpretation. In addition, a course is planned for aiding Native Americans in
resource classification, management, and utilization. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
