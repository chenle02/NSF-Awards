In this proposal, the investigators link world polity and social networks to
inform the development of a new over-time measure of country-level connectedness
to the world polity, labeled the "INGO Network Country Score." This measure will
score countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. The
resulting published dataset will be useful to a cross-disciplinary audience. In
a second part of the project, an in-depth analysis is carried out on one domain
of INGOs-Women's International Nongovernmental Organizations, or WINGOs. The
investigators draw upon theories of the international women?s movement to
provide testable theories about expected changes in the WINGO network structure
over time.

Broader Impacts The proposed project will have broad impact for academic
researchers in the fastest growing areas of political sociology and political
science. The dataset generated here will provide a substantial resource for
researchers who study global processes, international organizations, and cross-
national outcomes.
