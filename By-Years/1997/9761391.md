This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Gensym Corporation
will investigate the feasibility of developing online, real time reliability and
risk analysis software that will analyze process data to ascertain the
reliability of equipment and system functions, assess the current risk in the
facility, report and possibly alarm operators and managers of the risk to system
functions and equipment, and recommend corrective actions to maintain control
over risk. For many organization, expenditure on risk mitigation and safety is
significant. Risk mitigation costs can be reduced by more carefully monitoring
risk and taking corrective action before worst case scenarios develop. The
greater the ability to monitor and the tighter the feedback loop between risk
discovery and evasive action, the more significant the savings. This research
will demonstrate that Bayesian networks provide a core representation for most
reliability and risk analysis models, that system decomposability can be
exploited to provide real time assessment, and that learning methods can be
utilized to estimate and recalibrate the analysis. The value for an online risk
management capability is high in many industries: Environmental monitoring,
toxic waste processing, cleanup and shipment, nuclear power generation, offshore
oil production and shipment, emergency response and emergency evacuation,
critical telecommunications, transportation, flexible manufacturing, securities
trading, credit fraud prevention, and many others.
