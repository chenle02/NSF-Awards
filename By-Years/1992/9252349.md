The goal of this project is to introduce students to recent progress in three
subfields of modern optics: holography, optical phase conjugation, and the
photorefractive effect. A number of imaginative expreriments have been designed.
These experiences enhance their understandings of fundamental concepts in
physical optics, and stimulate their interest in scientific research.
