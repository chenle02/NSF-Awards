There is a large potential market for biosensors in the clinical and health
care fields and for industrial process monitoring. Often biosensors require
expensive equipment and procedures that are confined to the skilled operator and
thus are unsuitable for many purposes outside the analytical laboratory. The use
of monoclonal antibodies offer the possibility to monitor a wide range of
important chemicals using this approach. A novel signal transduction method is
proposed that could lead to simplified monoclonal antibody-based immunosensors.
The technical approach to be utilized for signal transduction will be one in
which resistance changes of a ultra thin metal film containing surface adsorbed
(immobilized) antibodies, will be measured when conjunction with the antigen
occurs. When this interaction occurs, it is envisaged that the changes in
molecular adsorption between the macromolecules and the underlying substrate
will be extensive and readily detectable using the resistance approach.
