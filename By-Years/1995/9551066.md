The teaching of mechanics and motion in introductory physics has produced
disappointing results that imply that most students leave the course with only a
primitive understanding of the motion of objects. In this project, recently
developed video technology is used in an inquiry-based, laboratory-lecture
format to improve students' learning of the fundamental ideas of Newtonian
mechanics. The students record the trajectory of an object with a low-cost video
camera, digitize and record the data on a computer, and then analyze the
observed motion frame-by-frame to discover the features of the observed
phenomenon. This procedure directly confronts students' preconceptions about
motion; measure the same quantities that are used to describe motion in the
classroom, such as the time-dependent position of a projectile; and make new and
challenging phenomena accessible in the introductory physics laboratory. Before
now, the methods employed in this project were too costly to allow students to
collect and analyze their own data in an introductory physics laboratory. In
addition, the method is flexible and easy to use, an essential practical
ingredient in an inquiry-based laboratory. The audience targeted in this project
is all students who take introductory physics. These students are from all
scientific disciplines (physics to sport science) and from all classes (first
year to seniors). The project implements the use of these video technologies in
an environment where the students are involved in both recording the video and
analyzing it. The students can investigate a variety of phenomena that because
of technical or cost barriers cannot be addressed in the traditional
undergraduate laboratory.
