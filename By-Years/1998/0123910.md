A major trend in day-to-day computing involves moving seamlessly from
workstation to wireless handheld devices. A second major trend is continuous
collaboration with colleagues. Accommodating and supporting these trends is
extremely difficult because of the vastly different platforms and communication
networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The objective of the proposal is to develop and
demonstrate a middleware framework for performance-optimized ubiquitous
collaboration over heterogeneous networks. It will enable quality-of-service
applications and support selective data distribution. The key component of the
proposed framework is the collaboration bus, which is a middleware to support
group communication in data-centric groupware. The proposed research
includes:&lt;br/&gt;a) algorithms and methods for dynamic monitoring of network
capabilities,&lt;br/&gt;b) data transformation and adaptation policies for
adjusting network traffic, and&lt;br/&gt;c) assessing and controlling the
performance impact involving in broadcasting each
message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the key elements of the research are the
development of Data Adaptation Agents. These agents transform and change the
data so that it can be used by different applications and hardware. The proposed
research will bring new capabilities for multi-user collaboration within reach.
