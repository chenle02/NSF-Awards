Efficient hierarchical planning, based on a task network, is the topic of this
research. Goal and subgoal interactions will be investigated to achieve improved
control strategies for planning. For example, it should be possible to improve
both the quality of the plan and the efficiency of the planning process by
developing a control strategy which selects among alternative task reductions in
such a way as to avoid harmful interactions while encouraging helpful
interactions. The following specific issues are central to this investigation:
(1) how the various properties of interactions can guide the choice among
alternative reductions in a task network; (2) how to improve the consistency of
task network representations, in particular, how to identify situations where a
seemingly unresolvable conflict can be resolved at a lower level in the task
network; (3) how to take advantage of the fact that some planning tasks, while
not independent in general, become independent once certain other plannng
decisions have been made. The investigators anticipate that completion of the
above research topics will result in significantly improved planning in a number
of environments. To test this idea, they will implement a planning system
incorporating the above ideas, and evaluate its performance on a number of
domains.
