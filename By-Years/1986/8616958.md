During maturation and aging, the nervous system exhibits a progressive decline
in plasticity and capacity for repair. This decline is similar to the decline in
responsiveness with the age of target cells to nerve growth factor (NGF). In
these cells, NGF is specifically bound by cell surface receptors, internalized,
transported to the cell body and degraded in lysosomal organelles. Dr. Claude
will begin investigation of these steps in order to gain a better understanding
of the mechanism of action of NGF, and of the ways in which target cell response
is modified by age and by other factors, including glucocorticoid hormones. The
experiments will make use of dissociated cell cultures of adrenal chromaffin
cells from rats of different ages. These cells respond to NGF with neuritic
outgrowth. Dr. Claude will monitor the number and distribution of NGF receptors
on the surface of the target cells as a function of (1) the age of the cell, and
(2) the presence of glucocorticoid hormones. The techniques to be used include
neural tissue culture, electron microscopy (EM), and cell surface labelling with
visible markers (colloidal gold). The information to be gained from these
experiments will help us to understand the mechanism of action of NGF, and
provide insights into some of the changes that neurons undergo during
development, maturation and aging.
