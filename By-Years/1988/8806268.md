To obtain near-intrinsic, high-resistance layers, ion- implantation of
transition metals Fe, Cr and V in n-type InGaAs, lattice matched to InP, will be
performed. Both furnace and rapid thermal annealing techniques will be used for
dopant activation. By performing Hall, secondary ion mass spectroscopy,
transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Rutherford back
scattering measurements, the resistivity, carrier mobility, impurity
concentration profile, crystal lattice perfection and defect density in the
implanted layers; and solid solubility limits of the implant species will be
determined. The position of the energy levels introduced by the transition
metals and residual implant damage will be determined by photoluminescence
measurements on the material and also by infrared photocurrent, deep-level
transient spectroscopy, and temperature-dependent, current measurements on n-i-n
and p-i-n diodes. Differential Hall measurements on the material and I-V
measurements on the n-i-n diodes will be performed to establish the
applicability of multiple transition metal implants for device isolation in
monolithic integrated circuits. Using the high-resistivity material
photoconductive detectors and p-i-n diodes will be fabricated and characterized
by dc, optical, and microwave techniques. Based on material and device
characteristics, the effectiveness of Fe-, Cr- and V- implants in providing high
resistivity material with attractive properties will be determined. The
transition metal implantations, rapid thermal annealing, and Rutherford back
scattering measurements will be performed at Naval Research Laboratory,
Washington, D.C. InGaAs material will be obtained from Professor Pallab
Bhattacharya's laboratory in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
