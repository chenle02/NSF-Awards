CTS-9700842 Gubbins Cornell University ABSTRACT Seven invited speakers from the
U.S. will be provided partial support to attend the International Conference on
Advances in Chemical Engineering, to be held at ITT, Madras on December 11-13,
1996. The conference is organized by a national committee, with advice from an
International Scientific Advisory Committee. This is the first conference of
this type to be held in Madras, although a similar Chemical Engineering
conference was held in Bangalore about ten years ago. The conference possesses
several unique features: (a) an opportunity to discuss and learn about the most
recent scientific and technological advances in a broad range of areas of
chemical engineering, particularly areas of current importance in Asia and
Europe; (b) there will be an industrial session, with several keynote speakers
and other presentations on R&D and New Technologies; ( c ) coverage of applied,
as well as fundamental, aspects; (d ) discussions of recent and future trends in
chemical engineering education with leading educators from India, Japan and
Europe.
