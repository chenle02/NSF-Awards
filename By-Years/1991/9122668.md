The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from SUNY Stonybrook requests funding for a 1200 kHz,
broadband Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to support research in
shallow coastal waters and estuaries. The instrument is currently needed to
support NSF-funded studies of mixing and hydraulic control in the Hudson River
estuary and an investigation currents on coral reefs of Barbados. The instrument
will also be made available to researchers at other universities and managed as
a shared-use facility. SUNY will provide cost- sharing for this purchase. //
