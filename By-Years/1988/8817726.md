As part of the ongoing rehousing and improvement of its invertebrate
collections, the California Academy of Sciences seeks to integrate three large
molluscan collections it has recently acquired. The new collections include
major holdings of chitons and sea slugs. In addition, adjunct materials such as
color transparencies, microscope slides, and publications were donated with the
collections, increasing their value to researchers. Identifications of the
donated specimens will be made by visiting experts partially supported by the
project. The Academy will also begin to re-curate its previous collections of
these two groups that are preserved in liquid; such wet specimens contain the
soft body parts lost in traditional dry mollusc preparations and thus are
extremely useful. Finally, computerization of collection data for the mollusks,
begun in a previous award, will continue.
