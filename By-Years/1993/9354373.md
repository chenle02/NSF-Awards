9354373 Tewksbury An introductory course on the geology of Africa is being
developed. The goals of this new course are 1) to attract black students to take
geology and to encourage them to major in geology, 2) to provide all students in
the course with a perspective on how the geologic evolution of a region has a
fundamental influence on historical, cultural, economic, and social issues, and
3) to provide both non-science students and prospective geology majors with a
rigorous, hands-on science course in which students really "do geology". This
new course, "The Geology and Development of Modern Africa", will be part of both
a major in geology and a major in Africana Studies. Students who take this
course will not simply learn facts about the geology of Africa. The course will
be designed as a lab course to give prospective geology majors and non-science
majors alike a rigorous, hands-on experience in science and an opportunity to
think creatively about the underlying geologic context for events and trends in
the history and development of modem Africa. The course will be designed to have
a maximum enrollment of 50. A group of several students, both black and white,
will participate during the summer of 1994 in designing the course, which will
be offered for the first time during fall semester 1994. Students who helped
develop the course will serve as teaching assistants and tutors during the first
year that the course is taught, and one of the goals of the course will be to
develop a nucleus of black students who are well-trained and interested in
geology. The course will be evaluated and revised during spring and summer 1995
and offered again in the fall of 1995.
