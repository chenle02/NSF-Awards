Thermal fluctuations create regional disorder within protein structures. It is
increasingly apparent that this dynamical disorder is both intrinsic to proteins
and inherently important for their functioning. Dr. Friedman proposes to study
this relationship between dynamical disorder and functionality. He will use heme
proteins as a model system, studying the rebinding of ligands after
photodissication. The focus will be upon characterization of parameters of the
disordered states and establishing their relationship to the quantum yield of
photolysis, the rebinding rates and the entry into and escape from the heme
pocket by the ligand.
