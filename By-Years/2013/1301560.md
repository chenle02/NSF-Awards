PI: Metin Akay&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 1301560&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neural
engineering is an emerging discipline that combines multiple engineering
disciplines, including electronic and photonic technologies, computer science,
physics, chemistry, mathematics with cellular, molecular, cognitive and
behavioral neuroscience to understand the organizational principles and
underlying mechanisms of the biology of neural systems and the behavioral
dynamics and complexity of neural systems in nature. To highlight this emerging
discipline, the 6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering
will be held in San Diego, CA from November 3 through November 6,
2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The objective of this conference
is to highlight progress in Neural and Cognitive Engineering, an emerging field
bridging molecular, cellular, systems, cognitive and behavioral neuroscience
with engineering, physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science. We
strongly believe that the neural engineering conference further stimulates
neural engineering research and education among neuroscientists, chemists,
engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: In addition to the keynote, plenary, platform and poster sessions, we
will also have a panel to focus on the challenges of making a career in the
rapidly growing, interdisciplinary fields of neural engineering, from being
hired as part of a team and finding&lt;br/&gt;exciting new research
opportunities, to becoming a team leader and what to look for when organizing
that team and choosing its members. Options will be discussed for graduate
studies and research both internationally and within the U.S., as well as the
potential for collaboration among researchers and students internationally.
