The methods of rapid prototyping are ideally suited to rehabilitation devices.
Because each person requires unique performance and function in a rehabilitation
device, devices specific to each person must be rapidly designed and produced.
This project is investigating a completely integrated approach to the design and
prototyping of passive mechanical rehabilitation devices. The approach involves:
the quantitative assessment of the form and performance of human limbs; the
design of the assistive device; evaluation of the device using virtual
prototyping; feedback from the consumer and therapist; actual prototyping of the
device; evaluation of the function and performance of the device; and redesign
based on performance. The contributions of the product include: the development
of new computer-based tools for the assessment of human performance; a
manufacturing technique for a new class of hyperelastic materials; the
integration of tools into a rapid prototyping system for rehabilitation devices;
and development of mechanisms for systematic evaluation of the final product.
