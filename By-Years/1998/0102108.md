This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Understanding the role of the soil
microbial community in the arctic tundra: integrating microorganisms with
climate change theory." Soil microorganisms control the flow of nitrogen,
carbon, and phosphorus through ecosystems. Soil samples are being taken from
established sites which have undergone existing long-term manipulations of
temperature and nutrient and light availability. The sample microbial
communities in these samples are being studied to determine whether treatments
known to affect plant communities also affect soil microbial biomass, activity,
and community composition as measured by terminal restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (tRFLP).
