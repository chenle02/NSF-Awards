Scientists and engineers often encounter data in the form of a relatively dense
collection of points on or near the surface of the object of interest; and one
objective is to reconstruct the surface of the object. Examples come from
medical imaging, machine vision, industrial engineering, statistical analysis
for high-dimensions, and geometric modelling. This research will develop
algorithms for such problems when neither the topology nor the geometry of the
surface are known a priori; both must be inferred in automated fashion from the
data points.
