Modeling of the geochemical carbon cycle and its effect on atmospheric CO2 over
Phanerozoic time (Berner, 1990;1991) has revealed the importance of knowing more
about how land plants affect chemical weathering. This includes the effect of
plants on the rate of uptake of CO2 by silicate and the feedback response of
weathering, with and without plants, to changes in CO2. This project will
investigate the role of plants in weathering by a field study on the island of
Hawaii. Hawaii offers a unique opportunity to study weathering because here
there are: (1) dated basalts ranging back to more that 4000 years (2) a wide
range of plant life, from lichens and algae to well developed rainforest, within
small regions of constant bedrock lithology and constant microclimate and (3)
access to the expertise of biologists who are presently studying plant ecology
in the same area. We plan to measure the thickness and mineralogical and
chemical composition of weathering rinds and soils on flows with an eye to
comparing relative rates of weathering in the presence and absence of specific
biota. Results of this work, when combined with results from planned future
studies of the effects of specific plants grown at varying CO2 levels on
weathering rate, will be employed on our carbon cycle model to place some limits
on how atmospheric CO2 might have changed as a result of the rise of vascular
plants over geologic time
