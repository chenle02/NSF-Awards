The SnowCluster 2018 workshop will bring together researchers and students
studying galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound objects in the
universe. Understanding galaxy clusters can reveal how the universe as a whole
evolved, which is called precision cosmology. In the simplest approximation,
clusters of galaxies are composed entirely of dark matter, because the galaxies
themselves contribute a small fraction of the total mass; they evolve solely due
to gravity, which acts on dark matter and ordinary matter alike. However, due to
the increasingly precise comparisons between observations and models, small
deviations are significant, and therefore small effects on cluster evolution are
important to understand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference provides an
opportunity for the scientific community to discuss and evaluate the latest
models of galaxy clusters, and to "calibrate" theoretical models of cluster
evolution. The conference will feature an informal setting to encourage
participation from students and early career researchers. The conference will
actively seek out participants from under-represented groups through a
systematic process of one-on-one recruitment of participants by the science
topic leaders. This conference is scheduled for March 18 - 23, 2018 at Snowbird
Utah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
