This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a platform technology for cancer therapy which overcomes the
inherent shortcomings of other attempts to delivery siRNA to cancer cells. The
difficulty with current siRNA delivery is that the enzymes in the body degrade
the siRNA before it can reach its target. Most current siRNA technologies on the
market are based on permanent modifications to the RNA itself to enable
delivery. These modifications typically involve changes to the internal linkages
of the siRNA which often decreases the gene silencing ability. Ablitech's Poly-
RNA system involves making reversible modifications to the siRNA solely for
attachment to our polymer network; the backbone structure of the siRNA itself is
left unchanged. This will allow for the delivery of the most effective siRNA
units rather than sacrificing efficacy for enzymatic stability. We plan to
specifically target pancreatic cancer as this form of cancer is one of the most
aggressive, and it is estimated that over 37,000 people will be diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer this year. Pancreatic cancer has an extremely high mortality
rate, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. The average life expectancy
after diagnosis with metastatic pancreatic cancer is only 3-6 months.

Commercially, this research is anticipated to result in a marketable platform
technology for gene therapy for the treatment of a variety of diseases such as
cancer, HIV, and other diseases resulting from genetic abnormalities. The
initial target market for Ablitech's Poly-RNA is the cancer therapy market,
which is expected to generate $55-$70 billion in sales by 2010. Currently, large
pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, and others
that possess large marketing and distribution channels dominate this market and
in recent years have commercialized technologies licensed from small, innovative
companies. Ablitech seeks to follow this model for the commercialization of
Poly-RNA.
