This project will investigate the low temperature deposition of single phase
superconducting films of YBa2Cu3O7 compound on Al2O3SiO2 and Si substrates. The
main objective of this research is to use the versatility of the Activated
Reactive Evaporation (ARE) process for the low temperature growth of single
phase superconducting films of the YBa2Cu3O7 perovskite phase. The project
objective is also to use sputter deposited thin films of SrTiO3, VO2, and TiO2
as diffusion mechanisms.
