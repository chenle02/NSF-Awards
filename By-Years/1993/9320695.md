9320695 Levine At times powerful governments seem to be seized by economic
forces beyond their ability to control: during a twenty-four hour period, for
example, the British government raised interest rates to astronomical levels,
swearing under no circumstances to devalue the pound, only to do exactly that.
At other times, seemingly minor tinkering with policy can unleash profound and
unplanned change: the enormous changes in the former Soviet Union, for example,
seem to have been triggered by relatively mild political reforms introduced by
Gorbachev in the mid- eighties. This project develops and experimentally tests a
rigorous theory that makes quantitative predictions about the strength of
economic forces. To the extent that such predictions are correct, they are of
great value, directing attention to those types of problems and situations where
policy can make a real difference. This project uses data from experimental
economics to validate the theory and improves the predictive power of the theory
in assessing situations where economic forces are extremely weak, such as the
case with the changes unfolding in the former Soviet Union.
