Revised Abstract, 0303319, Crane, N., Cal. State University Monterey Bay
Foundation

This award will provide ocean science education opportunities for
underrepresented middle school students in the Monterey/Salinas area. The
project is a collaborative effort between the SEA (Science Education Adventure)
Lab and RISE programs at California State University at Monterey Bay and 4
middle schools in the region. The RISE (Recruitment in Science and Education)
program will recruit and provide stipends for underrepresented student
participants. SEA lab will design and implement a one-week field-based summer
youth program, a day program for youth and their families and a SEA Guides
mentoring program for high school students and middle school teachers. Project
staff will work with middle school teachers to implement grade appropriate ocean
science curriculum designed to fit within the California Science Framework and
conduct teacher planning and curriculum development workshops.

Year 1 will focus on planning and piloting the field-based summer student
experience and the SEA Guides mentoring program. In years 2 and 3, all
components will be implemented. Project assessment will be conducted in
collaboration with faculty at the University of California Santa Cruz.
