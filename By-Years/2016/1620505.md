This award provides research travel support for Professor Wafic Sabra at the
American University of Beirut, Lebanon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most pressing
question in theoretical physics has been the reconciliation of the laws of
quantum mechanics which govern the microscopic world of the very small with the
theory of general relativity which governs the physics of gravity. Another
pressing question concerns the incorporation of gravity with the other
fundamental forces of nature into a unified theory. Einstein general relativity
is sufficient to understand most gravitational phenomena, but quantum-mechanical
corrections to this theory become important in the study of the early universe
and the physics of black holes. Professor Sabra will study the properties of the
theories that might emerge from such a unified theory at lower energies. This
work might therefore have relevance for studies of black holes, particle
physics, and cosmology. The interdisciplinary nature of this research makes it
potentially valuable to both physicists and mathematicians. This grant will also
help to support theoretical physics at the American University of Beirut, a
leading University promoting the American liberal-arts system in Lebanon and the
Middle East. It will also encourage students there to actively engage in high-
energy physics research, still an underdeveloped field in this part of the
world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, Professor Sabra will conduct
research in the construction of Lorentzian and Euclidean supergravity theories
and the study and analysis of their supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric
gravitational solutions. In the classification of supersymmetric solutions,
i.e., solutions admitting Killing spinors, he will use the powerful method of
spinorial geometry. He will also classify gravitational instantons and study
their connections with integrable models, Einstein--Weyl structures and black
holes in higher dimensions. He will also explore the interpretation of Euclidean
supergravity solutions in terms of string and M-theory.
