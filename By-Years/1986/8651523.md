This project will test an instructional strategy designed to increase the pool
of minority students who are successful in their study of algebra and higher
mathematics courses. Since 1979, the Comprehensive Math and Science Program at
Columbia University has been developing an instructional model designed to give
all entering ninth grade students the opportunity to work to their highest level
of capacity in mathematics. Key features of the model are a zero-based start,
which makes no assumptions on students' prior mathematics background, and a
complementary curriculum, which provides a set of parallel, interlocking
mathematics courses that substantially increases the rate of mathematics
instruction over a four semester period. Preliminary tests of the model in New
York City schools have yielded encouraging results. In the current project, the
instructional materials will be completed and the model will be extensively
tested in New York City and in Fulton County, Georgia. The testing will be
accompanied by the development of an apprenticeship model for teacher training,
which will pair new teachers with experienced teachers in the interlocking
courses of the program.
