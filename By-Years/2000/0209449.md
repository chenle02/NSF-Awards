Funding for computer scientists in quan um information processing has come from
a variety of&lt;br/&gt;programs a NSF. While a new QuBIC program has been
announced in he EIA division of CISE,&lt;br/&gt;there is arguably a need for a
focused program on quantum information processing with a direct&lt;br/&gt;focus
on he computer science aspects of he research. The C-CR division of CISE would
be the&lt;br/&gt;natural location for such a program on "Quantum Communications,
Cryptography and Coding."&lt;br/&gt;To gauge the need and plan what migh be the
scientific coverage and research agenda for such&lt;br/&gt;a potential
program,we plan to bring several of he leading researchers together for a
planning&lt;br/&gt;workshop.This workshop will lead to a five-to ten-page report
that will give a detailed assessment&lt;br/&gt;of the need for a new C-CR
program and give a descrip ion of he research areas ha such a
program&lt;br/&gt;should focus on. By having a C-CR program on "Quantum
Communications, Cryptography and&lt;br/&gt;Coding," NSF would be able to focus
its efforts on he computer science aspects of quanum&lt;br/&gt;information
processing and greatly enhance its ability o make sure he United States keeps
its&lt;br/&gt;leading role in his important area. This workshop and report will
be the first important step in&lt;br/&gt;planning such a program.
