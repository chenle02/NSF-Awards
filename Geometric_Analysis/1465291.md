Abstract (Vasy, 1465291):

The award will support junior US participants to attend two one-week workshops:
"Semi-classical Analysis: Spectral Theory and Resonances" on August 24-28, 2015,
and "Hyperbolic Equations on Spacetimes: Stability, Microlocal Analysis and
Quantum Field Theory", on September 7 - 12, 2015, which are parts of a 3-month
long program at the Erwin SchrÂ¨odinger Institute (ESI) in Vienna, Austria, on
the "Modern theory of wave equations".

Wave equations are hyperbolic differential equations that describe the
propagation of waves in space time.The two workshops and the program in general
are aimed at bringing together researchers working on wave equations in order to
foster interactions between three related areas in which joint conferences are
rare: Asymptotic behavior of waves on Lorentzian spacetimes and related
resolvent esimates; Scattering theory, resonances and semi-classical analysis;
Distinguished parametrices and Hadamard states in quantum field theory of curved
spacetimes. The organizers will make efforts so that many young researchers can
participate in the conference. The organizers will also strive to ensure the
diversity of the participants to the maximum extent possible.
