Protein-protein interactions are integral to virtually all biological pathways.
Predicting these interactions and the function of the protein complex in key to
understanding how biological pathways function. Detailed multistage docking
algorithms, which starts from the unbound structures of two proteins, can
determine the structure of the protein complex. The docking server, ClusPro,
strives to make these docking algorithms accessible to researchers. However, the
current refinement stage is computationally too demanding for use in an online
server, and hence is replaced by simple energy minimization. The ClusPro team
will develop methods to perform side chain search within a traditionally rigid
body docking algorithm, and to calculate escape times from each energy funnel by
stochastic roadmap simulations. These methods will provide more efficient
refinement and will help to identify near-native models, thereby improving the
reliability and accuracy of predictions. The server will be implemented on a
number of platforms, including supercomputers and multi-core
desktops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ClusPro already has over 4500 users and runs over
1000 jobs per month. In 2011, 164 papers used models generated using the server
to study problems in biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. The upgraded
server, with its simple user interface, will be particularly useful to
experimentalist with no extensive computational experience, who will be able use
it for generating models of protein interactions to explain their data. Graduate
students will be trained to optimally combine high performance structure
prediction algorithms with experimental data from a variety of low-resolution or
non-structural techniques. Docking methods are also being incorporated into
undergraduate courses to teach the biophysical principles of molecular
recognition.
