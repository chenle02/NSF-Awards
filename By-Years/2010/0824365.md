Abstract Kim

The PI will study the theory of types, and their applications in Harmonic
analysis on p-adic groups. First, jointly with Jiu-Kang Yu, the PI will
construct K-types in certain tame case and show that they are types in the sense
of Bushnell-Kutzko. These types have Hecke algebras associated to them. In the
second project, the PI will study the structure of these Hecke algebras. Lastly,
the PI will consider various applications of these K-types in Harmonic analysis.
Recent progress in the theory of types suggests that the Harmonic analysis on
p-adic groups can be completely understood via harmonic analysis on the
associated Hecke algebras. These projects are necessary steps towards advancing
the theory of types. In the tame case, one can expect them to lead to a
significantly improved understanding of representation theory of p-adic groups,
and they should also prove useful in the more general situation.

Representation theory is a major mathematical technique for exploiting the
presence of symmetry. For example, the structure of the hydrogen atom, one of
the fundamental computations in quantum mechanics, is controlled by
representation theory. Another way of thinking about representation theory is as
a generalization of the theory of eigenvalues and matrices that many people see
in a college course on basic linear algebra. The investigator studies certain
infinite groups of infinite dimensional symmetries. This project addresses
important questions in representation theory, which potentially has applications
to number theory.
