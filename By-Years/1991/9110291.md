The objective of the proposed research is to develop a fracture mechanics model
of interfaces for measuring interface toughness. Using this model, analytical
and numerical analyses will be carried out on an edge-cracked bimaterial
specimen under various loading conditions to provide the K-calibration
relations, which are necessary for extracting toughness data from experimental
measurements. This research is essential for extracting interface toughness data
from experimental measurements, as well as for assessing the fracture toughness
for a given structure containing the same type of interface. It can provide
valuable information for design, processing and failure prevention of
engineering materials and structures, such as laminates, adhesives and solder
joints.
