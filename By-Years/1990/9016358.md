The new generation of database applications, such as design databases and
scientific databases, and integrated, heterogeneous databases, requires more
powerful query languages, able to support declarative programming, ad-hoc
queries, complex objects, and other features not found in conventional DB
languages. The GLUE/NAIL language provides, for the first time, all these
capabilities in one language. It consists of a "semideclarative" language, GLUE,
which is essentially logical rules connected by conventional sequencing,
procedures, and modules, and NAIL, a completely declarative "view facility" for
GLUE. To make the language efficient, certain optimization techniques, such as
"magic sets" and "regular recursion optimization" must be used, and they must be
extended to handle certain other features. These include negation in subgoals,
following the well-founded semantics, aggregation (e.g., sum, avg.), and second-
order logic to support sets and other object-oriented capabilities.
