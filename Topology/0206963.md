DMS-0206963 Clarence W. Wilkerson James E. McClure Jeffrey H. Smith

Wilkerson (in joint work with W. G. Dwyer of Notre Dame) studies the classifying
spaces of Lie groups and p-compact groups with the goal of finishing the
classification of 2-compact groups and their automorphisms. Wilkerson and Smith
study actions of finite groups on arbitrary finite complexes. The goal is to
construct a moduli space that classifies actions with given fixed point data.
McClure and Smith will continue their work on chain operads and chain models for
homotopy theories. Specifically, they propose to find a small chain model for
the framed little-disks operad, to show that the category of "unstable"
coalgebras over a certain chain operad is a model for HZ-local homotopy theory
of spaces, to give a similar model for HZ-local spectra, and to create a chain
model for the model category of K(n)-module spectra. They also propose to
investigate the properties of a symmetric monoidal structure on the category of
cosimplicial chain complexes. McClure uses the joint work with Smith to study
the homotopy theoretic properties of the Snaith splitting. He hopes to find a
simplified proof of the theorem of Goerss-Hopkins theorem which gives the
spectrum E(n) a commutative multiplication. He also studies the rational
homotopy theory of equivariant spectra when the group is the circle. Smith and
Grodal are studying homotopy G-spheres. That is, spaces that are homotopy
equivalent to a sphere and have an action of a finite group G. They hope to give
a complete classification based on algebraic invariants of the group. They also
study the moduli space of homotopy G-spheres.

Homotopy theory is the most fundamental of all geometries. It studies those
geometric properties which do not change no matter what continuous deformations
are made. The "equality" of donuts and coffee cups is a well known example. Yet,
surprisingly, geometry as studied by homotopy theory has an intrinsic algebraic
nature. The PIs study the geometric properties of spaces using techniques that
come from algebra, with homotopy theory providing the bridge between these
different areas of mathematics. In fact, all homotopy information of a space can
be described using algebra. The algebra is complicated but homotopy theory gives
a correspondence between geometry and algebra that has many important
applications.
