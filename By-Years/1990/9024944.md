Optimization can contribute significantly both to on- line control and to the
design of linear and nonlinear controllers. In the form of receding horizon
control, it has the potential, not easily provided by other methods, to
stabilize linear and nonlinear systems with state and control constraints. When
employed in an interactive, optimization-based design environment, it enables
control systems to be designed to achieve the diverse, possibly conflicting,
objectives that typify engineering design. The purpose of this research is
twofold. Firstly, it will endeavour to provide a firm basis for the use of
receding horizon control by a comprehensive program of research aimed at: (i)
reducing substantially the on-line computational demands made by existing,
stabilizing receding horizon controllers, (ii) developing receding horizon
observers for use when the state is not accessible, (iii) developing adaptive
receding horizon control for the case when the plant is unknown, and (iv)
exploring the use of optimization-based design to achieve these objectives.
Secondly, it aims to improve computational tools for optimization-based design
by research on: (i) semi- infinite optimization, (ii) global optimization, (iii)
semi-infinite global optimization, and, (iv) simple, robust optimal control
algorithms for use in receding horizon control.
