Facebook and YouTube have massive databases containing many
objects.&lt;br/&gt;Objects (e.g., pictures, videos) are read from these
databases and presented&lt;br/&gt;to users. These databases use slower and
cheaper I/O devices. Repeated&lt;br/&gt;database queries are also slow, so
companies cache popular objects in&lt;br/&gt;volatile memory (RAM). As RAM is
about 1000x faster than I/O, queries to&lt;br/&gt;popular objects are serviced
faster. A single computer cannot efficiently&lt;br/&gt;use too much RAM, so a
distributed memory caching system called "Memcached"&lt;br/&gt;is utilized.
Memcached creates a cluster of nodes, forming a key-value&lt;br/&gt;database in
faster memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Memcached's simple architecture led to its
popularity, but is also its&lt;br/&gt;Achilles' heel. When loads increase, more
caching nodes are needed, but it&lt;br/&gt;is difficult to add new nodes and
redistribute the cached data to more&lt;br/&gt;nodes. Similarly, when loads
reduce, it is harder to shut down some nodes&lt;br/&gt;and migrate their cached
data to fewer nodes; scaling down the cluster helps&lt;br/&gt;reduce the large
energy costs they consume. Any changes to the number of&lt;br/&gt;Memcached
nodes result in throwing out most cached data, leading to
lengthy&lt;br/&gt;periods where the distributed caches have to be slowly re-
warmed up from the&lt;br/&gt;backend database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EArly-
concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project investigates techniques
to scale Memcached clusters&lt;br/&gt;smoothly, without any transient
performance degradations. The project also&lt;br/&gt;introduces an intermediate
Flash-based storage tier between the memory nodes&lt;br/&gt;and the backend
database, to help reduce high latencies to the backend&lt;br/&gt;database and
help the smooth scaling of the Memcached cluster.
