The scientific significance of the unicellular green algae treated in the
formal genus Chlamydomonas flourishes on several fronts including use as a model
system in experimental genetics, molecular biology, and gene manipulation.
Modern molecular systematic studies of variability have also revealed a
previously unsuspected wealth of phenotypic and genotypic diversity in the
genus. Comparisons of nuclear-encoded, ribosomal RNA gene sequences revealed
distinct groups of Chlamydomonas species that share more recent ancestry with
other non-Chlamydomonas species, including groups of colonial Volvocales.
Although these new observations conflict with the traditional taxonomy of
Chlamydomonas and its allies, based largely on light-microscopy, new
evolutionary interpretations of morphological variability suggest that undue
influence was accorded primitive features and that ultrastructural and
biochemical characters are not in conflict with the new gene data. A broader
sampling of Chlamydomonas and allied species will be implemented in a new
project designed to expand the molecular and morphological database for these
algae and to test evolutionary hypotheses about their origin and
diversification. A synthesis of modern genetic and traditional morphological
approaches to the study of evolutionary patterns will serve as a key component
of a taxonomic reassessment of Chlamydomonas and of other green algae as well.
