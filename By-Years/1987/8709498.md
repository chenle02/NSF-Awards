This purpose of this research is to investigate the determinants of sex
segregation by occupation. Although it has long been established that the
distribution of jobs held by men and women varies greatly, there has been wide
disagreement over the causes. Explanations for occupational segregation include
sex discrimination, different comparative advantages based on gender for
particular types of work, and different job preferences of men and women. This
study is important because it will provide useful insights into the functioning
of the labor market, at a time when there is considerable debate about the need
for and the appropriateness of government intervention, in order to produce a
more uniform distribution of men and women across occupations. To help
distinguish among the competing hypotheses that might explain occupational
segregation, a data set will be assembled containing occupational
characteristics from various sources including the Dictionary of Occupational
Titles, the Quality of Employment Surveys, the 1970 and 1980 censuses, and the
Current Population Surveys. These characteristics will be used to investigate
how jobs held predominantly by women differ from those typically held by men. In
addition, the question of why only some occupations that were dominated by one
sex in 1970 have shown substantial movement toward a more even division between
men and women will be investigated.
