0216182&lt;br/&gt;Dunn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) grant supports the research needs of Mount Holyoke College science faculty
through acquisition of a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a low-
vacuum sample chamber and energy-dispersive spectrometer. A new environmental
SEM (JEOL JSM-5610) will supercede an existing JEOL 35 CF SEM that is 17 years
old and lacks beam stability, image quality and the capability to image hydrated
or uncoated samples. Faculty from multiple departments including biology,
chemistry and the earth sciences are all engaged in research that will make
excellent use of a state-of-the-art ESEM. Specific studies that require high
resolution textural and compositional analysis of materials include, taxonomic
investigations of marine invertebrates (Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera),
studies of latex coated industrial materials, studies of graphite-calcite carbon
isotopic exchange during metamorphism as a proxy of the temperature of formation
of metamorphic assemblages, compositional mapping of Fe-rich mantle phases to
better understand deep earth chemical dynamics and redox conditions, and
taxonomic investigations of agriculturally-engineered crops. This facility will
also expand the resources available to Mount Holyoke's renowned educational
program for women. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
