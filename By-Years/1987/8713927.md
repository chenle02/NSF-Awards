This grant in experimental physical chemistry is to support a research project
in ultraviolet-microwave optical double resonance and a uv-microwave optical
polarization spectrometer will be first developed and then used to study the
dynamics and structures of very short lived (transient) molecules. Knowledge of
the fundamental physical properties (dipole moments, bond lengths, electronic
character and state distributions) of such chemical intermediates are important
in understanding the rates and paths of chemical reactions. The specific
molecules that will be studied include transition metal oxides, stable radicals
such as FeCO and NiCO and ground and low lying excited states of formaldehyde,
methylnitrene and MgOH. For the latter, state specific processes, such as
radiative and nonradiative energy distribution, dissociation, and isomerization
will be investigated.
