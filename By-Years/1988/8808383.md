The objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in atomic
physics between Predrag Krstic of Belgrade's Institute of Physics and Marvin
Mittleman from City College of New York is study laser-atom interactions. New
theoretical appopraches to the problem will be developed and some of these
methods are expected to be usefulin orther research areas such as heavy ion
physics, surface-ion physics. The collaboration of two capable senior scientists
with long experience in this field is oen of the benefits so to be derived from
this international grant. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint
Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint
fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav
governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of
State. No NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed principally of
Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include
travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
