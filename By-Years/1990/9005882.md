An excimer-dye laser, with frequency doubling, and a transient digitizer for
fluorescence intensity measurements are requested, to be used for studies of
chromium species oxidation, reduction and oxide-halide partitioning kinetics in
the 300-1900 K temperature range. Several unique experimental facilities are
involved. The principal one is a high temperature fast-flow reactor with laser-
induced fluorescence monitoring of the Cr radicals. Additionally, the metals
high- temperature photochemistry reactors, development of which began under a
previous NSF program, will be employed. This apparatus allows a check on the
flow reactor results and an extension of the 10-2 to 10-1 bar pressure range to
1 bar. A second flow reactor with mass spectrometer detection will be utilized
to help identify the reaction products. The proposed research is needed for
understanding the role of Cr species reactions in the formation of hazardous
emissions in waste incineration. Additionally, the equipment will be utilized on
several other combustion projects.
