w:\awards\awards96\career\0formca.doc 9532085 Zhang This Research Planning
Grant will support an investigation of the relation between crystal structure,
anisotropy, interplanar spacing, and transition temperature and the physical
properties of flux pinning, flux creep, the irreversibility line, and the
critical current density. Single crystal samples of the high temperature
superconducting single Cu-O layer compounds of the lanthanum, thallium, and
mercury cuprates will be grown, characterized and measured. The results of this
planning grant will provide a foundation for further study of these strongly
layered materials. %%% This Research Planning Grant will support an
investigation of the relation between crystal structure and physical properties
of the high temperature superconductors (HTS). A limitation in the use of HTS is
the control of properties that enhance the current that can flow without
resistance in these materials. This investigation will grow single crystals of
several classes of HTS having a single copper-oxygen layer and measure the
critical current and other parameters and their relation to the crystal
structure and the anisotropic properties of these crystals. ***
