Recent advances in computer and network technologies and storage, the explosion
of publishing, and the vast increase in data availability from sources such as
the Internet and satellites, that have enabled the emergence of an unprecedented
number of new computer applications, present a new challenge to the ways data
and information are used and managed. This challenge will shape both the
research agenda as well as the technology to be developed for the 21st century.
The objective of this workshop is to bring together the PIs and Co-PIs currently
funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of the National
Science Foundation to: (1) cooperatively analyze and focus on the research and
development issues of problems that are fundamental in making progress towards
this new challenge; (2) share, provide demonstrations and interact with each
other on the objectives, contributions and challenges of major research
activities funded by the IDM and explore fruitful collaboration and synergism;
and (3) provide an opportunity to NSF program officers, other foundations and
funding agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the current
research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and for such officers
to share their program highlights and concerns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will generate a proceedings on all projects currently funded by IDM in
both hard copy and electronic form. The workshop will also generate a report
detailing future directions of research and will suggest promising modalities of
research with an aim to foster innovation and technology transfer. The
proceedings will provide project information searchable by different criteria
and provide connections between discoveries and their use to society. The
workshop website (http://itlab.uta.edu/idm01) will also include links to other
relevant material.&lt;br/&gt;
