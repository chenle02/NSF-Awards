The equipment in this project is being used in a popular upper division physical
optics laboratory course; "Modern Experimental Optics." Students are performing
fourteen experiments in physical optics, interferometry, optical modulation and
heterodyning, laser physics, and time-resolved spectroscopy, but the equipment
is mostly generic, having wide utility beyond these particular applications.
Individual items of significant cost include two optical tables, a home-built
nitrogen laser, an electro-optic modulator, and a fast analog data-acquisition
system.In general, the experiments require students to assemble an optical
system from components, see phenomena they have read about, and use the
phenomena to make a physical measurement. For example, in a study of Fabry-Perot
interferometers, the students start with a HeNe laser, a few mirrors and lenses,
mounts, and a piezo-electric translator and come out at the end with a sensitive
reflectivity value for the low-loss mirrors used in the interferometer.Most of
the experiments are based on the Principal Investigator's experiences as a
postdoc and in industry; in general, they have not been discussed in the
literature. Consequently, they are being published as papers or laboratory
manuals for those projects which turn out to be most useful as teaching tools.
