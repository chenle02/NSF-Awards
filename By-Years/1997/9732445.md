9732445&lt;br/&gt;Scully&lt;br/&gt;This work consists of a set of theoretical
and experimental investigations in the application of atomic coherence to
quantum optics. Three different areas will be explored, precision spectroscopy
based on phase coherent media, an extension of lasing without inversion into the
frequency-upconversion regime, and new studies of enhanced index of
refraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
