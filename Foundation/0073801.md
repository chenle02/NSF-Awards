The PIs form a research group whose work emphasizes the connections between
model theory (a branch of mathematical logic) and other parts of mathematics.
They have established a successful, coordinated research program and an
excellent environment for postdocs, graduate students, and visitors. They plan
to build on that current level of activity by adding one postdoc and by
providing research support for three graduate students, as well as by bringing
in some more established researchers for shorter periods of time and by
organizing meetings for dissemination of new developments.

The general aim of the PIs and the group working around them is to increase the
effectiveness of model theory as a tool in mathematics, and to use feedback from
these interactions to guide the further development of model theory itself. The
work that would be supported by this grant covers most areas of model theory and
its applications.
