Many physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
influenced by microscopic variations that may be characterized as random. A
fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how these
random variations influence the system at a macroscopic level. The investigator
will study partial differential equations with random coefficients. In some
regimes, the macroscopic system is well-approximated by the solution to a
simpler "effective equation." In other regimes, however, the macroscopic
effective equation is insufficient to characterize the system's behavior because
random microscopic variations produce residual fluctuations in the macroscopic
system. In this case, it is important to understand the deviations from the mean
behavior. The first part of the project is to characterize the random
fluctuations of the wave-like and pulse-like solutions to reaction-diffusion
equations and some related equations. Because of the random fluctuation in the
coefficients, the solution is random, and it is important to understand how the
statistical character of the solution depends on statistical properties of the
medium. The second goal is to study random fluctuations of solutions to higher-
dimensional models for interface motion. The third goal of the project is to
study fluctuations of solutions to elliptic equations with random coefficients.

Understanding the effect of random microstructure on a macroscopic mathematical
model is an important problem in many scientific and engineering applications.
How can one quantify uncertainty in predictions of a model when only some
statistical properties of the model parameters are known? The analytical
techniques developed through this project will have an impact in the area of
uncertainty quantification for PDE-based mathematical models. The specific
equations to be studied include reaction-diffusion equations which arise in
models of phenomena in turbulent combustion, population ecology, and
neuroscience, for example. The project also will consider elliptic equations
which arise in applications such as hydrology and materials science. In these
applications, material properties like permeability or electrical conductivity
vary randomly and only some statistical properties of these parameters are
known.
