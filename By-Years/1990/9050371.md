This project improves the quality of instruction of upper level courses in
computer science in artificial intelligence by providing students with a
laboratory of powerful, interconnected workstations and a modern programming
environment which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, graphics,
windowing systems, and object-oriented programming. With this equipment,
students majoring in computer science, computer engineering, and physics are
able to develop advanced software projects, utilizing the state- of-the-art
software tools of graphics, windowing facilities, LISP, Prolog, an expert system
shell, and object-oriented programming tools. Also, students in senior research
projects, independent study projects, and in the honors program are able to
develop sophisticated AI software using this laboratory. These experiences with
advanced software will provide better preparation for students who wish to go on
to graduate school as well as those who pursue careers in industry. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
