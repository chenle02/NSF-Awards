This is a proposal to study the ULF wave spectrum at cusp stations in conjugate
hemispheres. An auroral observatory located at Longyearbyen, Svalbard in the
northern hemisphere has been in operation for nearly a decade and is equipped
with induction coil and fluxgate magnetometers to measure the ULF wave spectrum.
The station is also instrumented with all-sky and meridian scanning photometers
which provide an optical context for the magnetic measurements. In the southern
hemisphere, the Australian station at Davis, Antarctica is also equipped with
induction coil and fluxgate magnetometers and has made observations of the ULF
wave spectrum associated with the cusp for several year. We have begun an
echange of data and the analysis shows promising correlations. It is well known
that the cusp region is a rich source of ULF waves spanning the frequency
spectrum from near dc to above Hz. The spectrum consists of an ensemble of waves
and variations with causes ranging from boundary motions and macroscopic
boundary instabilities at the low frequency end, through impulsive and coherent
signals with correlation to the solar wind at intermediate frequencies, up to an
beyond ion-cyclotron waves generated in the unstable plasma near the
magnetospheric boundary layers and shocked cusp plasma. Our work in this
analysis is aided by through collaboration with the plasma simulation group at
the Geophysical Institute. Our goal is to collect ULF data at the two sites on a
campaign basis in order to: o investigate the conjugacy of the cusp at these
sites; o identify wave generation mechanisms associated with the cusp; o inspect
the ULF spectrum at the two sites for correlations; o identify signatures of
flux transfer and particle injection at the magnetopause; o use the waves as a
diagnostic for location of the boundaries.
