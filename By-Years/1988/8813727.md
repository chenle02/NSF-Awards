Despite several decades of research, the magnitude and variability of
biological production in the sea is poorly known. This is because until recently
these measurements relied on incubation experiments done on discrete sampling
from ships. The advent of remote sensing (from airplanes or satellites) of ocean
properties, has the potential to greatly improve our estimates of marine
biological productivity. This work will make direct measurements of surface
ocean phytoplankton (plant) characteristics coupled to remotely sensed optical
measurements. The work will be done in a biologically dynamic region off
southern California and should result in a significantly enhanced capability to
predict ocean productivity from remote measurements.
