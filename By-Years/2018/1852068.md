This funding renews a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at
Auburn University focused on smart unmanned aerial vehicles (smart UAVs).
Undergraduate students design algorithms and techniques to safely, securely, and
efficiently fly a fleet of autonomous UAVs in a limited field. A nationwide
recruitment process with particular emphasis on the southeast region of the
United States is used to select cohorts of undergraduate students to participate
in an eight-week summer research program at the host institution. The project
includes mentoring by the experienced computer science faculty members,
technical seminars and workshops, student presentations, field trips and other
professional development opportunities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project has
a strong research basis and the support of a team with research experience as
well as experience as pilots. The projects are in timely and appealing and
accessible to a broad range of undergraduate students. The research projects are
particularly focused on UAV autonomy, collision avoidance, secure communication,
stable flight, and energy efficient flight. The students participate in a full
range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to
production and dissemination of research results. Emphasis is placed on
recruitment of students from under-represented populations and institutions
where students have limited research opportunities. This project has the
potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members
and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
