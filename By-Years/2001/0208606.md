Conditional branches are expensive. Branches require a significant percentage of
the execution cycles since they occur frequently and can cause pipeline stalls.
In addition, branches result in forks in the control flow, which can prevent
other code-improving transformations from being applied. We plan to develop path
profile-based techniques for replacing the execution of a set of two or more
branches with a single branch on a conventional scalar processor. We propose to
improve performance by merging the conditions of two or more branches into a
single condition. Previous approaches have accomplished such merging of
conditions that have either only involved a single variable or have required
special hardware to merge multiple conditions together. Techniques will be
developed to produce a merged condition involving multiple variables that can be
used to bypass the code testing the original set of conditions on a conventional
processor. Merging conditions may be very good fit for run-time optimization
systems, which optimize frequently executed paths during the execution of a
program.
