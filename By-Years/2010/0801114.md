The PI proposes to further extend his program on the connection between forcing
properties of sigma-ideals and their descriptive set theoretic, measure
theoretic, Ramsey, Fubini, and dynamical aspects. The program has been
successful in the past, and continues to generate questions and results
connecting forcing to other parts of mathematics. The current issues include
among others rectangular Ramsey problems, in which the homogeneous sets have
forms of rectangles with sides positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal,
characterizations of sigma-ideals given by collections of measures, and
canonical Ramsey theorems, in which Borel equivalence relations attain simple
prescribed forms on sets positive with respect to a suitable sigma-
ideal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Cohen invented forcing as a method for proving
that various questions are unsolvable on the basis of the usual axioms for
mathematics. Saharon Shelah sharpened this tool with his method of proper
forcing. The method depends on complicated combinatorial ad hoc constructions of
partial orders. The PI considers partial orders of a special form--those of
Borel subsets of the reals positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal
ordered by inclusion. It turns out that little generality is lost in this way,
the decades of previous work on sigma-ideals in other branches of mathematics
can be brought to bear on the resulting questions, and the approach is in fact
provably optimal in certain important aspects. The project continues this line
of work, connecting the powerful method of forcing with such branches of
mathematics as measure theory, combinatorics, dynamical systems, and game
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
