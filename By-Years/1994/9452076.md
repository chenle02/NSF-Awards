9452076 Mink The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz Fourier
Transform NMR spectrometer with a 1H-13C probe and a variable temperature
controller. The instrument is an integral part of the ongoing updating of the
curriculum to emphasize chemical structure, synthesis and dynamics in the
laboratory courses. The project incorporates "hands-on" use of the FT-NMR
spectrometer across the curriculum, including 1-D and 2-D analysis in the
organic, inorganic and biochemistry courses. Two new laboratory courses are also
undergoing development, "Practical NMR Spectroscopy" and "Advanced Synthesis."
"Practical NMR Spectroscopy" includes the theory of FT-NMR spectroscopy, and
experiments using multiple-pulse sequencing, selective decoupling, and 2-D
spectroscopy. "Advanced Synthesis" is a project-based, research-oriented course
emphasizing the synthesis of organic and inorganic compounds combined with
techniques of 1-D and 2-D FT-NMR spectroscopy for product elucidation and
mechanistic studies. The instrument is also being used by students in our non-
majors organic chemistry courses, and by local high school teachers and
community college students. The instrument is also enhancing an active
undergraduate research program.
