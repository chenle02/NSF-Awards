This project is to provide support to Hampton University to institute a
program, in cooperation with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography
(ASLO), to increase the numbers of under represented minorities electing careers
in aquatic sciences and becoming involved in ASLO activities. The program is
targeted at minority students, faculty, and professionals with interest in
aquatic sciences, as well as majority faculty working at Historically Minority
Colleges and Universities (HMCUs). The proposed activities include: an initial
free membership in ASLO and support to attend annual meetings; pre.meeting
workshops to prepare attendees for active participation in the meeting; and a
special session during the meeting for HMCU representatives to make
presentations. The combined efforts of an HMCU and a professional society should
provide an effective mechanism to attract minority students and get them
actively interested and involved in scientific research and professional society
activities.
