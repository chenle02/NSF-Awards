This project will study the production and properties of Rydberg states of
laser-cooled rubidium inside a holographic atom trap (HAT). The HAT is produced
by sending a high power continuous-wave YAG laser though a holographic phase
element, then imaging the diffraction pattern onto a cloud of atoms formed
inside a dark magneto-optical trap. The resulting trap is an array of lattice
sites that strongly confines atoms in three dimensions. Each lattice site
contains thousands of atoms at densities more than two orders of magnitude
higher than in a magneto-optical trap. Traps of similar design are of great
current interest for Rydberg atom quantum computation. Narrow-band excitation of
Rydberg states in high density atom clouds has been recently predicted to be
strongly affected by the "dipole-blockade "collisional effect in which the
presence of a single excited Rydberg state can frequency shift neighboring atoms
out of resonance with the excitation light. The HAT will be used to study this
process at densities comparable to those needed for mesoscopic Rydberg quantum
computation.
