The allosteric regulation of enzyme activity is one of the most direct
mechanisms for a cell to respond to fluctuations in its environment. While the
allosteric properties and mechanism of a number of enzymes have been studied in
great detail, there is relatively little known about the solution dynamics of
these systems. E. coli methylglyoxal synthase, an allosterically regulated
homohexameric enzyme, will be used to understand the role of protein dynamics in
the allosteric regulation of a multisubunit enzyme. The 1H-15N backbone amide
NMR resonances will be assigned using TROSY pulse-sequence technology, and the
dynamics of each resonance will be measured on the picosecond to millisecond
timescale in both the T-state and the R-state. Isothermal microcalorimetry will
be used to determine the heat associated with the conformational change and to
independently determine if a pre-existing equilibrium exists between the two
allosteric conformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a reaction reminiscent of
that catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase, MGS catalyzes the elimination of
phosphate from dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form the enol of methylglyoxal via
an enediolic intermediate. Both the mechanism of proton transfer from oxygen to
oxygen and the mechanism of phosphoryl elimination will be studied by a
combination of site directed mutagenesis, mechanistic enzymology, computational
analyses, and X-ray crystallography. The extent and importance of phosphoryl
polarization to catalysis will be determined both by examining the structure of
methylglyoxal synthase complexes of novel sulfur analogues of known inhibitors
and by the kinetics of corresponding sulfur analogues of the substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The catalytic surfaces of methylglyoxal synthase and
triosephosphate isomerase will be compared to understand how each enzyme
controls its corresponding reaction pathway.
