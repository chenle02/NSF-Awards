The investigator will work on further development and applications of his
powerful geometric machinery of graded diagrams which was created to solve the
famous Burnside problem (posed in 1902) on periodic groups of sufficiently large
even exponents. In particular, he will extend the framework of the main
induction construction of this machinery to obtain more results on groups whose
defining relators are nth powers. In addition, he will work on a generalized
version of the Hanna Neumann conjecture on subgroups of free groups and long-
standing Stallings' problem on presentations of the trivial group.

This research is in combinatorial group theory which studies groups defined by
means of generators and defining relators and is at the intersection of the
theory of groups with low dimensional topology, geometry, and mathematical
logic. The theory of groups is a mathematical theory of symmetry which interacts
with many other disciplines, for example, physics and chemistry outside of
mathematics, coding theory, number theory, topology and geometry inside
mathematics.
