The PI and his team will continue to search for new exoplanets using
gravitational microlensing techniques in collaboration with an international
network of observatories with wide-field telescopes. Microlensing is a
phenomenon which can be used to detect a very faint object, such as planet,
through the planet's gravitational bending of light of a background source. The
investigators will conduct observations with an international network of
professional and amateur observers.

This work will have broad impact by involving researchers in different
countries, by making progress in unifying the gravitational lensing community,
working with amateur scientists at some of the telescopes, and public outreach
efforts. The PI will also train a graduate student in this field. Microlensing
has the potential to detect many new exoplanets with important demographics that
are often missed with other techniques, such as finding planets at high
separation from the host star, and free-floating planets, or those which do not
appear to be gravitationally bound to any star.
