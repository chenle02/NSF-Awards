This project ties in with a project funded under the Undergraduate Curriculum
and Course Development program entitled "A Laboratory Approach to Introductory
Differential Geometry." Much of the preliminary work on this project has already
been completed. This grant is supporting the purchase of a Sparc workstation and
a graphics accelerator board along with the peripheral devices necessary to
bring machines used in the project in line with the machines students will be
using in the laboratory. Undergraduates are being involved in the development of
the modules which will be tested at numerous institutions.
