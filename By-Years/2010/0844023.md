The fundamental issue being addressed by this workshop is the formation and
growth of continental crust ? one of the most fundamental issues in continental
dynamics. There is a long standing observation that continental crust has a
composition that is more silicic than basalt, but also more mafic than andesite.
One idea is that basaltic oceanic plateaus (oceanic Large Igneous Provinces ?
LIPS) may be important nuclei for continent formation. The PIs argue that Costa
Rica may be an example of a basalt plateau that is being converted to
continental crust by arc magmatism. Their objective is to establish that the
Costa Rican crust is in fact now approaching what would be accepted as
?continental?, that no older continental material is there, and to what degree
the arc magmatism has changed it chemically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team of
PIs involved in this effort has worked on the design of a research program for
over a year. However, to date, all members of the team have not had a chance to
interact in person. Such a meeting is crucial for the successful working of a
large scientific collaboration such as this one. This award provides funding for
a 2-day science plan development workshop, to be held at Rutgers University in
the fall of 2008. The workshop will pursue two primary
goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Reassessment of goals and targets of study in
view of the most recent work performed (or planned) in Costa Rica;&lt;br/&gt;2.
Formulation of the specific research program, along with a training and outreach
schedule.&lt;br/&gt;
