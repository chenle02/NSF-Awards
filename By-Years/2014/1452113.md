Using physical buildings as a metaphor for software systems is a well-
established idea, dating back at least to Fred Brooks' book, The Mythical Man-
Month, from the mid-1970s. A recent paper by Landwehr suggests that software
systems on whose security we rely might be more trustworthy if the software
analog of a building code were developed and applied to them. This proposal is
to support planning and participant travel for a workshop that aims to develop
both (1) an initial draft for a building code for a specific domain of software-
controlled systems, medical devices, which compose a domain of cyberspace in
which security and trustworthiness are particularly critical, and (2) a related
agenda for research into assuring desired security properties of such systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is to advance the adoption of
proven techniques for assuring that software controlling medical devices is free
of common sorts of vulnerabilities and to develop a research agenda that will
provide the basis for continuing improvement of the security of future medical
device software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop could lead to significantly
less vulnerable medical device software systems and could also motivate
appropriate research in the area. The techniques for using a building code
structure can be used to extend the approach to other possible software domains
where security is a critical consideration.
