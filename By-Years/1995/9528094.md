Delzell DMS 95-28094 This awards supports the special year in real algebraic
geometry to be hosted jointly by Louisiana State University and Southern
University. Emphasis will be placed on the study of the algebra and logic of
ordered structures. This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
