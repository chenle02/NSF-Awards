9711738 Johnson This award provides funds to the Engineering Research Center at
the University of Colorado, Boulder/Colorado State university, Fort Collins,
entitled Optoelectronics Computing Systems Center to develop cross-disciplinary
B.S./M.S. degree options in optical engineering in the electrical and computer
engineering department at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Students will
receive BS/MS degrees in electrical and computer engineering with an emphasis in
optical engineering. The degree options will be structured so that students can
complete both degrees, with an emphasis in optical engineering, in five years.
This proposal will develop and produce systems-level multimedia education
modules, based on the Center's system-based research, to be integrated into
selected optics/optoelectronic courses for these degree options.
