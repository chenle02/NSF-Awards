Research is progressing along five lines: 1. Algorithms for approximating (by
e.g. circumscribing) polygons and polyhedra. 2. Coordinating the movement of
several objects in a cluttered environment. 3. Terrain navigation on an
undulating surface. 4. Computational geometry on curved manifolds; and 5. The
shape of non-inferior regions in multi-objective programs. A monograph is being
written on "Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms."
