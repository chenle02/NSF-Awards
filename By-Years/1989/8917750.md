The nature of the shallow oceanic crust produced at seafloor spreading centers
is poorly constrained by available geophysical data. Recent studies suggest that
the shallowest layers of the crust are characterized by extremely low seismic
velocities, but that the velocity increases rapidly with depth. Understanding
the processes that control these variations are important in determining the
porosity of the crust, alteration of crustal rock, and the local and regional
significance of crustal drilling data. The present award will support a near
bottom refraction study of a segment of the East Pacific Rise in the eastern
equatorial Pacific. The project will allow a detailed study of the shallow crust
by using both a receiver and acoustic source deployed at the seafloor. This
technique will provide a higher resolution study than is available from normal
surface ship observations. Data from the experiment will be compared to drilling
results which are planned along this same section of ridge. The principal
investigators on this project have distinguished records in both experimental
and theoretical analysis of crustal data.
