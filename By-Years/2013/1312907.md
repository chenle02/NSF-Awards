Typically, optimization deals exclusively with instances of static problems,
with few exceptions. Some exceptions include stochastic optimization and on-line
optimization models that treat problems with time-varying uncertainties in the
objective functions. Stochastic optimization anticipates that these
uncertainties occur in a random fashion and on-line optimization allows for
objective functions to be drawn from some pre-specified class of functions,
again, in an arbitrary fashion. In the existing literature on constrained
optimization, there is litte, if any, evidence of optimization theory or
algorithms that treat the class of problems where the uncertainties are both in
the objective function and the constraint. The goal of this proposal is to
bridge this gap. The significance of the proposed research is twofold: (1) It
critically expands the domain of optimization to include a new class of problems
a with time-varying nature by developing their background theory; (2) It
pioneers some new computational models for solving time-varying problems, and
especially those currently arising in data classification, signal processing,
and network resource allocations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has
the potential to impact the design and operation of autonomous engineering
systems. It also has the potential to make contribution to the study of
information processing systems that support human-centric operations and
decisions. Some of the engineered systems that could benefit include:
surveillance and monitory systems for tracking environmental and other changes,
data management systems (including data analysis, information retrieval,
decision support), and wireless communication systems, e.g. mobile phone
networks. The proposed research could increase the stability, reliability, and
the performance of these systems.
