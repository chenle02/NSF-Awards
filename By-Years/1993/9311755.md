An Engineering Faculty Internship will provide funds to match support from
Durametallic Corporation. The award will enable the PI to study heat generation
and dissipation in mechanical seals. The temperature distributions in various
solid components and in the liquid will be predicted by computation and the
results will subsequently be validated by experimental work to be done on a
specialized test rig located at the industrial site. The results will be used to
develop design codes for design of mechanical seals with minimal leakage and
friction losses.
