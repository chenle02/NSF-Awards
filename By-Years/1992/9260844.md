The resolution and overlay accuracy needed for advanced semiconductor
manufacturing has tightened about 30% every two and one-half years. Current
design rules lie near or below the actual wavelength of visible light.
Therefore, optical tools for pattern generation are now supplemented by new
technologies such as X-ray and electron beam exposure systems. Manufacture of
devices under a sub-half micron design rule requires patten overlay control to
an accuracy more severe than ever before. The task is complicated by the mix of
new lithography tools, which may employ dissimilar technologies, but
nevertheless must be calibrated and integrated. So far, the most successful
approach has been to model the distortions of printed patterns against the
parameters of the lens and alignment systems. However, new and stronger methods
are needed. This SBIR Phase I research explores an expert system for process
overlay control. Called the Lithographic Imaging METrology (LIMET) module, the
LIMET-expert uses new techniques to provide the modeling and statistical
experience available to customize models and algorithms. LIMET-expert has
application in the real- time control and maintenance of the process as well as
the pattern generation equipment.
