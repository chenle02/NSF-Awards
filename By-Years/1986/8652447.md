Though geology is primarily a field science and the most effective method of
study is in the field, most earth science teachers have little if any such
experience. This program is designed to help teachers develop field skills and
to provide them supplies, resource materials, and field activities that can be
utilized in their earth science classes in Arkansas and Missouri. The program
will consist of two segments. The first portion will introduce earth science
teachers to as much diverse geology as possible to develop their field skills.
The course will begin at the University of Arkansas and Missouri campuses with a
three day intensive review and an introduction to the geology of the field area,
Lander, Wyoming. In Wyoming the participants will work in field projects, and a
resource unit on a field topic in geology. The second portion of the program
will occur in Arkansas and Missouri and involve the teachers in applying the
skills learned in field camp to develop resource materials and field activities
for their earth science classes. These reports will be edited and printed as a
fieldguide to the geology of the state.
