This project will evaluate the quality and utility of RNA oligonucleotides
synthesized using a novel chemical synthesis scheme. The growing interest in RNA
structural components, ribazymes and other RNA functions has generated a need
for reliable methods of synthesizing small RNA oligonucleotides (&lt;50
nucleotides). Although RNA synthesis can be accomplished for some applications
via either biochemical methods, em. transcription, or chemically, e.g.
5'-dimethoxytrityl-2'-silyl chemistry, there is a definite need for improved RNA
synthesis methods. Final processing of synthesized RNA must be done under mild,
sterile conditions with minimal handling. Our final processing is accomplished
under mild aqueous conditions, pH 3, 55 √ùC for 10 minutes. The purpose of this
study is twofold: (1) establish the general utility of this chemistry by
synthesizing a variety of RNA oligonucleotides to be evaluated by several
collaborators, (2) confirm the RNA quality by using a broad spectrum of chemical
and biochemical assays. The market for oligonucleotides should grow
significantly to a multi-million dollar level if this cost effective route to
these materials can be developed.
