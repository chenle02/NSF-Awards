Dr. Gary A. Lorigan of Miami University (Oxford, OH) is funded for his research
in magnetic resonance studies of membrane proteins by a CAREER grant in the
Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division and in the Molecular
Biophysics program of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division. He will
develop model membrane systems that magnetically align at low magnetic fields
for magnetic resonance studies. A Q-band EPR spectrometer will be used to
explore the structural and dynamic properties of model membrane systems and
integral membrane proteins. Dr. Lorigan will develop a modern biophysical
chemistry curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students in both the
classroom and the laboratory.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an important technique that is rapidly
becoming a standard tool in chemistry and biochemistry for the structural
determination of proteins. This research will allow biophysical chemists to
investigate the structural and motional properties of biologically significant
molecules. Dr. Lorigan plans on developing new course work in the area of
biophysical chemistry for both undergraduate and graduate students.
