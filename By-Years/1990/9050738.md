Through this project, digital computers have been interfaced to four
spectrometers in the department of chemistry to enable more students to
accomplish more sophisticated studies with the instruments. Student learn more
thoroughly how the instruments work and write programs that control and record
data from the instruments. The students in the advanced chemistry courses
designed and built some of the electronic circuits that are used for
communication between the computers and the instruments. The upgraded
instruments allow students to do experiments for classroom work and research
that they could no do without the computers. In addition to the use of the
computers with the instruments, they are able to write papers and work with a
chemical data base on the computers. The institution is contributing to the
project in an amount equal to the NSF grant.
