This award provides funds to the Geography Department at Utah State University
to help purchase equipment for the establishment of a Remote Sensing Teaching
Lab for undergraduate training in digital image processing and automated
mapping. This award will allow the Principal Investigators to: 1. Provide
training in state-of-the- art remote sensing and GIS software and hardware to
USU undergraduates. 2. Create laboratory exercise which stimulate the
development of new applications of remotely-sensed and GIS data bases for
resource management. 3. Provide laboratory facilities to encourage undergraduate
development and interaction between disciplines. and 4. Improve undergraduate
understanding of image processing software logic and the students ability to
create new algorithms to address specific land management problems. The grantee
is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
