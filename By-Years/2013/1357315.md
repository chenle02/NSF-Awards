This award provides partial support for three conferences in economic history:
the 2015 and 2016 Cliometrics Conference and the 2017 World Congress of the
Cliometric Society. The research topics bring together economics with
statistics, demography, political science, sociology, anthropology, and
archaeology. The goal is to use scientific methods to analyse historic data
sources.

Papers presented at the conference are chosen in response to an open call for
submission. Particular attention in selection goes to graduate students and new
scholars. The steady mixing of newly trained and experienced researchers creates
a unique intellectual environment that has worked to increase participation in
this field of economics. The result is that young scholars receive the
stimulation and encouragement to build strong scientific records in this
interdisciplinary field.
