Constraint-based reasoning has been used in many areas of artificial
intelligence: vision, language, planning, diagnosis, scheduling, configuration,
design, temporal reasoning, defeasible reasoning, truth maintenance, qualitative
physics, logic programming, and expert systems. This research focusses on the
constraint satisfaction problem paradigm, which underlies many of these
applications. The research objectives are: (1) characterizing tractable problem
classes, (2) developing new algorithms, (3) addressing knowledge representation
issues, (4) addressing knowledge acquisition issues, (5) studying extensions of
the basic constraints satisfaction problem paradigm.
