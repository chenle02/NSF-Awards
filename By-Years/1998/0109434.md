This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project seeks to develop
simulation software for teaching evolutionary biology. Evolution is the core
subject in biology, yet it requires concepts and ways of thinking that are
challenging for most students. Moreover, it is a subject that is poorly
understood by many non-scientists, with important consequences on the way
science is taught in public schools. This project will lead to the development
of a very flexible piece of software that allows users to design evolutionary
simulations and students to graphically see evolution in action. The software
will be accompanied by a set of classroom-tested laboratories teaching a variety
of evolutionary topics. Students will learn by designing and performing their
own experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this project
is immediate and obvious. To date, a good, general purpose teaching program of
the type proposed in this project is not available and the market is very large,
consisting of virtually every secondary school and college in the
country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
