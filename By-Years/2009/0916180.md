Cognitive radios enabling dynamic spectrum access are envisioned to sense the
environment and self-learn to maximize an individual or group utility function.
This results in cheating, irrational behavior, inequality aversion, altruism,
learning from past memory, etc. These traits are strikingly similar to human
behavior and social interactions. Therefore, this project explores this
parallelism going beyond traditional game theoretic analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the implications if communication protocols in a
cognitive radio network resemble human behavioral and psychological
interactions? Will the network develop its own psychology with random
perturbations, similar to human evolution?&lt;br/&gt;These are the fundamental
questions addressed in this project using tools from social science and
behavioral games. Some of the main theoretical ideas will be implemented in
SpiderRadio, a cognitive radio network prototype developed in the PIs?
laboratory at Stevens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
intellectual merit of this project is an inter-disciplinary effort
that&lt;br/&gt;overlaps human behavioral models, cognitive psychology, economic
models, decision theory and dynamic spectrum access. Emerging social science
concepts such as evolutionary and cognitive psychology, behavioral economics,
drama theory, personal and social dilemmas are used to model various types of
interactions among cognitive radio nodes in a network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The outcomes of this project will have a
broader impact on wireless networking research and spectrum policy making
communities. This project also gives a unique opportunity for students in
engineering and psychology to collaborate. Finally, some of the ideas presented
here will impact the next generation standards in cognitive radio networking.
