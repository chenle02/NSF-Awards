Sheremet&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0116910&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shallow water and
hydrostatic approximations do not hold for deep convection, implying that the
horizontal component of the earth's rotation cannot be neglected. This proposal
is to support work to determine how convection in a system where the gravity and
rotation vectors are parallel differ from one in which they are not? Preliminary
experiments in the latter type of system suggest an eastward advection of the
convecting region and general sinking of fluid along a wedge between the
directions of gravity and rotation. Two modes of sinking are identified: blobs
sink parallel to gravity and leave behind tails parallel to the rotation axis
while curtains sink parallel to the rotation axis. Laboratory experiments will
be performed to determine the dependence of the characteristics of convection on
a three-dimensional parameter space defined by the rotation, the buoyancy flux,
and the angle between the rotation and gravity vectors. The PI will also compare
the lab results with the output of the MIT model in a hope of verifying one of
the many proposed parameterizations present in the model.&lt;br/&gt;
