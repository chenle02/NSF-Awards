The University of Florida group will carry out research in theoretical
gravitational physics which will involve the application of analytic and
numerical techniques to the study of black holes, compact stars and clusters,
cosmological problems, and quantum aspects of gravity. Binary systems consisting
of two black holes might form fairly often in galactic nuclei and become
important sources of gravitational radiation. The evolution and emission
properties of such binaries will be studied with new techniques. The study of
neutron stars will continue. One activity will imploy further the Butterworth-
Ipser numerical code to decipher observable structural properties of rapidly
rotating relativistic neutron stars. Another will employ new "Eulerian"
techniques to study nonaxisymmetric pulsations and stability, with emphasis on
the maximum rotation rates expected to be observed. Star clusters, which
possibly form in galactic nuclei and collapse to massive black holes, will be
studied, with the focus on their stability properties. Estimates will be made of
the distribution of dark matter in galaxies to assess the viability of local
experimental detection of dark matter. Tools such as path integrals and spinoral
techniques will be used to study quantum-gravity problems such as the early
Universe and late stages of black-hole evaporation.
