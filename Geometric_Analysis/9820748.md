Abstract

Award: DMS-9820748 Principal Investigator: Xianzhe Dai and Rugang Ye

This award provides partial support for the (first) Santa Barbara Summer
Conference in Geometry, to be held from July 21 to July 24, 1999 on the campus
of University of California, Santa Barbara. The purposes of this conference are
threefold. First, to bring together the leading experts in geometry, and
especially in the fields closely related to physics. Second, to survey the
recent remarkable progress spurred by physics, especially string theory, and
point to new directions and frontiers for young researchers, graduate students
and postdocs. Third, to further stimulate the fruitful interactions between
mathematics and physics in coordination with the program "Geometry and Duality"
to be run right after this conference at the Institute for Theoretical Physics,
UCSB.

Currently, we are witnessing the blossoming of a golden age of interactions
between physics (in particular high energy physics) and mathematics (in
particular, differential geometry, differential topology and algebraic
geometry). On the one hand, physicists, guided by physical intuitions and
equipped with most advanced mathematical tools, bring about new break-throughs
which pose new challenging problems and also provide new insights for
mathematics. On the other hand, mathematicians, inspired and spurred by advances
in physics, make amazing progresses in mathematics, which in turn provide new
machineries for physicists. Mathematicians also make direct contributions to
physics in collaboration with physicists. The joint efforts of physicists and
mathematicians lead to major advances in our understanding of the structures of
the universe, and will ultimately uncover major new energy sources and provide
new foundations for more powerful natural computations at higher and deeper
levels. The Santa Barbara Summer Conference in Geometry is designed to make
contributions in the framework of these developments.
