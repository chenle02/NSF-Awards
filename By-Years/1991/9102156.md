This project is concerned with the theory of tree lattices and zeta functions
for lattices acting on trees. The principal investigator will explore lattices
in the automorphism group of a locally finite uniform tree. The mathematical
issues concern existence of lattices, volumes, commensurability classes, zeta
functions, and spectral theory. A lattice is a set of objects together with an
order on these objects such that any pair of objects has a greatest lower bound
and a least upper bound. Lattices have shown to be quite useful in the study of
Lie groups. In a similar spirit this project will explore lattices in the
automorphism group of certain trees. This work is of interest to many different
areas of mathematics. It also has potential applications in information theory.
