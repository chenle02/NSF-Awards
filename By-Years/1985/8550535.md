This project is a cooperative effort between the New Mexico Museum of Natural
History and the Center for Rural Education of New Mexico State University. It
brings together scientists and educators for the purpose of improving science
education in rural elementary schools. The project will develop hands-on kits
and working models on a number of related topics. Kits will use locally
available specimens, background material, scientific apparatus, and suggested
activities to teach natural science concepts. Working models such as stream
tables to demonstrate the evolution of landforms and terraria mini-environments
to demonstrate ecological relationships will be developed. Teachers' manuals
will be written and workshops offered to train teachers to properly use the
kits. Teachers will also receive training in the development of additional kits
specific to their local conditions. The materials will be designed for use with
multi-cultural populations and will build upon existing knowledge of rural
children. Activities also include the establishment of out-of-school natural
science clubs.
