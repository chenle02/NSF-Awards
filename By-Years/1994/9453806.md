9453806 Curwood The program producers at the World Media Foundation seek
$550,000 over three years to produce and present to listeners vital stories
about scientific inquiry and technological developments related to environmental
change. These presentations, entitled Living on Earth, are broadcast weekly on
more that 240 National Public Radio member stations in the United States. The
producer intends to develop the program into a one-hour format from the current
30 minute broadcast. Audience participation will be encouraged through call-in
question and answer sessions about science and ecology.
