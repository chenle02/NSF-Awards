Pressure gauges installed on the seafloor are key instruments for monitoring
tides, offshore earthquakes and tsunamis, seafloor volcanoes, and offshore oil
and gas fields. While valuable, the instruments slowly drift, which make long-
term measurements more difficult or even impossible to use. This research will
simulate seafloor pressure and temperature conditions in the laboratory, and
periodically re-calibrate the instruments to determine the drift behavior. New
sensors and methods to correct the drift in place will also be tested. The
results will improve the characterization and application of pressure
measurements for such important problems.

Pressure observations for seafloor geodesy provide important data on many
seafloor deformation processes, including volcanism and tectonic deformation.
Pressure observations are also relevant to rates of sea level rise and other
oceanographic signals. Existing pressure sensors all drift in&#8232;time
(dominated by linear and exponentially decaying functions of time), which limits
their use in the aforementioned applications to relatively short period signals
(days to months). Methods such as seafloor pressure campaign surveys and in-
situ&#8232;calibration can effectively remove the drift, but these methods are
costly and thus limited&#8232;in usage. The manufacturers of pressure gauges
have proposed new sensors and methods to address the drift issue, which are
significantly simpler and would be much less costly to implement. One approach
uses a secondary sensor to measure only sensor drift due to residual water vapor
contamination (hypothesized to be a dominant term), independent of the applied
pressure.&#8232; Another method hypothesizes that the drift rate can be measured
by comparison to a one-atmosphere low drift sensor. This research will subject
an array of existing and new sensors to simulated seafloor pressures and
temperatures over extended periods of time (4-6 months at a minimum). The
sensors will be periodically calibrated with a primary, drift free metrological
standard known as a deadweight tester. Drift determinations with the new sensors
and methods will be made, and compared to the estimates determined by primary
standard. This experiment will determine the efficacy and uncertainties of these
new methods. If these new approaches are validated, this will enable the
development of new seafloor instruments, and the ocean sciences will have access
to new methods that will benefit observations of important phenomena. In turn,
better understanding of seafloor tectonics and volcanism will improve the
assessment and response to potential geological hazards.
