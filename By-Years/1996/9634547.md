The performance of massively parallel multicomputers depends largely on their
processor management scheme. Unfortunately, the schemes employed in the current
generation of commercial multicomputers do not efficiently utilize the system
resources. Processor management is concerned with processor allocation and job
scheduling. Processor allocation also affects the interprocessor communication
latency. Researchers have addressed these issues independently of each other.
However, it is essential to evaluate the combined effect of these issues on
system performance. Thus, this project focuses on an integrated study of
processor allocation, job scheduling, and interprocessor communication. The
research objectives will be accomplished in three phases. The first phase
encompasses the design and development of efficient processor allocation and job
scheduling schemes while employing a suitable message routing algorithm for
interprocessor communication. In the second phase, the integrated effect of
allocation, scheduling, and interprocess communication on system performance is
to be studied. The third phase of the proposed research is concerned with the
experimental validation of these schemes. ***
