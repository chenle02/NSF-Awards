The Center for Undergraduate Research in Mathematics (CURM) provides funding and
training for undergraduate research courses during the academic year that are
carried out in collaboration between a two-year or community college and a
bachelor's-granting institution. Faculty members funded by CURM receive training
in inclusive and scaffolded research mentoring for early-career students,
funding to support research activities and collaboration during the academic
year, and models for institutionalizing academic year undergraduate research.
CURM also provides mentorship for developing a strong proposal to CURM for
faculty with less experience in grant writing. Intellectual merits include
contributions to research, presentations at conferences and workshops, and
publishing research papers in multiple subfields of mathematics. Broader impacts
include early exposure for students to the high impact practice of research,
increasing transfer rates for two year and community college students, and
development of strong research and research mentoring skills in mathematics
faculty across the US.

CURM addresses previously identified barriers to undergraduate research at
2-year and community colleges. Providing funding for faculty helps address high
teaching loads and lack of travel funding. Credit-bearing course-based research
opportunities help address lack of student awareness of research opportunities,
and also student workload issues. Inter-institutional communities of practice
help address lack of student awareness, lack of sense of belonging at 4-year
institutions for 2-year college students, and the short time students may be
enrolled at 2-year colleges. Finally, training for faculty in research areas
with rich selections of research projects for early career students helps
address faculty uncertainty about how to find and effectively mentor an
appropriate research project. We will offer a research immersion experience for
faculty in those research areas, including data science, graph theory,
mathematical modeling, and mathematics education. Doing so will also increase
the research expertise in participating institutions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
