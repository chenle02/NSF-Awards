Project Kilo Aina: Science of Place is a project aimed at developing
institutional infrastructure and programs that increase the number of Native
Hawaiians engaged in STEM programs, and to increase these students' educational
achievement and attainment. By combining effective STEM institutional capacity-
building strategies with culturally relevant practices that honor traditional
Hawaiian knowledge and values, the project is expected to: 1) create strong
school- and community- based pathways from K-12 to Leeward Community College
that engage Native Hawaiian students and their families in STEM fields of study
and occupations; 2) integrate indigenous and Western knowledge systems into STEM
curriculum that results in improvements to pedagogy and instructional practices
and increased undergraduate research experiences and internships; and 3) provide
a summer bridge program for incoming remedial students..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As
a result of this effort, the enrollment of STEM majors is projected to increase
from 195 to 312, with Native Hawaiian enrollment in STEM majors increasing from
35 to 77. Native Hawaiians are projected to demonstrate success rates (a 2.0 or
higher) above 70% in 8 redesigned gatekeeper courses. The Kilo Aina Summer
Bridge Program is expected to engage up to fifty students over the course of the
project. Finally, the number of Native Hawaiian STEM students graduating each
year is projected to increase from 5 to 20, while the number of Native Hawaiian
STEM majors who transfer to a 4-year degree program each year is projected to
increase from 12 to 48.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project results will contribute to
multiple areas of study such as indigenous knowledge and its intrinsic
contribution to current STEM education; the impact of indigenous knowledge
embedded in STEM curriculum on native student achievement; and the efficacy of a
culture-based curriculum embedded with math on remedial student improvement.
