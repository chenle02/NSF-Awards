In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Gutowsky of the University of Illinois at Urbana will use
high-resolution rotational spectroscopy to gain structural information of small
cluster molecules created in supersonic jet expansions. The clusters are formed
by van der Waals, electrostatic, or hydrogen bonding forces. Cluster isomers,
high-temperature species, and excited-state and high-energy conformational forms
are among the species to be studied. This work should help elucidate the
mechanism by which inter- and intramolecular forces govern the dynamics of
condensed-phase forms. %%% Cluster molecules are the intermediate species formed
when gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or solids. The study of the
structure and properties of clusters is useful in understanding such diverse
phenomena as molecular orientation and mobility on catalytic surfaces as well as
protein folding. The work supported here examines clusters formed by a number of
different forces, from very weak physical attraction to almost chemically strong
bonds.
