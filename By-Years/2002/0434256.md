A grant has been awarded to the University of Washington, under the direction of
Dr. Dennis WIllows to provide funds to replace microscopes for laboratory
investigations, and an outboard powered skiff for nearshore and intertidal
fieldwork at the Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL). The microscopes are needed to
maintain the basic research and teaching infrastructure, and the boat will
replace one that is decrepit and unusable. FHL is located at the junction of
Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits and Puget Sound, at a site of unusual
biological diversity and opportunities for coastal ocean studies. FHL supports
research from molecular and cell biology along a scale of increasing spatial
dimensions to animal behavior and community ecology. It has traditionally
encouraged innovative and cross-cutting original research by eminent scholars,
researchers, and students in a wide range of fields including zoology,
oceanography, botany, and basic biomedical sciences. With help from this
request, they hope to establish and sustain for at least 3 decades,
opportunities for research and training for students and investigators from
culturally diverse, national and international institutions in the marine
sciences.
