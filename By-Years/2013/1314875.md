We are investigating the subsurface structure of fault zones using a variety of
seismic phases: surface waves, body waves, fault zone head waves, and fault zone
trapped waves. By using a larger portion of the recorded seismic wavefield, we
should be able to better resolve the fault zone structures to which the waves
are sensitive. We use an adjoint-based tomographic inversion technique that
relies on highly accurate, three-dimensional seismic wavefield simulations. The
study has the following three components: (1) simulations of synthetic
seismograms in realistic, complex 3D fault zone models, including clarifying the
allowable ranges of geometrical and material variations that produce the
observed characteristics of recorded head and trapped waves; (2) analysis of
volumetric sensitivities of various fault zone, body, and surface phases to key
fault zone structures at depth; (3) iterative adjoint tomographic inversions for
the structures of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield and different sections of
the San Jacinto fault zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large damaging earthquakes
originate on faults kilometers below Earth's surface. A detailed
characterization of the physical setting where earthquakes nucleate and rupture
has not yet been achieved. By modeling seismic waves that are particularly
sensitive to the structures of fault zones, we can image the subsurface
structure of fault zones. The basic difficulty in imaging fault zones stems from
their multi-scale and strong variations in structure, which are evident at the
surface and within boreholes. By using accurate seismic wave propagation models,
the study will provide the most detailed description of fault zone structure
afforded by the recorded data. The project focuses on two societally relevant
fault zones in southern California.&lt;br/&gt;
