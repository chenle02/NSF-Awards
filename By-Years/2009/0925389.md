"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to
investigate a new type of amplifying coupled-resonator optical waveguide (CROW).
The CROW is to be realized in a waveguide geometry with individual resonators
formed by grating "defects". The waveguide will be fabricated on a hybrid
Si/III-V platform in which the propagating slow mode will be amplified through
the partial modal penetration into the amplifying &lt;br/&gt;III-V layers. The
project aims to fabricate a grating CROW with 100 defect resonators thus
enabling signal storage of more than 10 bits in a compact semiconductor
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Having initially
proposed and analyzed CROWs for the purpose of slow-light waveguides the authors
have come to the conclusion that the best way to realize them would be grating
defect CROWs. Compared to microring CROWs and 2D photonic crystal defect CROWs,
grating CROWs over the advantages of small resonator sizes, smaller footprint,
and easier control of the coupling coefficients.Since the major weakness of any
slow-light device is the optical attenuation due to inherent losses, the
amplifying CROW will compensate for the loss inside the structure. The key
technology of current-pumped hybrid Si/III-V waveguides will be the amplifying
platform of the proposed work. The demonstration of amplifying CROWs with 100
resonators will enable new classes of optical delay lines, buffers, and memory
elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Another aspect of the
project is to educate a diverse group of students to pursue scientific research
and to mentor them about the culture of scientific discovery. Programs such as
undergraduate thesis research, the Minority and Summer Undergraduate Research
Fellowship (MURF and SURF, respectively), enable a multicultural group of
students to participate in scientific research.
