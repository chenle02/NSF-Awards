This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a powerful
optical diagnostic for high temperature gases that is fundamentally different
from any technique currently in use. This diagnostic provides spatially
localized information, like laser-induced fluorescence, but does not require a
laser. It utilizes the optical emission from the hot luminous gases. As
explained in this proposal, the emitted light can be optically detected and
subsequently manipulated and separated into two components whose intensity
difference is due only to optical emission from a spatially localized region
within the luminous volume. More precisely, this intensity difference is due to
one spatial Fourier component of the light source distribution in the selected,
localized region. Because of prior university and SBIR development of low-
frequency devices, a high-frequency shearing interferometer emission velocimeter
(SIEVE) can be designed, fabricated, and demonstrated under SBIR funding. In
Phase I, three different ways to extend the technique to high frequencies will
be analyzed, conceptual designs for instruments will be developed, and the light
intensity requirements for each method will be calculated. A complete instrument
will be built, demonstrated, and characterized during Phase II.
