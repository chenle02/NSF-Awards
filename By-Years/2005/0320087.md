This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
define methodology to facilitate the growth of engineered cartilage tissue for
use in a multi-well culture system for drug discovery. Culture systems, which
are currently available to study the affect of potential therapeutic factors in
degenerative joint disease, are less than ideal for shedding light upon the
anabolic and catabolic processes which are taking place. The purpose of this
proposal is 1) to define culture conditions for the de novo formation of
engineered cartilage tissue, 2) to adapt the methodology for the preparation in
vitro of cartilage tissue with defined properties for use in a multi-well
culture system, and 3) to develop a system of standard operating procedures and
quality control measures for tissue production. Engineered cartilage tissue will
offer an alternative to expensive animal studies and provide the option of
utilizing human tissue. The studies outlined here will test the influence of
factors on the anabolic and catabolic aspects of cartilage matrix turnover and
cartilage matrix maturation. This work will ideally lead to an inexpensive
commercially available semi-automated cartilage culture system promoting
efficient drug discovery and efficacy and toxicology testing.

The commercial application of this project will be for use by researchers in the
field of joint and bone therapies. Major pharmaceutical companies and research
institutes (e.g. NIH) could use the cartilage culture system to identify and
test new drugs for cartilage repair and growth.
