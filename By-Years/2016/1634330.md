The present subsurface imaging process involves massive data collection, often
manual retrieval, from hundreds and thousands of sensors to a central place for
post computing. The whole process is expensive and often takes months to
complete. This I-Corps team creates a groundbreaking technology, Real-time In-
situ Subsurface Imaging (RISI), for imaging subsurface dynamics in real-time
(e.g., seconds to minutes). A RISI system can be said as a "subsurface camera
and video camera" that records the subsurface dynamics in a snap - a technology
milestone and invention to be written in the history. Such a technology can be
applied to a wide range of subsurface exploration topics such as oil/gas
exploration and production, hydrothermal, CO2 storage, mining safety, border
security and civil engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RISI
technology is a groundbreaking technology that integrates interdisciplinary
innovations on distributed computing and signal processing, geophysical imaging
and mesh networking technology. Instead of collecting data to a central server
for post-processing, the distributed data processing and computing are performed
in-situ under resource constraints. Such an approach has never been attempted
before and represents a major achievement for both earth and computer science.
In sharp contrast to present-time technology, the RISI system significantly
reduces the whole process from months/days to seconds, and its deployment and
maintenance costs are near zero, as a RISI system is autonomous, self-healing
and self-sustainable, and requires little intervention during operations. The
I-Corps program will provide insight through customer interviews of the
viability of the RISI technology in the marketplace, information regarding
desired instrument design attributes, funds for technology development, and a
transition plan for commercializing the technology. It will be a great education
and outreach experiences for faculty and students involved, and promote the
entrepreneurship in the GSU and the broader technical community of Atlanta.
