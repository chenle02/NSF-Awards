This project investigates the kinetics of the formation and destruction of
supramolecular structure in liquid crystalline polymers subjected to flow. It
studies the interrelationship between structure and flow behavior in ordered
polymeric fluids. The study will concentrate on how a polydomain structure forms
and deforms under steady shear flow. Liquid crystalline polymers is an important
class of advanced materials. The outcome of this research may suggest
nonconventional processing techniques that may enable fabrication of articles
having either anisotropic non-domain structure, or a controlled polydomain
structure.
