The Chortis block (Honduras, El Salvador and environs) is a microcontinental
block at the northwestern end of the Caribbean plate which may have been
transported east from southern Mexico during the Cenozoic opening of the Cayman
Trough. However little is known about the tectonic history of this block. This
project will gather kinematic data on Cenozoic faulting to help determine slip
directions and to infer stress regime and estimate displacements to see if
significant Cayman Trough offset is absorbed within the block. In an effort to
place age constraints on the tectonic history, U-Pb, 40Ar/39Ar and fission track
ages on granitoids and volcanic rocks will be carried out. These data will allow
testing of the hypothesis that the Chortis block originated from the truncated
southern margin of Mexico, and generally improve the understanding of the
transport of microcontinental blocks along a large offset transform fault.
