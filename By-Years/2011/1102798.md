Measurements of the solar neutrino spectrum have already yielded unexpected
results of fundamental importance and, as these measurements improve, new
results promise to be equally revealing. Neutrino oscillations, coupled with the
MSW mechanism, are required to explain the observed neutrino fluxes at Earth.
This solution allows an interesting region between vacuum- and matter-enhanced
oscillations where additional new physics can be probed. Likewise, recent solar
abundance measurements have created conflicts between the Standard Solar Model
and helioseismology results, which are most sensitively resolved by measurement
of the CNO neutrino flux. Significantly, there also remains the question whether
the luminosity of the sun, as determined by photons, accurately matches the
luminosity as determined by neutrinos. In this case, a direct measurement of the
pp neutrinos is also required. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide
funding for this group to continue their participation in the science arena of
Borexino in the underground laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy as the collaboration
focuses on measuring the Beryllium-7 neutrino flux. The group actively
participated and provided expert manpower to Borexino purification efforts.
Results from the first pass of purification have been very successful, and when
completed in the coming year, Borexino looks well poised to provide meaningful
measurements of the CNO and pep fluxes as well. Future possibilities include
measurements of the pp neutrino flux with the LENS experiment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide excellent training of, and
experience for, the students and postdocs who work in the program as well as
potential applications of these technologies outside of the field.
