9312632 Mickelson This proposal is for sponsorship of a small workshop to be
held with approximately 50-75 participants from industry, university, and
government laboratories and agencies. All participants will be involved in
optoelectronic packaging. The purpose will be to try to identify major problems
in an area loosely termed optoelectronic packaging through discussion of the
research challenges faced in advanced optoelectronic packaging as well as
methods of fostering an atmosphere in which there will be free exchange between
university and industrial researchers. Graduate students will be encouraged to
attend the workshop by travel supports. Such non-classroom education will
enhance students' experiences through group discussions and poster exchanges.
