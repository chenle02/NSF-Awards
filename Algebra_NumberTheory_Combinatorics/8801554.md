This research is concerned with the representation theory of algebras. The
principal investigator will examine the homological properties of the class of
Artin algebras by examining the relationship between certain exact sequences and
the homomorphisms of one module into another. In addition, the structure of
projective resolutions of modules over Artinian rings will be studied. It has
been shown that a resolution for an arbitrary finitely generated simple module
over an Artin algebra, finite dimensional over an algegraically closed field,
can be obtained algorithmically. This approach will be extended to more general
situations.
