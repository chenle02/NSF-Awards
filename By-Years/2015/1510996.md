#1510996&lt;br/&gt;Law, Chung K. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Princeton
Summer School is to provide the next generation of combustion researchers and
graduate students with a comprehensive knowledge in the technical areas of
combustion theory, chemistry, experiment, computation and applications. For the
past five years, each summer school session has offered several daily morning
and afternoon three-hour lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five days.
The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion
chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses such as engine
combustion and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants has been
uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The proposed
support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to offset part of
the cost for travel and lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2015 Princeton-
CEFRC Summer School on Combustion. The "camp" environment provides ample
opportunities for students to interact intimately with established researchers
as well as among themselves. Such a learning opportunity is usually not offerred
on a campus and should help to develop the next-generation leader in combustion
research and applications fields for the nation.
