The research will involve computational studies of the collisions of slow atoms
and ions with stepped nanostructured metal and insulator surfaces. Time-
dependent wavepacket propagation methods are used to carry out numerical
solutions of the Schroedinger equation. Semi-empirical parametrized surfaces,
adjusted to reproduce band gaps, surface states and ionization potentials are
used to represent the interactions of the incident particles and the surface.
