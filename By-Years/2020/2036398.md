The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project seeks to develop a novel on-board sensor for detecting oxides of
nitrogen (NOx) in diesel exhaust streams with a sensitivity and specificity
unmet by existing technologies. Diesel engine manufacturers currently cannot
accurately precisely control their exhaust systems due to the lack of
appropriate cost-effective sensors capable of differentiating between NOx and
other species in the exhaust stream. The proposed sensor can result in 10% fuel
efficiency improvements. Use of this sensor at scale will lead to reduced carbon
emissions and healthier air with lower amounts of NOx-induced smog, ground-level
ozone, and acid rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project is based on a novel application of laser-absorption spectroscopy, which
probes the unique spectral absorption fingerprint of NOx species to avoid cross-
species interference. This sensor is projected to achieve tenfold lower
detection thresholds than current widely deployed electrochemical sensors in the
harsh high-temperature particulate-laden diesel exhaust environments in a form
factor similar to those of existing diesel aftertreatment systems. This Phase I
research will leverage novel manufacturing techniques to fabricate and
demonstrate the performance of a high-sensitivity laser-based sensor capable of
surviving high-temperature, oxidizing, intensely vibrating, and particulate-
laden flows characteristic of vehicle exhaust gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
