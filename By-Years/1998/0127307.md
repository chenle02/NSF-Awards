Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Chemical Process (CCPS) of
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) has established an industrial
need to help Chemical Engineering Departments in the nation add an element of
safety to the core courses in their curriculum. In addition our team has
reviewed the accident history of the chemical process industry and has found
that the number of major accidents continues to rise every year. The sad
consequences for our society are deaths, injuries, and environmental damage.
Unfortunately only a fraction of our practicing engineers have the appropriate
safety culture and exposure to key safety concepts to impact this negative
performance. To overcome these problems we have identified key ideas and
effective pedagogical techniques to help professors teach a number of these. Our
effort has been to overcome this lack of safety training in core course covering
chemical processing. The courses we will address are Mass and Energy Balances,
Kinetics, and Plant Design and Economics. We have created two one half hour
lectures as well as exercises in a modular format for each course using
different teaching methodologies. We have assessed the effectiveness of these
materials and our approach and have made numerous changes. To help with
dissemination of our course materials and modules we are working cooperatively
with member of the Center for Chemical Process (CCPS) of the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). We are also working with our publisher SACHE to
present our materials in their newsletters, web site, and through their
workshops. &lt;br/&gt;
