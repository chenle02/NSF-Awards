The object of this proposal is to explore the efficiency of a three-dimensional
finite element implementation modeling of the consolidation process on a 386/486
microcomputer. Such a model is urgently needed to support the recent
developments in Automated Data Acquisition procedures, and to comprehend the
delicate balance of the internal forces/mechanisms during the evolution of
physical phenomena such as consolidation process that lead to soil
instabilities.
