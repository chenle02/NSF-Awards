The proposal concerns interactions between ergodic theory and the study of
infinite groups. This includes the use of ergodic theoretic concepts, in
particular a revised notion of group boundaries, for the study of superrigidity
phenomena for various groups. In another direction, it is suggested to use group
actions imbedding in certain classical dynamical systems to prove simplicity of
the Lyapunov spectrum - an important quantitative characteristic of chaotic
behavior of a system. Additional problems in "measured group theory" are
proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will continue to explore
many of the surprising connections between Algebra, Geometry and Dynamics. Part
of the proposal describes ways in which some implicit symmetries of certain
dynamical systems yield rigidity of groups. In the other direction, presence of
groups with certain properties, is conjectured to yield certain dynamical
properties.
