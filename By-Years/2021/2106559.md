Artificial intelligence is becoming an integral part of society, and is poised
to affect increasingly many aspects of life. Like any other software,
artificial-intelligence applications can have errors with potentially serious
consequences. As a result, improving the quality of artificial-intelligence
software is a critical challenge. One promising technology for addressing this
challenge is the use of probabilistic programming languages, which let
programmers implement artificial-intelligence applications in a simpler and
safer way. The focus of this project is to develop techniques and tools to
transform probabilistic programs into code executable on a computer. More
specifically, the aim is to understand how to make such tools free of errors
while being as efficient as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops
a verified compiler and runtime for the Stan probabilistic programming language.
The compiler is developed in the Coq proof assistant, and connects to CompCert,
an existing verified compiler for C programs. Programs written in Stan will be
compiled to CompCert C through a succession of transformations, each of which
handles a specific feature of Stan. These program transformations are specific
to probabilistic programming languages, and include truncating distributions and
re-parameterizing to support constraints on random variables. The runtime
implements a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that uses the compiled program
to perform inference. The formal proof defines the semantics of the Stan program
as a probability measure and shows that the compiled program asymptotically
generates samples from this measure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
