9451220 Gupta Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) produces extremely high resolution
image of a specimen surface that is quantitative in three dimensions. The image
is precise enough to examine grain boundaries, quantify surface roughness,
measure microstructural defects, provide surface profile, and even visualize the
atomic configuration of the specimen surface. SPM is now a routine microscopy
tool used for metrology and extremely high-resolution profilometry. Since
scanning probe microscopes are commercially available with mature inexpensive
technology, this proposal requests matching support from NSF for the equipment
to introduce students in Mechanical and Microelectronic Engineering programs to
scanning probe microscopy in a significant way. Students will use the equipment
in a number of required courses, and in senior design/seminar/research projects
involving open-ended problems. With the equipment, students will be able to
visualize atomic configuration at material surfaces, understand fundamental
relationships between bulk material properties and size-scale, see sub-
microscopic structures in detail, and quantitatively characterize effects
microelectronic processes have on material surfaces during integrated circuit
fabrication. Microelectronic engineers and mechanical engineers working together
to design and build prototypes of micro-electromechanical systems will also be
able to characterize their prototypes with the SPM equipment.
