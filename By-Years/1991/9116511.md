The award will cover participation of this group of individuals in studying the
physics of the particle responsible for the weak interaction - the Z0. The
machine called LEP at CERN in Europe which makes Z0's has been running now for
almost three years, and this group were responsible for building an important
component of the spectrometer called L3 which is used in the detection of the Z0
decay products. These decays reveal details of the theoretical "standard model"
for the interactions of nature (including the weak interaction) with great
precision. The same group also plans to participate in the design and
construction of a future detector to be used at the SSC accelerator which should
be operational in the next decade, and which should provide clues to questions
for which the standard model has no answers. Such preparations are necessary at
this time, given the large scale of the SSC project.
