The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore
translation of a sensor for better diagnostics and therapeutics. The proposed
technology can be created at low cost, enabling an instrument that integrates
parallel sensors for a high-throughput system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project explores applications for the Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor
(IRIS), a label-free detection (LFD) system. The proposed system uses optical
biosensors in multiplexed imaging detection of molecular binding kinetics on Si-
based microfluidic chips as low-cost consumables. Hundreds of capture probes can
be arrayed on the IRIS chip and tested against a target molecule in parallel.
The proposed system addresses needs for multiplexed and robust small molecule
affinity measurements, which can enable the discovery of new ligands for
detection and monitoring of small molecules for compact
sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
