9310518 Espy-Wilson This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to
investigate speaker variability and a feature-based approach to speech
recognition. The speaker variability study builds from current knowledge to
consideration of a spontaneous speech database with the purpose of
categorization and modelling for recognition purposes. It is anticipated that
systematic variability will show in this study and that it may be possible to
represent it within the lexical representation of words, easing requirements for
training of recognition systems. The representation of phenomena such as
lenition provides an example of the more general possible agreement between a
lexical item and its possible acoustic realizations. A study of speech features
in relational terms is carried out to search for sources that may decrease
variability and to disclose the remaining, hopefully fewer, factors that may be
central to their correlates in order to facilitate feature-based recognition.
