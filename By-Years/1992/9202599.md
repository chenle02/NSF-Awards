This is an ongoing theoretical study of the dynamics of mid- ocean ridges. A
range of modeling studies will test existing hypothesis, explore new ones based
on existing observations, and make predictions that will suggest new
observations. The primary emphasis will be on spreading center structure and
segmentation as well as the exisodic nature of the spreading. Specific tasks
will be studies of convection generated by composional and thermal buoyancy, 3-D
modeling of melt migration, the evolution of ridge geometry, the mechanical
factors that control the spacing, dip, and displacement of ridge-parallel normal
faults, the importance of strain-rate dependence of viscosity, and an extension
of existing of existing 2-D models of the formation of the median valley to
three dimensions.
