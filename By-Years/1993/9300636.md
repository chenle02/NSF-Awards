The University of Michigan will operate R/V LAURENTIAN during 1993 as a general
oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The LAURENTIAN
is a 80' general research vessel constructed in 1974. It is owned by the
University of Michigan. The ship is scheduled for 84 operating days in 1993, of
which 74 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The ship operates
primarily in the Great Lakes. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the
National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship much be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institution around the country. The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the
work proposed. The program considers the ship important part of the fleet due to
its location. The Laurentian is the only UNOLS vessel hat operates in the Great
Lakes, and the University of Michigan should be encouraged to improve usage of
the vessel.
