Dr. Harte will evaluate the feasibility of a novel approach to field
manipulations for investigating the ecological consequences of global warming.
The approach uses an array of infrared radiators suspended three meters above
the ground. This provides a relatively simple, reliable, and realistic way to
simulate additional surface warming in-situ. Field trials of the procedure will
be conducted in replicated experimental and control plots in undisturbed montane
grasslands at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Colorado.
Additional infrared flux is designed to produce a nearly uniform soil
temperature rise over the experimental plots that is commensurate with that
predicted by general circulation models for the gird in which the site is
located. Dr. Harte is an expert in the area of ecology, biological conservation,
and causes and consequences of climate change. The facilities for this research
are outstanding.
