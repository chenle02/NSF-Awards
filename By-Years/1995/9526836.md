9526836 Wolfenstine An exploratory research program is proposed to investigate
the possibility of using the unprecedented method of ingot processing
(thermomechanical working of the as-cast material) as an alternative to the more
conventional powder processing route for achieving fine-structure
superplasticity in two-phase structural ceramics which will eliminate the
problems generally occur in the conventional powder processing route; these
include (I) the consolidated powders do not always attain full density and (ii)
during processing the powders impurities and unwanted phases are unavoidable.
Magnesium alumnate and magnesium oxide system will be attempts to prepare
superplastic two phase structural ceramics. Research, if successful, will
demonstrate the first time such superplastic concepts in ceramics. %%% The goal
of this research is to explore the unprecedented method of ingot processing for
achieving fine structure superplasticity in two phase structural ceramics.
