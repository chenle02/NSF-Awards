This Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM) project will examine
two experiments designed to test models of social learning, which are the
foundations of cultural evolution. These will examine conformity in five person
groups with changing environmental parameters over time. The project will create
a computer laboratory with local area networks to demonstrate how experiments
can be used to test the theoretical underpinnings of models of cultural
evolution. Subjects will be organized into five-person groups run simultaneously
in the computer laboratory. Each subject will have to choose between two
behavioral options, providing different payoffs, to be paid in real dollars at
the end of the experiment. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work pertain
to the fact that rapid social, economic, political and technological changes are
occurring in the majority of society in the world, and increases in our basic
knowledge of these processes will be valuable to decision makers as well as to
the educated person concerned to understand contemporary life.
