The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This
award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Daniel N.
Leszkiewicz to work with Dr. Stuart Cull-Candy at University College London in
the United Kingdom.

The NMDA receptor is a subtype of glutamate receptor which is an ion channel
closely involved in synaptic processes associated with learning and memory. The
goal of this project is to study the role of NMDA receptors in synaptic
transmission by examining the subunit composition of these receptors and how
they shape synaptic responses in the cerebellum. Specifically, NR1 and NR2
subunits will be characterized with regard to their biophysical and modulatory
influences on synaptic transmission. A successful outcome of these experiment
will fill gaps in our knowledge of NR2 subunit heterogeneity, distribution,
kinetic properties, and how these factors play a role in determining NMDA
excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).
