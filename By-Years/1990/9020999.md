This project represents the continuation of research begun as a pilot study in
which the application of a new mathematical technique, known as the contour
dynamics method, to the study of atmospheric dynamics was investigated. The
initial results of that study are sufficiently promising to warrant continuing
the research. The project involves a collaboration between Dr. Lorenzo Polvani
of Columbia University and Dr. Alan Plumb of MIT (who is funded under
ATM-9015367). The contour dynamics method provides a means to resolve fine
structure of fields at relatively low computational expense. This is
particularly useful for studies of the behavior of the stratospheric polar
vortex. Disturbances to this vortex, in the form of upwardly propogating large-
scale waves, often result in the breaking off from the main vortex of filaments
and secondary vortices; this air then mixes into the middle latitude regions,
affecting the overall circulation of the stratosphere. This study will attempt
to better define the nonlinear dynamical processes involved. The Principal
Investigators also hope to begin exploring the dynamics of synoptic-scale eddies
in the troposphere using the same techniques.
