Nickel-containing superoxide dismutases (NiSODs) represent a completely novel
mechanism for the elimination of superoxide in biological systems. The proposed
project uses an interdisciplinary approach to explore the structure and function
of NiSODs found in Streptomyces species, an organism that is responsible for
many of the antibiotics currently available to medicine. Single crystal x-ray
diffraction, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry will be used to examine structural aspects of NiSOD. These
techniques will characterize the overall structure of the protein, determine the
structure of the metal site and the dioxygen species present in various forms of
the enzyme (including potential reaction intermediates or inhibitor complexes),
and help to elucidate the role of quaternary structure in the function of the
enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis techniques and kinetic measurements will be
used to test the role of specific amino acid residues in the structure of the
catalytic site, with the effect of mutation monitored by measurement of the
catalytic rate constant. Kinetic methods will also be used to examine the role
of quaternary structure and an unusual product inhibition that is associated
with peroxide in NiSOD.

Broader Impact: The proposed research also provides a significant training
opportunity for students at all levels (undergraduate through post-doctoral) at
the interface of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry. Students will benefit
from the association with a Chemistry-Biology Interface training program on
campus, collaborations with scientists at other institutions in the U.S, and
from a NSF-funded exchange program with a laboratory in Hungary. Students will
be exposed to a number of techniques and concepts from both biochemistry and
inorganic chemistry. Students will be drawn from a diverse pool, and effort will
be made to provide opportunities for minorities.

This project is funded jointly by Molecular Biochemistry and Inorganic,
Bioinorganic & Organometallic Chemistry Program.
