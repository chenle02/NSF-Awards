Biological time keeping is a fundamental property of living systems. In
mammals, these daily physiological and behavioral events, such as sleep/wake
cycle, temperature and hormone levels, are regulated by an internal clock
located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. A fundamental
question is how this neural clock modulates overt rhythmicity in response to
input signals, such as light. Recently, Dr. Lynch reported the daily pattern of
neuronal activity can be altered by changing exposure to light to resemble that
of winter months. These data are very exciting because they suggest that this
neural clock is a flexible, integrative structure and not "hard-wired" with
regard to time. Using an in vitro preparation and neurophysiological recordings,
Dr. Lynch will now determine if the photoperiod-specific pattern is linked to
daylength per se, or to the action of light at a particular circadian phase.
Moreover, he will determine how hormone factors, especially melatonin, modulate
both the firing pattern within the suprachiasmatic nucleus and changes in daily
behavior (sleep/wake cycle). Melatonin, a hormone of the pineal gland, is an
ideal candidate since it is strongly linked to the control of circadian rhythms.
This research will significantly enhance our understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying circadian and photoperiodic events and has important
ramifications about the plasticity of the neuronal pacemaker. Findings ways to
influence the neural clock may lead to improved treatments for people with
sleeping disorders and problems caused by jet lag and shift work.
