9319934 Saladin Several experimental investigations on the behavior of nuclei at
high angular velocity (i.e. high spin) are proposed. The interest in such
studies lies in the fact that, as the angular velocity of a nucleus is
increased, its internal structure changes due to the influence of the coriolis
and centrifugal interaction. The proposed experimental program will be carried
out with the Pitt array at Notre Dame, the Pitt-FSU array at FSU and at
Gammasphere. In the A=70 to 80 region a search for theoretically predicted
superdeformed bands is proposed. It is furthermore proposed to study odd A
nuclei in the A=70 to 90 region and in particular the odd-odd nucleus Br- 78. A
series of lifetime studies on Ac-219 by means of DSAM and the plunger method are
proposed. A series of experiments are proposed. which are based on conversion
electron spectroscopy which can provide crucial information on the multipolarity
of transitions. Specifically it is proposed to study the origin of "surplus"
electrons that were observed by the Pitt group in Ce- 130. Experiments are
planned in neighboring nuclei in the A=130 nuclei and for different target and
projectile combinations. It is furthermore proposed to confirm the M1-character
of the recently found so-called M1-bands in the light Hg and Pb region.
