The proposed multidisciplinary graphics design laboratory (MGDL), provides
terminal-based, interactive instruction in courses of five academic departments:
Industrial, Electrical, Mechanical, Biomedical and Engineering Core. The
facility includes ten high-resolution workstations, and twenty-five medium-
resolution terminals, networked to a Digital Equipment Corporation, VAX 4000
central computer, with its supporting disc memory and interconnect peripherals.
The applications software chosen for the MGDL provides advanced analysis,
design, and graphic visualization capability and has the greatest impact on the
upper level, design course instruction, and on the special senior
research/design program. The MGDL's capabilities are also used to assist high
school teachers in upgrading their technical skills and knowledge of modern
engineering laboratories and educational methods.
