The project of Professor James Haw of the University of Southern California,
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks to achieve a
fundamental understanding of the catalytic reactions that occur on zeolites and
solid acid catalysts. A special pulse quench catalytic reactor has been designed
that allows the investigation of catalytic reactions by nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometry. Changes in chemical intermediates can be followed with
this device with a time resolution of 0.2 s; reactions are quenched by rapid
cooling or by the introduction of inhibiting reagents. Theoretical calculations
are also used to model the experimental NMR results via calculated NMR chemical
shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants. Two specific examples of catalytic
systems to be studied in this project include the synthesis of pyridine and
butene isomerization, both are processes which are catalyzed by zeolites.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry is used to study
the catalytic transformation of simple adsorbed gases into more complex
molecules on zeolites and solid acids. Professor James Haw at the University of
Southern California has developed a combination of chemical reaction system with
quenching that allows complex catalytic systems to be studied. The new
analytical method will be used to study the industrially important projects of
pyridine synthesis and the isomerization of butene, a precursor to synthetic
rubber.&lt;br/&gt;
