I/UCRC for Visual and Decision Informatics (CVDI) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1160958
University of Louisiana at Lafayette; Raghavan &lt;br/&gt;1160960 Drexel
University; Hu &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Visual Decision Informatics
(CVDI) will develop new visual and analytic methods that leverage modern
computer hardware and software, and develop analysis and discovery tools that
can be applied to complex data-based decision-making process. The University of
Louisiana at Lafayette (UL) and Drexel University (DU) are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with UL as the lead institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will bring together analytic, visual,
and perceptual techniques in order to support decision makers in industry and
government by advancing the state-of-the-art in the research fields of
Information, Visualization, Visual Analytics, and Automated Analysis. The
proposed center's research agenda will be driven by the applications of
information integration and decision support systems, 3D content creation and
management in decision informatics, immersive visualizations, and human computer
interaction technologies for training and education of workforce. To ensure that
the research activities are transformative, software prototypes and frameworks
developed through research will be tested in several application contexts by
close collaboration with industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
center activities will enhance the international competitiveness of the American
industry in the problems and opportunities of leveraging data for evidence-based
decision support. The center will help its potential members achieve higher
productivity gains through the adopted data-driven decision making process, and
will also impact the broader American industry through the publication and
dissemination of the center's research results. Both universities are committed
to including underrepresented groups and have active plans for addressing
diversity. The center also intends to promote, catalyze, and accelerate the
commercialization of technology innovations.
