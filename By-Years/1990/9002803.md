The investigators will continue development of new analytic approaches to
homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation in several important areas of applied
dynamical systems. In particular, they will continue development of a new
bifurcation function approach to periodic and aperiodic solutions near
homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles. They will to continue development of
a unified theory of interior layers of singular perturbation problems using
heteroclinic bifurcation techniques and a version of the shadowing lemma. They
will continue working with shock wave solutions of nonstrictly hyperbolic PDE's
and PDE's that change type using heteroclinic bifurcation techniques. They will
extend a new rigorous algorithm for numerical continuation of homoclinic and
heteroclinic orbits to include continuation to the point where an equilibrium
becomes nonhyperbolic. Finally, they will investigate nonhomogeneous solutions
of reaction-diffusion equations near spatially homogeneous solutions represented
by homoclinic orbits or heteroclinic cycles of an ODE.
