In this project academically-talented, financially needy graduate students in
the geological and geophysical sciences are pursuing the study of Continental
Margins Oceanography (CMO). The project's intellectual merit rests in part on
the increasing social and scientific importance of research on continental
margin processes given the recognition that both human activities and natural
environmental processes are having a profound effect on the continental margins
from the coastline to offshore areas. The multi-national exploration for oil and
gas reserves makes these regions even more environmentally, socially, and
economically important and is increasing the demand for capable scientists with
appropriate expertise. Three CMO scholar cohorts are being recruited primarily
from Texas universities and colleges where the population of students with
financial need is large and there are high populations of students from
historically underrepresented groups, particularly in the sciences. Academic and
social support networks are available both at the department level and
university-wide. In addition, through the institution's Career Center, CMO
scholars connect with companies and organizations recruiting masters and
doctoral students in each scholar's specialty. The project's broader impacts are
being felt through targeted recruiting efforts that are bringing academically-
talented, financially needy students into areas of high national need with
impact on society and the economy as alluded to above.
