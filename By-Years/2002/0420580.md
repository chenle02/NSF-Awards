This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a transmission
electron microscope (TEM) and charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to be housed in
a multi-user microscopy facility at the Storrs campus of the University of
Connecticut. This purchase will ensure continued TEM availability and provide
new capabilities to enhance and expand both research and research training. The
instrument will be used in research projects of at least eleven investigators.
The expertise of the major user group ranges from evolutionary biology to
materials science; all are currently using the TEM to address questions at the
cutting edge of their fields. The group includes both senior investigators with
well-established programs and junior faculty depending on TEM for their career
development. Research projects include: (1) fundamental aspects of the way cells
in the brain communicate, (2) systematics and evolutionary diversity amongst
parasitic flatworms, (3) interactions between proteins that are responsible for
contraction in muscle cells, (4) design of new materials to be used in
semiconductors, ceramics, batteries and fuel cells, (5) salt resistant plant
studies, (6) clearance of chemical contaminants from the brain, (7) sporulation
and cellulose degradation in bacteria, and (8) pathogen-host interactions.
Demonstrations of TEM principals and practice are a regular part of a number of
existing courses for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. The new
instrument will allow larger groups to be accommodated, increasing the number of
courses that can benefit from these demonstrations, and will allow more
effective instruction in TEM methodology.
