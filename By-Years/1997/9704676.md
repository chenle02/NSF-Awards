9704676 Farquhar The P.I. will study oxygen isotopes in carbonate minerals
present in the SNC (Shergotite, Nakhlite, Chassigny) meteorites. This research
will use the proportions of the three stable isotopes of oxygen to study the
nature of atmosphere-regolith interactions on Mars. It will address current
questions about the amount of oxygen isotope exchange that these meteorites have
had with the terrestrial reservoir. It will be used to provide evidence that
will support one of two models for the formation of the Martian atmosphere. It
will be used to provide indirect evidence for the timing and duration of
hydrothermal events that contributed to the growth of SNC carbonates. Finally,
this research will refine three isotope measurements of carbonate oxygen so that
sample size can be reduced and this tool can be extended to other questions.
