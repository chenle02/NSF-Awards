Smyth/Abstract ATM-9616766 I propose to investigate the stability of properties
of barotropic, cirucular vortices in a stratified, rotating environment. This
work will extend the results of Gent & McWilliams (1986) beyond the
quasigeostrophic regime. I will document the transition between scale-selective
instability in the quasigeostrophic regime and the castastrophic transitions to
turbulence which characterizes the unstratified, non-rotating case. A number of
vortex stability characteristics will be sought. THe proposed project is modest
in scale, but should provide useful information to the geophysical fluid
dynamics community, particularly with reference to the evolution of hurricanes
and tropical cyclones.
