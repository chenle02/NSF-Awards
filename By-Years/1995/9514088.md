Abstract Adkins-Regan 9514088 The goal of the proposed research is to analyze
developmental processes leading to adult mate choice and mate preferences,
especially preferences that are sexually dimorphic (different in males and
females). The project will focus on a particularly robust and widespread aspect
of mate choice, preference for opposite-sex partners (sexual partner
preference), and a species well-suited to the goal, the zebra finches treated
with estrogen during the first two weeks posthatch and housed in an all-female
zebra finches treated with estrogen during the first two weeks posthatch and
housed in an all-female environment from 40 days (independence from the
parents)to 100 days (young adulthood) then prefer to pair with other females. In
order to address important questions raised by this discovery, a series of
experiments will be conducted in which annals are exposed to different hormonal
or social environment manipulations during development and then tested for
sexual partner preference--organizational effects of hormones produce early in
development, and sexual imprinting--and will elucidate the manner in which
hormonal and experiential influences interact during development. This work will
advance our understanding of mate choice and of reproductive behavior
development.
