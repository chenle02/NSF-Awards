The proposed research addresses the current stagnation in N- gram language
modeling by developing a set of principled techniques by which higher level
structure can be applied to the problem of language modeling. These techniques
include trans-finite-state probabilistic grammar formalisms (probabilistic
feature grammars and tree-insertion grammars) that are both practical and
lexically sensitive, and similarity-based methods that address data sparsity
problem for large-N models directly. A novel technique of multi- pass parsing
has potential utility in addressing some of the practical computational issues
that arise in using such models. This promising combination of techniques ---
lexicalized grammar formalisms and the multi-pass parsing method to make them
practical, along with similarity-based estimation to aid in solving data
sparsity problems --- has the potential to improve language modeling beyond the
asymptote that it has reached, with applications in improving speech
recognition, information retrieval, and many other language-processing
applications.
