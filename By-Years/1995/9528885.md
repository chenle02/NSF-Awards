9528885 Grindlay A high-resolution bathymetric and geophysical investigation of
a 2,000 km-long portion of the ultra-slow spreading Southwest Indian Ridge will
be conducted. The investigation is designed to establish the characteristic
morphologic, gravimetric and magnetic segmentation of the straight portion of
the ridge from 15 east to 25 east and then study how this character changes in
the fracture zone complex between 25 east and 35 east. ***
