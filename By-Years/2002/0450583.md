This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project
involves an innovative gas sensor (DiskFET) based on a commercially available
hard drive mechanism, proprietary polymers for sensing, and a modified Field
Effect Transistor (FET). The device as envisioned is small, handheld,
lightweight, low power, and applicable to a diverse range of chemical sensing
fields. The DiskFET operates by applying an electric field between a polymer
coated rotating disk and stationary FET, which is "floating" a fixed distance
above the disk surface, the field strength will be affected by the interactions
of the analyte with the polymer coating on the disk. This change in field
strength is measured by the FET. By combining the signal responses of all of
these relatively non-specific sensors, a "fingerprint" for the analyte is
constructed. Using Artificial Neural Network analysis, the concentration and
identity of the analyte can be recognized based on a database of the sensor
response characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personal safety and air quality
monitoring is on the rise. More and more workers are becoming conscious of the
dangers of their work environments and are demanding adequate monitoring
technologies as evidenced by the long-term, steady increase in chemical detector
sales. This device will be used for the detection of chemicals such as Ammonia
and VOC's with detection limits below current OSHA accepted levels.&lt;br/&gt;
