The detection of moving objects in the environment is important for a broad
range of tasks involving activities such as locomotion, manipulation, and
description. This proposal describes a line of research aimed at studying
vision-based techniques for recognizing the presence of moving objects in the
field of view. The solutions must have broad generality and good reliability;
the analysis specifically deals with problems associated with moving-object
detection when the camera may also be moving. In the latter case, moving and
stationary objects may both be changing position with respect to the camera,
generating visual motion in the imagery. Significant preliminary work has been
completed on the problem. The proposed work would build on the prior results by
addressing three problems that are central to the development of a general
understanding of detection of moving objects: (1) how can depth information be
combined with visual motion? (2) can existing structure-from-motion algorithms
be extended to include the detection of motion while avoiding problems with
numerical instability? (3) can detectability thresholds be computed based on
magnitudes of relative motion and noise, and how do various simplifying
assumptions affect those thresholds?
