The goal of this project is to continue a very successful program of monitoring
the 15 GHz flux densities of blazars and radio galaxies on the 40m radio
telescope at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. Blazars are highly luminous and
highly active sources of radio, optical, x-ray, and &amp;#947;-ray radiation
powered by massive black holes in galactic nuclei. By comparing the radio light
curves with simultaneous &amp;#947;-ray light curves from NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope the project will help to elucidate the emission mechanisms,
energy sources, and jet collimation processes in these objects. In particular,
measurement of time-delays between radio and &amp;#947;-ray flares can tie down
the location of the radiation sources and determine whether they are associated
with the jets or accretion disks around the black
holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students. The awardees will continue their
educational outreach program in collaboration with colleagues at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and with the Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope and
the Lewis Center for Educational Research to bring teachers from US and
international schools to California to learn astronomy and modern scientific
methods via hands-on experience with radio telescopes. The teachers will take
their knowledge and tools back to their schools and apply them in high-school
teaching programs.
