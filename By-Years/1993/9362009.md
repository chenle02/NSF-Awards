9362009 Murphy Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs), subsea robots and other
instrumented and remotely operated systems for marine applications require a
power source which is as efficient as possible to give long range or extended
use times. The obvious choice is an electrochemical unit of fuel cell type.
Conventional fuel cells require hydrogen fuel, and they normally use molecular
oxygen as oxidant. Aboard an AUV, for instance, these materials would be
expected to be carried as cryogenic liquids, as in a space-craft. This presents
several practical problems, among which are the difficulties of storage, safety
and handling, and buoyancy problems aboard the AUV as they are consumed. This
program examines alternative fuel and oxidant combinations for use in an
electrochemical fuel cell power system. The objective is to explore the
possibility of fuel- oxidant combinations with a specific energy which is an
improvement on cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen, but also to determine whether such
combinations have advantages in regard to their practical specific volume
including any additional volume on board which may be required for displacement
corrections during propellant depletion.
