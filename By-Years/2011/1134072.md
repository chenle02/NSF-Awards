This project supports travel expenses for participants at the workshop on
advances in language and vision. In the past few years, great progress has been
made in the fields of language and computer vision in developing technologies of
extracting semantic content from text and imagery respectively. Each field has
desires to adapt methods from the other, but often looking to the past
literature rather than the current state of the art. This workshop makes
significant scientific progress in multimodal representations and methods by
bringing together the top researchers in both fields. The well organized
brainstorming and discussion sessions contribute new ideas to this emerging
area. The outcome of the workshop provides some guidelines for targeted research
in this interdisciplinary area, including anticipated fundamental scientific
advances, possible large-scale challenge problems, the needs and prospects for
available datasets, and connections to significant applications and their
associated long-term economic impact and other societal benefits.
