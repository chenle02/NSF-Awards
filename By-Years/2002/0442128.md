This award supports participants in a two-day symposium on machine learning for
anomaly detection to be held at Stanford University on May 22-23, 2004. The
purpose of the symposium is to bring together researchers, students, and
industrial practitioners from different application areas and let them report
their recent results and discuss common concerns. A central aspect of the
symposium are eleven invited talks given by established researchers whose work
provides a good sampling of research using machine learning methods to detect
anomalies across a variety of domains. The symposium fosters improved research
in anomaly detection by exposing attendees to ideas from other fields,
encouraging interaction and collaboration, and helping to identify common open
problems. Dissemination plans include developing a website
(http://cll.stanford.edu/symposia/anomaly/) with the speakers talks and relevant
papers available for download, preparing a workshop report, and organizing a
special journal issue devoted to machine learning approaches to anomaly
detection. Finally, the symposium will contribute to increased understanding of
methods for anomaly detection, which is becoming important in many areas such as
public health monitoring, computer network security, and accounting fraud
detection. &lt;br/&gt;
