Despite recent advances in the understanding of processes leading to
Lagerstatten formation, many important Lagerstatten have yet to be studied from
a combined taphonomic, sedimentologic, stratigraphic, paleoecologic, and
geochemical perspective, all of which lead to understanding of how Lagerstatten
form. Understanding preservational processes in these exceptional deposits is
important because: 1) taphonomic processes controlled preservational biases, 2)
understanding preservational processes will lead to better understanding of the
depositional environments that ultimately exerted ecological control on the
suite of organisms available for preservation, and 3) secular variations in
taphonomic processes could influence perceived evolutionary patterns. Although
most Carboniferous Lagerstatten occur in laminated mud-sized sediment, they may
represent a range of depositional environments and paleoecologies. To this end,
this is a study of five well-known Carboniferous Lagerstatten in North America:
Bear Gulch Limestone (Chesterian, Montana), Mecca Quarry Shale (Desmoinesian,
Indiana), Hamilton and Garnett localities (Virgilian, Kansas), and Kinney Brick
Company Quarry (Virgilian, New Mexico). A multidisciplinary approach using
stratigraphy, sedimentology, taphonomy, paleoecology, and geochemistry will be
used to distinguish among four models of Lagerstatten formation: 1) tidal
sedimentation, 2) deposition in euxinic, stratified basin, 3) production of in-
situ cyanobacterial mats, and 4) storm-bed deposition.//
