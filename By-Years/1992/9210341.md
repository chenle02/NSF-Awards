The goal of this project is the development of an algorithm for real-time
adaptive control of drug delivery based on sparse measurements of a patient's
responses. It will involve recursive Bayesian parameter estimation, forecasting
the expected performance of adaptive control, and the determination of an
appropriate sampling schedule. The algorithm will be validated using Monte Carlo
simulations of adaptive control based on sparse measurements for several
representative clinical applications. This research is important since it could
form the basis for new, innovative drug delivery technology that will offer
significant advantages over current technology. This system should allow patient
response to be controlled more accurately than with model based open-loop
control.
