Math libraries are an important part of programming environments that support
the development of application software. While broadly available on sequential
computers, math libraries are rare for parallel computers - especially in the
case of distributed computing across networks of workstations. This project is
to conduct research leading to a portable version of the LAPACK library for
network distributed computers. LAPACK was selected since it is probably the most
important math library in use today. The key research issues to resolve in this
project are to find data decompositions and algorithms that support efficient
execution with the coarse granularities found on networks of workstations. These
results will be analyzed as part of the feasibility study. They will form the
basis of the work plan for implementing the library for the Phase II proposal
that would follow.
