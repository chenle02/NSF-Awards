The Department of Civil Engineering at the Kansas City engineering program of
the University of Missouri will purchase computing equipment which will be
dedicated to support research in computational aspect of geo-modelling,
micromechanics of materials, and computer aided design in structures and
geomechanics. The equipment will be specifically used in: 1. Large scale
simulation in particulate mechanics; 2. Methodologies for design and performance
prediction; 3. Thermal stratification problems of fossil units.
