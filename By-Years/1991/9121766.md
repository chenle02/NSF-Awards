Fundamental research to investigate the thermodynamic, kinetic and
morphological stabilities of metal contacts to indium phosphide and to correlate
the electrical behavior of selected InP/metal and intermetallic contacts in
terms of their stabilities at the interfaces will be conducted. The research is
of particular interest for providing a sounder scientific basis for the
improvement--performance and reliability--of ohmic contacts and Shottky barriers
to compound semiconductor materials, and is considered critical to advanced
electronics and photonics science and technology. %%% This research is expected
to provide deeper fundamental understanding of basic properties of metal
interfaces to electronic/photonic materials. From an application point of view,
understanding these properties and their relationship to materials synthesis and
processing is beneficial to semiconductor device design and fabrication. The
results will be of importance in a general way to the technology of large scale,
high speed integrated electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
