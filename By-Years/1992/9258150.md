Initial directions in optical fiber communication systems research will involve
the routing and control of data in a high-speed photonic network/switch.
Wavelength - and space - division- multiplexing technologies will be highlighted
as well as novel network control schemes, all using state of the art
optoelectronic devices gained from collaborative efforts. The results will
advance the capabilities of an eventual (inter)national high- speed optical data
infrastructure.
