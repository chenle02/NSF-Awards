This award supports visits over two years by Dr. Richard Emlet of the
University of Oregon to the laboratory of Dr. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of the
University of Sydney. The research will examine the fluid-mechanical and
physiological changes that are associated with modification of development in
the Australian echinoid genus Heliocidaris and other genera of sea urchins. The
research will compare larvae of the congeners H. tuberculata and H.
erythrogramma which live in the same latitude and environment thus minimizing
measurable differences between related species for reasons unrelated to
developmental changes. The research will involve measurements of ciliary
morphology and kinematics, swimming behavior and metabolic rates. Results are
expected to show whether and how changes in morphology influence swimming
performance in the species with modified development. The morphology of the non-
feeding larva will permit a determination of the energetic cost of locomotion in
a larval metagoan. This research combines the strengths of the U.S.-Australian
scientists to allow them to investigate how changes in development are
manifested in morphological and physiological performance. Dr. Emlet has
expertise in the evolution of echinoid larval development and fluid mechanics of
microscopic organisms. HIs Australian colleague brings expertise in metabolic
physiology and has developed new technology for measuring oxygen consumption in
growing planktonic organisms. Seven of the fourteen lineages of sea urchin
larvae that have evolved nonfeeding development are represented along the coasts
of Australia.
