Dr. Gregory L. Hillhouse, Chemistry Department, University of Chicago, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division to develop metal mediated reactions of nitrous oxide
and related species. The oxo and imido insertion reactions of nitrous oxide and
organoazides will be utilized to synthesize a series of late transition metal
hydroxides, alkoxides, and imides. The metal systems will be chosen so that
reductive elimination reactions will result in the clean formation of cyclic
organic molecules that contain oxygen or nitrogen heteroatoms. Systems will be
constructed in which the metal catalyzes these transformations. One of today's
greatest chemical challenges is the selective oxidation of organic substrates. A
very attractive oxidant is nitrous oxide, a molecule which liberates only
nontoxic and environmentally friendly nitrogen gas after it serves as an oxygen
transfer agent. Moreover, nitrous oxide is recognized as both a `greenhouse gas`
and a stratospheric `ozone depleter`; it would be advantageous to find new uses
for this gas, which is now an underutilized biproduct of the chemical industry.
In this project metal systems will be designed to activate nitrous oxide toward
oxygen atom transfer reactions and metal catalysts will be developed to
facilitate these reactions. As a result new uses for nitrous oxide and some
related species will be developed.
