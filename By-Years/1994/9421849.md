Research in theoretical gravitational physics will be continued, and the
following topics will be investigated: A. Decoherence and Quantum to Classical
Transition B. Noise and Fluctuations in Gravitation and Cosmology C. Black Hole
Thermodynamics and Backreaction D. Galaxy Formation and Phase Transitions in the
Early Universe E. Gravity as an Effective Theory F. Stochasticity and Complexity
in Cosmology The concepts and techniques of non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics and the formalisms of quantum stochastic field theory in curved
spacetime will be further developed and applied to problems on the foundational
aspects of quantum and statistical mechanics, gravitation theory, general
relativity, cosmology and black hole physics. The goals of this work will be
probing the deeper structures of the physical laws under extreme conditions and
understanding their manifestations in the origin and dynamics of the Universe.
