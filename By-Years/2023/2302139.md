The CombinaTexas 2023 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College
Station TX on April 22-23, 2023. The conference will feature six fifty-minute
plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks in various areas of
Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is
to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas
and the surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the
region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent
developments in the field of Combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&M University
hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at
different institutions in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2023 is
the nineteenth conference in this series.

The topics of the CombinaTexas Series include all branches of Combinatorics,
Graph Theory, and their connections to Algebra, Geometry, Probability Theory,
and Computer Science. In 2023 the confirmed plenary speakers are Sergi Elizalde
(Dartmouth College), Patricia Klein (Texas A&M University), Bernard Lidicky
(Iowa State University), Jesus de Loera (University of California Davis), Andrew
Suk (University of California San Diego), Sheila Sundaram (Independent). They
will cover topics in Algebraic Combinatorics, Combinatorial Representation
Theory, Commutative Algebra, Discrete Geometry and Ramsey theory, Extremal
Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Combinatorial Algorithms, and Computational
Applied Mathematics. About 70 participants are anticipated, with estimated 20
contributed talks in parallel sessions. More information about the conference
will be available at the webpage
