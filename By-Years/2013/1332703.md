Funds are provided for the project to investigate the hydrodynamics and sediment
transport processes associated with migrating ridge and runnel systems. Novel
insitu techniques developed from wave flume experiments will be combined with
remote sensing methods to quantify sheet flow, suspended sediment transport, and
morphodynamic response in a ridge and runnel system in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
Results will be used to test the hypothesis that sheet flow processes dominate
ridge and runnel migration, and to develop a comprehensive understanding of the
morphologic evolution of these systems from inception through attachment to the
beach. This research may lead to improved management of beach erosion and
recovery. The project will support a PhD student (with recruitment targeted
towards underrepresented minorities) and two undergraduate students. The PIs
will construct and train teachers to operate a portable flume for use in three
Texas high schools participating in the ?Beach in a Classroom? program. Project
results will be incorporated into public outreach activities in Texas and
Delaware.
