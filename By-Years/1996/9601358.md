9601358 Thommes The symposium will address problems in developmental
endocrinology from an integrative standpoint. Its aim is to evaluate the current
state of the art, and to identify important future directions in research and
utilization of non-mammalian vertebrates. The expected data will serve as the
basis for a wide range of applied aspects, from lamprey (pest) control to new
approaches to fish farming and improved poultry (egg and meat) production. The
one-day program is scheduled as part of the December 1996 meeting of the Society
of Integrative and Comparative Biology (formerly the American Society of
Zoologists). Its format is oriented to create strong interactions (discussions)
between the presenters and the general audience, resulting in a more "fruitful
event" than the traditional lecture-only format.
