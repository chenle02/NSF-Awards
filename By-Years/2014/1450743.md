This EArly-Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides support for the
development of new theory and methods for optimization of dynamic resource
allocation problems. Its objective is to provide an enhanced but tractable
framework for these problems, expanding the applicability of existing
methodology to broader, more realistic applications. This research has the
potential to be transformative in the theoretical field (opening up new lines of
research ) and in applications across diverse domains, such as defense (e.g.,
goal-oriented deployment of heterogeneous assets, minimizing cost of failure),
medicine (clinical trials with failures and cumulative costs), education, health
monitoring, and computer science (dynamic operation of multi-modal sensor
networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic resource allocation problems have been
traditionally approached within the multi armed bandit framework, under the
following restrictions. At each period over a time horizon, a controller
activates one project of a finite collection of independent projects, advancing
the state of the selected project while the others remain frozen. Rewards,
collected from each activated project, are discounted at a constant rate, either
modeling risk or accounting for compounding interest. There is a uniformity of
the time-scale as well as a structural symmetry among the projects. The primary
objectives of this research project are: i) To break the uniform time-scale
restriction. ii) To break the structural symmetry among the projects. To achieve
these goals we plan to investigate project dependent "halting events." These
halting events allow the modeling of projects that operate at different rates,
as well as "singling out" projects - generating rewards from successful projects
and incurring costs for unsuccessful ones. A main challenge is to model the
expanded frameworks in a way that makes it possible to obtain insight into the
structure of optimal solutions. A second challenge is to develop efficient
computational methods for these inherently large scale data and optimization
problems.
