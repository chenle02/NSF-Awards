The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is motivated by
a software framework that focuses increased attention on improving children's
mental health and wellness. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration recently called for prevention efforts, including
interdisciplinary approaches, particularly addressing mental and physical
health, through sustainable and coordinated community support. This project
offers a unique model that incorporates mental health, physical health, and
digital literacy into a platform that provides a cohesive message for
transformation, moving children and communities from risk to resiliency by
promoting social and emotional learning, positive character development, and
overall wellness. This platform accomplishes its goals through the mechanisms of
education, health, and social responsibility wrapped in entertainment, supported
by data.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project applies a novel software
framework to collect data from user engagement (e.g., based on inquiries,
content accessed, content created, services performed, etc.) that highlights
risk factors affecting children's performance in social and educational
settings. This data supplements the P-20 database (P-20 is a state-level,
longitudinal, educational, data system intended to capture and analyze student
data from preschool to high school, college, and the workforce). The P-20
database focuses on biometrics, and provides a more holistic look at what is
happening with children, families, and communities due to the focus on mental
health data. This holistic approach provides a multi-risk factorial to identify
target communities and specific needs, such as bullying, violence, or substance
abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
