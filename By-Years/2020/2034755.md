The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be highly disruptive to the nation's higher
education community, as universities struggle with safe and effective means to
maintain students' progress toward their degrees. This EArly-concept Grant for
Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate risk-management of
alternative delivery mechanisms that will enable universities to safely reopen,
appropriately engaging students, faculty, and staff, while keeping the broader
university community, including the neighboring businesses that serve the
campus, as safe as possible from disease outbreaks. The research will generate
new knowledge in the area of operational risk management and decision making
related to public health and will assist university administrators and public
health officials in evaluating risk management strategies to operate safely
during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award supports
research on a comprehensive, data-enabled disease spread model tailored
specifically to university demographics and operations. The research will yield
(1) novel operational risk management formulations that specifically take
participant behavior and university and surrounding community demographics into
account, (2) investigations into different strategic options for educational
delivery in a university community, and (3) methods to integrate empirical and
conceptual models of disease spread with dynamic data in this
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
