This investigation focuses on the adaptations ciliates can achieve by acquiring
chloroplasts and utilizing their photosynthetic capabilities within the ciliate
cell. Many planktonic ciliates retain a portion of the chloroplasts from the
algal cells they ingest. In some, these retained chloroplasts continue to carry
out carbon assimilation at rates comparable to the intact algae. This research
focuses on how ciliates regulate the photosynthetic production of retained
chloroplasts and how important this energy source is for the microzooplankters.
As ciliates can be very important microzooplankton components of some aquatic
ecosystems, this adaptation may greatly affect the production ecology of these
systems.
