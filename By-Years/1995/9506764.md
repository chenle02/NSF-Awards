Performance index functions with integer parameters are important in the
evaluation and analysis of computer systems, communication networks and general
distributed and parallel processing systems. These functions are often difficult
to evaluate for large integers. On the other hand, most of these performance
functions have nice properties such as monotonicity, convexity, analyticity, as
well as obtainable asymptotic behavior. This research uses such properties to
extrapolate the performance functions based on their values at small integers.
The objective of this research is to further establish the theoretical
foundation and to develop guidelines, algorithms and their software
implementations that will be applicable to a wide array of systems. The results
of this research will make it possible to express the performance measure
function in terms of the system size of dimension as a low-degree rational
function for some general classes of systems. The successful completion of this
research will provide a framework in which various difficult modeling, control
and optimization issues can be attacked.
