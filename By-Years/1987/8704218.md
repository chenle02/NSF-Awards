This research is designed to integrate the following three areas: (1) Bayesian
statistical inference and decision theory, (2) computational and numerical
methods for statistical applications, and (3) applications of computational and
statistical methodology to problems of modeling. At the core of this project is
the adaptation of methods for the parallel statistics and decision theory, and
to other numerical and computational methods. Two broad classes of problems to
be studied that relate parallel processing to other computational problems are
the use of a parallel system for the computation of high-dimensional integrals
and the optimization of high- dimensional functions on a parallel system. In
both classes of problems. the basic question is to determine an efficient way to
decompose the computation across a collection of different processors operating
in parallel. The methods, algorithms, and software to be developed for parallel
processing will be useful in the determination of optimal or approximately
optimal Bayesian solutions in a wide variety of sequential decision problems,
including applications in robotics.
