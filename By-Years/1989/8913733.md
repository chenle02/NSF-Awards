The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. Access to X-ray
crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists to
carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at SUNY, Buffalo will
use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire X-ray
diffraction equipment. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by
the acquisition include the following: 1) Synthetic and mechanistic
organometallic chemistry 2) X-ray crystallographic studies of metal carbonyl
clusters 3) The synthesis, structure and chemical reactivity of metal carbonyl
clusters 4) The study of coordination complexes 5) The study of organo-group 13
compounds.
