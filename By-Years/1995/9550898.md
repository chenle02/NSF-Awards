The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Varian GEMINI 2000 High-Resolution
NMR System to support its instruction laboratories and enhance its senior
research programs. Introduction of NMR concepts with hands-on access to modern
NMR spectroscopic techniques early in a students chemical education increase
interest and excitement in the field of chemistry. Students must have
instruction in FT-NMR to meet the demanding requirements of the academic and
industrial world.
