This award will support the continuation of the Pacific Northwest Geometry
Seminar. It will provide opportunities for frequent contacts between workers in
similar fields and thereby help the participants keep abreast of recent
developments. It will also provide an ideal setting for the initiation of new
collaborations. The seminar has been supported by the Foundation since 1978 and
has operated at very high scientific and efficiency levels. This small award
represents an excellent investment of programmatic funds.
