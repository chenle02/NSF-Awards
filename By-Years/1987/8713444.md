This grant will support nuclear physics research by a faculty member and
several undergraduate students from the State University of New York College at
Geneseo for three years. Experiments to determine the mechanisms responsible for
projectile fragmentation in medium energy heavy ion reactions will be carried
out during summer visits to the Florida State University Nuclear Physics
Laboratory. These measurements will be made in collaboration with Florida State
scientists. Analysis and interpretation of the resultant data will be carried
out at Geneseo during the academic year. The grant is funded under the auspices
of the NSF Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
