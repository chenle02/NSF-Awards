9404374 Muraki The theme of proposed work centers on the evolution of spatial
structure in nonlinear models which derive from physical systems of current
interest: a) self-focussing of light in nematic liquid crystals, b) interfacial
pattern formation in chemical reactions, c) flow structures in complex fluids.
In particular, the mathematical objective is to establish relationships between
coherent structures, instability and dynamics as pertains to the development of
weakly-turbulent behaviors in simple nonlinear systems. The basic strategy
involves both the identification of the primary structural modes, and the
determination of their dynamics and interaction properties. A combination of
asymptotic analysis, dynamical systems methods and numerical computation are
employed to obtain clear illustrations of the mechanisms by which spatial
structures are created and sustained by nonlinearity. This, in turn, provides an
analytical basis leading to a physical understanding for the underlying
nonlinear phenomena. A familiar example of a spatio-temporal evolution is the
video record of satellite weather maps as often shown on the evening news. While
the imagery of spatial features that evolve over time is a common theme for many
physical and biological phenomena, our quantitative understanding of these
processes is actually quite limited. The proposed research investigates the
model equations for unusually complex patterns -- the break-up of optical laser
beams, and the spreading of chemicals in surface reactions -- which have only
recently been produced in the laboratory, but hold future promise for the design
and control of new fine-scale processes.
