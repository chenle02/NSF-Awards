Buchler, J. Robert 95-28338 Dr. Buchler will continue research on pulsating
variable stars in three areas. The first is a study of the interaction of two
vibrational modes to explain the irregular pulsations of stars such as W
Virginis, +the second is a survey of Cepheid pulsation properties as a function
of global parameters, and the third is a study of the non-radial pulsation of
white dwarfs and delta Scuti stars. ***
