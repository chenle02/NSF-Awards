9413867 Moulton This partnership of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research
Institute, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the University of Massachusetts,
Lowell and the is focused on meeting the manufacturing engineering needs of
Massachusetts' growing biotechnology and biomedical industries by retraining
displaced defense engineers. Some of the features of this program include quick
"retooling" in biology and chemistry, a two-track certificate path, a four- to
six-month paid practicum at a biotechnology or biomedical company, and the use
of intelligent computer tutoring systems. With some additional work,
"retrainees" can earn a master's degree. ***
