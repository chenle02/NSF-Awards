This grant will bring together a multi-disciplinary team (technical and
social/organizational) to explore deployment of and impact of e-government
services in Puerto Rico, with security, privacy and other enabling IT
capabilities. The City of Mayaguez will be the government partner. Multi-
lingualism will be one of the technical themes, along with automated
representation and extraction of semantic information, and collaborative secure
wide area government to government databases. Social science aspects include
study of economic/social barriers to technological adoption. Most e-gov
deployments operate on the principle of 'build it and they will come';
unfortunately many times they don't come. This project will help us understand
the barriers to citizens' full embrace of e-gov services in an environment which
will allow leapfrogging of older web technologies, working with a populace that
is not sophisticated and is inexperienced with e-gov services. Strong leverage
will be provided by the City and the University.
