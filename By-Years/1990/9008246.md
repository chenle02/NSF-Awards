Dr. Micheal A. Duncan is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study gas phase laser vaporization using beams of
molecules. These experiments investigate unusual atomic arrangements which can
give rise to previously unknown chemical bonds which, in turn, may well allow
the production of highly efficient molecular energy stores. Ionized clusters of
the lighter main group elements (C, Si, Al, etc.) are prepared in supersonic
molecular beams using the technique of pulsed nozzle laser vaporization. Similar
methods are used to synthesize metal containing ion-molecule complexes. These
jet cooled species are size-selected in a specially designed reflectron time-of-
flight mass spectrometer system. Wavelength dependent visible and/or ultraviolet
laser photodissociation spectroscopy provides a probe of electronic, vibrational
and rotational levels in these systems. These novel experiments investigate
cluster electronic and geometric structure, photochemical dissociation channels,
and excited state dynamics, providing significant new tests of fundamental
bonding principles.
