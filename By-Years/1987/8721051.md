In the past decade the scientific community has become more aware of the
complex photochemical reactions which occur in the middle atmosphere. At an
altitude of about forty kilometers and above molecular oxygen (O2) is
dissociated by ultraviolet light and the oxygen atoms formed react with O2 to
create ozone (O3). These reaction sequences are responsible for creation the
layer of ozone which shields the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet
radiation. Interest in the ozone photochemistry has been spurred by concerns
that human activities such as high flying aircraft, chlorofluorocarbon release
to the atmosphere, and atmospheric release of nitrous oxide by agriculture might
result in the destruction of ozone in the middle atmosphere. Since the early
1970's laboratory and field investigations have been carried out in order to
better define stratospheric chemistry and man's potential of perturbing this
delicate system. In the course of these studies it has been discovered that
ozone in the middle atmosphere is apparently enriched in the heavy oxygen
isotopic (i.e., oxygen atoms which weigh more than the most common oxygen
atoms.) This finding of anomalously distributed oxygen isotopes in the ozone
layer has been the subject of scientific questioning and debate since current
knowledge about the mechanisms and rates of ozone production and destruction
does not predict the observed isotopic composition of ozone. This is a renewal
