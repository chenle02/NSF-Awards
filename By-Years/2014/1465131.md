Abstract

In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Thomas Lectka of Johns Hopkins University is developing new
chemical methods focused on site-selective fluorination to produce chemically
interesting products not easily accessible by other means. At Johns Hopkins,
Professor Lectka, supervises a research group that contains predominately
undergraduates. In addition, graduate students are participants in the K-12
educational outreach program and also the Chemistry Olympiad; in a separate
program offered by Hopkins called LEAD, two grad students spend time mentoring
inner-city Baltimore middle school students twice a week in science and math. In
summary, the P.I. plans to continue a track record of educating underrepresented
minority groups (especially African-American and Hispanic undergraduates) for
the foreseeable future.

Operational simplicity, low catalyst loadings (where applicable), mutual
compatibility, mild conditions, and broad scope are the fundamental goals. The
recent, widespread interest in fluorine chemistry stems primarily from the
utility of fluorinated compounds as pharmaceuticals. Nearly one quarter of the
top pharmaceuticals on the market contain fluorine, placing synthetic
fluorination methods, particularly those amenable to late-stage
functionalization, among the most valuable warheads in the arsenal of the
medicinal chemist.
