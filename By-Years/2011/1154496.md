This project will create a Top Achieving Scholars (TAS) program to provide 20
four-year scholarships and 12 three-year scholarship in three cohorts for
academically talented and financially needy students in computer engineering,
computer science, civil engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing
engineering, and mechanical engineering at The University of Texas-Pan American
(UTPA). The goals of the project are to improve educational opportunities for
students by coupling student preparation with mentoring, tutoring, and research
opportunities; to achieve student academic success and research excellence while
providing broad educational access; and to cultivate more Hispanic Engineers by,
among other things, increasing retention of students to degree achievement.
Proposed efforts include ten different activities and services in recruiting,
mentoring and student leadership development. These activities and services will
foster students' growth and interest in their fields of study. A unique and
valuable aspect of the program is its effort to influence students who are not
in the program. This includes providing constructive feedback to applicants who
are not selected, and forming learning communities with both TAS and non-TAS
students. The requirement that students prepare a professional plan or technical
document to share with family and community will also extend the program's reach
beyond the funded students. This project would have a direct positive impact on
the participation in the STEM fields by Hispanic Americans since the institution
is an HSI. This project could provide a model for other underrepresented groups
such as African Americans, Native Americans and women in the STEM fields.
