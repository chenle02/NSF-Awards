This research will focus on the interplay between molecular biology, computer
science, and evolution to probe a complex form of biological information
processing: gene unscrambling in hypotrichous ciliates. The long term goal is to
develop a multidisciplinary approach to this problem that will enable us to tap
into this biological process as a computational tool. The proposed research
combines three approaches that first improve our understanding of the function,
mechanism and logic of this phenomenon. Specifically, this proposal uses gene
unscrambling as a model system to explore the mechanisms underlying complex gene
rearrangements in ciliates the steps through which these processes have evolved,
and their capacity to solve hard computational problems in vivo. The impact of
the award would be an influx of new ideas and direction from computational
sciences into the study of a complex biological system involving programmed
genome rearrangements in ciliated protozoa, with the ultimate goal of harnessing
the process for the purpose of performing in vivo computation.
