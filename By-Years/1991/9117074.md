Research is proposed on three relatively low cost and manufacturable
technologies for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which will contribute
toward enabling commercial development of these systems. The first technology is
a process for integrating optical-quality compound semiconductor materials onto
silicon- based microstructures. This technology, which is based on a
modification of epitaxial liftoff techniques for compound semiconductor
materials, will enable the development of integrated optically- based sensors
and actuators. The second technology involves the use of electroplating
techniques coupled with polyimide-based electroplating forms to produce a low-
cost alternative to the LIGA process for fabrication of high-aspect-ration
microstructures. The third technology involves the design and fabrication of
simple solar cell structures that can be used as self- contained power sources
for MEMS. The solar cell structures will be optimized for the high-voltage, low-
current needs of electrostatic microactuators, and designed such that they can
be integrated directly with standard silicon-based microstructures.
