Incorporating High Tc Superconducting (HTS) materials in planar transmission
lines is very promising for high speed digital, and high frequency analog
applications. Before full exploitation of the HTS's, their current and power
handling capacities need to be assessed. Knowing the material critical current
density does not directly lead to the maximum current that can be carried by the
transmission line. In this Research Initiation Award, London's equations and the
two-fluid model will be used to investigate the current distributions on HTS
transmission lines. They will be coupled with one of two electromagnetic models.
The first on is a full-wave analysis. The developed equations are discretized
over the structure cross-section in a two dimensional mesh using the finite-
difference scheme. The total current carried by an HTS microstrip line without
exceeding the critical current density of the material as well as the total
power can be calculated. The losses due to normal electrons and the Q-factor are
directly obtained. We have already performed initial calculations, and the
preliminary results are very encouraging. We here propose to fully develop the
model by incorporating substrate losses and non-linear conductivity. Then, the
fully developed models will be used for comprehensive analysis of HTS microstrip
lines. Design guidelines for microwave superconducting planar transmission lines
will be developed. Comparative study between different planar transmission lines
will be performed to select the best structure that fully exploits HTS
capabilities.
