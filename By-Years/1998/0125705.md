This grant provides support for refinements to the widely-used Isoplot/Ex, a MS
Excel-based computer program used for reduction and evaluation of radiogenic
isotope data. The program will be expanded to include several new capabilities
including: 1) a Bayesian + Monte Carlo approach for improving the precision of
radiometric dates from a sequence of stratigraphically-constrained beds; 2) a
method for logical, statistical, and graphical integration of the two main Ar-Ar
age-approaches (stepwise-release age-spectra and Ar-Ar isochrons); 3) a Gaussian
unmixing module to enable quantitative evaluation of age-suites involving
multiple age-components; 4) code revisions to maintain compatibility with new
versions of Excel and eliminate bugs as they are detected; and 5) expansion and
revision of the Isoplot User's Manual to increase clarity and teaching
effectiveness. ***
