This project deals with the concepts and development of a superconductive
composite wire (SCOW). Since the latest generation of the higher temperature
(Tc&gt; 77 K) superconductors are ceramic materials, their processing and more
important, their durability, are major problems. It is proposed that the
superconductive ceramic particles be incorporated into a tough polymeric matrix
to produce a composite wire. The microstructure of the wire should be such that
particle-to-particle contacts are established; the electrical conduction will
then take place by percolation mechanisms. The required microstructure will be
developed by using special processing conditions (appropriate shear rates) that
will promote aggregation of particles to generate particle-to-particle contacts.
In spite of a possible limitation of a low current capacity, the superconductive
composite wire will be cost-effective and highly durable and reliable.
