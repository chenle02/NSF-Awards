This project will study the general area of instability in various physical
systems using advanced mathematical concepts from perturbation theory, dynamical
systems theory and Hamiltonian mechanics. Among the topics to be considered are
the stability of dispersive wave solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation and
the Zakharov equation, the advective mixing of fluid trajectories at the onset
of chaos in viscous flows and the escape of particle trajectories of rotating
Hamiltonian systems from KAM regions. The phenomenon of turbulence is perhaps
the most important and the most difficult problem in fluid dynamics today. In
this project the principal investigator will study simple models of turbulent
flows using techniques from perturbation theory and nonlinear mechanics in order
to understand better how instabilities in flows are magnified to the point where
the flows go completely unstable and become turbulent. This too is an important
problem, predicting where and when a flow first becomes turbulent, since very
often one wants to delay the onset of turbulence for as long as possible.
