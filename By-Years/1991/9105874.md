The intestine and urinary bladder of vertebrate animals serve an important
barrier function controlling the movement of nutrients, salts and water into and
out of the organism. The major objective of the proposed project is to determine
the specific mechanisms by which such substances pass across these tissues and
the pathways for control of these processes. The individual membrane proteins
which mediate the movement of ions, specifically, can be studied in their
ensemble behavior using conventional electrophysiological techniques (and the
results related to the overall macroscopoic functioning of the tissue in
homeostatic balance of the animal) or studied individually using patch clamp
technique (and the results related to the biophysics of membrane ion channel
function). These techniques will be applied to delineate the roles of hormones
and drugs in altering membrane transport and to increase understanding of the
role(s) of these tissues in salt and water balance. //
