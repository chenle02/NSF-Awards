A number of reinforced concrete shell roofs have failed a number of years after
having been placed in service. Although no fatalities have occurred as a result
of these failures, several have been total collapses. With the current state of
finite element capabilities, it is possible to evaluate a failure load for these
structures including creep, nonlinear geometry and nonlinear material responses.
This research focuses on the development of the procedures to perform such an
analysis then apply these procedures to verify their determination of failure
conditions for those roofs which did fail.
