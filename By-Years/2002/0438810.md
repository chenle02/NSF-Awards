The American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES), the American Society
of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and WGBH Educational Foundation will lead a coalition
of the country engineering associations to develop and implement a national
initiative to encourage girls to consider pursuing a degree and subsequent
career in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;Comprised of a national outreach campaign,
television broadcast, multimedia resources, and companion Web site, the
EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN ENGINEERS initiative will provide an accurate picture of
engineering, but also present it as an attractive and compelling option for
girls. The project activities include: conducting a needs assessment; hosting
focus groups with high school girls, science, math, and technology teachers,
guidance/career counselors, and engineers; establishing an advisory committee;
researching compelling stories for the television broadcast and multimedia
resources; developing the outreach and Web components; creating evaluation
plans; and producing a report addressing the question of what motivates a high
school girl to consider engineering. In this phase of the EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN
ENGINEERS initiative, the coalition will research and test persuasive messages
and effective delivery mechanisms aimed at getting high school girls to consider
an engineering education and career.&lt;br/&gt;
