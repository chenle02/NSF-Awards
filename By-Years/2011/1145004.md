Social Network, mobility and the cloud represent special and unique
opportunities for synergy among several existing and emerging communities that
are now often evolving in isolated silos. All three areas hold much promise for
the future of computing and represent significant challenges for large scale
data management. As these three areas evolve, their direct influence on
significant decisions on each other becomes evident and critical. The potential
for cross fertilization among these three areas of important research will drive
much of the research in academia, and the products in industry. This two-day NSF
workshop brings together leading researchers, practitioners, and planners to
discuss and articulate interesting directions that the community should pursue
in deploying large-scale mobile and social network applications in the cloud
environment. The workshop includes invited talks, panels and breakout
sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has broader impacts across multiple
segments of society as: (1) social network and mobile applications have the
potential to significantly enhance productivity and quality of life;(2) the
workshop produces a set of research challenges and directions that seed research
projects and grant proposals that prepare and educate the next generation of
researchers and students who will be critical for building the foundations of
future computing, both short term in industry as well as long term in both
academia and industry; and (3) the workshop widens the scope of research in each
of its three main communities: social networks, mobile applications, and cloud
environment, to include new aspects that evolve from integrations with the other
two communities. More information on the workshop can be found at
