A partnership made up of CSY, Inc. and the Science and Engineering Alliance has
been created to develop a multi- media based Minorities in Science Series for
K-6. The product is designed to provide a solid foundation for understanding
scientific and technological concepts and how they relate to a student's
personal and social context. The principle aim of this project is to create
courseware that is developed in an environment that will provide technology
based pedagogical strategies that increase minority achievement, stress minority
role models and bring an overall sense of pride and ownership to the learning
process on the part of minority students. The project will produce two sides of
video disc -- one for K-3 and the other for 4- 6.
