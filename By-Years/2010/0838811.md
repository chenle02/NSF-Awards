Sergienko/0838811 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to conduct a modeling
study of the ice stream ? sub-glacial water system. A suite of numerical models
of various dimensionality and complexity will be constructed in a sequential,
hierarchical fashion to formulate and test hypotheses regarding how sub-glacial
lakes form under ice streams, determine the effect of sub-glacial lakes on ice-
stream flow and mass balance, and to determine feedback effects whereby the ice
stream ? sub-glacial water system can elicit both stable and unstable responses
to environmental perturbations. This research will address one of the only
observationally verified fast-time-scale processes apparent within the Antarctic
Ice Stream system. The intellectual merit of the project is that understanding
the origins and consequences of near-grounding-line sub-glacial lakes is a
priority in glaciological research designed to predict short-term variations in
Antarctica?s near-term future mass balance. The broader impacts of the proposed
work are that it will contribute to better understanding of a system that has
important societal relevance through contribution to sea level rise.
Participation of a graduate student in the project will provide the student?s
training and education in application of the numerical modeling in
geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
