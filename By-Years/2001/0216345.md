A heavy-ion tracking system is being developed by the University of North
Florida to support nuclear astrophysics research at the Superconducting
Accelerator Laboratory of the Florida State University (FSU). The tracking
system consists of two identical ion detectors and is modeled after a focal
plane detector system implemented at the Fragment Mass Analyzer of the Argonne
National Laboratory. In each detector, a thin plastic foil emits delta electrons
when a heavy ion passes through it. The delta electrons are accelerated away
from the foil toward an electron "mirror" which reflects the electrons toward a
stack of micro channel-plate electron multipliers. The detector system will
provide position and direction information on heavy ions incident at rates up to
approximately one million per second. The system will be used to track ion
species generated by the exotic(radioactive) beam facility, RESOLUT, at FSU. The
initial goal of the RESOLUT research program is to study nuclear reactions that
are important in&lt;br/&gt;models of stellar nova explosions. Undergraduate
students will participate in all aspects of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
