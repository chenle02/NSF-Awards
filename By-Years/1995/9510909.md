SRS 9510909 Vonortas The project will develop a database of the research joint
ventures (RJVs) registered with the U. S. Department of Justice under the
National Cooperative Research Act (NCRA) of 1984. The NCRA-RJV database permits
both time series and cross sectional statistical analysis and will provide data
to do empirical analysis to determine the characteristics of these research
joint ventures and their business participants. The data base will be linked to
other Commercially available databases such as Compustat and CorpTech and will
be updated for the next three years until 1998. The database will also be
available to other researchers. The project will provide data on the
characteristics of such partnerships and will contribute to the discussions
concerning the importance of interfim cooperation to industrial competitiveness.
