Markov chains play an important role in a variety of fields, but the analysis of
their convergence properties remains a challenging problem. The emphasis of this
workshop is on the analysis of "large" Markov chains, i.e., finite-state chains
where the number of states is exponentially large as a function of the
description size of an individual state. Such chains are especially important in
the study of statistical physics models and the design of approximate counting
algorithms. The workshop will bring together researchers in the analysis of
large Markov chains from many areas of application, to review progress and to
identify challenges for future research.

Recently there has been considerable success in designing approximate counting
algorithms without the use of Markov chains, relying instead on so-called
"spatial mixing" properties. Remarkably, matching hardness results have been
established in the special case of antiferromagnetic 2-spin systems. This
beautiful collection of results ties together the complexity of approximate
counting on a general class of graphs with an associated phase transition for
the infinite regular tree. By highlighting recent results in the study of
approximate counting problems, the workshop will explore analogous connections
for other models and for related problems. Video tapes of presentations and
discussions will be distributed to the public. Students will be encouraged to
participate in this interdisciplinary area.
