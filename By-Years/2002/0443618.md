With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at Boston University will purchase a liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer
(LC/MS) time of flight (TOF) system. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including 1) the preparation and evaluation of dendritic-linear
hybrid macromolecules; 2) asymmetric synthesis using (E)-crotylsilane reagents;
3) the development of new methodologies for chemical synthesis of complex
molecules; 4) synthesis of natural products using catalytic methodologies as a
source of selective organic transformations; and 5) homo Diels-Alder chemistry.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely
used analytical instrumentation techniques. Because of this, it is important for
undergraduate and graduate students to be exposed to the technique. Graduate
students, undergraduate summer and postdocs will use this instrument for their
research.
