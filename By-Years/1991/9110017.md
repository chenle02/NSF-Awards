This award is to fund an NSF research planning workshop on "The Challenges of
Computer Vision - Future Directions in Computer Vision Research" to be held
immediately following the 1990 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern
Recognition in Maui, Hawaii in June 1991. Junior and senior researchers in
computer vision will be invited to participate in this workshop, which will
address basic research needs and recommend future directions that should be
emphasized, and will also examine enabling tools and technologies which can most
contribute to progress in computer vision. A report of findings will later be
produced and distributed widely.
