The San Diego Natural History Museum (San Diego, CA) is developing a new
permanent Minerals Hall that will present San Diego geology and mineralogy to
visitors through displays of outstanding mineral specimens and through
interactive exhibits on the physical properties of minerals. This NSF award will
support the design, construction and evaluation of the interactive exhibit
components. In addition to the permanent exhibits at the San Diego Natural
History Museum, an additional set of exhibits will be prototyped, tested, and
installed in a new Great Lakes Exhibit at the Cranbrook Institute of Science
(Bloomfield Hills, MI). The two institutions will collaborate on exhibit design
and development and carry out parallel evaluations with their respective museum
audiences. NSF support will be approximately 45% of the project total.
