This award is to provide partial support for conducting the second colloquium
on Materials Handling Research. This colloquium is focused on the current state
of materials handling research and to identify the critical issues to be
addressed in the last decade of the 20th century. These issues were partially
addressed in the first colloquium and a continuation of the effort will enable
the broadening of the base of participants and build better communication links
within the research community and between the research and the industrial
community.
