ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal CCR-ITR 0312809
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: New Directions in Software
Security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amit Sahai&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is widely
believed that the greatest threat to computer security today is not
cryptographic weakness but rather flawed software design and implementation, and
weakness in protecting information within software and hardware. This research
proposes to develop the area of software security - protecting functional
objects from vulnerabilities by means of fully automated software and hardware
transformations. The approaches proposed in this research attempt to build a
novel and theoretically sound foundation to this
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, this research considers the broad area of
software transformations to counteract security vulnerabilities caused by flaws
("bugs") in software. In particular, this project will develop theoretical
foundations and tools for preventing attacks which exploit flaws to gain control
of remote systems. More generally, this research will aim to classify the
security that computationally limited software transformations can
provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, this research considers the question of
software and hardware privacy -- how to ensure that an adversary cannot learn
important secrets by examining software or hardware. In this case, this research
will study transformations such that, when the attacker gains access to the
transformed software or hardware, it cannot learn specific secrets embedded in
the original software or hardware, such as cryptographic keys or potentially
even secret algorithmic techniques. This research will propose such
transformations for hardware and software under various assumptions, and seek to
determine when such protection is impossible.&lt;br/&gt;
