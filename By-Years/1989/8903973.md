This project deals with a scientifically and technically important problem,
namely the study on ductile fracture in metal forming processes such as
extrusion and forging. The approach in this project is to consider the shape
change of voids and the progressive loss of strain hardening capability of the
matrix material. Following that argument, a theoretical framework is outlined to
estimate the average internal void-matrix configuration of the ductile porous
material subjected to arbitrary three-dimensional finite deformation. The
development of the theory will be buttressed by an experimental program and
incorporating it into a finite element program.
