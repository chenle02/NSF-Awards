This proposal will investigate carrier transport as a way of increasing the
sensitivity of optical nonlinearities in semiconductors. The goal is to obtain
all-optical information switching at intensity levels approaching W/cm2 for
applications in optical information processing, optical computing, neural
networks, optical communications. Three studies are proposed, as justified by
previous experiments and modelling: 1) Optical bistability at 1.06 um in a
hetero-Schottky barrier in InP/GaInAsP. Material will be grown by LPE in our
laboratory; 2) Nonlinear optical switching in MQW-H-nipi structures. Material
grown by MBE will be provided by Hughes Research Laboratory; and 3) Near-band-
edge electrorefractive photo-refractivity in GaAs, making possible phase
conjugation and locking of semiconductor laser arrays with a speed a million
times faster than previously. Lasers will be provided by Sarnoff and Spectra-
Diode Laboratories.
