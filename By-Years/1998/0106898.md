ABSTRACT

Origin of Siltstone Facies in the Permian Phosphoria Formation

Alan Carroll EAR-0106898

Silty marine mudrocks represent one of the most volumetrically important
sedimentary rock types, but their genesis remains very poorly understood. The
proposed study will investigate siltstone facies contained within the Permian
Phosphoria Formation in the western U.S. A regional sedimentologic and
stratigraphic investigation will be conducted to assess the importance of
suspension settling versus other depositional processes, and to examine the
relationship of siltstone and other facies to changing sea level. Oxygen
isotopic analyses of different quartz grain size fractions will be used to
constrain their temperature of crystallization and thus their origin (reworked
versus primary quartz). Finally, grain size distributions from siltstone and
other silty facies will be measured at a number of widely distributed sites.
These measurements, combined with high-resolution stratigraphic studies, will be
used to examine grainsize trends across the Phosphoria sea.
