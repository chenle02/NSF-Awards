9351254 Paselk The project will purchase equipment to set up an advanced
molecular modeling workstation to enhance the undergraduate research and
instruction in biochemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and
organic chemistry. This system will implement student modeling of chemical
processes and reactions to enhance their understanding and chemical intuition.
The Visualizer also provides for the independent movement of molecules for
docking and observing molecular-orbital interactions. These facilities will
allow physical chemistry students to follow fundamental processes in chemistry
such as bond formation and to visualize the molecular orbitals involved in
spectroscopic transitions. Students in advanced inorganic chemistry will create
and display the HOMO's, LUMO's, calculated spectra, stereochemistry to better
understand bonding and reactivity in transition-metal complexes and other
systems. ***
