The objective of the project is to obtain sufficient knowledge of the pathway(s)
for the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and the mechanisms for the
interconversion of free and bound IAA to understand how the plant controls its
endogenous level of growth hormone. An in vitro enzymatic system has been
developed for the synthesis of IAA and tryptophan from indole at a rate
commensurate with the in vivo rate. The system is sufficiently stable to permit
enzyme fractionation and characterization. The enzyme that catalyzes the first
step in the biosynthesis of the conjugates of IAA has been purified to
homogeneity. The gene for the enzyme has been cloned in E. coli. This gene will
be sequenced for comparison with genes for other auxin binding proteins and
other enzymes of auxin metabolism. These results should facilitate the isolation
of enzymes of auxin metabolism, permit studies of the genetic regulation of the
auxin conjugation system, and ultimately permit development of anti-sense
techniques to further understand the role of the auxin conjugation-hydrolysis
system.
