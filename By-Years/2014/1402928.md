This mathematics research project is in the general area of representation
theory and geometry. It involves the study of basic symmetries that occur in
nature, namely the continuous symmetries known as Lie groups, introduced by
Sophus Lie in the 1880's. One of the main goals of the project is to understand
the basic building blocks of the theory, the irreducible unitary representations
of Lie groups, using geometric methods. In addition the PI will make use of
geometric methods to attack several longstanding problems concerning systems of
differential equations, modular representation theory, and dualities for Lie
groups.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the PI and Wilfried Schmid have
made far-reaching conjectures which put the problem of finding the irreducible
unitary representations in a general mathematical context. The conjectures
themselves go beyond their application to representation theory and involve the
theory of mixed Hodge modules of Morihiko Saito. The Langlands program provides
a means of relating areas of mathematics that often do not have a
straightforward direct relationship. It implements this relationship via the
symmetries of the theories by exhibiting a relationship between their
representations. In this spirit the PI has initiated a collaboration with
Geordie Williamson, whose goal is to understand modular representation theory.
In particular, they want to settle the longstanding problem of understanding the
irreducible characters. Also in this direction, the PI proposes, in joint work
with Roman Bezrukavnikov, to prove a categorical Langlands duality for real
groups. Many structures in mathematics can be modeled by systems of differential
equations. Of particular interest are the maximally over-determined systems. The
PI, jointly with Masaki Kashiwara, has solved the key longstanding problem in
this area, the codimension-three conjecture. Kashiwara and the PI will continue
working towards a comprehensive understanding of holonomic regular
microdifferential systems (these are the systems that most often come up in
applications to other areas). To understand these issues better, the PI also
plans to develop a relative version of the classical theory of several complex
variables.
