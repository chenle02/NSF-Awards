With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Whitworth College will acquire a 750 Hz narrow-band
argon fluoride laser. This equipment will enhance research in the following
areas: 1) development of a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system to analyze
wear on carbon-based ion thruster grids in situ; and 2) measurement of the
dissociative resonance Raman spectra of several interesting molecules that
photodissociate at 193 nm. Researchers from several area institutions (Gonzaga
University, Eastern Washington University, New Light Industries) would also use
this laser system to carry out studies on nonlinear materials, photoacoustic
spectroscopy of bacteria and to develop high-spatial frequency gratings for
templates in the growth of controlled orientation colloidal photonic crystals.
Undergraduate students at Whitworth, Gonzaga and Eastern Washington will be
heavily involved in the research efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A high
repetition rate laser provides pulses of coherent visible or infrared light and
enables researchers to obtain important information about fast occurring
chemical reactions. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules. In particular, LIF is capable
of detecting very small quantities of carbon atoms in the plumes of ion
thrusters. This will allow for a rapid diagnostic test for wear in these
advanced thruster systems. A switch to carbon-based thrusters will significantly
increase the efficiency and lifetime of the ion thrusters, resulting in
tremendous cost-savings.
