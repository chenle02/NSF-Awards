Colony integration is the term used to define the degres of functional
interdependence between ramets (e.g., zooids, polyps) within a colony. Work in
many different systems has revealed repeated patterns of colony integration
within and between taxa and found repeated correlations between patterns of
integration and patterns of clonal organism life history traits. Despite the
success of this correlative approach, virtually all work on colony integration
has been based on morphological inference, with little attempt to directly
observe, measure, or experimentally perturb the vascular systems of colonial
invertebrates. This work will initiate a research program designed to place
studies of colony integration on a firm functional foundation based on detailed
analysis of the anatomy and behavior of the vascular system of a clonal
invertebrate.
