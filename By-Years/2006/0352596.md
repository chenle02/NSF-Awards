This research project supports multi-disciplinary research in Iceland and the
Faroe Islands focusing on the ecological impacts of first human settlement and
the theoretical insights this gives into global climate processes and social,
political and economic change. Focusing on zooarchaeology, complemented by
historical, ethnographic, and ecological research, the project proposes to
provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between the social and
ecological factors shaping the current island landscape. Building on prior
research, the PI and CoPI continue to test their understanding the complex
relationships between humans and their environment.
