This project is mathematical research sponsored by a Research at Undergraduate
Institutions award. The subject is linear operators on Banach spaces, the latter
being (generally) infinite-dimensional versions of the finite-dimensional space
in which we live. In general, it is easy for a linear operator to be
discontinuous, that is, not to preserve limits; this is a feature of infinite
dimensionality. It is therefore remarkable that under certain cirumstances, an
operator that merely satisfies a particular algebraic identity turns out
automatically to be continuous. The principal investigator will seek automatic
continuity results of this nature within a framework described by the spectral
theory of operators. His research will help him provide intellectual leadership
to the mathematics department of his institution, Southwest Missouri State
University, thereby improving the environment for undergraduate students seeking
to learn mathematics.
