This proposal on "Xinjiang Magnetotelluric Transect" between Dr. Stanley H.
Ward of the University of Utah and Professor Zhao Jingxiang of the Institute of
Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration is jointly sponsored by NSF and the
Chinese Ministry of Geology. The investigators propose a magnetotelluric (MT)
geophysical survey of a portion of China's Xinjiang Province, the first look at
the geoelectric structure of the area directly north of the Tibetan Plateau. The
survey will explore a north-south 1000 km line of MT stations (transect) running
from the Junggar Basin in the north, across the Tien Shan Range, into the Tarim
Basin in the south. The MT method is a passive, deep-sounding exploration method
used to map variations in the electrical conductivity of the subsurface. The
investigators believe MT is ideally suited for largely unexplored areas such as
Xinjiang. The completion of this transect will augment other MT surveys that
have been conducted in China. These data should be comparable to data on the
Sevier orogenic belt of Nevada and Utah and the Laramide deformation of the
Colorado Plateau where compressional tectonic forces similar to those at work in
Central Asia were at work in the late mezozoic and early cenozoic. Using the
results of transects such as these, it is possible not only to examine crustal
structure, but also to recognize zones of conductive volatile fluids or partial
melting at depth. Recognition of such zones is necessary for a complete
understanding of crustal evolution.
