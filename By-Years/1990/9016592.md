This is a joint award with Dr. Vijayshanker at the University of Delaware. This
team has proposed several major research tasks in natural language processing
with special emphasis on several mathematical and computational aspects. The
work clearly has a formal and mathematical character. The various computational
structures and strategies the team has developed and will develop, need to be
investigated mathematically because such investigations shed light on the
descriptive and processing powers of these formalisms. These two aspects, i.e.,
the development of the structures and strategies, and their mathematical
investigations, are very much interrelated. It is believed that natural language
processing backed up by a formal framework, and mathematical investigations
grounded in empirical studies are two very productive areas of research. The
researcher will focus on interested in mathematical investigations only to the
extent to which the results have important implications for natural language
processing.
