Four broad topics will be investigated. First, a theory is being developed for
transient phenomena in a degenerate Fermi gas that ensue when the magnetic field
is swept across a Feshbach resonance. Second, corresponding studies in Bose
systems will be revisited as there appears to be a qualitative element still
missing in the comparison between theory and experiments. Third, an analytic
theory of the superfluid-insulator transition for bosons in an optical lattice
will be constructed. Fourth, Bragg scattering of light from atoms, bosons and
fermions, in an optical lattice will be undertaken.
