This project develops distributed control algorithms for robot sensor networks
using information dynamics to unify network mobility and communication. The new
framework moves beyond location-based mobility control algorithms and packet-
based communication protocols to a single information-theoretic approach. The
framework is developed through: (1) formulation of a new quality of service of
information metric and characterization of feasible quality of service demands,
(2) adaptive receding horizon control that adjusts planning horizon and sample
time based on information dynamics, (3) distributed calculation and optimization
of team quality of service, and (4) experimental validation using a
heterogeneous indoor robot sensor network and outdoor unmanned aircraft
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research enables the collection of in situ
data over large spatiotemporal scales. When deployed in remote or hazardous
locations the data collected with these networks leads to a direct improvement
to model or understand complex environments, which can help save lives. Students
will benefit from the multi-disciplinary activities involved, including embedded
computing, miniature sensor devices, wireless networking, and automatic control.
