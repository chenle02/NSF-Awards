Science and innovation policies emerge from political decision-making processes,
are implemented in political settings and are often aimed at addressing issues
that are defined politically, and assessed in a political environment. Yet there
is little research that systematically investigates the political aspects of
science and technology policy. The workshop will develop a research agenda for
better understanding the development, implementation, evolution, and assessment
of science and innovation policy. The project will craft a future research
agenda to addresses the types of questions faced by decision makers tasked with
creating new science and technology policies and improving the implementation of
existing policies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will contribute to
building a community of scholars focused on improving understanding of the
interactions between politics and science and innovation policy, and
articulating research opportunities, pressing questions and data needs. This
project has the potential to provide evidence for a more solid basis for
decisions regarding science and innovation policy as analysis typically does not
consider political feasibility or the politics involved with implementation.
