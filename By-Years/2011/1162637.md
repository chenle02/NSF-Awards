This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the week-long
Arizona School of Analysis and Mathematical Physics to be held at the University
of Arizona on March 12-16, 2012. Much of the funding will be directed to young
mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not
have their own support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's school will introduce
a number of areas of active research at a level accessible to young
mathematicians; the target audience will be specifically strong graduate
students and recent postdocs. The school will be organized around four mini-
courses. Each will be given by an expert in the field who is known for their
pedagogical skills. More precisely, the program will include the
following:&lt;br/&gt;1. Hypothesis testing and non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics by Yoshiko Ogata (University of Tokyo).&lt;br/&gt;2. Derivation of
effective evolution equations from quantum dynamics by Benjamin Schlein
(Universitat Bonn).&lt;br/&gt;3. Random Schrodinger operators by Simone Warzel
(Technische Universitat Munchen).&lt;br/&gt;4. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation
and its universality class by Jeremy Quastel (University of
Toronto).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school will afford many junior researchers
the opportunity to learn and interact with established researchers in analysis
and mathematical physics. It will be an event with significant research and
training impact.
