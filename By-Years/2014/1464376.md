This project contributes to our understanding of the relationship between people
and technology by addressing two related core open problems in the field:
enacting anonymity online and managing strong tie support in online communities.
Issues of privacy, anonymity, equality of participation, engagement, and social
support are of interest in many online contexts. This work extends the theory
and practice of Social Computing and Human-Computer Interaction by contributing
a rigorous empirical investigation of online anonymity and peer support
practices in online communities for recovery from addiction and alcoholism.
Additionally, this project will contribute to the design of new technologies to
advance national health and welfare - addressing the "treatment gap" for addicts
and alcoholics who seek recovery by leveraging novel technology to connect them
with treatment and peer support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These topics will be
investigated through four specific research activities. First, participatory
observation will be conducted of an online community for recovering addicts and
alcoholics. Second, data will be downloaded from this online community over the
course of a year to develop a quantitative understanding of the evolution of the
relationships and activities in this community over time. Third, in-depth
interviews with members of this community will examine the role of leadership in
these online health communities and the factors that contribute to strong social
support online. Finally, participatory design workshops with recovering addicts
and alcoholics will integrate, vet, and validate the findings of these empirical
investigations and develop novel ecologically-valid technology prototypes for
supporting recovery from addiction and alcoholism.
