Most night-flying moth locate mates through female production of, and male
response to very precise blends of three or more species specific airborne
chemicals. Within a species, females that produce atypical blends are not as
attractive as other females. Similarly, rare males that have genes for response
to an altered blend are expected to be less reproductively fit than normal
males. Based on our current understanding of the genetics and mechanics of
sexual communication in moths, evolution is expected to select against the
proliferation of new sexual communication systems. However, there are currently
thousands of moth species, each with a unique system of communication. Our goal
is to hybridize two closely related moth species that differ in their pheromones
and male responses. We will map sexual communication genes and develop strains
with single genetic differences in pheromone production or response to determine
if and to what extent their fitness is decreased in a number of environmental
conditions.

There are many complex traits for which diversification is expected to be
hindered in early evolutionary stages. We expect the information from our work
on moths to provide general insight into how traits that are expected to be
conserved, can diversify.
