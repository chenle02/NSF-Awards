9319417 Olson Within the last four years, and especially since the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, casualty estimation, long a neglected subject in both
research and application, has emerged in both sectors as a key focus. The long-
term objective of this research effort is to develop quantitative methods and
techniques for estimating earthquake-caused casualties for loss estimation,
emergency medical response planning, and improved design of structural and
nonstructural building elements. The objective of this project is to maintain
the momentum and interaction between researchers and practitioners by
organizing, holding, and publishing proceedings from a Second Workshop on
Earthquake Casualty Estimation. The workshop will further the planning efforts
of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and will be conducted in
the context of the development of a national earthquake loss estimation
methodology. ***
