9626245 Parker This proposal contains three projects on the analytic aspects of
the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves. The first is an analytic approach to
computing the enumerative invariants of algebraic geometry; the second project
aims to identify new constraints on which bubble trees can arise as limits of
J-holomorphic maps; the third project has to do with Taubes-type invariants of
symplectic four-manifolds. In particular, the investigator is interested in
obtaining invariants of symplectic four-manifolds finer than the Seiberg-Witten
invariants. Our universe, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity,
can be thought of as a four-dimensional curved space. Four-manifolds then are a
mathematical abstraction and generalization of this four dimensional curved
space. They are general in that different curvature and shape properties are
possible; they are abstract in that a four manifold does not necessarily sit
inside an ambient space. Mathematicians have been trying to classify four-
manifolds according to various schemes in recent years; the proposed research
looks at so called the differentiable structure of these manifolds.
