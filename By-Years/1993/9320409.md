9320409 Ramakrishnan This award supports a U.S.-U.K. Workshop on Fiber
Reinforced Cement and Concrete to be held in Sheffield, United Kingdom, June
1994. The objectives of the workshop are to review the most recent advances in
the field of fiber-reinforced cement based composities and to identify future
collaborative research directions. The workshop will also address the different
forms of composites with discrete or continuous fibers, the characteristics of
advanced cement as they influence the properties of composites, and worldwide
standards or specifications for the use of fiber-reinforced concretes. The co-
chairpersons are V. Ramakrishnan of the South Dakota School of Mines and
Technology and R.N. Swamy of the University of Sheffield. Rapid advances have
occured in the development and application of new materials of construction like
fiber-reinforced composites, especially in the United Kingdom. New cement
composites are of great importance to civil infrastructure efforts as they can
extend the life of many existing, old facilities and provide for new, longer-
lasting and economic structures. The proposed workshop will advance U.S.
research efforts in this area through information exchange and initiation of
links with leading researchers in the United Kingdom. ***
