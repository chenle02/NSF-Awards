This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase II research project proposes to develop nanotechnology-enabled
advanced lithium-ion batteries for electric transportation applications. While
lithium-ion batteries represent the current state-of-the-art for rechargeable
batteries, performance of current lithium-ion battery designs is limited by the
properties of both electrodes and electrolytes. The proposed research combines
nanostructured electrodes with environmentally benign electrolytes to develop
high-performance, safe, and long lifespan lithium-ion batteries. The proposed
research will optimize nanostructured electrodes, produce the electrodes in
large scale, and fabricate and evaluate packaged prototype batteries. A team
capable of fabricating, evaluating, and commercializing these batteries for
electric transportation applications has been
assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is to
improve the functionality and marketability of advanced electric transportation
applications such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), Plug-In Hybrid Electric
Vehicles (PHEVs), and Electric Vehicles (EVs). The proposed batteries will
significantly benefit electric vehicle applications by decreasing harmful
emissions, achieving better fuel economy, and reducing our nation?s reliance on
foreign petroleum sources. More broadly, they will also benefit a wide range of
applications including consumer electronics, medical electronics, electric
utility industries, and military and defense systems. The technology under
development in this project will enable the next generation of lithium-ion
batteries that will offer superior performance and reduced environmental
concerns. In addition to lithium-ion batteries, nanostructured materials
demonstrated in this project will have a broad impact on other electronic and
electrochemical devices.
