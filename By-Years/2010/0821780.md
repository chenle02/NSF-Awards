This project is for the development of a multichannel low noise receiver, data
acquisition, and digital signal processing system for experimental development
work in radio astronomy. The system will support multiple ongoing research
efforts to study new techniques involving antenna array instrumentation and
signal processing algorithms. Applications include centimeter-band focal plane
array development work, radio frequency interference mitigation algorithms for
focal plane arrays and synthesis arrays, and data gathering to verify and refine
ionospheric correction techniques for direction-dependent self calibration in
long wavelength synthesis imaging.
