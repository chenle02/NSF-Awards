Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The soil carbon cycle is commonly characterized by
photosynthetic inputs of carbon by plants balanced by heterotrophic respiration
of accumulated soil humic substances. The role of leaching in decomposition,
transport, stabilization and loss of soil organic matter is rarely represented
in conceptual or numerical models of belowground carbon cycling. This is despite
the fact that leaching is known to be a dominant mechanism of transport and loss
of numerous mineral and nutritive elements in humid forest soils. This study
seeks to quantify (a) the fluxes and storage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
in the soil and (b) the seasonal changes in the rate of carbon export to streams
from two contrasting coastal California ecosystems. Water fluxes entering,
moving through the soil, exiting at the channel head and in the stream networks
will be monitored, while solution samples will be analyzed for carbon
concentration, composition and age. We will couple this information on DOC
fluxes to detailed analyses of the spatial distribution of soil carbon, its
relative recalcitrance, age and turnover.&lt;br/&gt;
