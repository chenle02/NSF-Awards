This project is the second part of a comprehensive revision of the tiphiid wasp
subfamily Thynninae. Thynninae includes more than 50 genera and 750 described
species. Probably 30% of the genera and species remain undescribed. These wasps
occur in South America and Australasia, apparently having reached both regions
via land bridge connections with Antarctica some 75 million years ago. They are
parasites of ground-dwelling scarab beetles, including those related to the
Japanese Beetle. The transantarctic distribution, and distinctive relationship
between morphology, taxonomy and behavior makes this group of wasps ideal for
analyses of their evolution and distribution. Taxonomic and evolutionary
analyses have been completed for the South American groups. The proposed
research in this project on thynnines includes evolutionary analysis of the
Australasian genera, and then overall evolutionary and biogeographic analyses of
the entire subfamily worldwide.
