The field of homotopy theory is the study of mathematical invariants that are
insensitive to deformations. It is applicable whenever one is interested in
studying qualitative aspects of a system, or whenever there might be imprecision
in the specification of the state of a system. In recent years the methods of
homotopy theory have found use in fields as diverse as condensed matter physics
and the foundations of mathematics. This project aims to bolster these
relationships with new tools from algebraic topology, and to apply them to other
areas of mathematics and science. There are applications of this work to
condensed matter physics, classical algebraic geometry, and, in the long term,
to education.

The scope of this project involves several interrelated areas of study. One of
these, on algebraic vector bundles, depicts a new interface between complex
analysis and algebraic topology, and is intended to get at the obstruction to
topological vector bundles having algebraic structures. Another organizes tools
developed for the study of differential manifolds into higher categories, in
service of providing a general topological expression for the evaluation of
"Gaussian integrals" in topological quantum field theories. The two principal
investigators will work jointly on a project designed to establish a striking,
conjectured, structural result for "groups of units" occurring in algebraic
topology. This result has implications for the construction of topological
quantum field theories and offers a potentially new approach to understanding
the "homotopy groups of spheres." Three further projects involve new
generalizations of ideas in homotopy theory, in the contexts of algebraic
K-theory, "transchromatic homotopy theory" and in a relationship between
Goodwillie calculus and the construction of "smash" products in the
stabilizatons of infinity categories.
