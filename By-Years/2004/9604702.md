Mechanistic and kinetic studies of enzymes involved in the metabolism of
aromatic hydrocarbons, degradation of alkylamines, and respiration will be
undertaken. The enzymes include the flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase
(Pseudomonas putida), the quinoprotein methylamine dehydrogenase (methylotrophic
bacteria), copper-containing quinoprotein amine oxidases (human and Arthrobacter
globoformis), and iron-sulfur flavoproteins succinate dehydrogenase (mammalian
and bacteria) and fumarate reductase from Escherichia coli. The numbers, types,
and redox potentials of the organic and metal ion cofactors are already defined.
The majority of these enzymes have been cloned to allow for alteration of their
properties by genetic manipulation. The available x-ray structures of many of
the proteins studied will guide some of the research. It is proposed that the
requested rapid-scanning stopped-flow spectrophotometer be used to define events
occurring on substrate/ligand binding to enzymes, and the properties of the
individual cofactors in integrated functions. It is also proposed that the
instrument be used as a rapid-recording, dual-wavelength spectrophotometer for
essential quinol oxidation reduction assays.
