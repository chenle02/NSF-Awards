The grant funds a 4 year project to disseminate nationally the materials and
techniques developed at the University of Arizona for image enhancement. These
materials allow students and teachers to scan images, or select one of thousands
already available, and do enhancement and analysis. The images are drawn from
many fields and support exploration and discovery related to all area of science
as well as many areas of mathematics. The Image Processing for Teaching project
develops a curriculum for inservice workshops for teachers in grades 5 through
12. Multimedia materials on CD-ROM accompanied by video and print materials
support the sites that adopt the technology. A national structure will
disseminate the materials and promote further development of applications by
teachers and students. An initial core group of 90 expert teachers will
participate in the dissemination and training. The grant includes funds to
support 80 teachers per year from either districts that cannot afford the
workshops or those that teach targeted underrepresented groups.
