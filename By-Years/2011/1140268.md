The Mississippi River and Atchafalaya River are experiencing a historic flood of
major geological significance. South Louisiana has one of the fastest land loss
rates on any region on Earth, with much of the loss due to a lack of sediment
delivery into the coastal zone. This flood is likely to deliver large amounts of
sediments to the coastal zone, and therefore could potentially contribute to
land building along the South Louisiana coast. This research is a rapid response
to investigate whether the massive release of freshwater from the Atchafalaya
River in late May, 2011 will lead to the development of a freshwater-dominated
continental shelf environment and whether sediments released by the flood will
initiate the development of a large mobile mud belt that will extend from the
mouth of the Atchafalaya River westward along the Chenier Plain Coast. These
hypotheses are being tested by examining the physical and geological
oceanography of the inner continental shelf and determining the patterns of
recently deposited sediments. The proposed research provides a rare opportunity
to study the critical processes of sediment supply and land building in a
coastal ecosystem. Broader impacts include support of two institutions in EPSCoR
states and student training.
