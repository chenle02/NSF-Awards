This SGER project will examine the feasibility of using lighter than airships
(blimps) to follow various aspects of cetacean biology such as the time/space
variability in population structure, diving and submergence behavior, and
migratory movements and behavior, as well as in depth studies of important
breeding and nursery grounds along the US Atlantic coast. The airship time is
being donated by the FUJI corporation on its FUJI airship and by Metropolitan
life on its METLIFE blimp and thus the award involves an important commitment
and cooperative effort with the private sector. The donated time will be
provided on an opportunistic basis, dependent on primary commitments. The
project will evaluate and make recommendations on the use of these new advanced
airships for ocean surveys of marine mammals and their habitats and should
further extend our basic understanding of space and time population variation
and general behavior of these interesting and endangered organisms.
