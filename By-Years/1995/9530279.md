9530279 Freeman The PIs will reconstruct curves of the magnitude of isotopic
fractionation by marine plankton during Neogene using delta 13-C of
prymnesiophyte-derived long-chain ketones (alkenones) and planktonic carbonate
phases. If climate colling is driven by a decline in atmospheric CO2, then on a
global scale isotopic fractionation should also decrease. The isotopic proxy
method of reconstructing pCO2 will prove useful to evaluate climate change over
large temporal and geographic scales during the early Neogene.
