This awards supports the research of Professor O. Debarre to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on the dimension of Schottky problem as well as questions
about Prym Varieties including the Torelli problem. He will also work on moduli
spaces for semi-stable vector bundles. The research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed
to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood
for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the
simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in
fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding
theory and robotics.
