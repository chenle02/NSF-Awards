The genomes of positive strand RNA viruses are unique in that they serve both as
messenger RNAs and as templates for genome replication. Regulatory regions that
control and coordinate these competing uses of the same RNA mostly reside in the
untranslated regions (UTRs) of the genomic RNA. Defining the properties of the
UTRs is therefore crucial to understanding the infections of viral pathogens.
This project investigates the roles of a unique plant viral 3'-UTR, the tRNA-
like structure (TLS) of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RNA. The TYMV TLS can
be valylated and binds the translation elongation factor eEF1A; these properties
are essential for infection. Two recently discovered roles for the TYMV TLS are
being studied in detail: (1) a role in supporting the translation or gene
expression of the viral RNA, and (2) a role in negatively regulating the onset
of genome replication (minus strand synthesis). The first role is being studied
by identifying the extent to which RNA stability and translation enhancement
contribute to efficient gene expression derived from the TLS. The detailed
mechanism of translational enhancement is being studied with a variety of
biochemical techniques aimed at identifying molecular communication between the
3'-TLS and the 5'-end of the RNA, where ribosomes initiate protein synthesis.
Based on preliminary results, these studies will investigate a role for
translation elongation factor eEF1A in enhancing the initiation of translation.
eEF1A has also been shown to be capable of repressing minus strand synthesis, a
repression that might be relieved during an infection as viral gene expression
produces viral replication proteins that displace eEF1A from the TLS by
competitive binding. This scenario will be investigated by testing whether eEF1A
binding to the TLS is relieved when viral proteins are present. These studies
will clarify the roles of a viral 3'-UTR in regulating and enhancing viral
infection. This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students,
providing a training experience for the next generation of scientists.
