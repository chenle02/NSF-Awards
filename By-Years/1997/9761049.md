Intelligent Automation Inc. will develop a smart camera system which will not
only provide a wide field view, but more importantly, will be capable of
detecting moving objects or persons within that field and capturing high
resolution images using a servo-controlled narrow field camera. This smart
camera concept offers next generation performance over existing systems, and is
targeting applications in surveillance systems, intruder detection, motion
detection and multimedia human computer interface systems.
