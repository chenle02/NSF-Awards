The proposed research is concerned with the treatment of general, variable
coefficient systems of equations of elliptic and parabolic type. Special
attention will be paid to several key features of the theory. First, a strong
emphasis is placed on problems having a global character. In particular, the
topology of the underlying manifold is expected to play a significant role.
Also, global integral representation formulas (in terms of multi-layer type
operators) for the solution are sought. Second, minimal smoothness assumptions
are to be made on the analytical and geometrical structures involved. In this
context, a symbolic calculus is no longer readily available and, hence, the
nature of the problems at hand is significantly altered. The overall objective
is to undertake a systematic study of such problems via the modern tools of
harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Such problems are not only
of a purely academic interest. Besides the mere understanding of the natural
limits of the theory, this study is also motivated by real-life problems (like
those involving domains with edges, corners or cracks, discontinuous
coefficients and/or boundary data, non-homogeneous and/or anisotropic media)
where non-smooth problems are considerably more abundant than smooth ones.
Indeed, any realistic application, such as calculating the scattered wave from
the body of an airplane, will have to confront some kind of roughness such as
domains with non-smooth boundaries. Formulating the theory which ultimately
allows for the design of efficient numerical algorithms for such problems will
be one of the main goals of the proposed research.
