This award will support collaborative research between Dr. M.G. Raymer of the
University of Oregon and Dr. P.D. Drummond of Queensland University. The co-
principal investigators are Dr. J.H. Eberly of the University of Rochester and
Dr. K. Baldwin of the Australian National University. Several other researchers
at these four Universities will also be involved. The areas to be investigated
are important areas in modern quantum optics: nonclassical states of light;
cavity QED; quantum noise in nonlinear optics; novel lasers; short-pulse and
intense-field effects in laser-atom interactions and atomic photo-ionization.
The project represents excellent coupling between experimental and theoretical
physics, and the involvement of two institutions in each country will allow a
great amount of cross-fertilization of ideas. The potential of scientific
advances in quantum optics and laser physics are excellent. Laser gyroscopes,
laser radars and range finders, optical communication systems, information
processing and switching systems are some examples of areas of application.
