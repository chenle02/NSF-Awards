*** 9603218 Hyde-Wright This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
research in nuclear physics involves faculty, students and postdoctoral
researchers at Old Dominion University and at the Universite Blaise Pascal in
Clermont-Ferraud, France. The award will provide travel support to Charles E.
Hyde-Wright and his colleagues to collaborate with Pierre-Yves Bertin and his
research group. The research is primarily focused on physics opportunities at
the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) in Newport News,
Virginia. The objective of the U.S. investigators' travel to France is to work
on measurements and analysis from their experiments in virtual compton
scattering (VCS) and to provide research opportunities for graduate students.
The project takes advantage of the complementary experimental and theoretical
expertise of the U.S. and French investigators. ***
