The objective of this project is the development of a laboratory which will give
all electrical engineering majors the opportunity to thoroughly understand the
physical concepts fundamental to the design and operation of electric machines
and integrated electromechanical systems. The laboratory is precisely designed
to emphasize these physical concepts and to demonstrate the internal dynamics
and complex nonlinear phenomena associated with the behavior of materials all of
which is difficult to present to the students analytically. In addition, the
proposed set of equipment is designed to provide extreme flexibility that allows
the students to safely design their own experiments rather than to mechanically
execute experiments designed by others.
