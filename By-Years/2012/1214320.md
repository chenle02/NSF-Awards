This award funds the research activities of Professor Brandon Murakami of Rhode
Island College.

This project concerns rare lepton decays and their possible appearance at the
Large Hadron Collider (at CERN) and at the MEG experiment (at the Paul Scherrer
Institute in Switzerland). As part of this research, Professor Murakami intends
to focus on the decay of the muon to an electron-plus-photon state, a process
which is being studied by the MEG experiment and which is forbidden by the
Standard Model of particle physics. For this reason, any measurement of this
process is an unambiguous indication of physics beyond the Standard Model ---
particularly scenarios currently under investigation as potential solutions to
the gauge hierarchy problem. Professor Murakami plans to investigate all
theoretical issues concerning this rare decay and its potential experimental
observation, focusing on those involving weak-scale supersymmetry.

This project is also envisioned to include significant broader impacts.
Professor Murakami has been contributing to the overall science awareness in
Rhode Island with public lectures, participation in the NSF-funded TheoryNet
program which partners theoretical particle physicists with high-school
classrooms, and offers a freshman-level course on particle physics and
cosmology, designed to recruit undergraduates into physics. He also participates
in the Department of Education's "Upward Bound" program. As part of this
project, the PI intends to continue all of these activities.
