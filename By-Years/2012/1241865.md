Ensuring the security of the world's and our own nation's computers and networks
is a key national challenge. A significant need exists in Delaware and northern
Maryland for trained cybersecurity graduates critical to large regional
employers. This Regional Cybersecurity Education Initiative, formed by the
University of Delaware (UD), Delaware Technical and Community College (DTCC),
and Harford Community College (HCC) along with government and industrial
partners is establishing ongoing education and research collaborations that is
building programmatic capacity and establishing a pipeline of graduates skilled
in the theories and practices required to address these challenging
Cybersecurity issues. The project is completing initiatives including: expanded
Cybersecurity courses and Minor at UD producing students able to design state of
the art secure software and systems, a 2+2 Program to allow 2nd year DTCC and
HCC student to transfer into four year UD CIS and CPEG BS degree programs, and
establishing cybersecurity outreach including an internship program, middle and
high school student and teacher summer camps and bridge programs to energize and
attract the next generation of Cybersecurity professionals. The program's
initiatives are establishing a sustainable comprehensive approach to engaging
and educating a continuous pipeline of Cybersecurity professionals. The
intellectual merit of the proposed activities centers on the new discoveries
that will be made possible by students, faculty, and professional partners
through the unique collaborations and established creative education and
outreach programs. The education and outreach activities, and the regional and
national capacity needs addressed, directly represent the programmatic broader
impacts.
