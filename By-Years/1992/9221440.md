This award supports research by a senior faculty member, an Assistant
Professor, and an Assistant Research Professor at Boston University. They study
fundamental properties of elementary particles, especially those connected with
the electroweak sector of the standard model. Major activities are with the L3
group who operate at the electron-positron collider, LEP, at CERN. Some
particular goals are discovery of Higgs and SUSY particles or at least
extensions of their currently established mass limits, measurement of the
partial width of Z decay to b-quark pairs, and test of standard model
predictions at energies above W-pair production threshold. In preparation for
the future SSC-dominated era, they participate in design studies for the GEM
detector. Data from GEM (and SDC) will begin to clarify the electroweak symmetry
breaking mechanism, either with the discovery of the Higgs or some as yet
unknown phenomena outside the Standard Model.
