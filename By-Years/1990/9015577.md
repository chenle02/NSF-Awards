This award supports continued research into programming language support for
parallel scientific computation on (MIMD) distributed memory multiprocessors. It
is becoming clear that this class of parallel computers will play an important
role in the future of large scale scientific computation. Currently, however,
such computers are very difficult to program. The goal of this research is to
make it considerably easier and more natural to program these computers for
large scale parallel scientific computation, without sacrificing the run-time
efficiency of the resultant code. A second goal is to make such programs
portable between different distributed memory multiprocessors. The main issues
are high-level language support for parallel numerical algorithms that use
dynamic data and process structures. The researchers will interact extensively
with scientists who are (potential) users of these computers. This interaction
is aimed at increasing understanding of the paradigms that underline the
scientists' parallel algorithms, integrating these paradigms into programming
language research, and assessing how well this research is meeting their
needs.//
