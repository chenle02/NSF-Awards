Although the general concept of linear magnetic anomalies generated by seafloor
spreading processes at the ridge crest is well established, the source of the
magnetization within the ocean crest remains uncertain. Samples obtained during
ALVIN dives in the Hess Deep comprise a range of differentiated tholeiitic
extrusives, dikes and gabbros that represent a section through the upper
gabbroic crustal layer, 700 m of sheeted dikes, and about 300 m of crustal
pillow.lava sequence. The intention is to acquire a full suite of rock magnetic
measurements on coarse and fine.grained rocks of different compositions,
representing different levels of the upper ocean crust, and integrate these with
the crystallization and alteration histories of the rocks, as well as the
compositions of magnetic minerals.
