Abstract

Award: DMS-0102316 Principal Investigator: Tao Li

Essential laminations and immersed essential surfaces are two important objects
in 3-manifolds. They generalize embedded incompressible surfaces, and are
remarkably useful in obtaining topological and geometric information of
3-manifolds. The main goal of this project is to explore the relationships
between the topology of 3-manifolds and these two objects. The tools that the
investigator will use include branched surfaces and immersed branched surfaces
that have been proved to be extremely useful in the investigator's previous
work. The investigator intends to continue his research on essential laminations
and immersed surfaces with the following goals. (1) To construct essential
laminations in 3-manifolds obtained from Dehn surgery on hyperbolic knots. The
techniques to be developed in this research could potentially have great impact
on some famous conjectures in knot theory, e.g., Property P for knots and the
cabling conjecture. (2) To find an algorithm to decide whether a 3-manifold is a
Seifert fiber space. The investigator intends to use immersed branched surfaces
and normal surface theory to find a practical algorithm. (3) To show that two
homotopy equivalent 3-manifolds, which contain essential laminations, are
homeomorphic. (4) To find an algorithm to decide whether a 3-manifold contains
an essential lamination.

Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space that we are
living in. These objects can be found in many other sciences, such as physics,
biology, and chemistry. A geometric way of studying 3-manifolds, which is
extremely fruitful, is to view a 3-manifold as a collection of 3-dimensional
pieces glued together along 2-dimensional surfaces. The investigator plans to
study the structure of 3-manifolds using such 2-dimensional surfaces, which are
called essential laminations and immersed essential surfaces. The research in
this project is related to knot theory, which has helped to understand the
structure of DNA; it is also related to hyperbolic geometry, which has been used
by physicists to understand the universe.
