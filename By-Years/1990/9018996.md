The principal investigators will attempt to determine controls of element
mobility as a function of metamorphic grade by studying boron partitioning
between minerals, mass balance whole-rock trace element compositions, zoning of
trace elements in minerals, and correlations between trace element compositions
of progressive metamorphic suites. Work will involve the identity of minerals
that contain boron, and certain other trace elements, as well as whole-rock
characterizations for additional fluid- mobile elements. Results will be applied
to subduction zone metamorphism and the evolution of arc magmas. This research
will help geologists understand important chemical processes deep within the
earth.
