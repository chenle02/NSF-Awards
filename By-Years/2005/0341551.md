Mathematical Sciences (21) This proof-of-concept project is developing short
video clips explaining how to do selected homework problems covering the primary
topics covered in introductory calculus. These clips are intended to supplement
traditional forms of support such as tutorials and recitation sessions with
particular attention to reducing the percentage of unsuccessful students
(D/F/Withdraw) taking calculus. The digital incarnation of these clips promotes
wide accessibility and reuse. From the learner's perspective the clips also
offer multiple opportunities for viewing and reviewing. To manage this
collection of clips an XML/DTD management system is being constructed to allow
publication to a variety of media, in multiple formats. Both web and DVD based
dissemination is being undertaken along with a comprehensive evaluation program
to determine the effectiveness of these initial clips. This project also offers
a model for helping potentially unsuccessful students in other math and science
courses.
