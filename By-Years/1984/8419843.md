This research seeks to develop system design methods which permit and encourage
designers to incorporate the necessary distributed error correction throughout
any digital system. A new systematic distributed design procedure, employing
error-correcting codes and a well-defined clustering technique, incorporates
error correction directly in the logic design. System models describing internal
soft errors and an analysis procedure yielding the probability of error
performance are developed. An incremental probability analysis is used to
determine the proper gates for sharing and when compromises between performance
and complexity are required. The research efforts involve developing automated
design tools for a complete clustered design and refined analysis techniques so
that the best trade-offs between implementation complexity and error protection
can be quickly achieved. In addition, simplified analytical methods are required
for guiding the design process and estimating the performance of modified
designs.
