9413089 Sisson Five universities--Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MIT, Cornell
and two Historically Black Colleges and Universities, North Carolina A&amp;T,
and Tuskegee--have come together in an ambitious project to remake undergraduate
engineering education. The project is based on a vision of the future
engineering workplace in which virtual organizations are formed over the
National Information Infrastructure to create new products. Each school will
have a "Design Studio of the Future" modeled on architectural teaching studios.
These design studios will be electronically linked together. Students will
engage in product realization projects that increase in complexity over four
years. For a senior project, students from all five schools will form teams that
"meet" over the Internet in real time to design and prototype a new product. The
schools also will develop and use modular courseware for manufacturing that can
be used at other schools.
