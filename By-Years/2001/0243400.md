The proposed research will focus on the investigation of four topics of very
topical and current interest. The first concerns how family symmetry gets broken
in grand unified models with family gauge groups. This renewed interest in
family symmetries has arisen because they arise naturally in orbifold
compactifications in string theory. Possible experimental signatures of flavor
changing currents in these models will be investigated. The second project
consists of identifying possible Kaluza-Klein states in extra-dimensional models
that are candidates for being observed at lepton colliders. The third topic of
research will be whether mu-tau conversion can be observed in nuclei. Finally
the implication of both CPT and Lorentz violation that are possible in string
theory will be investigated in terms of possible atomic physics experiments.
