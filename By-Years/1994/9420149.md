ABSTRACT 9420149 HUMPHREYS, Roberta The Automated Plate Scanner (APS) of the
University of Minnesota has been used to scan the glass duplicates of the first
epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS I) and create an on-line catalog,
STARBASE, available to the public over the Internet. The database of hundreds of
millions of stars and several million galaxies includes positions, magnitudes,
colors, and object classification using a neural network technique. Another
survey made at Palomar 20 years later is being scanned and measured for proper
motions of every object possible in the POSS I database. Duplicates of the
second epoch Palomar Sky Survey (POSS II) plates are to be obtained and
measured. The resulting databases from the additional surveys will be made
available over the Internet in a user-friendly form. The new databases will
include some image information, as well.
