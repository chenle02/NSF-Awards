&lt;br/&gt;4th International meeting on the&lt;br/&gt;Mechanics of Time
-Dependent Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of time-dependent material
behavior in engineering is important in the design and evaluation of structures
intended for durable uses. A quarter of a century ago, the term "time dependence
of materials" implied, essentially, the study and understanding of creep
behavior of metals. Though durability questions have become a much more
important part of cost-effective engineering designs, the attention paid to the
contribution of intrinsic material behavior of such designs has not kept a
commensurate pace with requirements. Though polymers are most prominent
materials in this class many of the principles governing their performance apply
to other solids. The conference is thus aimed at fostering awareness of time-
dependent issues in engineering, and particular to attract a young and diverse
audience/participation and to expose them to concerns of established researchers
dealing with such issues from interdisciplinary points of view. &lt;br/&gt;
