The objective of this project is to develop a novel hybrid control system for
building structures. The system is intended to exploit the efficiency and
flexibility of active control, while maintaining the safety and reliability of
passive systems. To achieve this objective, a screw-jack or shock- absorber type
of actuator that incorporates both passive and active damping mechanisms will be
developed. Such devices are to be installed in structural braces with collocated
sensors, and can be easily distributed at multiple locations in a structure. To
implement such a system, different control algorithms based on robust and
adaptive control concepts will be explored. Optimization techniques will be used
to determine the optimal allocation of active/passive control devices and
sensors, and to maximize both the efficiency and safety of the control system.
The hybrid system will be finally validated by laboratory tests. The study will
be carried out with an interdisciplinary effort involving researchers from
structural, electrical, and aerospace engineering. The research will lead to the
development of safer and more effective control systems for building structures
under wind and earthquake excitations.
