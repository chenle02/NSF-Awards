0447343&lt;br/&gt;Agnew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the cost of
replacing failed and antiquated air conditioning equipment that is essential for
the continuous operation of two long baseline interferometric laser strainmeters
in southern California that have been collecting near-continuous strain records
for over 20 years, in the case of the Pinon Flats Observatory (PFO), and over 10
years, in the case of the Durmid Hill (DH) instrument. These instruments provide
unique and highly sensitive information on short-period transient and secular
strain rates proximal to the active transform system of the North American-
Pacific plate boundary. In addition, continued operation of these instruments
will complement a planned continuous GPS and borehole strainmeter network of
instruments that is now under construction along the west coast of the north
American continent (the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) component of
EarthScope). &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
