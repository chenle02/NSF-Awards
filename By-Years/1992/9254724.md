This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from the University of North
Texas for a Teacher Institute which offers a master's degree in elementary
science. The planning grant will begin examining elementary science protocols,
establish design teams to make decisions on content, and begin the process of
redesigning existing university courses. In all, 12 courses, 3 credits each,
will be modified by the design teams. Through this project, a major will be
created which prepares teachers in content, methodology, and in their new roles
as change agents in schools which use site based management. The planning grant
begins the processes that lead to the Teacher Institute. The new concentration
is expected to be institutionalized by the end of the grant. The University of
Texas is cost sharing 92% of the project.
