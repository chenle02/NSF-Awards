Research is conducted to confirm the existence and determine the size of
clusters of solute in saturated and near-saturated solutions using a more
sensitive method of Raman band component analysis. Experiments are carried out
in flow cells and in density gradient columns. The results may lead to a
substantial rethinking of the classical homogeneous nucleation theory of
crystallization from solutions and to more rational design of crystallization
systems.
