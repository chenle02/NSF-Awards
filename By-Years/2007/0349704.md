This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a novel Resonant-Enhanced Crystallization (REC) process for
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry applications. REC technology is
expected to be superior to the conventional crystallization process that
incorporate impeller stirring for crystallization, due to its enhanced mass and
heat transfer, lower shear (or reduced crystal breakage), and improved crystal
size distribution.

The commercial impact of the project would be on pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries. REC technology will make the crystallization process
more attractive to pharmaceutical separation and purification operations.
