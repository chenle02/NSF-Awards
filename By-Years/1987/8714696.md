Gallium Arsenide and related compound semiconductors have progressed from the
R&D to the production stage where manufacturing efforts are being planned and
carried out. The processing of these materials is very different from the
processing of Silicon for integrated circuits. This proposal covers a request
for support of the Second U.S. Conference on GaAs Manufacturing Technology. A
substantial group of leaders in the field, representing U.S. industry,
universities and government, will meet at this conference. This conference will
take place October 12-14 at Portland, OR. This conference represents an attempt
to integrate university based manufacturing studies with industrial
manufacturing engineering efforts. NSF support of this interactive role is
extremely important.
