The low level jets (LLJs) that occur east of Andes Mountains in Central-South
America and play a major role in the inter-basin transport of water vapor from
the Amazon to the La Plata river basin are not well understood or predicted.
This is, in part, due to poor observational coverage locally where spatial
distribution of radiosonde sites is sparse and some of them have only one launch
per day. This research project attempts to fill this observational gap and seek
improved understanding and prediction of these LLJs. The research work is
divided into three components. The first one is to study different features of
the LLJs and their interactions with large-scale anomalies during the El Nino
and La Nina summers using a global telescoping model that allows local high
resolution. The second component is to launch radiosondes at two sites in
Bolivia and one in Paraguay for three months in the Southern Hemisphere summer
of 2002-2003 to obtain information on the diurnal and spatial structure of the
LLJs. The third component will be to carry out short-term numerical simulations
to calibrate and validate both the model and the reanalysis against the summer
field observations. Understanding of these features may improve prediction with
regional and global models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborations between
scientists in the U. S. and South American countries have great potential to
elevate the research activities there and improve the long- term observational
efforts locally. This last goal, if achieved, will have immeasurable benefits to
the meteorological research and operational community.&lt;br/&gt;
