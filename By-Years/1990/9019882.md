This proposal described experiments to test the hypothesis that the mechanism by
which insulin increases cellular seryl/threonyl protein phosphorylation is
mediated, in part, by the phosphorylation and activation of a distinct protamine
kinase and by the phosphorylation and inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A
mediate by the protamine kinase. Specifically, immunological and biochemical
experiments are described (a) to demonstrate that the rat hepatocyte insulin-
stimulated protamine kinase is related to a previously characterized protamine
kinase from bovine kidney cytosol, (b) to provide direct evidence that insulin
stimulates the activity of the protamine kinase via increased phosphorylation of
this enzyme, and (c) to examine to regulation by insulin protein phosphatase 2A.
Together, these studies will establish the molecular basis, intracellular
relevance and function of insulin stimulation of the protamine kinase. The
information derived from these studies is critical for an understanding of the
metabolic function and regulation of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation.
