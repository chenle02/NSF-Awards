*** 9660309 Bonney This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
determine the feasibility of significantly improving the process of validation
and verification (V&V) for large-scale, software systems, which has
traditionally required excessive amounts of paper documentation for
specifications, architectural descriptions, etc. Lead times associated with the
distribution of physical documentation results in the review of outdated
documents and a longer V&V cycle. There has been a slow trend towards using
World Wide Web technology for cataloging system documentation, but Web pages and
links are manually generated, which leads to omissions. More importantly, a
comprehensive view of the project cannot be gleaned from the Web pages as key
elements of the system are not maintained in a Web-usable format. The objective
of the proposed research is the development of a prototype Web-based V&V tool
that takes formal system requirements, specifications, and a project-specific
intranet, generates a comprehensive Web of project-specific information, and
periodically updates the Web to reflect changes. The research focuses on
automatic Web generation and the incorporation of systemdesign parameters in the
generation process. The commercial product of the research, a software-based V&V
toot would be marketed to corporate and independent V&V groups thorough existing
distribution channels. ***
