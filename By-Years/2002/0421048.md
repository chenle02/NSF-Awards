A 256 node (128 pair) Beowulf parallel computing cluster is used to improve the
realism of gravity-wave modeling by permitting treatment of the three
dimensional problem and multiple wave interactions. The infrastructure resource
is also to be used by computationally intensive modeling of turbojet fluid
dynamics and meteorological forecasting. The former project forges as
relationship by which private research funds are pledged by a corporate sponsor,
and the latter establishes a direct research link between the lead institution
(Embry-Riddle) and Bethune-Cookman College. That particular research link
establishes direct access to a skilled population underrepresented in Space
Science, facilitated by a well-established institutional advocate. The broad
impacts of undergraduate opportunity, direct interaction of Space Science
research with a well-trained but underrepresented population, and corporate
sponsorship are features of this research, not the more common afterthought.
