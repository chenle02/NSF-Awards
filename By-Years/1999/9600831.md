Water bound to proteins is a ubiquitous and integral component of the protein
surface, as observed by X-ray crystallography. A substantial proportion of
surface-bound water is required for protein activity, and remains even under
unfavorable conditions such as repeated rinsing in organic solvent. Bound water
also plays essential and diverse roles in protein-ligand interactions; for
instance, water is required for the recognition of operator DNA by trp
repressor, and is essential not only for inhibitor binding by trypsin, but also
for trypsin catalysis. This proposal addresses several outstanding questions
concerning protein-water and proteinwater-ligand interactions. What is the
chemistry, beyond hydrogen bonding, that determines the favorability of water
binding sites and their conservation between structures? How can this knowledge
be to used to assess the favorability of sites and to predict hydration? In
particular, given the uncomplexed structure of a protein or ligand, can the
bound water sites mediating the protein-ligand interaction be predicted? Using
the same techniques designed to answer these questions, advanced software for
modeling bound water will be developed and distributed. Key applications of this
software will be to fill two major gaps in current solvent modeling, by
providing a knowledge-based, uniform approach to water site assignment for
crystallography, and by identifying active-site hydration appropriate to include
in computer-guided ligand design and docking.
