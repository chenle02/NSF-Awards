Sampling will begin well down in what is believed to be the Peoria Loess and
continue all the way to the present land surface. We should thereby include the
Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition, the interval of post-glacial high
temperature (the Altithermal or Climatic Optimum), and the period of
temperatures lower than present (the Neoglaciation, including the Little Ice
Age). We will routinely collect samples from the lower, middle, and upper
portions of each visually detectable geological or pedological unit, and take
samples at intermediate levels of thick, apparently massive units. In this way
data will be obtained for all variations of material, yet form a basis for
statistical manipulation of analyses with depth if that becomes desirable. All
samples will be subjected to routine soil characterization procedures such as
determination of grain size, organic matter content, pH, carbonate content, bulk
density, and cation exchange capacity. Carbon-nitrogen ratio, base saturation,
and clay mineralogy may also prove useful for elucidation of variations in
climatic parameters. The modern surface soil and all buried paleosols will be
described according to standard soil survey criteria. At least one monolith will
be prepared and removed from the face in order to preserve the stratigraphy for
possible restudy after the exposure has been eroded away. Carbon from the
organic- rich horizons in the paleosols will yield a sequence of radiocarbon
dates to develop a firm chronologic framework for the proxy climatic data. At
least two radiocarbon dates will be obtained for each of the paleosols.
