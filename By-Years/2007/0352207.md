ITR: Developing and Testing A High Telepresence Virtual Agora For Broad Citizen
Participation: A Multi-Trait, Multi-Method Investigation

This grant will support research related to citizen learning and participation
in communities and government using Internet-based information technologies and
tools. This is a multidisciplinary proposal with participants from Public Policy
and Management, Philosophy, Political Science, Social Psychology and Computer
Science. A variety of free software will be developed to foster collaborative
information sharing, structured discussions and community decision-making
through shared data, chat sessions, video conferencing and other information
modes. The software is not an end in itself, but rather will serve to support
research by the PIs addressing some of the well-known problems of computer-
mediated communications, such as poor transmission of social cues, usability,
accountability, and access inequalities. These problems will be studied within
two larger contexts, Community Effects and Decisions Quality Effects, and two
levels of physical community, on-campus, and off-campus (but still within the
Pittsburgh local community). The software will be robustly built and intended
for broad use beyond the project itself.
