The proposed research involves the development of new synthetic methods
involving organocopper intermediates used at catalytic concentrations. Reactions
will include 1) Fleming's silyl cuprate chemistry, 2)the use of lanthanide and
other rare earth cocatalysts, 3) alkylations of functionalized Zn and Zr
reagents with vinyl and aryl triflates, and 4)1,4-reductions of alpha,beta-
unsaturated carbonyl compounds using copper hydride complexes. Raman and IR
spectroscopy, and electrospray mass spectrometry, will be used to determine
organocuprate compositions and structures in solution. With this renewal award,
the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides continuing support for
the research of Dr. Bruce Lipshutz of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California at Santa Barbara. The research involves the
developmentof synthetic methods for preparing organic compounds under mild
conditions and with high selectivities. The work will provide valuable training
to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in organic synthesis and the
spectroscopic identification of reaction intermediates.
