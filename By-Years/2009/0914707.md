The "Increasing Diversity in Earth Sciences (IDES)" project is the first
partnership of its kind in the state of Oregon, involving community colleges, a
research university with major strengths in Earth Science research and education
and an institutionalized commitment to enhancing diversity, along with state and
federal agencies, and centers of informal education. The project has two
integrated goals: to increase the number of students from underrepresented
groups who pursue careers in Earth Science research and education, and to
strengthen the understanding of Earth Sciences and their relevance to society
among broad and diverse segments of the population. IDES is built around a
proven model of tiered mentoring, an interactive student cohort, research and
education internships, and financial support. This 4-year program will recruit
15 students (mainly rising juniors) each year for four years (60 students in
all) from science majors at Oregon State University and five partner Oregon
community colleges. The program will reach its goals by implementing a plan to
prepare participants in IDES for success in the Earth Sciences through training
in the application of geospatial technologies to Earth Science problems of
personal relevance and participation in a two-year mentored research project
that will culminate in internships with academic units, state and federal
agencies, and centers for informal education in Oregon. IDES participants will
gain knowledge of potential career paths through contact with Earth Science
professionals as mentors, a professional internship, and a learning community
that includes a speaker series, which provides personal connections, role models
and direct work experience. An extentsive outreach and public education campaign
will instill an understanding of the context and relevance of the Earth Science
Enterprise to the participants, their families, their communities.
