In 1975, a pioneering Environmental Technology Center (ETC) was built at Sonoma
State University, one of the 22 campuses in the California State University
System. Originally the Center housed laboratories, instrumentation, resource
materials for research and research training in energy management, renewable
energy education, and sustainable development technologies applications.
Determined as seismically unsound twenty years later, the center was demolished,
severely curtailing research and training programs. Funding from the Academic
Research Infrastructure Program will aid the institution in its endeavor to
replace the facility. Specifically, funds will be used to replace the existing
space dedicated to environmental science research. The project is unique in that
it will not only provide research space, but will itself be the subject of on-
going study. Faculty and students will evaluate the ETC's own sustainable
architectural design and will evaluate the best available energy efficiency,
renewable energy, and environmental technology. Designs include: -smart
building+ control and management technologies, environmentally sensitive
building materials, passive solar heating and cooling systems, and solar
electric technology. The new facility will be located at the Sonoma State
University's EarthLab, a site on campus that has been developed into an outdoor
laboratory for the study of agroecology. The ETC and the EarthLab will
complement each other, providing research opportunities consistent with the
department's interdisciplinary approach. By emphasizing the connections of
fundamental science and practical applications for a sustainable future, this
project will assist the department in preparing graduates to participate in the
diffusion of environmental science and technology.
