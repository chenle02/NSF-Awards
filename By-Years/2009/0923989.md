As a collaborative effort, the University of Delaware and Oregon State
University propose to operate two Van Pools for the University National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). The East Coast Van Pool will be
operated out of Delaware and the West Coast Van Pool will be operated out of the
Oregon State University facilities. Both pools request funds to be utilized in
support of National Science Foundation (NSF), Navy?s Office of Naval Research
(ONR), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) funded scientific research at sea. The pools will provide
portable lab vans (general purpose, isotope, clean and cold) on vessels. They
will charge a day rate to the institution or Agency based on the type of van
requested and will be responsible for all shipping and maintenance of the vans
and the storage/support facilities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
