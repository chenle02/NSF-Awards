Augsburg College's Physics Department has a long-standing research program and
a strong record of preparing undergraduates for graduate study in physics and
engineering. As strong as this research and educational effort has been and
continues to be, it is significantly hindered by the inadequacy of space for
advanced laboratories used for research and research training activities. Space
used for research is scattered and suffers from general deterioration and
inadequate electrical, cooling and ventilation systems, limiting the
effectiveness of the department's research program. To remedy this situation and
further strengthen the education impact of physics research, Augsburg College,
with assistance from the National Science Foundation will renovate the ground
floor of Science Hall for the department. Constructed in 1948, the facility with
its deficient plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems cannot support state of the
art experimental work. Current configuration does not comply with ADA
regulations, thus limiting access to physical challenged individuals who are
interested in conducting research. By consolidating the department in one
location, faculty will be able to perform research in Magnetospheric,
Heliospheric, Atmospheric and Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics in a
conducive environment. Enhanced research opportunities will assure the
professional capability of faculty and encourage collaborative approaches to
physics research. Increase training opportunities will be available for more
students who envision a career in the discipline.
