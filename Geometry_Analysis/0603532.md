The area of research of this project is the rigidity of least area planes in
hyperbolic 3-space. A least area plane is a plane where any subdisk is area
minimizing among the disks with same boundary. For a given simple closed curve
in sphere at infinity, the existence of a least area plane that spans the given
curve in hyperbolic 3-space is known by Anderson's results. However, there are
few results on the number of such least area planes so far. In particular there
is no known example of a simple closed curve at infinity bounding two different
least area planes. The investigator obtained strong generic uniqueness results
on the problem by combining the results from very different fields, like global
analysis, minimal surfaces, and elliptic PDEs. In this project, he will
investigate whether the uniqueness is true in general, and he will try to prove
the rigidity of least area planes in hyperbolic 3-space. Such a result will be a
crucial ingredient for solving some problems in the topology of hyperbolic
3-manifolds, Teichmuller theory, and hyperbolic geometry. The second goal of the
project is to investigate same problem for the absolutely area minimizing
hypersurfaces in hyperbolic n-space. This problem is also known as the number of
solutions to the asymptotic Plateau problem. Another part of this project is to
approach the "Universal Cover Conjecture" by using minimal surface techniques.
Universal Cover Conjecture states that the universal cover of any irreducible
3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is an open 3-ball. Gabai suggested a
program to solve this conjecture by using minimal surfaces. He showed that if
the universal cover of the 3-manifold has a properly embedded least area plane,
then it is homeomorphic to an open 3-ball. The author aims to fill the missing
part of the proof by constructing a properly embedded least area plane in a
universal cover of an irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group.

The author will undertake research in Differential Geometry, Geometrical
Analysis,and Geometric Topology. He will investigate the asymptotic Plateau
problem by using topological techniques. The problem attracted many
mathematicians for more than 20 years. The results of this problem have produced
fruitful applications in the solutions of some classical low dimensional
topology problems. The rigidity result which the author is trying to prove will
have many applications in low dimensional topology, Teichmuller theory, and
hyperbolic geometry which are all traditional areas of investigations that have
experienced a tremendous progress in the last 20 years. The second part of the
project is to attack a long standing low dimensional topology problem, "The
Universal Cover Conjecture", by using minimal surface techniques. This
conjecture is one of the most famous conjectures in 3-manifold topology, and it
is interesting in own right. It has attracted many topology for more than 50
years. Minimal surfaces had many fruitful applications to several important
problems in low dimensional topology, and the investigator is trying to apply
the useful properties of these objects to prove this classical conjecture.
