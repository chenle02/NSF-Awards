This is a fundamental study of the role of cellular dislocation structures in
the deformation and fracture of materials. It is an outgrowth of previous work
on the fundamental mechanisms controlling the steady-state response of cellular
dislocation structures produced by fatigue. Since dislocation cellular
microstructures and their behaviors are archetypical of the inhomogeneous
structures and inhomogeneous behaviors that characterize the deformation of many
ductile crystalline materials, the scope of this work is broadened to study
dislocation cellular microstructures as phenomena. From the theoretical point of
view, several issues are addressed, such as internal stress development, the
stabilizing forces that lead to a dynamic steady state, the evolution of cell
structures from restricted random dislocation activity, the motion of cell
walls, the detailed dislocation mechanisms for slip and dynamic recovery and the
onset of instabilities that lead to fracture. Experimentally, this project
addresses two of what are believed to be the most significant issues related to
cell structures that can be settled experimentally, namely the effects of
deformation cell structures (or their absence) in fracture toughness and the
effects of partial (or recovery) anneals on the behavior of isothermally formed
cellular dislocation structures. The former will be very valuable to the
fracture community and its ongoing examination of the shielding concept, while
the latter will address the contribution of vacancies and internal stresses to
the observed mechanical response of fatigued metals.
