The research project will try to settle old conjectures about the structure of
K-theory and Motives, and clarify recently discovered relationships between
disparate areas of algebra, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. The
motive of an algebraic variety is built from geometric relationships, and is
designed to be the universal motif for cohomological invariants (hence the
name), so its structure reveals aspects of geometry. In contrast, the K-theory
of a ring or variety is built from relationships involving linear algebra using
algebraic topology, so its structure reveals aspects of algebra and topology.
Clarifying the relationships between these constructs will help our
understanding of many phenomena that are currently understand only poorly.

One part of the project is to find clean proofs of major pieces of the proof of
the recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. This includes trying to: find a
general degree formula which combines various degree formulas due to Rost, in
terms of algebraic cobordism theory; establish an equivalence between models of
the symmetric powers of a normal variety; and understand motivic cohomology
operations better. These all play a role in the proof. This part of the project
will be invaluable in training young researchers around the world. A related
part of the project is to understand how Voevodsky's slice filtration is related
to algebraic cobordism and other motivic spectra. The goal is to verify several
of the slice conjectures, especially in finite characteristic, using homological
algebra and algebraic Thom spaces. Part of this will be joint work with graduate
students, contributing to their training. The project will also study the
relationship between the singularities of a variety, its K-theory and its cdh-
cohomology, using recently developed cohomological techniques and the
relationship to cyclic homology and de Rham-Witt theory. This should shed some
light on classes of singularities related to du Bois singularities. The final
part of the project is to formulate an archimedean cohomology for a motive over
a number field and relate it to Serre's local factors for the L-functions of the
motive. This generalizes work of Connes and Consani, and uses cyclic homology
for schemes.
