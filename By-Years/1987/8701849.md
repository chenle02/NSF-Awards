It is now clear that most animal cells are able to share small molecules with
their rs by means of cell-to-cell channels. An impressive set of evidence es
that these channels are found in "gap junctions", membrane specializations which
have been analyzed with a variety of methods. In addition to the permeability
properties and structural features of gap junctions, investigators are currently
studying the regulation of the channel, the constituent proteins, the related ge
nes, and the role of these intercellular junctions in development and normal
tissue function. In this proposal partial support is requested for an
International Conferenece on Gap Junctions to be held at the Asilomar Conference
Center in California, in July of 1987. Over 100 new and established
investigators will assemble to discuss new findings gleaned from a variety of
experimental approach es (cell biology, immunology, microscopy, and genetics).
The Cell Biology Program recognizing the timliness of this conference, the
quality of invited speakers, a nd the emphasis on including young workers,
recommends that an award be made.
