The objective of this research is to formulate theories and techniques for a
new communication paradigm of cooperative detection. This approach leverages
cooperation among destination nodes during detection. The approach is to utilize
the fact that wireless signals intended for one node are also overheard by
neighboring nodes, thus a cluster of adjacent nodes can cooperatively recover
the original information by exploiting spatial signal correlation through game
theoretic information sharing and distributed source-channel coding.

With respect to intellectual merit, this work seeks to increase network
throughput and reliability through the use of cooperative detection. Existing
research on cooperative communication is dominated by a focus on cooperative
transmission, which relies on coordination among transmitters to achieve
specific signal structure at receivers. Cooperative detection, as investigated
in this project, instead exploits the intrinsic signal correlation among
neighboring receivers without requiring explicit coordination among
transmitters. It enables a family of communication techniques that have the
potential to be inherently robust against the lack of precise coordination and
to fully exploit the spatial diversity inherent in wireless networks.

With respect to broader impact, this research has the potential to close the gap
between theoretical network capacity and practical achievable throughput and to
accelerate the deployment of high data rate reliable wireless networks to a
variety of operational scenarios. The project provides research experiences for
undergraduate students and interactive demonstrations to students from
underrepresented groups during department open house and site visits to minority
serving institutions.
