Rieffel will continue his investigation of C*-algebraic quantization. Topics to
be studied include quantization and quantum groups, aspects of quantum topology
and differential geometry, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups. Attention will
also be given to relationships with applications in such areas as quantum
mechanics and field theory, and signal processing and pattern recognition. The
general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of
algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or
infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put
together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract
objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key
role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the
structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
