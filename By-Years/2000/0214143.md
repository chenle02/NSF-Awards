This study will employ a national survey to explore the implications of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks for civil liberties. Previous NSF support,
in the form of a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), enabled the
researchers to examine some short-term implications of the terrorist attacks on
public anxiety, support for civil liberties, political tolerance, patriotism,
and perceptions of the root causes of terrorism. With the first-wave data
collection nearly complete and the results contributing to our understanding of
political tolerance and the support for civil liberties, the researchers will
examine the durability of civil liberties concessions over time. They will
conduct a second wave of the "Civil Liberties Trade-Offs" survey, consisting of:
(1) reinterviews of the initial 1400 first-wave respondents, which included
African American and Hispanic over-samples, and (2) a survey of new respondents
to assess testing effects.
