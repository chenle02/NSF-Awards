This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address a major
problem for environmental restoration: the low cost measurement of soil
contaminants and their transport characteristics. First Point Scientific, Inc.
proposes to develop a novel Neutron/X-ray Spectral (NXS) logging instrument,
which will be used with a cone penetrometer (a probe which is hydraulically
driven into the ground), for this purpose. This instrument uses passive and
neutron-induced gamma-ray spectroscopy and x-ray spectroscopy techniques to make
the needed measurements. It is expected to provide high sensitivity (e.g., Hg @
0.2-2 ppm; Cl @ 3-20 ppm), for both detection and monitoring activities, without
the use of radioactive materials. It will also provide attractive sampling
volumes and depth resolution. The objective of the proposed project is to
determine the technical feasibility of the NXS concept. This will be
accomplished by performing two tasks: (1) develop the preliminary design for a
laboratory prototype NXS instrument and (2) evaluate its performance, in terms
of minimum detection levels, through detailed computer modeling. Los Alamos
National Laboratory, Westinghouse Hanford Co., and Cornell University personnel
will contribute to these tasks. Successful demonstrations of feasibility in
Phase I will provide a firm foundation for construction and testing of the
laboratory prototype instrument in Phase II. This project responds to the 1994
Solicitation emphasis on National Critical Technologies in the area of Pollution
Minimization and Remediation.
