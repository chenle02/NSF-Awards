The proposal will synthesize existing studies of the connection between teacher
training and student achievement. Studies of experimental, quasi-experimental,
and non-experimental design will all be included in the synthesis. The goal is
to produce a meta-analysis not limited by research method. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The study will create improved
evaluation capacity building. By concentrating on research on teacher
qualifications . things like whether people have majored in particular subjects,
achieved high grade point averages, been granted certification in specific
areas. The studies that will be evaluated will include a relationship of teacher
qualifications to student achievement.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to substantially enhance future
research and evaluation and will provide a framework for designing and
interpreting non-experimental studies and estimating their validity. It will
provide empirical advances by estimating the magnitudes of differences among
effect estimates generated under various design conditions. &lt;br/&gt;
