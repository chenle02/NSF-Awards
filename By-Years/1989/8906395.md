This award will provide funds to a group from the University of California,
Irvine to continue their study of ultra high energy (UHE) phenomena using Cosmic
Rays and the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. They will continue the search for UHE
signals from astrophysical point sources and investigate the muon content of the
showers from these signals and will try to determine whether the anomalous muons
which have been seen in Herculus X-1 bursts, is a universal phenomena among UHE
sources. These studies are essential for our understanding of photon hadron
interactions at the center of mass energies in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range.
