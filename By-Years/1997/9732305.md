9732305 Collins Fisk University will continue a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics department. Undergraduate students will
be recruited from regional institutions, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) and major institutions with physics programs, with a
recruitment focus on African-Americans. Students will participate in research
projects on the theme of "Materials Characterization Techniques", including
surface studies of compound semiconductors, plasma modification of materials and
non- linear optical glasses. In addition, REU participants will attend the
National Conference of Undergraduate Research to present the results of their
work %%% The REU site, with an emphasis on minority institutions, has potential
impact on underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate student population in
the sciences. ***
