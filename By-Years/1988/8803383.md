The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) operates an ongoing
program of absolute measurements of the earth's gravity. Started in 1982 with
primary support from the National Science Foundation, the program has moved from
the construction and laboratory testing of an absolute gravity meter to the
deployment of the instrument at a number of sites in California, Alaska, Nevada,
and Canada. The goal has been to provide epoch measurements or the eventual
detection of crustal deformation. There are now absolute gravity records at more
that 20 US sites, with the total number of measurements approaching 100. The
statistics in the data have reached the point where trends at some of the sites
are clearly discernible; difinitive results describing crustal deformation are
now being formulated. This grant is or the continuation of the program of repeat
measurements of gravity in California and or the establishment of three new
sites in Hawaii.
