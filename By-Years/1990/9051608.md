Recent developments in cognitive psychology, computer technology, software
(including authoring programs), optical disc technology, and "hypermedia," have
the potential for creating an instructional environment that is qualitatively
different from the traditional one, and which provides ways of overcoming some
of its curricular shortcomings. This project is developing a calculus-based
introductory physics course utilizing interactive multimedia--a combination of
text, pictures, diagrams, animations, sounds, and animated and/or live-action
video. The grant provides eight interactive multimedia workstations, each
consisting of a Macintosh SE/30 computer and a Pioneer LD 4200 Laserdisc player.
These are managed by a Macintosh IICX computer which is a file server and also
keeps records of student performances for use in evaluation and program
development. Simulations and animations are used to help develop students'
intuition and understanding of physical principles. Interactivity is emphasized.
Mathematical models, including numerical methods, such as used in research and
industry, are being developed. The college will match the award with an equal
amount of funds.
