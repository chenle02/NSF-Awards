Reconfigurable optical interconnects have numerous applications for parallel
processing, photonic switching, and hybrid electronic/optical computational
systems. The principle objective of this program is to evaluate the possibility
of realizing this type of interconnect network with an element which uses a
substrate mode hologram and layers of a material with reversible, photoinduced
anisotropic properties. The substrate mode hologram redirects a totally
internally reflected beam within the substrate, and the recently reported photo-
reversible birefringent material consists of organic azo-dye in a polymer
matrix. This research effort will concentrate on: 1) modeling and fabricating
substrate mode holograms, 2) developing preparation techniques for the photo-
reversible anisotropic material, 3) forming and evaluating the induced
anisotropic effects and polarization holograms formed in this material, and 4)
evaluating interconnect structures which combine substrate mode holograms and
layers of the photo- reversible anisotropic material. This effort will result in
improved understanding of the characteristics of substrate mode holograms and
azo-dye:polymer recording materials. It will also provide a basis for examining
a number of reconfigurable optical interconnect systems.
