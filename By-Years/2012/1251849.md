Deaf researchers are underrepresented in sign language research. The aim of this
project is to broaden the participation of deaf individuals in disciplines that
conduct sign language research. Funding will be used to bring U.S. deaf college
students to the Theoretical Issues in Sign Language Research (TISLR) conference
that will be hosted in London during the summer of 2013 and to provide American
Sign Language interpreting services for these students at the conference. TISLR
is the most significant and well-attended international sign language research
conference. Immediately prior to TISLR, the students will also participate in a
three-day Sign Language Researchers' Toolkit training that will be offered by
the Deafness, Cognition, and Language Centre at the University College London.
The training will include hands-on experience with state-of-the-art equipment
and software for analyses and documentation of signed languages. The knowledge,
skills, resources, and networks the students will acquire in London at the
training and at TISLR will make them better equipped to develop careers in sign
language research.
