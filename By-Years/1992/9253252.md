In an effort to increase both the use of technology and actual data in
education, this project will utilize computers and CD- ROM technology to bring
scientific data and curriculum material developed by NASA, NOAA, and USGS in the
Joint Education Initiative (JEdI) Project into the classroom. The use of these
materials will allow teachers and students to investigate their own questions
relating to global and astronomical phenomena. Scientists that help develop the
CD-ROM discs, university faculty, and industry personnel will serve as mentors
assisting teachers on the access and use of government data and in its
instructional application. Two hundred and twenty- five teachers from around the
country will be trained during the three year project which runs from September
1, 1992 through August 31, 1995. Training will occur at the University of
Maryland (College Park) and Western Washington University. Another 660 teachers
will receive training from lead teachers, increasing the total number of
teachers reached in the project to 885. There will be an approximate cost share
of 27%.
