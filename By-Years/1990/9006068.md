Etching of GaAs and other compound semiconductors is performed with wet
chemical techniques. Wet chemical etching present several limitations, and
therefore the P.I.'s wish to acquire a reactive ion etching (RIE) system. RIE
provides highly anisotropic etching due to kinetically assisted chemical
processes. This anisotropic etching will allow definition of smaller geometries
than are currently possible with wet chemical etching capabilities due to a
reduction in undercutting of masking patterns. With proper conditions, lateral
etch rates close to zero can be obtained with RIE. This is particularly
important for processing GaAs because unlike silicon, GaAs has no liquid
etchants which will result in little or no undercutting of the masking pattern.
Another advantage of RIE is the ability to selectively etch layers. This is due
to the high selectivity of the etchants used. Howevern even when this etchant
selectivity is not possible, one can still selectively remove layers with RIE
due to the easy incorporation of end point detection. End point detection is the
monitoring by spectrometric methods of one or more of the reactants or effluent
to determine when a layer has been removed.
