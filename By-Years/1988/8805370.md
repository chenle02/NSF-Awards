A Gordon Conference on Electron Spectroscopy will be held at the Brewster
Academy in Wolfeboro, N.H. July 18-22, 1988. A range of modern techniques will
be covered, including excitation sources, targets and detectors. Electron
spectroscopy is used as a common thread to draw together and focus diverse
approaches to frontier research topics. Interchanges will occur across the gas
phase/condensed matter boundary and between basic and applied sciences. Invited
speakers will stress the important interdisciplinary relationships.
