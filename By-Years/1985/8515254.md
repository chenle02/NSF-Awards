Topics of concern to the semiconductor manufacturing industry, all of which are
severe, long-term barriers to the future of Very Large Systems Integration
(VLSI) production, will be addressed. The three areas to be investigated in this
research project are: (1) detection of submicron particulates in process gases;
(2) investigation of phenomena associated with the emission of vapors or
particulates from surfaces in clean room manufacturing areas; and (3)
investigation of physical processes that might be used to remove Angstrom sized
particles from gases used in semiconductor manufacturing.
