In this CAREER project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp;
Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. GaÃ«l Ung of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Connecticut is developing molecules capable of
emitting circularly polarized light, light possessing right-handed or left-
handed rotation with respect to the direction of propagation. This next-
generation light source provides potential opportunities to enhance optical
three-dimensional displays, bio-imaging, and security inks. The goal is to
obtain molecules emitting strong circularly polarized luminescence in the
visible and near-infrared region. This is to be achieved by rigorous evaluation
of the relationship between chemical structure and circularly polarized
luminescence properties. This project is tied to a research program supporting
low-income first-generation college students who typically work part- or full-
time to sustain themselves, allowing them to be as successful as other students
who can afford to take research in STEM fields without sacrificing financial
stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Dr. Ung and his group examine
the effect of symmetry, structural rigidity, and coordination geometry on the
circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide complexes. Modular ternary
lanthanide complexes supported by chiral hexadentate ligands have been designed
for the structure-function study. Two specific groups of lanthanides will be
studied, either emitting in the visible region, or in the near-infrared region
of the spectrum. An appropriate combination of chiral ligand and sensitizer will
allow for the synthesis of molecules exhibiting strong circularly polarized
luminescence. The team will also examine the effect of ligand substitution on
the circularly polarized luminescence of chiral copper complexes, providing a
more sustainable alternative for the development of circularly polarized
emitters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
