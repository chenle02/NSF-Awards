9420743 Gindikin This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award supports
travel expenses related to the visits of Drs. S. Gindikin and J.-F. Treves,
Rutgers University, to Sao Paulo, Brazil. The purpose of the visits is to
perform research on Hyperfunctions in Hypo-Analytic Structures. The Brazilian
counterpart in this research is Dr. Paulo Cordaro, from the University of Sao
Paulo, Brazil. The joint work of Cordaro and Treves has led them to a
formulation of hyperfunction theory, especially well suited for the application
to Lie groups representations which were suggested by Gindikin. Cooperative
research should be extended to cover these new applications, and include
Gindikin. Visits of Gindikin to Brazil can cement the collaboration between him
and Cordaro, and possibly lead to joint work between Gindikin and other
Brazilian mathematicians. ***
