Dr. Halpin is attempting to show how physical theory, and quantum mechanics in
particular, can act as a guide to counterfactual logic. Counterfactuals are
statements about what would happen if, counter to fact, certain circumstances
held. Included amongst counterfactuals are important interpretative statements
in quantum mechanics about what would result and with what probability if a
measurement were to be performed. Over the past several years, Dr. Halpin has
developed various negative consequences of physical theory for counterfactual
logic. A number of influential counterfactual theories are inadequate, he has
shown, given basic facts of physics. In contrast and more positively, reasoning
from the physics also supports a new approach to the similarity analysis of
counterfactuals. It is this approach and its motivation which Dr. Halpin is
examining. Much of this research is specific to counterfactuals within the
quantum mechanical context. This research includes the development of the logic
of a probabilistic counterfactual meant to explicate quantum mechanical
probability attribution.
