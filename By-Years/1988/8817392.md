Dr. Dennis is carrying out studies on the detailed mechanisms of action of
cobra venom phospholipase A2 at the lipid-water interface. He has accumulated
evidence that its activity is dramatically affected by interfaces, that it binds
more than one phospholipid at the lipid/water interface and that this binding
can cause both an activation and an aggregation of the enzyme. It is planned to
probe the structural details of the interaction between substrate, activators,
products and the phospholipase A2. Enzymes of lipid metabolism are unique in
that they act physiologically on complex substrate aggregates. Discerning the
means by which these enzymes carry out their cellular functions requires not
only a knowledge of classical enzymology, but also an understanding of how these
large aggregates and the interfaces they form modulate enzyme and substrate
behavior. The goal of this research is to understand how lipolytic enzymes
interact with aggregated lipids and their interfaces. The study also has direct
application to understanding how the phospholipase A, which is involved in
arachidonic acid release for prostaglandin biosynthesis, acts.***//
