The research will develop a new technique for materials processing. The
technique will demonstrate the fabrication of a composite Nb3Sn superconductor
and will offer the promise of greater economy in manufacture and improved
performance. In the technique, a ductile matrix contains particles of a brittle
material that are made to deform by the hydrostatic force in the ductile matrix.
The material in wire form will be heated briefly to a temperature above the
recrystallization temperature of the ductile component that will transmit the
deformation force hydrostatically to the brittle component. The wire will be
heated at die entrance, deformed in the die, and quenched at die exit. The time
at temperature for any point on the wire will be only a few seconds and
undesired diffusion will not occur. The research should produce more reliable
and economical Nb3Sn conductors for fusion energy device magnets, NMR Magnets,
Accelerator Magnets, etc. and provide new techniques for the deformation of
brittle powders.
