The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting will be held in
Phoenix, AZ, October 11-14, 2017. This award will fund several competitive
travel grant programs as well as professional development activities targeted at
underrepresented groups and those that may not otherwise be able to participate
in the conference. The competitive travel grant programs include: students (12),
career development awards for underrepresented post-doctoral trainees and young
professionals, including junior faculty (20); and NSBE members interested in
biomedical engineering who have not previously been BMES members (25). In
addition, funding is sought for a Career Pathways in Biomedical Engineering
session and a High School Visitation program for students from Phoenix high
schools that do not have enhanced STEM programs and targeting underrepresented
groups. Finally, a small amount of funding is sought for 5 poster awards. The
meeting will feature 19 Program Tracks with the theme "Engineering Personalized
Medicine and Therapies." Approximately 800 oral presentations, 1600 poster
presentations and over 4,000 participants are anticipated. The BMES Annual
Meeting serves as a primary vehicle for scientific sharing and dissemination of
the latest advances in biomedical engineering, as well as a facilitator of
important cross-fertilizations between the life sciences and engineering
technologies, which foster a multi-disciplinary approach in the practice of
Biomedical Engineering. The travel awards will afford the opportunity for young
investigators and investigators from underrepresented groups to attend the
Annual Meeting, be informed on the latest scientific and technological advances
in Biomedical Engineering, and help support BMES members involved in research
and training focused on health disparities and minority health. The partnership
with NSBE is specifically targeted at supporting underrepresented engineers with
an interest in biomedical engineering.

The overall aims of this award are to support the professional development of
students and underrepresented groups. Through a series of travel awards, a
Career Pathways Session, a high school visitation program, and poster awards,
this grant will provide opportunities for increased diversity among the meeting
attendees and participation in the meeting's networking and diversity
activities. BMES is the premier biomedical engineering conference in the United
States, covering all areas within the broad discipline. It brings together
researchers with backgrounds in engineering and biomedical science to discuss
the latest advances in the field and support the professional development of the
next generation of biomedical engineers.
