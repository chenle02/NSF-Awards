This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Toreki's Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. The research will deal with the synthesis of rigid
polymeric solid-state organometallic and inorganic frameworks. Specifically,
functionalized tetraarylsilanes will be reacted with various metal complexes to
form three-dimensional polymeric networks containing alternating metal- and
silicon-centered units. A specific example of such a polymer will be the product
formed by the reaction of four equivalents of iron pentacarbonyl with a
phosphine-substituted tetraarylsilane. Morphological control of cavity, pore and
channel formation will be achieved by the selection of metal complexes and the
nature of the linking functionalities. It is expected that these materials will
afford efficient heterogeneous catalysts for processes such as hydrogenation and
hydroformylation. %%% The inherent rational design of these supramolecular
architectures permits the facile tailoring of their specific properties, pore
dimensions and topologies and defines a fundamental new class of innovative
materials.
