This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports research
in biology to be conducted by Dr. Jose R. Lemos of the Worcester Foundation for
Experimental Biology, Dr. Roger Y. Tsien of the University of California, San
Diego and Dr. Ernesto J. Podesta of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
The project focuses on the fact that the interaction of a peptide with the
appropriate receptors on a cell surface, and the subsequent signal transduction
are some of the most important steps in the mechanism of peptide hormone action.
The approach will allow study of the mechanism of peptide hormone stimulation of
steroid secretion. The aim of the project is to understand stimulus- secretion
coupling. Using state-of-the-art techniques, the investigators will examine the
compartmentalization of the cAMP-mediated response of individual Leydig cells to
hormonal stimulation. The award will allow continuation of a productive
U.S.-Argentina collaboration.
