This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
meeting "Workshop in Operator Theory : Recent Trends and Applications " a
workshop that will take place during May 3-5, 2018, on the campus of the
University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. Additional information about the
conference can be found on the website

The focus of the meeting "Workshop in Operator Theory : Recent Trends and
Applications" is on long-standing open problems in operator theory. It will also
provide an update on recent important contributions to the field. A concerted
effort will be made to include underrepresented graduate students, including
women, and early career mathematicians in the workshop. In addition, it planned
to create a future network of support and interaction among participants to
enable further research and collaboration. This will be an significant
conference in operator theory and funding that will offer early career
mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups the opportunity to become
involved in state-of-the-art research in operator theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
