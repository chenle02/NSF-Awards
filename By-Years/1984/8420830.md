Highway planners must consider the flow of traffic on the network of roads in a
community. The data required is concerned with the number of vehicles coming
into an area from different directions, and the extent to which they aggregate
in certain paths. This type of information is needed to plan new highways, widen
some, and abandon others. This project will develop a mathematical approach to
the aggregation and accumulation of vehicles from different sets of highway
networks.
