The overall purpose of this project is to develop decision aids and
methodological guidelines for performing risk assessments of low-probability,
high-consequence events at large-scale technological facilities. The decision
aids and methodological guidelines will cover (1) methods for identifying
combinations of failures that could lead to high-consequence accidents; (2)
methods for estimating the probabilities of such accidents (especially when
there is no historical experience upon which to base such estimates); and (3)
methods for estimating the health, safety, and environmental consequences of
such accidents. Detailed case studies will be used to examine and compare the
strengths and weaknesses of alternative decision aids and methodological
approaches.
