EIA-0205456&lt;br/&gt;Joshi. Aravind K&lt;br/&gt;University of
Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Language, Learning, and Modeling
Biological Sequences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent significant advances in natural
language processing such as the integration of grammatical and probabilistic
machine-learning techniques have not been exploited for modeling biological
sequences. These new techniques are highly relevant to the biological domain
because they support the integration of sequence features at several scales,
from dependencies between successive items through dependencies involving
complex structures to overall sequence statistics. Hence, the major goals to be
pursued are: (1) Development of new techniques for integrating grammatical and
probabilistic information, in particular, integration and evaluation of
grammatical, probabilistic, and approximate counting methods for fold prediction
in secondary and tertiary structures of biomolecules. (2) Development and
evaluation of probabilistic exponential models for gene finding, in particular
genes for apicoplast-targeted proteins in eukaryotic human pathogens of the
phylum `Apicomplexa'. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is highly
interdisciplinary, involving the disciplines of computer science, biology and
linguistics. It will have a significant impact on the modeling of biological
sequences. It will also provide a wonderful opportunity to train new researchers
to carry out this interdisciplinary research, thus contributing to science and
mathematical education and human resource development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research arose out of many discussions that took place at a landmark
workshop on `Language Modeling of Biological Data' held at the University of
Pennsylvania in February 2001.&lt;br/&gt;
