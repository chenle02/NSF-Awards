This Phase I Small Business Research Innovation Project focuses on the
development of a state of the art parameter estimation code. Many phenomena in
science and engineering are described by systems of ordinary linear differential
equations (ODEs). Often, although it is possible to write out the equations
which govern the system, the coefficients or parameters which describe the rate
of the various processes are unknown. If the researcher has data describing the
operation of the system, these parameters can be determined from the data. This
process is called parameter estimation. Parameter estimation problems are common
in many areas, including chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, biology,
epidemiology and control theory. Unfortunately, not only are such problems
extremely difficult to solve in practice, but there is no robust public domain
or commercial code available. Thus, the objective of this project is to
demonstrate that a method known as `domain decomposition` is considerably more
robust than the current standard method `the black box method`, that the code
can be written so that the user does not have to be a parameter estimation
expert, and that the code can be run on a standard PC.
