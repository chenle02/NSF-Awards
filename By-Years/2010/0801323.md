The discovery of new physics at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron
Collider that will soon begin operation at CERN is not simple, and often
requires some knowledge about the exact nature of the new physics. Two questions
stand out as being of critical importance. What are the best candidate theories
for physics beyond the Standard Model that address the hierarchy problem?
Secondly , how well can the LHC experiment test each of these theories? The
research to be performed by the PI is aimed at addressing precisely these two
questions. He has proposed two new classes of theories, twin Higgs theories and
folded supersymmetric theories, that address the&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy problem up
to the highest energy scales accessible to the LHC. He plans to study these
theories in greater detail, with particular emphasis on their collider
signatures. He also proposes to work on ultra-violet completions of these
theories that extend their validity to higher energies, with particular
attention to their predictions for weak scale physics. He further plans to
investigate new models of electroweak symmetry breaking based on these ideas.
The broader implications of the research project relate to the PI acting as a
bridge between experimentalists and Theorists at the University of Maryland and
at Johns Hopkins University. The PI will also participate in&lt;br/&gt;the
training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as Postdoctoral Fellows.
He will help coordinate joint seminars between the University of Maryland and
Johns Hopkins University.&lt;br/&gt;
