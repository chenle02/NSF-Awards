Supply chain refers to the system that moves goods from where they are produced
to where they are consumed. This system includes manufacturing, assembly,
warehousing, transportation, and retailing processes. This project will study
how to improve efficiency and robustness of the supply chain by using novel
machine learning techniques to control the supply chain automatically. The
project specifically focuses on the development of decision-making strategies to
deal with uncertainties and correct disruptions in the supply chain system. In
collaboration with an industrial partner, Siemens, the project will focus on a
real supply chain application related to the production and distribution of
radiopharmaceuticals (an important component in health diagnostics). The
advancements in supply chain and machine learning resulting from this project
have potential to benefit a wide range of industries.

This project studies a new approach for using machine learning (ML) as a tool
for optimizing, analyzing and controlling supply chains. Current approach to
supply chain operations makes assumptions about statistical distributions of
uncertain factors in supply chain and uses predictive techniques or forecasts to
estimate the few parameters required to characterize these distributions. These
estimated distributions are then used in the analysis and control of the supply
chain. This project has a novel approach of combining the data-analysis and
supply-chain optimization stages into a single ML algorithm. The project focuses
on two main classes of supply chain problems: production and distribution of
radiopharmaceuticals (a core problem for the industrial partner, Siemens), and
early warnings and corrective actions for stochastic supply chains. In addition,
the project will make methodological contributions to the theory and
implementation of ML algorithms, including new loss functions, techniques for
using deep learning as a preprocessing step for reinforcement learning, adaptive
strategies to handle non-stationary data, and improved initialization methods
for ML. The tools and concepts to be develop will be generalizable more broadly,
both within and beyond supply chain.
