Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing an
integrated laboratory to support courses on power electronics, adjustable
electric drives, and harmonic filters and compensators by adapting laboratory
material developed by a nationally prominent program at the University of
Minnesota. In addition, the investigators are introducing new experiments,
developing interfaces for computer control of the instruments, and introducing
Internet tools for distant access to some features of the laboratory. Finally,
they are creating a new course on harmonic filters and compensators design. The
evaluation process will use an evaluation of student products and a self-
assessment survey to characterize changes in student leaning outcomes resulting
for this laboratory experience. The PIs' plan to disseminate their experiences
through the widely attended, national workshop on teaching power electronics and
electric drives.&lt;br/&gt;
