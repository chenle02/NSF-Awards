This work concentrates on the study of a simple deterministic model of flow
through a network. Both analytical and numerical investigations of the
properties of the model are performed. An approach to flow control in
communication networks is developed which is based on formulating the problem as
a Stackelberg game. Flow control is accomplished by pricing schemes.
