This award supports cooperative research between Dr. Michael Saso of the
University of Hawaii, and Professor Lai Yonghai of Nanjing University on the
sociological aspects of the restoration of religion in the People's Republic of
China. The research will involve a survey of selected major Buddhist and Taoist
religious centers to investigate the popular involvement in the restoration of
customary practice, and to collect and compare texts which document the
practices and theology of these two important religions. The recent policy of
freedom of religious practice in China has brought about a revival of Buddhist
and Taoist studies, which have again become accepted in China as part of
university-sponsored research. This collaborative research will provide an
opportunity to gain insight into a profound social process and into the
evolution of the relationship between a socialist government and religious
structures. This project is supported under the US/PRC Protocol on Cooperation
in Basic Sciences.
