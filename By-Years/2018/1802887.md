This award will support the participation of early-career, US-based researchers
at the workshop "Automorphic forms on Reductive Groups and their Covers" to be
held June 25-28, 2018 at the FIM Institute for Mathematical Research, at ETH
Zuerich in Zurich, Switzerland. The conference will focus on recent advances in
automorphic forms and automorphic representations, particularly those related to
covering (metaplectic) groups. Participating researchers are from the US,
Israel, Europe, South Korea, and Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic
forms and automorphic representations are topics with historical origins in
number theory, but recent advances have led to new and surprising connections
with mathematical physics. A particular theme of the conference will be the uses
of small automorphic representations in both number theory and string theory.
The web site for the conference may be found at https://www.math.ethz.ch/fim/con

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
