Objective: The objective of this program is to develop scalable
nanomanufacturing technologies for the production of high-energy density
electrochemical capacitors, consisting of nanostructured electrodes with
controllable charged defect density and redox polymers. This aspect of nanoscale
engineering is transformative in that the constituent electrodes have a unique
combination of both double-layer and redox capacitance, with very large area
leading to higher energy density and low electrical resistance for enhanced
power density.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit
is defined through the scope of the work, which aims to integrate from the
bottom up, all the necessary processes for a carbon based high energy storage
density device. This includes nanostructure synthesis through a roll-to-roll
process, plasma processing for electrical charge introduction, in-line metrology
to provide real-time monitoring of the structural properties, for the ultimate
purpose of deploying fully functional capacitors. Fundamental insights into
electrochemical mechanisms and material interactions will be obtained and
applied to the development of proof-of-concept devices and prototype
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are the
development of high-energy density carbon nanomaterials compatible with large-
scale device fabrication technologies, and extending the reach of nanotechnology
to budding scientists and the wider community. The potential applications for
high-energy electrochemical capacitors range from small-scale portable
electronics (requiring high power density and large cycle life) to large-format
energy management. In addition to promoting graduate and undergraduate education
and training on nanotechnology and process integration, outreach activities will
promote novel energy technologies.
