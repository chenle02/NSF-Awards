ECS-9700651 Makram This proposal describes the existence of "unbalance" in power
systems and draws the attention of the reader to the alarming and growing
presence of harmonic unbalance in power systems created as a result of the,
random use of single, double and three phase harmonic loads in power systems.
While prior attempts to characterize unbalance in power systems have been
typically unclear, a review of the current literature shows no attempts to
characterize harmonic unbalance although it is important, useful and necessary
from both an academic and practical point of view. Beginning with the
development of advanced three phase load models for commonly used power system
loads, this project endeavors to undertake the critical task of proposing a
metric that quantifies harmonic unbalance. This new quantitative metric that
characterizes power system harmonic unbalance bears a large impact on the
utility in terms of modifying existing tariff structures, better instrumentation
& metering and power quality studies. Using the proposed metric, unbalance
profiles will be studied and limits for the safe operation of customer equipment
will be established. This proposal aims to conclude with setting standards for
harmonic unbalance in power systems, thereby enhancing basic research in the
understanding of harmonic unbalance in Power Systems.
