This is an investigation of a new importance sampling technique called twisted
simulation. In the i.i.d. case it corresponds to simulating the events of
interest via an exponentially shifted version of the direct simulation
probability measures. In the finite dimensional Markov chains of i.i.d. random
variables the method is optimal over a large class of importance sampling
distributions in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic variance of the
estimates. The work may be extended to more useful probability models, in
particular Markov additive processes and multidimensional event sets. The
theoretical extensions require different analysis techniques than have been used
previously. The techniques and tools involved will be sophisticated and
involved, bust due to the conjectured optimality of the method, the effort
expended on these theoretical investigations should have substantial payoff in
applications. The methods promise to provide a rigorous structure for the
pursuit of the study of simulation of systems with memory.
