The Advanced Technology Environmental and Energy Center, the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE), and the Partnership for Environmental Technology Education are
partnering to build the nation's capacity for educating technicians to work in
the energy industry. The Sustainable Energy Education and Training (SEET)
project is (1) increasing community college and high school technology
instructors' technical knowledge of sustainable energy by hosting annual 10-day
professional development workshops about advances in energy technology,
technician training requirements, renewable energy, and energy efficiency and
conservation for 75 instructors at DOE sites around the country, (2) promoting
ongoing learning and teaching of sustainable energy by creating a resource-rich
SEET website and a network of educators, and (3) promoting ongoing peer learning
and teaching by having SEET participants conduct annual energy-related webinars
for educators nationwide and having participants conduct professional
development events in their local communities. An external evaluator is
measuring the impact of project activities on participating instructors and
their students.
