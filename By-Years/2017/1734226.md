The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Directorate for
Education and Human Resources Programs, will conduct and implement a second STEM
Mentors Alumni Meeting with recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence
in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) and the AAAS
Lifetime Mentoring Awards in April 2017. The theme of the meeting is "STEM
Mentoring 2030: Emerging Strategies for Inclusion". The meeting continues the
discussion of effective science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
mentoring practices at all critical pathways (K-12, community college and
technical institutes, 4-year and other colleges and universities, graduate and
postdoctoral scholars and early career STEM professionals) leading to STEM
degree attainment and/or successful entry and retention in the STEM workforce.
The project will be guided by a planning committee that will include PAESMEM and
AAAS Mentor awardees.

Participants will continue to reflect on what is known about effective science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educational and career mentoring
and identify new directions for regional approaches to effective STEM mentoring.

The objectives for the proposed STEM Mentors alumni meeting are to:

(a) review current research on the progress of STEM mentoring to Develop a
Research and Action Agenda on STEM Career and Workforce Mentoring;

(b) identify and summarize what is known about effective STEM Mentoring at all
educational and career stages, including a discussion of research on mentoring
with invited authors;

(c) identify key strategies and tools to address regional needs and/or scale-up
effective STEM mentoring over the next 10 years, at all educational and career
stages;

An online report highlighting findings from the meeting will be produced,
including tools and resources. The on-line report and recommended tools will
promote inclusive mentoring practices in all educational settings and an
inclusive workplace. Creating a sense of belonging in STEM significantly
increases the representation of underrepresented minorities, women,and persons
with disabilities in all STEM fields.
