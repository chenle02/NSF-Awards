This research is in the area of interacting particle systems, which are
stochastic models for large systems of interacting components. These systems
model such phenomena as competition of species, epidemics, spread of genetic
traits, and catalytic chemical reactions. The investigator plans to study the
temporal limit behavior of some particular classes of interacting particle
systems. Specific models to be studied include the voter model, a catalyst
model, and an interacting diffusion model. This research in probability theory
is in the area of interacting particle systems. These are stochastic models for
large systems of interacting components. Among the phenomena these systems model
are competition of species, epidemics, spread of genetic traits, and catalytic
chemical reactions.
