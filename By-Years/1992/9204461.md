This research addresses unsolved problems in software portability. Portability
of a software unit (application program or component) is its ability to be
transported and adapted to a new hardware/software environment at a cost
significantly less than complete redevelopment. As far as possible, portable
software should also take advantage of the specific capabilities of the target
environment. The continuing proliferation of both applications and environments
has made portability an increasingly critical need which, in many cases, is
largely unfulfilled. The goal is to develop and validate new methods to improve
portability of software units during the design process, and to improve support
for portability in computing environments. These methods will improve
portability for conventional software, and extend portability to new software
classes such as real-time and concurrent software. Part of our work is to
explore relationships between portability and reusability. Another important
part of our study is the investigation of methods to specify and measure
portability requirements and attributes. The research will use both analytical
and experimental methods. Planned activities include a survey of existing
strategies and methods; analysis of portability problems for selected new
classes of software; development of methods to specify portability requirements
and attributes, and metrics to quantify the costs and benefits of portability;
comparison of potential strategies for specific classes of software using these
specifications and metrics; and evaluation of promising strategies by selected
experimental implementations.
