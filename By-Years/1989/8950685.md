Six component sting balances were installed in the existing subsonic wind tunnel
which overcomes the accuracy and reliability problems of the previous
instrumentation. Experiments will be performed using a modern data acquisition
system which exposes the students to both the flow phenomena and the techniques
of flow measurement and data acquisition. This award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
