component of many large-scale configurable systems because it enables dynamic
adaptability of system behavior by changing policy configurations without
reprogramming the systems. Policy evaluation, the process of checking whether a
request satisfies a policy, is typically the performance bottleneck of policy-
based systems. Most prior research has focused on the correctness (i.e.,
specification, design, and analysis) of policies. While correctness is an
important issue, the adoption of policy-based computing may be limited if the
resulting systems are not implemented efficiently and thus perform poorly. The
high-level research objective of this project is to increase the effectiveness
and adoption of policy-based computing by designing high performance policy
evaluation algorithms and engines that can be adapted to support various policy
languages. The primary focus of this project is the fast evaluation of security
policies, which are most prevalent. To speed up policy evaluation, this research
uses two unique approaches: policy normalization and canonical policy
representation. The idea of policy normalization is to convert a policy with a
complex logical structure to an equivalent policy with a simple logical
structure. The idea of canonical policy representation is to convert a given
policy to its canonical form. The techniques developed in this effort will be
useful beyond this project. The results will greatly benefit society by
increasing the adoption of policy-based computing. To promote education and
learning, this effort actively involves high school, undergraduate, graduate
students, especially students from under-represented minorities.
