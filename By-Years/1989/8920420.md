This is a project to extend, implement, and evaluate a special-purpose
programming language for computer vision. The language, called Apply, includes
parallel constructs for local vision operators that are compiled differently for
different architectures. The extension being developed includes constructs for
global control through divide-and- conquer, and is intended to allow portable
parallel programs that can be ported between dissimilar architectures to be
written. A compiler for extended Apply is available for each of several
different parallel architectures, and compiled code is being compared to
handwritten code on each architecture. In addition, a widely used package of
vision routines is being rewritten in the extended language and distributed for
evaluation within several applications groups.
