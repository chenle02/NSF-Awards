Cosmic rays have been observed up to energies in excess of 10^20 eV. It is not
at all clear how these particles are accelerated up to such energies, since
standard acceleration scenarios have difficulties above 10^15 eV or so. It is
clear, though, that the sources of these extremely high energy cosmic rays must
be nearby. Otherwise interactions with the microwave background will degrade the
particle energies, and thereby prevent them from getting to us from distant
sources. The Auger experiment is designed to study these highest energy
particles. Auger would be the first air shower array large enough (9000 km^2-sr)
to detect a reasonable number of 10^20 eV events, and it should have sufficient
angular resolution (1 degree) to trace them back to their sources in the sky.
This proposal will aid in the Auger project development through simulation of
cosmic ray showers in the detectors.
