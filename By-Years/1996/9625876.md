The adsorption of water and water/X mixtures on model activated carbons will be
studied using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo techniques with biased sampling as
needed. Such simulations are very demanding because of the hydrogen-bonding
between the various species; such bonds are relatively long lived, and long
simulations are needed to ensure ergodic behavior. Large systems are also needed
to avoid size effects. This project will study pure water on an activated carbon
surface, in which oxygenated surface sites are attached to the surface and can
H-bond to the H atom in the water molecules. The effect of variation in the
density of sites, species of sites, and geometric arrangement of sites on the
surface will be studied. In particular the effect of these variables on the
absorption, filling mechanism, and heats of adsorption will be of interest. This
will be followed by studies of water/X mixtures on such surfaces. Initially, X
will be a hydrocarbon, methane or benzene. The pore filling mechanism for the
hydrocarbon and water are expected to be completely different, so that variation
of the site parameters is likely to have a decisive effect on the selectivity of
the pore for one of the components, and selectivity inversion is likely to be
seen. Later studies will include the case where X is acetic acid. Both benzene
and acetic acid are of practical interest, since they are EPA priority
pollutants. The selectivity mechanism for acetic acid will be subtle and
difficult to predict in advance of the simulations, since both water and acetic
acid can bond to the surface. Parallel codes will be developed for these
simulation on the IBM SP/2 at Cornell.
