The goal of this project is the isolation of individual elementary reactions
relevant to the sulfur/nitrogen interaction in combustion systems and the
characterization of their reaction kinetics over a wide range of temperature.
Short-lived reactive species including atoms of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and
sulfur and diatomic radicals such as NH, NH2, CN, SO, CS, and SH are generated
by pulsed ultraviolet excimer-laser or flash-lamp photolysis of precursor
molecules. The concentration of transient radical species are monitored with
time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy - laser-induced fluorescence for
molecular radicals and vacuum-ultraviolet resonance fluorescence for atomic
species - to obtain rate constants and product identification as functions of
temperature and pressure. Reactions are studied under pseudo-first-order
conditions with a large excess of the stable reactant. Experiments include
reactions of radicals with stable molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur
dioxide, and nitric oxide and also radical-radical reactions involving SO. The
interaction of nitrogen and sulfur chemistry within flames and exhaust gases
influences the generation of nitrogen oxides from combustion and thusly impacts
acid rain, photochemical smog, and tropospheric ozone. Depending on conditions,
sulfur may augment or reduce the amounts of nitrogen oxides emitted. This study
investigates the underlying chemistry of this interaction. This project provides
a vehicle for the participation of undergraduate and secondary-school students
through the Texas Academy of Math and Science and the Upward Bound Math and
Science Program.
