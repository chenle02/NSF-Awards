The principal theme of this research is the application of group-theoretic
techniques to a wide variety of search problems. The ultimate objective is to
combine algebraic techniques with standard search methods to solve "hard
problems" which are currently solvable by neither method alone. This requires
the interaction of three major research efforts: the study of efficient
algorithms for performing fundamental group computations; the development of an
experimental system for testing algorithmic ideas on both sequential and
parallel machines; and the exploration of methods for representing search
problems in an algebraic setting and tools for solving them. The algorithms to
be studied play a fundamental role in the development of general algorithms for
computing with groups as well as for application of group theory to real world
problems. Applications are diverse and range from isomorphism testing of
combinatorial objects to the transportation problems in operations research.
Both algorithms and applications will be implemented in both a traditional
sequential environment engineered to support experimentation with a variety of
data structures and techniques, and, where suitable, on a massively parallel
SIMD machine.
