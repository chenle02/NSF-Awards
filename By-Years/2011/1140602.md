The focus of this project is to develop, implement and evaluate
interdisciplinary science education materials, contextualized around the quest
for drug discovery to treat neglected diseases. In order to solve this
intellectual challenge, students are trained in chemical synthesis,
computational analysis and biological evaluation through problem solving in each
of these core scientific disciplines. As part of their course work, students
gain general literacy regarding the application of science to solving important
humanitarian problems, learn about the drug discovery process, use integrated
STEM skills, and participate in national and international student and teacher
collaborations. Independent professional assessment is part of the project
design. Intellectual merit includes development of educational materials that
will enable students to learn about the drug discovery process and perform
significant research with no predetermined outcome during their undergraduate
education. Broader impacts include the self-contained modules of lectures and
labs, produced to achieve a readily disseminated, contextualized,
multidisciplinary science laboratory experience that are simple, reproducible
and inexpensive.
