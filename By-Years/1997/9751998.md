Southeast Community College (SCC) in Lincoln, Nebraska, in partnership with the
University of Nebraska, the DuPont Company, 36 community colleges across the
country, 7 industry representatives, and an advisory board, is continuing to
spearhead efforts to reform the curriculum and materials for community college
chemical technology educational programs in the United States. This project,
entitled "Assignment: Chemical Technology II", or ACT-II, is continuing the work
of the current NSF-supported project (DUE 9553674) awarded to SCC in 1995
("Assignment: Chemical Technology - I, or ACT-I), in which the curriculum and
student materials for the first-year chemistry course in these technology
programs is targeted. The ACT-II project targets four major areas: 1) the
laboratory program for the first-year chemistry course, 2) the analytical
chemistry and organic/biochemistry courses, including laboratories, found in the
second year of these programs, 3) multimedia materials to include world wide web
supplements and CD-ROM materials, to complete the work already begun for the
first-year course and to also address the second-year courses, 4) a distance
learning component to assist in the training of incumbent chemistry technician
in these topics. The curriculum and materials developed is being guided in part
by the Voluntary Industry Skill Standards for the chemical process and
bioscience industries, Good Laboratory and Management Practices (GLP and GMP),
and safety and occupational health issues.
