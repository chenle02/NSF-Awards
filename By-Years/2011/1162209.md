The research objective of this award is to apply techniques from quantum
chemistry to predict the catalyzed chemical wear rate of tools used in single
point diamond turning of alloys with varying composition, and then to validate
those predictions. Current theory successfully predicts diamond wear rates for
elemental metals, based on atomic electronic structures, but the predictions do
not apply to alloys. A metric for predicting diamond wear when cutting alloys
will be generated based on the electronic structure of alloys, using a method
with linear combinations of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals in metals
and alloys. Wear rates for a range of alloys will be determined using a novel
interferometric technique and compared with the new metric. Chemical reaction
rates depend on local temperature, which depends on material properties and tool
edge condition (wear). Cutting temperatures will be measured using a novel
pyrometric method and cutting forces will be measured using a dynamometer. These
data will be used to normalize wear rates.

If successful, this work will provide a method of selecting optimum alloy
compositions for such rapidly emerging technologies as roll-to-roll production
of complex films or next generation optical molds for high volume optoelectronic
products. The currently expensive, and time consuming, testing of tool wear for
every alloy composition will be eliminated. In addition, the results will
stimulate new thinking across diverse parts of the research community. The
proposed experimental techniques will be useful in other areas of precision
machining research. The transformative change in thinking about catalytic
activity in alloys may impact areas ranging from diamond synthesis to coal
gasification. It also suggests developing alloys with properties optimized for
structural as well as catalytic behaviors.
