This is an international study that will collect sample survey data on student
achievement in the use of computers by elementary and secondary school students
in the United States. It is the second phase of the Computers in Education Study
designed by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement (IEA). The study's purpose is to provide comparisons between
countries in level of study knowledge and use of word processing, spreadsheets,
and general purposes of personal computers. It will also provide time trend
information about the uses of computers in schools; their function and
integration with the traditional curriculum.//
