Traditional biochemical approaches have been largely unsuccessful in the study
of the membrane-bound enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. The characterization
of mutants of Arabidopsis deficient in lipid biosynthesis provides opportunities
to clone the genes involved without first purifying the corresponding proteins.
Chromosome walking will undoubtedly be successful, but this approach requires a
very large amount of effort for each gene cloned. This project determines
whether any mutants in lipid metabolism can be identified in a population of
1,800 Arabidopsis lines containing stably integrated T-DNA inserts. When a
mutation is found and shown to cosegregate with the kanamycin resistance marker
located in the T-DNA, then a substantial effort to complete the cloning and
characterization of the gene is justified. Fatty acid unsaturation is a
determinant of the quality and economic value of the product from oilseed crop
species. Because of the importance of unsaturated fatty acids in human health,
it would be advantageous to be able to control the degree of unsaturation of the
lipids in these species. A crucial step toward this goal is to understand the
molecular basis of desaturation. This research provides for this by identifying
fatty acid mutants to be used for the isolation and cloning of genes encoding
the enzymes responsible for desaturation. This further allows for the
development of strategies to alter usefully the fatty acid composition of
vegatable oils.
