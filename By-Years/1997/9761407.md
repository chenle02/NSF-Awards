*** 9761407 Akselband This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
addresses novel isolation and culture methods for marine microbial isolates in
order to take advantage of the vast diversity of ocean environments. To date,
little study has been directed toward natural products from marine bacteria due
to difficulties isolating and culturing producing organisms. It is estimated
that fewer than 5% of marine bacteria can be cultured and isolated using
standard methods. Phase I will develop a method for isolating, culturing, and
assaying marine microorganisms for active substances. Single cell encapsulation
will be combined with high-throughput screening methods to allow analysis of
small subpopulations of cells producing substances for therapeutic and
industrial products. This technique will allow cloning of slow growing organisms
that can not be isolated using other methods. Development of new isolation
methods is expected to enhance rapid automated natural product screening of
marine as well as terrestrial samples. Marine organisms represent a vast
potential source of novel bioactive metabolites. Improved isolation, culturing,
and screening methods will permit commercial screening for useful therapeutic
and industrial products. ***
