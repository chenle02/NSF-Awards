9309006 Espinosa The purpose of this Research Initiation Award is to develop a
constitutive model for brittle amorphous materials, such as ceramics and glass,
for dynamic loading. In particular, pressure- shear experiments on glass thin
films, in which high shear stresses, high strain rates and high pressure are
imposed, offer ideal conditions for the derivation and validation of a
constitutive model describing these amorphous materials. Such a model will be
incorporated in micromechanical simulations of alumina polycrystals under the
conditions of plate impact experiments. The postulated model is expected to
predict such phenomena as damage-induced anisotrophy and shear localization.
Model validation will be accomplished by comparison of simulated and
interferometrically measured velocity histories in normal impact and pressure-
shear experiments conducted on alumina samples.
