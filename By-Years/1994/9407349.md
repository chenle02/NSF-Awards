9407349 Beissinger Abstract Offspring represent parental investment in the
future. In evolutionary terms, this means that parents should generally behave
in ways that maximize the number of offspring they raise. Certain aspects of
this fundamental biological question can be particularly well-studied in birds
because birds control the development of their young by when and how they
incubate eggs. Dr. Beissinger will test several hypotheses about the adaptive
nature of parental behavior through a series of field experiments which will
examine different adaptive functions of incubation behavior. The results will be
integrated into a hierarchical model of reproduction and will help to develop
our understanding of the biology of reproduction. In addition, because many
close relatives of the species Dr. Beissinger works with are endangered, this
research will have implications for conservation biology.
