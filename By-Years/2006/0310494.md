This proposal from the University of Chicago requests support for a group
participating in the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron, currently the
world's highest energy accelerator. The particular goal of this research is to
understand electroweak symmetry breaking, which in the Standard Model of
particle physics is described by the Higgs mechanism, The physics associated
with this mechanism, and the Higgs boson itself, is poorly understood and
tested. However, one can infer the properties of the boson by indirect probes
using precision measurements of electroweak observables such as the W-boson
mass, the top-quark mass and the Z-boson properties via quantum corrections.
This investigator plans to measure the top-quark properties, including its mass,
and the W mass with the Tevatron Run 2b data. She also plans on working on
future projects that will provide better sensitivities to these physics
measurements, namely the upgrade of the Silicon Vertex Trigger and the hardware
track finder project for the ATLAS experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this
work, many younger physicists, including under-represented minorities and women,
will be trained. The work on the silicon and triggering systems will strengthen
international ties in science and can be expected to have a broader impact on
the electronics technology.&lt;br/&gt;
