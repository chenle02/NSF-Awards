This dissertation research investigates the grammar of complex sentences
(sentences which contain a dependent clause as well as a main clause) in
Sundanese, a language spoken by the second largest ethnic group in Indonesia.
The primary goals are to describe various Sundanese sentences containing clausal
complements (the dependent clause) and to compare their structure with that of
other languages of the world in order to test various hypotheses of contemporary
linguistic theory.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Indigenous to western Java, Sundanese
is spoken by approximately 34 million speakers, making it the third most widely
spoken language in Indonesia (following Indonesian and Javanese). Despite the
large number of speakers, Sundanese has received surprisingly little attention
in the Western linguistics literature even though there is a fairly robust
literature of closely related languages. Furthermore, what literature there is
does not address the sentence-types to be examined here in any systematic or
comprehensive way. Thus, this study will fill a sizable gap in our knowledge of
the language and will provide a repository of data that will contribute to
current and future linguistic debates. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since no
exhaustive descriptions of these structures currently exist, compilation of
primary linguistic data is a crucial component of the project. Bandung,
Indonesia will serve as the principal location for data collection, which will
be conducted by the native-speaker co-PI. Several methods will be used to gather
the necessary data: direct elicitation (face-to-face sessions with native
speakers getting acceptability judgments), recorded conversations and oral
narratives, written texts, and existing accounts of the language. The resulting
corpus of sentences and recordings will constitute a repository of data
available to other researchers and interested members of the public.
