This award is made in the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. Surfactant bilayers
supported on colloidal particles will be developed as a new medium for
photochemical energy conversion. Vectorial energy and electron transfer
reactions within the bilayer will be initiated by aromatic hydrocarbons promoted
to their triplet state either by direct photoexcitation or by sensitization with
Ru(II)polypyridine complexes. The inorganic supports will be based on silica
and/or alumina. These supports will be activated for participation in the
bilayer-mediated photoevents by the incorporation of photosensitizers or redox-
active metal ions into the inorganic oxide matrix. Laser flash photolysis will
be used to determine relevant spectral, kinetic, and thermodynamic parameters
for the desired chain of events resulting in either triplet energy migration or
charge separation across the supported bilayer membranes. %%% This project is
expected to contribute to a fundamental understanding of membrane-mediated
energy conversion processes, and ultimately to the design of molecular devices
that capture light and store it by chemical means as fuel.
