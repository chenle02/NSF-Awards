This project will provide undergraduate students at the University of Michigan-
Dearborn with experimental capabilities afforded by modern HPLC instrumentation.
The equipment will be used in courses throughout the curriculum, including
organic, advanced organic, advanced inorganic, analytical, and environmental
chemistry laboratories, biochemistry, molecular biology, and a special course in
chromatographic separations. Undergraduates will perform experiments which
illustrate the multidisciplinary uses of HPLC and the variety of analytical
applications of this powerful, widely used experimental technique, from compound
identification and percent product distribution to design and optimization of
separation systems. The students will gain experience with both refractive index
and ultraviolet/visible absorbance detectors, and with microprocessor control of
HPLC instrumentation.
