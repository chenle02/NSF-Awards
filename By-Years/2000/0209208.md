This project will investigate bidding strategies using agents which can buy
goods and services from multiple auctions while satisfying user preferences and
budgetary constraints. Of particular interest is the study and development of
bundle bidding strategies, which will allow agents to put together preferred
bundles of goods for users from online auctions selling only individual items.
Automated bundle bidding procedures with well-understood performance
expectations will allow users to form bundles with significantly less effort and
much more success. The bundle bidding problem presents challenging and
interesting research problems that involve asynchronous events, uncertainty
about future auctions, and the widely varying valuations and bidding strategies
of users and their proxies. Several variations of the bundle-bidding problem
will be identified and studied. The project will also investigate the usage of
auctions in conjunction with other forms of information processing within a
broader context of coordination between self-interested autonomous agents
representing individuals, organizations and supply chains.
