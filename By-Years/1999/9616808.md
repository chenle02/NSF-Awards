Abstract EEC-9616808 Dogan The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC) is a multi-university
consortia composed of Washington State University, University of Washington,
Oregon State University and the State University of New York - Stoneybrook. This
planning award is funding an industry-university meeting to determine the
economic viability of establishing a research site for CDADIC at Tuskegee
University. Establishing a research site at Tuskegee University will not only
expand the CDADIC research agenda but it will provide an effective industry-
university interaction mechanism for minority students.
