One of the two goals of the project is to advance the state-of-the art in
approximate query processing (AQP), a critical component of analytical
processing -- a 3.5 billion dollar segment of the software industry. The need
for approximate query processing arises from the growing discrepancy between the
volume of information that has to be processed and the computational resources
or communication capabilities available. Using two computational models, data-
streaming and distributed computation, the project addresses fundamental
problems in AQP such as development of new approximation techniques for data-
stream computation, extensions of data-stream algorithms to distributed
algorithms that can efficiently query sensor and peer-to-peer networks, and
theoretical aspects of AQP that allow the design of AQP techniques to be
accelerated and better understood. Part of the project's research goal is the
design and implementation of a approximate query processing engine that uses the
developed AQP techniques and the rigorous benchmarking of the software produced.
The second goal of the project is educational and consists in, on one hand,
motivating students to study and pursue carers in databases through bonus points
for extra activities and integration of the database curricula and other CS
disciplines, and, on the other hand, integration of approximate query processing
into both undergraduate and graduate curricula. The project will have broad
impact by developing techniques for efficient processing of large volumes of
data -- crucial for scientific data processing and home-land security -- and by
increasing the quality of database education with a direct impact on nation's
technological leadership.
