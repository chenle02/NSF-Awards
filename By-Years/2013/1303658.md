This project will investigate the two-dimensional spatial distribution of plasma
irregularity structures in the F-region ionosphere and their relationship to the
development of density perturbations known as equatorial spread-F (ESF).  Better
understanding of such ionospheric disturbances and their generation is highly
relevant to radio wave propagation, scintillations, and communication and
navigation applications. The project will obtain a new set of interferometric
radar images of F-region irregularities and analyze them to determine the
spatial distribution of scattering structures within the radar beam, to identify
 patterns or periodicities related to underlying plasma waves, and to quantify
the correlation between ESF structures and clusters of bottom-type
irregularities. The project will fine-tune an interferometric system to study
scattering structures with zonal scale sizes of several kilometers or more, and
the project will focus on structures having scale sizes less than a few tens of
km, for which few investigations have been conducted to date.
