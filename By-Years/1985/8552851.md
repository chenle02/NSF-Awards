This project will explore the encoding and control of robotic tasks which
require significant interaction with rather challenging environments involving
unertainties of geometry, kinematics, and dynamics, including such complex tasks
as throwing, catching, juggling, pouring liquids, and wielding hand tools. The
approach will combine symbolic manipulation with numerical computation, and will
evaluate the tradeoffs between the increased expressivity of the symbolic
computations and the mathematically provable convergence of the numerical ones.
