An Argon ion laser, optical table and laser accessories are being used as part
of an ongoing effort to create instructional labs for three newly developed
courses in the area of Lasers and Modern Optics, and improve two recently
initiated major student projects: construction of a photoacoustic microscope and
a diffusion measurement apparatus. A significant ingredient of the project is
the use of materials of high technological importance, such as liquid crystals,
polymer dispersed liquid crystals, micellar systems, and colloidal particles,
which provide new ways of performing laboratory experiments, and exposure to
novel materials and their applications. The acquired equipment is being used to
achieve the following goals: a. create new experiments in the area of modern
optics, b. significantly improve instruction on lasers and their applications,
c. provide unique laboratory experiments and ways of introducing nonlinear
optics to the undergraduate curriculum, and d. strengthen student research in an
undergraduate environment. The versatility of the requested equipment assures
its continued impact on future instructional and student research activities.NSF
grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
