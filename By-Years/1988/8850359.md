The goal of this project is to develop a network to increase and facilitate the
participation of mathematicians in programs for the improvement of pre-college
education and expand communication between mathematicians and mathematics
educators. Implementation of the network will take place in three stages. The
first stage will consist of a workshop in the summer of l988 to establish
contacts between people who have been working in the field and those who are
just beginning. The second stage will include the establishment of a network
that will provide support for people in the process of developing new projects.
Network activities will include consultation services, a project databank, a
materials resource clearinghouse, the publication of workshop proceedings and a
newsletter. Finally regional workshops building on the model of the first
workshop will be held so that many more mathematicians will be reached.
