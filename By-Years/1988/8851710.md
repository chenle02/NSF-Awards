Freshman chemistry students are being prepared for transfer to four year
institutions and for careers in industry by doing laboratory experiments using
computer directed equipment. This is happening by upgrading Chemnet (Chemistry
CAI) with more powerful computers and printers that have more capabilities and
chemical applications for handling and manipulating data. The freshman students
are learning to store data on text files, carry the text files to Chemnet, and
transfer the files into Chemnet for data evaluation, printing and plotting.
Students are also using a computer to control the variables of the experiment
and the UV-Visible spectrophotometer and then transfer the data electronically
with Chemnet. The students are also using the computers with other accessories
to learn additional laboratory techniques. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal funds.
