The focus of this research is the preparation and characterization of carbon-
rich networks based on polyacetylenic benzenoid aromatics. Both oligomeric
substructures and polymers will be constructed and characterized. Target systems
include graphdiyne, graphyne and triacetylenic macrocycles. With this award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Michael M. Haley of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon. Dr. Haley will focus
his work on the preparation of densely cross-linked carbon-rich solids based on
polyacetylenic benzenoid polyaromatics. These polymeric networks have the
potential for having properties amenable to use as advanced structural materials
for nuclear power generators, gas turbine engines, high performance heat
engines, heat exchangers, cutting tools, glassy carbon electrodes, and aerospace
applications.
