Dudley 9704603 For differentiating functionals or operators on empirical
distribution functions, most statisticians had adopted compact or Hadamard
differentiability. R. Dudley and co-workers are showing that Frechet
differentiability, well known to be superior when it holds, can be obtained by
use of p-variation norms for one-dimensional sample spaces, with optimal bounds
on remainders. The program is next being pursued in multidimensional spaces.
Also, R. Dudley and a co-worker are showing that a posteriori probabilities can
be well approximated by normal (Gaussian) probabilities even with respect to
relative error when the probabilities are very small. In the study of
differentiable statistical functionals, one is looking at how estimators or
other statistics depend on the observed data distribution: is the dependence
smooth, approximately linear, or not, and how can smoothness or lack thereof be
quantified. In Bayes asymptotics, one begins with an assumed prior probability
distribution over an assumed surface of possible parameter values, and from
enough observations, finds an a posteriori distribution which has approximately
a Gaussian form. The project is showing that a simple method works very well,
giving very accurate Gaussian approximations to the a posteriori probabilities.
By way of these approximations, the project includes studies of methods for
choosing between competing statistical models, or theories, based on multiple
data sets, as in multiple experimental studies on the same or closely related
questions.
