This grant supports Dr. R. Ross as a post-doctoral associate of Professor R.
Guralnick. Dr. Ross will investigate the Beilinson conjectures that relate the
algebraic K-theory to the behavior of the Hasse-Weil L-function at s=0. This
project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
