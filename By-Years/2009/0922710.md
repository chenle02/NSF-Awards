NSF/MRI funds will be used to purchase a new generation multi-collector thermal
ionization mass spectrometer. The new instrument, which will replace a 20 year
old instrument, will be used for high precision U-Pb geochronology, and Nd, Sr,
Pb, Li isotope tracer studies in tectonic, petrologic, sedimentologic,
hydrologic, and paleoclimatologic research at Syracuse University and the State
University of New York at Oswego. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance and
Importance&lt;br/&gt;It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of
determining the isotopic composition of Earth materials to virtually all fields
within the geosciences. For instance, our ability to determine precise ages of
rocks has continued to increase with every new generation of scientific
instrument. A geologic event that occurred over 100 million years ago can now be
determined to within 0.1 million years. This ability allows us to investigate
critical events in Earth history, such as testing the hypothesis that massive
volcanic eruptions coincided with mass extinctions, assessing if climate change
occurred in response to major mountain building events, and to correlate oil-
bearing sedimentary strata over significant distances. The acquisition of a new
generation mass spectrometer gives us an unprecedented ability to determine the
timing of major geological events and thus understand better over four billion
years of Earth history. The new instrument will also be extensively used to
train the next generation of Earth scientists to collect the geochemical data
needed to address issues of energy resources, climate change, natural hazards,
and water resources.&lt;br/&gt;
