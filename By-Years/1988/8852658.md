This project uses a specialized computing laboratory to support a Computer
Science Secondary Teacher Certification program. The Computer Science Teacher
Education Lab includes a mixture of the IBM-PC family as well as Apple
II/Macintosh series of computers. Using this collection of equipment,
prospective teachers are exposed to hardware and software that is pervasive in
industry, business, education and in homes. The laboratory is used as an
integrated applications environment in the curriculum for teachers of computer
science in the secondary schools. The courses in this program demand extensive
and active laboratory experiences in order to prepare prospective teachers for
an effective classroom environment. This award is being matched by an equal sum
from the grantee.
