This research is a continuation of ongoing investigation of the defect
structure and electrical properties of the perovskite- related oxide ceramics.
Materials in the lanthanum-copper oxide system will be investigated during this
grant period. Experimental techniques, such as equilibrium electrical
conductivity at constant oxygen activity and constant chemical composition,
coulombic titration, electron microscopy (including selected area diffraction,
dark field imaging, and latticing, will be used to give quantitative information
on defect concentrations, conduction mechanisms, and on the defect ordering that
occurs in some of these materials. A domain model at the nanostructure level has
been proposed to explain the observed behavior of partially-oxidized, acceptor-
doped, members of the related strontium-iron-titanium oxide system. These
materials are remarkably similar to the superconducting oxides in both
compositional and structural type. An improved understanding of the nature of
the defect structure and its relation to electrical properties of these
materials will lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of
superconductivity.
