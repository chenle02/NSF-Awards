In order to improve the technology of implementing database systems, a
mechanical reasoning capability needed to help database systems implementers
achieve high efficiency in advanced database systems is developed. Mechanical
reasoners are to be used by implementation designers as they map high level
database system specifications, in the ADABTPL specification language, into
implementation systems such as the University of Wisconsin's EXODUS. The project
involves the definition of a formal data transformation language for specifying
the semantics of data structures in terms of high level concepts, developing
heuristic methods useful to a database implementation designer transforming
specifications into implementations, and devising techniques for supplying
details missing in incomplete internal schemas. Systems that will benefit from
the new technology include design, graphics, control and knowledge based
systems.
