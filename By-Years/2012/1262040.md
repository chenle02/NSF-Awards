In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Vanderwal of the Department of Chemistry at UC Irvine will
continue to develop Zincke aldehydes - the products of the ring-opening
aminolysis of pyridinium salts - as useful reagents for complex molecule
synthesis. For example, Zincke aldehydes will be used as readily
functionalizable surrogates to pyridines, enabling the controlled preparation of
polysubstituted pyridines. Previously developed methods to access complex
polycyclic amines from cascade pericyclic reactions of Zincke aldehydes will be
applied to the synthesis of the alkaloids gelsemine and alsmaphorazines A and B.
Finally, in a new venture, the Himbert arene/allene cycloaddition reaction will
be exploited for the generation of complex architectures.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This work generally aims to improve the efficiency of assembly of
complex, value-added compounds from readily available starting materials. The
results of these studies will positively impact any area of applied science that
benefits from chemical synthesis, including pharmaceutical development,
materials science, and more. This project will provide a research training
ground for undergraduate and graduate students. The grant provided in support of
this project will also support the UCI-LEAPS (Laboratory Experiments &amp;
Activities in the Physical Sciences) program that brings in local middle school
students for day-long experiences in university chemistry and physics
laboratories.
