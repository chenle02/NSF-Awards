9700569 Kelley The principal investigator will continue his research program in
the numerical solution of large systems of nonlinear equations and bound
constrained optimization problems. In the area of nonlinear equations the PI
will expand his recent work on nonlinear equations in two directions: (1) pseudo
transient continuation, a popular method for computing steady-state solutions of
certain problems in fluid mechanics and combustion, and (2) research into
termination criteria for nonlinear iterations with applications to the method-
of-lines solution of partial differential equations. The PI will also continue
his work on multilevel methods for compact fixed point problems. In the area of
bound constrained optimization in function spaces, the principal investigator
will continue his work on methods for bound constrained parabolic control
problems, begin a new project on preconditioners for bound constrained problems
in infinite dimension, and redesign his implicit filtering code with a view
toward applications in automotive engineering and environmental monitoring. New
algorithmic features will be added to the code, the code will be ported to a
parallel computer, and theoretical questions related to the new algorithms will
be addressed. Such questions include detection of and escape from stagnation in
Nelder-Mead and related algorithms and convergence of quasi-Newton methods in
the presence of noise. Many processes and models in engineering and science are
expressed as nonlinear equations. Numerical simulation of these processes
requires the rapid and accurate solution of these equations and a clear
understanding of the methods and their limitations. Simulation is then used in
design and optimization for manufacturing. The optimization problems that arise
in industrial design are often noisy because of measurement or simulation error.
The principal investigator will continue his work on the computational solution
of nonlinear equations and optimization p roblems. The work will consist of
study of algorithms, needed to ensure robustness and reliability of simulations,
implementation on distributed memory computers for rapid turn around, and
testing in the context of engineering applications. Through the principal
investigator's collaborations with scientists and engineers in industry,
national laboratories, and academia, the work will be used in (a) environmental
measurement and remediation, (b) simulation, optimal design, and control in the
aerospace industry, and (c) optimal design in automotive engineering.
