The goal of this project is to provide meaningful research experiences to 8
undergraduate students selected largely from the Tulane University student body.
Two faculty members will work with the 8 undergraduate students during the
summer of 1990. The team will focus on the distributed shared memory performance
area. It will select representative applications suitable to assess shared
memory performance, assess what variables affect an application's performance
using analytical modeling, validate the analytical model by measuring actual
performance and determine how to tune applications for improved performance.
