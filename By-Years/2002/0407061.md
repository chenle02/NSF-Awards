AST-0407061&lt;br/&gt;McKay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is the scientific
analysis and dissemination of gamma-ray burst (GRB) follow-up observations
obtained by the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE), which is a
network of four fully automatic rapid response telescopes, placed on four
different continents to provide global coverage. NASA's SWIFT satellite will
provide accurate, prompt localizations for hundreds of GRBs over its nominal
two-year mission, and ROTSE will be able to respond in less than 10 seconds to
nearly half of these events, providing early optical observations for a hundred
or more GRBs, versus the current handful. The early time period is crucial for
understanding the origin of GRBs, and ROTSE should reveal important clues to
progenitor environments, gamma-ray emission mechanisms, and event
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves undergraduate researchers
extensively, and has a very high level of public interest. ROTSE is also a
highly visible, extremely international project, involving the US, Australia,
Germany, Namibia, and Turkey.
