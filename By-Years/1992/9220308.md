The Serpukhov Institute for High-Energy Physics in Protvino, outside of Moscow,
has developed plans to construct UNK, a proton-proton colliding beam accelerator
at an energy intermediate between those of the existing Tevatron collider at
Fermilab and the planned next generation of machines. However, due to resource
limitations and recent developments in Russia, the project has become moribund.
Recent results from the NSF-supported experiment P238, run at the CERN SPS-
Collider, suggest that the UNK asymmetric collider project could be an important
international facility for the study of the physics of particles which contain B
or Beauty quarks and, in particular, for the study of CP violation. A team of
five scientists led by Dr. Peter Schlein of UCLA will travel to Protvino in July
1992 to evaluate the status of the UNK project. In addition, a potential CP-
Violation experimental program will be discussed, and discussions will be held
on other possible smaller scale collaborations.
