This study proposes to examine the placement of the order Carnivora as well as
several other groups, among the eighteen extant orders of eutherian mammals. DNA
sequence data will be gathered from four different loci: Cytochrome B,
Ubiquitin, Histone H3, and the oncogene K-ras. The use of nucleotide sequence
data from several different loci, rather than all the sequence of one large
gene, yields comparisons of codon bias, rate of evolution, and retention of
phylogenetic signal between genes as well as avoiding the evolutionary,
peculiarities of any one locus. Each order will be represented by at least two
taxa, which will be chosen to be as diverse as possible based on prior
systematic analyses. A parsimony approach combined with down- weighting of
saturated sites will be used to analyze the data. Additionally, molecular
information will be combined with the pertinent morphological data in a separate
analysis. This combination of phylogenetic sampling, use of multiple loci, and
total information analysis makes it likely that the so far equivocal information
on relationships of many of the mammalian orders will be better understood and
that current theories of mammalian molecular evolution will be better tested and
expanded.
