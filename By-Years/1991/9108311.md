Research in theoretical physics and astrophysics will concentrate on studies of
cosmic topological defects and quantum cosmology. The topological defects can
include strings, domain walls, and other structures which can help solve the
riddle of how "lumps" such as galaxies formed out of a very smooth early
universe. Quantum cosmology is an effort to understand the nature of the big
bang, and in particular the very first instant of the universe.
