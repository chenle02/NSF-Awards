This individual investigator award supports a project to address fundamental
scientific issues associated with electron transport and tunneling in low-
dimensional systems that have technical relevance to future generations of
microelectronics. There are two main scientific thrusts. The first is to use
quench-condensed ultrathin films to investigate how low dimensionality, strong
disorder, and electron-electron correlations can lead to novel behavior such as
multifold magnetoconductance, a hard correlation gap, the electron glass, and a
current-driven insulator-to-superconductor transition. New superconducting
field-effect devices are proposed. The second is to characterize a variety of
electrochemically fabricated ultrathin films and nanowires. The immediate goal
is to develop novel methods, such as an in-situ contact method and electron-beam
lithography, to make electrical contacts to single nanowires, of 2-200 nm in
diameter, and to carry out transport and tunneling measurements. The project
provides the students with an interdisciplinary learning environment integrating
physics, electrochemistry, and nanofabrication, which will prepare them for
future careers in either academia or industry. It will also benefit a new
chemical physics program at the University of Rochester. Research projects are
outlined that will provide outreach to women and students from groups
underrepresented in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator
award supports research to address fundamental scientific issues associated with
electron transport and tunneling in low-dimensional systems that have technical
relevance to future generations of microelectronics. This project will carry out
experimental studies of ultrathin films, mesoscopic structures fabricated by
electron-beam lithography, and nano-sized materials fabricated by
electrochemical self-assembly. The results from this research program will have
a broad impact on basic science in the field of low-dimensional systems, as well
as on the development of new physical principles, new materials, new devices,
and new fabrication techniques for future generations of microelectronics. The
project provides the students with an interdisciplinary learning environment
integrating physics, electrochemistry, and nanofabrication, which will prepare
them for future careers either in academia or in the broader high-tech industry.
