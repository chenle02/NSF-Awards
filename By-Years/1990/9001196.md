This award supports an international workshop on applied mechanics to be held
in Valparaiso, Chile from January 2-5, 1991. The U.S. organizer is Dean Mook of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute; his counterpart in Chile is Pablo Kittl of the
University of Chile in Santiago. The interaction organizing and editorial
committee consists of engineers from Brazil, Canada, Argentina, Venezuela and
Chile as well as from the u.S. The objectives of the workshop are 1) to expose
engineers and scientists as well as graduate students to new research findings,
techniques and problems and 2) to provide opportunities for personal
interactions among the mechanical from all the Americans through formal lectures
and informal conversations. There will be a special session with a panel of
well-known engineers from both Americans to discuss how to further open channels
of communication and to foster future collaboration between North and South
America. In addition there were 45 abstracts received in Chile. Such a level of
interest on both sides makes this opportunity for interaction between U.S. and
Latin American engineers and scientists along with the attendance of graduate
students a good example of the fulfillment of the goals of the Science in
Developing Countries program.
