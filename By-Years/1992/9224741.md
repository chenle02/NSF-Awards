Over the last decade, a dramatic increase has been observed in the ability of
individual experimental scientists to generate and store data. This increase has
not been matched by an equivalent development of adequate data management tools.
The goal of this project is to develop an Experiment Management System (EMS)
that meets the needs of experimental scientists from a wide range of
disciplines. Located on the scientist's desk, the EMS serves as the sole
interface between the scientist and the data. Throughout the life cycle of an
experimental study, the EMS can be used to design the study, order experiments,
manage the generated data, and analyze the results. Graphical user interfaces
and integration of database systems with experimentation environments are the
fundamental database research challenges addressed by this project. While the
EMS under development is generic in many aspects, specific emphasis is given to
the special requirements of a plant growth simulation environment, an Integrated
Microscopy Resource, and a simulation laboratory. Once placed on the desk of
scientists who use these experimental environments, the new data management
technology encapsulated in the EMS will improve scientists productivity and
establish a new paradigm in managing experimental studies. ***
