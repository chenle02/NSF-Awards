This five year project by COMAP will produce, field test, and evaluate a three
year secondary school mathematics curriculum. This curriculum will consist of a
9-11 core which will be application and modeling based. Materials will
incorporate computer and calculator experiences, a video applications library,
appropriate assessment instruments, and teacher manuals. The materials will be
developed by the project staff and a 30 member writing team including many high
school teachers. The Educational Film Center will help on video development.
Rutgers University and the University of Wisconsin at Madison will direct the
field testing. The Freudenthal Institute of the Netherlands will aid in the
development of appropriate assessment strategies.
