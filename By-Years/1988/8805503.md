This is an ongoing research project to explore the implementability and utility
of Equational Logic Programming. It has already produced a compiler for an
equational programming lanquage in which a program is a set of equations, an
input is a term, and a computation is a derivation of certain logical
consequences of the equations in the program, leading to the output of a term in
normal form equivalent to the input. Novel features of the language include a
total refusal to compromise semantics for performance, leading to a uniform use
of "lazy" evaluation - a technique in which precisely the information
demonstrably relevant to the final output is automatically computed. The current
version of the compiler uses partial evaluation of intermediate code as an
optimization technique, and its performance is approaching that of conventional
optimized compilers for C. Continuing research will include the study of more
sophisticated evaluation techniques to improve performance, theoretical advances
to extend the class of equational programs that can be compiled, simulation
studies to determine the potential benefits of parallel implementations of
equational programming languages, and experimentation with advance user
interfaces, including structure editor interfaces.
