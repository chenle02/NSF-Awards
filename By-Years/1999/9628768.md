This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) and Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware upgrade the existing
departmental X-ray facility. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including (1) support of extramural collaborators from academic
laboratories for varied research projects (2) internal research specializations
emphasizing synthesis, and (3) crystallographic characterizations. The X-ray
diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the
precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and
it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules
