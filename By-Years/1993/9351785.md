The Milwaukee School of Engineering is in the process of curricular revisions
and developments that will place a major new emphasis on photonics and sensors
in engineering and physics. An important part of this program is the development
of a Photonics and Sensors Laboratory in the Electrical Engineering Department.
A new laboratory sequence for Optical Electronics and revisions of Sensors and
Fiber Optic Technology are planned. The Senior Design Project sequence will now
encourage more projects in sensors and photonics. This project will provide
significant improvements in the education of our upper division students in
Electrical Engineering, Electrical Engineering Technology, and Manufacturing
Engineering Technology. To a lesser extent this laboratory will also support the
Mechanical Engineering (and Technology) curricula. The major equipment requested
includes fiber optic apparatus to demonstrate a broad variety of optical and
communication principles. The optical time domain reflectometer and optical
power meters will support both photonic and sensor experimentation. Vibrating
and optical angular rate sensors and piezo-film kits will provide the basis for
studying motion- sensing systems and phenomena. The sequence and content of the
experiments, as well as the instrumentation, were selected to optimize the
student's advancement, building upon their prior applied optics foundation.This
laboratory's impact is expected to result in undergraduates who are literate in
the areas of photonics and sensors, and should serve as excellent preparation
for graduate work. During off-hours, we expect to use the laboratory to teach
and demonstrate photonics and sensors to middle and high school science
teachers, and also during Open Houses to help attract students into science and
engineering.
