This project explores the design of systematic techniques to adapt the internal
interface and component structure of programs of moderate size or larger.
Programming tools based on these techniques could have the effect of increasing
the extent to which the internal interface structure of systems can be made more
fluid, that is, evolvable and adaptable. One potential application is to
reorganizing abstraction boundaries in programs: It is clear in practice that
software structural architectures are rarely optimal, but the costs and risks of
adapting them are high. Another potential application is to the tailoring of
general purpose frameworks and components to specific constrained uses,
improving performance. Four questions are addressed: (1) What semantics-based
program manipulation techniques are needed to support manipulation of internal
software interfaces represented, for example, as encapsulation boundaries in
programs? (2) How can soundness and other properties of the program manipulation
techniques be established? (3) What are the design considerations for the
development of tools that can operate on programs of increasing complexity and
size? (4) How can the utility of the techniques be assessed for development and
re-engineering of internal software interfaces and associated components?
