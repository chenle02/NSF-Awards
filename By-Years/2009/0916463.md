The field of bioinformatics and computational biology is experiencing a data
revolution unlike any other scientific computing field. Experimental techniques
to procure data have increased in throughput, improved in accuracy, and reduced
in costs. The preponderance of data has limited the scalability of existing
software tools. In a pursuit to understand the complexities and challenges that
stem from designing algorithms for data-intensive biocomputing, this project is
developing new approaches for two major problems in protein bioinformatics: i)
identification of protein families and homology clusters; and ii) peptide
identification from large-scale mass spectrometry data. The former requires
large-scale graph analysis and the latter requires large-scale database search.
The project is investigating a multi-faceted approach which involves designing
space-efficient algorithms for massively parallel machines, developing
algorithmic heuristics for reducing the time to solution, evaluating the
MapReduce paradigm as an alternate computing model, and deploying multicore
architectures for fine-grain parallelism. Project outcomes will include new
algorithms and open-source software libraries for large-scale protein
bioinformatics, including a more generic library for data-intensive
biocomputing. The project is addressing a critical need for scalable methods in
protein bioinformatics and in doing so will usher in state-of-the-art computing
models and concepts from both software and hardware into mainstream
biocomputing. Broader impacts include creating interdisciplinary research
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and new interdisciplinary
curricula at high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. Education materials
will be disseminated through a partnership program with Shodor Education
Foundation, Inc.
