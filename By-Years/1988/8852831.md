Resources are provided to adapt some undergraduate experiments in hydraulics and
fluid mechanics to computer-based instrumentation and control, and to explore
new concepts in the teaching of laboratory courses. The purpose of the project
is twofold: to introduce students to modern methods of scientific data
acquisition and control, and to enhance the teaching of fluid mechanical
phenomena. The latter is the primary objective as it is well known that direct
involvement and observation of fluid flows is essential for gaining a feel for
the subject. The project will accomplish this by allowing many more cases to be
explored and by providing rapid feedback of the consequences of changing
experimental variables. A manual which describes the experiments and makes the
software available to other institutions will be produced.
