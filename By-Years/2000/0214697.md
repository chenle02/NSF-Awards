This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
an efficient and reliable enhanced Raman spectroscopy probe by integrating a
microspherical resonator with nanoparticles providing Surface Enhanced Raman
scattering. This spectral information provides a chemical "fingerprint" and
analyte identification. However, broader application of this technology is
hindered by the powerful laser sources and sensitive optical detection equipment
that the inherently weak Raman scattering requires. The proposed probe addresses
these limitations by (1) locally increasing the light intensity at the probe
head with an optical resonator to permit the use of lower power sources and (2)
improving the Raman scattering efficiency with metallic nanoparticles to permit
the use of less sensitive detection equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Raman spectroscopy has wide commercial application in chemical process
monitoring, pharmaceutical analysis, and environmental site monitoring because
it provides rich spectra arising from the chemical structure of the analyte. In
addition to expanded use in the above-mentioned industries, reducing the cost
and size of Raman spectroscopy equipment will enable point-of-care systems for
medical diagnostics and field portable systems for rapid identification of
chemical unknowns from accidental or intentional releases.&lt;br/&gt;
