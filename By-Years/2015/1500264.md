This project is in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, fields where
solution sets of polynomial equations are studied. These areas have many
applications in other areas of mathematics and in other disciplines. The project
is concerned with questions in local cohomology, a powerful tool used in
commutative algebra, and connections with several other areas of mathematics.
The discovery of a connection between two different areas of mathematics holds a
potential for enriching both of them by making available new sets of techniques
for attacking old problems. Advising students, mentoring postdocs, giving
invited talks, and organizing a conference on D-modules in commutative algebra
will also be part of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large part of the
investigator's research on local cohomology over the last twenty years has been
devoted to the study of a number of striking connections with several quite
diverse areas of mathematics. For example, local cohomology provides a way of
proving otherwise inaccessible results on the topology of algebraic varieties,
while D-modules provide a way of proving otherwise inaccessible finiteness
properties of local cohomology modules. While considerable progress on this
circle of ideas has been made, many open questions remain. The project is aimed
at a better understanding of a number of interrelated problems such as the
structure and algorithmic computation of local cohomology modules, Lyubeznik
numbers, De Rham homology and cohomology of algebraic varieties, the direct
summand conjecture (via the absolute integral closure of a local domain in mixed
characteristic), and tight closure. Local cohomology is the common thread that
runs through all these problems and connects them to each other. The principal
methods to be employed are the use of D-modules and F-modules.
