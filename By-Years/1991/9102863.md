An experiment is to be conducted with a very large number of hotwire probes to
diagnose the coherent structure content of a turbulent jet. Simultaneous signals
from these probes wiol be utilized to create an experimental reconstruction of
the flow by way of the modes inferred from a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD), as well as the dynamical mode interaction. This will be compared to a POD
decomposition constructed from existing nonsimultaneous data combined with
modeling, to infer the quality of the model used in this latter scheme. The data
will also be subjected to various conditional sampling schemes to evaluate the
ability of such schemes to capture coherent structures. The research is aimed at
evaluating various existing and proposed schemes to experimentally extract the
coherent content of turbulent flows. Predictive modeling of such flows is
presently handicapped by lack of reliable information on these structures.
