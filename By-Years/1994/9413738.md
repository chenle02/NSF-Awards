This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Union College acquire a FT-IR spectrometer and OPO
Laser System which will be used in research. The research activity to be
supported includes (1) the study of the optical properties of defects and
radiation induced damage processes in insulating solids; (2) non- linear and
chaotic dynamics, and laboratory based astrophysical research relating to the
interstellar medium; (3) the development of diode-laser-based fluorescence
spectrometers, and detectors for flow injection analysis; (4) investigations of
the binding of organic molecules to cyclodextrin (CD) and CD polymer (CDP)
molecules; and (5) measure elastic wave velocities and thermal diffusivity of
small samples of geologically interesting species. A tunable infrared laser can
provide important information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable
breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and nonreactive
of molecules.
