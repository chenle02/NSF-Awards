Barbara Garrison of Pennsylvania State University is supported by an award from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to perform research aimed at
modeling energetic particle bombardment of surfaces to address essential issues
in state-of-the art experiments. The proposed research is based on molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in
depth profiling.

This research has relevance to a broad range of important technologies and
manufacturing processes including surface cleaning, surface smoothing,
implantation of dopants in semiconductors, focused ion beam milling for
integrated circuit repair, reactive ion etching, and the analytical technique of
secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS, including extremely high resolution three-
dimensional imaging. Additionally, it is relevant to natural processes such as
the erosion of the moons of Saturn.
