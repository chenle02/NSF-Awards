A common challenge faced by all programming technology, including optimizing
compilers, query optimizers, theorem provers, and model checkers, is the ability
to reason about "term equivalence" -- that is, when one program is equivalent to
another. Optimizing compilers seek to replace one sequence of instructions with
another equivalent sequence that executes faster. Structured Query Language
(SQL) query optimizers start from a query plan and search for an equivalent plan
with lowest cost, and theorem provers need to infer equivalences between
expressions to prove mathematical equations. Checking the equivalence of two
expressions is one of the fundamental problems in computer science. The
project's novelties are building a new framework for checking equivalence, by
using a technique called equality saturation. Instead of rewriting a term to a
new one and forgetting the old one, equality saturation keeps all equivalent
terms in a single, compact representation. The project's impacts are developing
new technology for checking equivalence that will impact compilers, query
optimizers, and theorem provers, by improving their ability to reason about, and
to optimize expressions.

Equality saturation relies on a compact representation of a set of expressions
using an E-Graph, where equivalent expressions are grouped into E-Classes, and
individual operators are represented by E-Nodes. At the core of the approach is
a fixpoint computation of the closure of a given expression under a specified
set of rules and under equality. The project pursues three thrusts. The first
thrust extends equality saturation with Datalog rules. The project exploits the
fact that datalog is a query language that is also based on a fixpoint
semantics, and builds a novel framework that allows datalog rules to be combined
with equality assertions, in a unified way. In the second thrust the project
conducts a theoretical investigation of the conditions that ensure termination
of equality saturation. This problem has been studied independently under
various aspects by the term rewriting community, the chase community, and the
tree automata community; this project adapts those theoretical results to
equality saturation. Finally, in the third thrust, the project creates new
optimization techniques for equality saturation in order to improve its
performance. These optimizations will be inspired by database query optimization
techniques, such as worst-case optimal joins, semi-naive evaluation, and
multiquery optimization.
