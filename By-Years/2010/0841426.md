In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), it is proposed to test a
new geochronological technique based on U-series disequilibrium of cogenetic
non-silicate minerals to date young lava flows. Previous attempts to dating
lavas with U-series isotopic techniques have been problematic due to the fact
that silicate crystals have variable magma residence times and, in many cases,
do not have the requisite U concentration and U/Th ratios. The proposed
analytical plan will be focused on the mineral gypsum. Gypsum is a common
cogenetic mineral in basalts often found in lava tubes. They have the required
high U and low Th concentrations. Preliminary data on gypsum crystals give
encouraging but mixed results. The ultimate purpose of this SGER will be to
develop a set of criteria to distinguish datable materials from those that are
not by using strontium, sulfur and in some cases radium isotopic data in a
suitable field area. These will be used eventually to document and establish the
likelihood that this new technique is feasible for a number of different rock
types. If successful, results from this project will have broad applicability in
the Earth Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
