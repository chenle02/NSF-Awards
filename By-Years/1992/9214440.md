The University of Massachusetts seeks support for its academic research
infrastructure in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. This
support will be used to develop a remote sensing radiometer (22 GHz) designed to
measure the vertical distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere. The
Department's Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory will construct the radiometer
and actively cooperate with meteorologists at Penn State, the Universities of
Wyoming, Wisconsin, NOAA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
Graduate students in electrical and computer engineering will benefit greatly
from the interdisciplinary research that will be supported by the acquisition of
this equipment.
