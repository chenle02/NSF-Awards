The purpose of this award is to continue support for development of a user-
friendly data base of stock market transactions. Considerable progress has been
made to date in developing the data base for the New York and American Stock
Exchanges, and two months of data has been made available at 16 test sites. This
data base includes transaction prices for all security trades, not just closing
trades. Transactions prices will be maintained for the most recent ten years of
data. This award will allow the investigator to complete the work on the New
York and American Stock Exchange transactions and will provide for the
development of a similar data base for Over-The-Counter trades and quotes. These
data will be made readily accessible, in a convenient format, and at a
reasonable cost to scholars doing research in the area of financial economics.
At present, information is not readily available to academic researchers. This
project is important because it will allow scholars to explore a host of
questions regarding the functions of financial markets which at present is not
possible, given the high cost and access problems associated with existing data
sets.
