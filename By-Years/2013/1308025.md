Objective: This project will establish the scientific and technological
foundations for texture ratchets as a microfluidic platform for low-cost,
parallel handling of droplets. Since their invention in the PI?s lab, we have
shown that texture ratchets can perform the essential tasks of droplet
generation, transport, splitting, merging, mixing and sorting, all without
electric fields, pressure gradients or pumps. We hypothesize that we can extract
a wealth of information by observing the dynamics of texture ratchets, starting
from the phase lag of droplet oscillation to the intricate motion of the solid-
liquid-vapor line along the droplet footprint. The impact of this research will
span from a deeper understanding of the physical interactions between liquids
and nano-structured surfaces to diagnostics on novel portable devices.
Intellectual Merits: Despite decades of research in wetting phenomena and
microfluidics, recently there have been dramatic new insights from
interdisciplinary efforts by physicists, nanofabrication engineers and
developers of biomedical instruments. This project will establish a
comprehensive model of texture ratchets and validate it on newly designed
devices. Specifically, we will explore texture ratchets as a low-cost
microfluidic platform and develop applications for the biomedical arena. Broader
Impact: This research sheds light on the behavior of water at the micro- and
nano-scale that is relevant well beyond surface physics and nanofabrication,
with applications from self-cleaning surfaces to desalination systems. The PI
will be involved in activities to connect advanced research to a wider audience:
Within UW, he helps establishing an interdisciplinary ?Undergraduate Minor in
Nanoscience and Molecular Engineering.? Beyond UW, he hosts classes from North
Seattle Community College in UW cleanrooms, participates in MESA outreach
programs for K-12 underrepresented minorities, and gives hands-on demos at the
Pacific Science Center.
