Permafrost is ground that is frozen for at least two consecutive years. The
distribution of permafrost has a major impact on ecosystems and human activities
in areas where it is found. Availability and presentation of permafrost data and
products can be important for scientists, engineers, policy makers, indigenous
communities, and the general public. This project will advance the accessibility
of permafrost models in order to help researchers and others who are not
permafrost modeling experts to employ models to explore and study permafrost. In
particular, the project will promote the online use of permafrost models by
students, scientists, and stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
create an Integrated Modeling Toolbox (IMT), consisting of four permafrost
models representing a range of capability and complexity. The IMT will provide
easy online access to students, stakeholders, and scientists who want to use
permafrost models, but lack the expertise and resources to develop them. The IMT
will include multiple sets of sample inputs representing a variety of conditions
and locations to enable immediate use of any of the permafrost models. The
project will also develop open source Visualization Tools with a user-friendly
front-end interface to plot model outputs and compare model outputs to
observations. Lastly, the project will develop two IMT applications to
demonstrate its utility: 1) a high-resolution permafrost map of Alaska and 2) a
link between a permafrost model and a geomorphology model. The project also
engages students and includes several workshops and meetings to reach out to
users and to teach them how to use the permafrost models with hands-on training
sessions.
