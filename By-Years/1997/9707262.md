9707262 FAWLEY The class of green algae called the Prasinophyceae includes
organisms similar to the ancestors of all green plants. Some Prasinophyceae are
flagellates, but others are nonflagellate (coccoid) unicells. Some unusual
pigments and cellular features that are distinct from land plants and other
green algae occur in prasinophytes. However, several studies have revealed that
the Prasinophyceae is not a OnaturalO class, but may instead be composed of
several different evolutionary lines. Variations in cell structure and pigment
composition that are shared among particular species of prasinophyte algae may
indicate the presence of lineages that share a single common ancestor. In thsi
research, Marvin Fawley will focus on a particular group of prasinophytes, those
that possess the carotenoid prasinoxanthin. Several lines of evidence suggest
that these organisms are from a single evolutionary lineage. However, current
classification systems place the prasinoxanthin possessing organisms in two
separate orders. This project will test the hypothesis that the prasinoxanthin
possessing algae form a single lineage. 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis
as well as pigment and biochemical data will be used. Most of the organisms
examined will be coccoid prasinophytes, because few of these organisms have been
well studied. However, the coccoid prasinophytes are critical to our
understanding of the diversity of oceanic phytoplankton. Better knowledge of the
phylogeny of these organisms will contribute greatly to ongoing research on this
diversity, as well as to our understanding of green plant evolution.
