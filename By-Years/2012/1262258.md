Project researchers have found there is a scientific as well as public need for
persistent Earth and space remote sensing applications. The availability of
dense global measurements could enable new techniques in geosciences for imaging
the Earth, yielding important observations that could test theoretical models
and improve understanding of the planet. Constellations of satellites could
additionally be used to provide observations on climate, aurora, radiation
belts, albedo clouds, lightning, radiation belts, gravity-hydrology and space
weather among many other topics. By placing sensors as ride-along packages on
constellations of existing satellite there is the potential to increase the
coverage, distribution and amount of data that could be used for scientific and
public benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing additional instruments on existing
satellites could ameliorate the need for costly satellite programs. Global
imaging capabilities, possible through this technology have the potential to
mitigate global issues that impact the public including but not limited to;
monitoring of volcanic ash clouds for airplane flights or global monitoring of
crop health and the global carbon cycle. Data streams from this technology may
provide necessary data for improved weather prediction, climate, space weather
and disaster response and recovery.
