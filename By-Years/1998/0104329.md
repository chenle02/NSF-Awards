This project is organized around two leading themes in internal gravity wave
propagation in stratified fluids: (a) interplay between nonlinearity and
dispersion, and (b) instabilities and resonances. Within the first theme, the
long term goal is to provide a model of internal waves in layered stratification
that correctly accounts for dispersion and high nonlinearity, to be used in
alternative to the currently adopted non-dispersive and weakly nonlinear models.
The aim is to retain the advantage of the simplicity of these theories with
respect to the full Euler (or Navier-Stokes) governing motion equations, while
still maintaining the ability to describe wave dynamics of practical interest.
Highly nonlinear regimes often generate instabilities. The causes and evolution
of these instabilities for fully nonlinear internal waves are the focus within
the second theme. In particular, stability criteria based on the Howard-Miles
theorem for stationary shear flows and parametric instability occurring at
stable Richardson's number will be revisited in the context of internal gravity
waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on an area of wave propagation
which has widespread atmospheric and oceanic applications, and, therefore, large
societal implications. For instance, large internal waves generated by wind
forcing of the upper ocean may have a strong feedback effect on the intensity of
hurricanes. Thus, numerical codes based on models capable of representing
accurately large amplitude waves and their dispersive behavior (responsible for
the spreading of wave energy over increasingly larger regions) can play an
important role in hurricane forecasts, at little additional cost with respect to
the currently employed hydrostatic codes. The award will support work that will
help establish the theoretical and technical foundations of such improved
computational codes.
