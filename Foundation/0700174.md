Computational "proof assistants," which allow users to construct axiomatic
proofs of formally specified assertions, are currently used for two purposes:
first, to verify ordinary mathematical proofs, and second, to verify that
(descriptions of) hardware and software meet design specifications. This project
will develop logical and computational methods to support both types of
activities. Specific components of the project include: the development of
formal libraries to support proofs in number theory and discrete geometry; the
extraction of verification conditions from software component specifications and
implementations in an assertive programming language known as Resolve; a
classification of the types of inferences that arise in both domains; the
development of logical methods for verifying these inferences automatically; and
the development of educational materials and software that will make it possible
to integrate these methods into undergraduate and graduate curricula in computer
science and mathematics.

As mathematical proofs become more and more intricate, and now often rely on
extensive computation, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they
are correct. Similarly, as hardware and software systems become more and more
complex, it is becoming increasingly difficult to verify that they meet their
design specifications. Doing so is especially important when resources, lives,
and security depend on their correct behavior. This collaboration between
mathematical logicians and computer scientists will develop methods to make it
possible to verify that such mathematical and computational claims are valid,
and that the arguments supporting them are free of errors. The project will also
develop means of training the next generation of computer scientists and
mathematicians to use these methods.
