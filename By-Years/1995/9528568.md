Dr. Bruce E. Bursten, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division for experimental and theoretical studies of the
photochemistry of dinuclear organometallic compounds (DOC). The project aims at
defining the photochemistry of this class of complexes and involves exploratory
photochemistry, spectroscopic investigations of the intermediates formed during
the photochemical reactions, and theoretical studies of DOC complexes and
photochemically generated DOC intermediates. The compounds chosen for study
contain two metal atoms bonded to one another through small organic groups.
These complexes will allow an exploration of the competition between metal-metal
and metal-ligand bond breaking reactions, of the chemistry that can occur at two
metal centers, and of a wide variety of metal-ligand bonding modes. When a
chemical compound is exposed to light it is often activated and undergoes what
are termed photochemical reactions. Exceedingly important examples include
photosynthesis and the chemistry of vision. The photochemical properties of
organic compounds are well documented and understood. In contrast, detailed
knowledge of the factors that control inorganic photochemistry has not yet
emerged. The detailed investigations to be carried out in this study are
designed to help fill this void and will ultimately allow DOC compounds to be
tailored for specific photochemical activity.
