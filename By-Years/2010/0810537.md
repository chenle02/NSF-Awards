CBET - 0810537 &lt;br/&gt;Echekki &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative
computational-experimental efforts will study the mechanisms thermo-diffusive
instabilities in turbulent flame kernels at lean fuel conditions. The flame
kernel is an important fundamental canonical problem of relevance to many
practical applications where fuel-lean combustion technologies are developed to
reduce emissions. The computations, led by the U.S.-based PI, will be based on
spatially- and temporally-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) with
realistic descriptions of chemistry and transport. The experiment is based on
non-intrusive optical diagnostic approaches to image the transient evolution of
turbulent kernels. This study is directly relevant to an emerging combustion
technology based on burning fuel-lean mixtures to minimize pollutants emissions
while maintains a high degree of combustion efficiency. The project activities
will support two junior scientists: one from Egypt and the other from the US
program. The planned activities will promote the exchange of expertise and ideas
among the U.S. and Egyptian researchers on a topic of global importance. This
project is supported by the U.S. Egypt Joint Board for Science and Technology,
which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.
