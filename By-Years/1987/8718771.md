Physical adsorption refers to the state when molecules are weakly bound to
surfaces (binding energies less then one-tenth of an electron volt). The many
phenomena observed in physisorbed films have attracted the attention of a
diverse group of scientists because they reveal fundamental behavior of matter
in a different way from bulk systems. This program presents a multi-facetted
attack on a set of problems of current interest. One broad area of focus is film
structure; interesting questions include the nature of two dimensional phases
(commensurate, incommensurate, orientationally ordered) and transitions between
such phases, the growth of films as they become three dimensional and wetting
transitions. A closely related problem involves the dynamical properties of
these films. Both of these will be addressed by thermodynamic and scattering
techniques, traditional probes used in bulk systems. Another fundamental area of
investigation is the binding of gas molecules to surfaces; this also is to be
studied by scattering. Accompanying these experiments will be theoretical
studies concerned with the same issues. Included are the application of
statistical mechanics to describe the collective phenomena associated with film
ordering. Computer simulation is a particularly powerful tool to explain and
predict these properties, as well as test theoretical hypotheses about the force
laws. The systems to be considered include both monatomic and polyatomic
adsorbate species. While the popular graphite substrate will receive some
attention, magnesium oxide and other substrates will get somewhat greater
emphasis. The "compound" system of solid and monolayer film will be studied by
both elastic and inelastic scattering probes.
