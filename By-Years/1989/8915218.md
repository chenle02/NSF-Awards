This project is a collaborative effort between an electrical engineer and a
neuroscientist, to develop a new sensor capable of an order of magnitude
improvement in our ability to study living human brain tissue and how it works.
The ultimate goal is the development of a chip, .3 cm by .3 cm, containing
16,000 independent electrodes capable of independent recording from brain cells.
Another part of the research is the development of techniques to keep brain
slices alive and functional in contact with the sensor, and to design a sensor
which does not deteriorate in that environment. Tests will be done on brain
slices already available as a byproduct of surgery to correct epilepsy; sensor
data will be analyzed to see how patterns vary between normal tissue and tissue
causing the epilepsy, in order to yield insight into normal and abnormal
functioning of the brain.
