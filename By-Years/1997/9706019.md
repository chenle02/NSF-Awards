9706019 Tauxe The PIs will study the variability of the intensity of Earth's
magnetic field using sedimentary records. Investigations of the Oligocene
sequence of sediments recovered during Leg 73 at Hole 522 in the South Atlantic
produced relative paleointensity data of high quality that allow specific
predictions to be made about the long term behavior of the geomagnetic field in
ancient times. Those data suggest that the average paleofield intensity is
related to reversal frequency and that the variability of the data is
proportional to the mean intensity. If these observations can be verified
elsewhere, they provide profound constraints on the process which generates the
field, and in this study, the PIs will continue this work in the Paleogene. They
will focus on generating records from latitudinally distributed locations for
two time slices in the Oligocene from DSDP/ODP cores and will test whether
sedimentary sequences can be found that preserve a record of the field. They
will also perform a feasibility study on Italian limestone sequences to
investigate possible changes in paleointensity near the Cretaceous Normal
Superchron, which is suggested by a statistical study of the Oligocene data from
Hole 533. ***
