New state-sum invariants for knots in 3-dimensional space and knotted surfaces
in 4-dimensional space were defined, in a state-sum form, by the principal
investigator and collaborators, using self-distributive operations called
quandles and their colorings of knot and surface diagrams. The weights of the
state-sum are derived from quandle cohomology theories. A number of applications
to various properties of knots and surfaces have been discovered. The project
investigates relationships among quandles, Lie algebras, coalgebras, crossed
modules and their cohomology theories in order to develop applications such as
manifold invariants. It also proposes to use geometric and diagrammatic methods
to analyse specific categorifications, quantum groups, and cohomology theories.



A knot is a circle situated in space. Surfaces in four-dimensional space can
also be knotted. Knot theory studies such knotted circles and surfaces, and has
provided models and applications to DNA theory, molecular configurations, and
physics. Knot diagrams drawn on a piece of paper, and numerical quantities that
are easily computable from diagrams, have been extensively used in knot theory.
The principal investigators and their collaborators have developed algebraic
systems from the knot diagrams that give a close reflection of the visual
representations of knots. The algebra of these diagrams and related versions
concisely encode deep connections among knots and physical systems. The current
project develops new connections between the algebraic system of diagrams and
other established algebraic systems (Lie algebras and crossed modules) that are
closely associated with the standard model in physics. The techniques will also
be applied in the context of categorification --- a process by which identity is
replaced by an instruction of how to identify.
