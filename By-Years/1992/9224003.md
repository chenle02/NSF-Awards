Energy consumption usually increases at a faster rate than does economic output
in developing nations, because almost all major changes associated with economic
development (industrialization, increases in the capital-to-labor ratio,
substitution of commercial energy for traditional energy, the construction of
modern infrastructure, mechanization, and urbanization) require more intensive
use of energy. Economic development in China in the 1980s did not follow this
pattern, however, as energy intensity actually declined by almost 30 percent
from 1980 to 1988. This project will explore this decline in China's energy
intensity and will identify those factors that were responsible for the
reduction. Energy will be examined as an intermediate input in the production of
goods and services, and changes in energy intensity will be examined within the
framework of both final demands and production technologies and functions.
Structural-decomposition analytic techniques will be used to analyze data from a
range of different sources that document Chinese economic activity over the
study period, thereby forming the basis for merging quantitative modelling
approaches at macro and micro levels with qualitative assessments based on case
studies, site visits, and personal interviews. This project will enhance
understandings about this important topic in a number of ways. The database used
for many of the analyses will bring together relevant information from a diverse
range of sources, thereby facilitating research by others. Knowledge of the
relationships between economic development and energy use in China will be
improved, but these insights also will provide new perspectives for other
nations. Of special utility will be new knowledge of ways that national and
regional policymakers might be able to foster energy conservation while
simultaneously spurring economic development.
