P. I.: John Churchill RFB&amp;D is conducting a three-year project with funding
from the National Science Foundation to develop a unique technology to integrate
computerized text files with digital human voice recording. This technology will
make mathematics, science, and other educational materials accessible to print-
disabled people. The most widely used technology available to print-disabled
people today for accessing information includes large print, braille, analog
recordings and computerized text files. Although analog recordings offer the
sound quality of a human voice, searching for information is a difficult and
time-consuming process. Conversely, a book on computer disk has advanced search
and retrieval capabilities but sound quality is restricted by the nature of
synthetic speech. The combination of the recorded voice and a computerized text
file will make mathematics and science materials more accessible due to the
random access capabilities of both disciplines that digital audio offers in a
more dynamic and robust format. For the purposes of this project, RFB&amp;D is
employing several methods to achieve its previously stated objectives. They are
first and foremost working to develop a software that will integrate the
computer text file with a digitally recorded human voice. They will then create
a nongraphically based user interface to help make mathematics, science and
other technological materials accessible to print-disabled people via the
computer. Digital audio books will offer the best features of both audio and
E-Text formats--the recorded human voice and the ability to search and retrieve
information as needed. This newly created reading system, which will run on a
standard multimedia computer equipped with a sound card and CD-ROM, will
revolutionize how print-disabled people read and obtain information. Most
important, digital audio books will, for the first time ever, allow print-
disabled people to access mathematics, science and other technological m
aterials through natural human speech using a personal computer.
