The proposed project is an application of the hyperspherical hidden crossing
method (HHCM) to positron-atom scattering. Positron-alkali collisions will be
investigated in the energy range where there are two open channels, elastic
scattering and positronium formation. For positron-hydrogen collisions, the plan
is to extend previous two-channel calculations to include excitation to the n=2
states of hydrogen. The objective of this investigation is to provide insight
into the dynamics of three charged particles which is basic to the understanding
of the dynamics of atomic collisions. The HHCM is well suited for the study of
collisions involving three charged particles of arbitrary mass. An important
feature that the HHCM method shares with the hyperspherical method is that it
treats excitation and the rearrangement process on equal footing. This is
important for positronium formation in positron-atom collisions.
