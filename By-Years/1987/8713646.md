This project, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is directed
towards the study of dynamic processes in collisions and photodissociations. In
both types of experiments, the effect of the orientation (alignment) of the
reacting component relative to its collision partner or dissociation fragment
will be investigated by the measurement of high resolution infrared absorption
and emission. The measurements require very precise experimental techniques, of
which Dr. Leone is one of the world's experts. The result of these
investigations will lead to both the development of instrumentation to measure
actual process of chemical reactions and a better understanding of the
mechanisms of chemical reactions.
