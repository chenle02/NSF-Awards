Now that computer technology appears to have reached the limit of Dennard
scaling (increasing clock rates), software must become more parallel, to scale
with hardware that provides more instead of faster cores. However, writing
correct, scalable shared-memory concurrent programs is notoriously difficult.
Transactional memory (TM) offers potential improvements over conventional
shared-memory systems in programmability, reliability, and scalability. However,
it has not lived up to its initial promise, primarily because no one has shown
how to make it practical. Hardware manufacturers are reluctant to build hardware
TM (HTM) into already-complex cache and memory subsystems, and software TM (STM)
suffers from poor performance and weak semantics. This project seeks to advance
the state of the art dramatically by investigating new research directions for
making STM truly practical, by achieving high performance with strong semantics.
The project tackles STM's key cost in existing work -- detecting and handling
conflicting accesses -- using a novel mechanism that avoids synchronization at
non-conflicting accesses.

Direct beneficial impacts of making widely available practical STM support
include the ability to produce more reliable and scalable software systems,
leading to advances in software for safety- and mission-critical systems.
Widespread use of STM can help spur commercial development of hardware support
for hybrid hardware-software TM, which requires practical STM support. The
investigator's engagement with industrial researchers provides an avenue to
enhance dissemination. Public distribution of STM implementations produced by
this project provides a basis for further research and development. Several
educational and outreach activities, including course projects, enhanced core
course material, interactive presentations for a summer bridge program targeting
minority undergraduate engineering majors, and recruiting events for prospective
minority graduate students, aim to train a diverse group of programmers and
researchers in developing future reliable, scalable software systems.
