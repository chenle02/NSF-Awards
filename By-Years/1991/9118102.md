Funds are requested for instrumentation necessary to establish the fermentation
protein of a complete Cell Culture Facility in the Institute for Biological
Research and Technology at the University of South Carolina. This facility will
replace an unusable 28 L fermenter, and will provide a wide range of
fermentation services to the University community. The User Group includes
faculty from the Department of Chemistry and Biological Sciences, as well as the
College of Pharmacy and School of Medicine. The scope of projects to be
supported by this instrumentation includes: (1) studies on the structure and
function of hemeiron oxygenase enzymes; (2) mechanistic studies on thymidylate
synthase; (3) studies on mammalian gene expression; (4) work on thymidylate
synthase and fluoropyrimidine resistance; (5) structure function studies on
matrix vesicle annexins; (6) using selenium as a probe of structure/function of
biomacromolecules; (7) examining physiology, ecology, and evolution of bacterial
functional group; (8) studies of the genetics of coal solubiolization; (9)
mechanism of gene regulation in Caulobacter; (10) structural studies of rat
spermatid transition protein 2; (11) examining the interaction of antitumor
agents azinomycin A and B with DNA; (12) mechanistic studies of enolase; (13)
cell division gene products of Bacillus subtilis; (14) role of human
papillomaviruses in the transformation of human cells; (15) formation and role
of pseudouridine in mRNA splicing cofactors; (16) preclinical evaluation of a
human recombinant alph B/D hybrid interferon in therapy of hepatitis and
papillomavirus infections; and (17) integrins and their interaction with the
extracellular matrix.
