Building on insights developed during Phase I of the Cal Poly Science Noyce
Program, this Phase II Project is producing twenty new STEM teachers (to add to
the thirty-three produced in Phase I) while tracking and analyzing the progress
of the first cohort of Noyce Scholars. Cooperating school districts include:
Santa Maria-Bonita School District, Santa Maria Joint Union High School
District, and Lucia Mar School District.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: Phase II Noyce Scholars are benefiting a) from a required research
experience through the STEM Teacher and Researcher (STAR) Program during their
pre-service years that can be incorporated into and enrich their credential
coursework and clinical field experience, and b) from interactions with and
mentoring from Phase I Noyce alumni during their training and early years of
teaching in high need schools via face-to-face meetings and online interactions.
Noyce alumni are benefiting from annual summer professional development
workshops designed to support implementation of scientific and engineering
practices experienced through prior research into their classroom teaching
through modeling, project-based learning, and other proven strategies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to the benefits to area and
other high needs schools due to the teachers produced by this project, the
evaluation of the project is helping to provide evidence to support the adoption
by others of the STEM teacher education and professional development practices
found to be effective by this program. Longitudinal studies of the Phase I Noyce
STAR alumni is providing valuable insights into the effects of undergraduate
research experiences, mentoring, and professional development on the career
trajectories, teaching approaches, and effectiveness of these teacher-
researchers.
