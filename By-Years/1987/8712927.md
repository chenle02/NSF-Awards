The REU Computer Science Project at Northern Michigan University will be
comprised of two distinct but related tracks, research projects in heuristic
search directed by Hal Martin and research projects in logic programming and
programming environments directed by Don Faust. Before the beginning of the
eight week project, each student will be expected to have familiarized himself
or herself with the fundamental ideas of either heuristic search or of logic
programming, depending upon the track of the program in which they are
participating. In heuristic search this will be the first three chapters of Nils
Nilsson's "Principles of Artificial Intelligence" and Part 1 of Judea Pearl's
"Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer Problem Solving", and in
logic programming will consist of either Chapters 4, 5 and 6 of Nilsson's
"Principles of Artificial Intelligence " or some standard treatment of the
first-order predicate calculus together "Foundation of Logic Programming". By no
later than the beginning of the third week each student, in either the heuristic
search group or the logic programming and programming environment group, will
have begun work on a particular research project. Project leaders will
encourage, but not insist upon, students working jointly on projects in teams of
two or three.
