Funds are requested from the NSF to assist in the purchase of a 500 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) console and two probes. The requested console will
replace an existing Varian VXR-500 console (made in 1987) and will be located in
the recently expanded Department of Chemistry's Instrumentation Facility (DCIF).
The addition of a modern 500 MHz NMR console is an integral part of a major
initiative, including a $540,000 renovation, which is already underway to
upgrade and modernize the multi-user DCIF at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The new capabilities provided by a 500 MHz NMR instrument with three
rf channels and pulsed field gradients are vital for the carrying out of
biologically-related research in the Department. Projects that will benefit from
the acquisition of a high-field NMR instrument fall into the following general
categories: (1) investigations of drug-DNA interactions; (2) design of drugs
that selectively inactivate tumor cells; (3) development of a chemical
understanding of the basis for helicity in proteins; and (4) NMR studies of
small proteins. At present, the two 500 MHz NMR consoles in the DCIF are more
than 10 years old. The lack of modern, high-field NMR instrumentation requires
Departmental researchers with a need for state-of-the-art NMR technology to
obtain time at regional facilities and negatively impacts productivity.
Biological research being carried out in the Department would be greatly
facilitated by a 500 MHz NMR console with increased sensitivity, better shims,
digital filtering, pulsed-field gradients, selective excitation, and triple
resonance.
