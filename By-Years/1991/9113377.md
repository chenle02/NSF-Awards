ABSTRACT In Musey, a Chadic language of northern Cameroon and southwestern
Chad, the initial consonant of a word constrains the possible tone patterns
which a word may exhibit. The nature of this relationship appears to be
different from cases of tonal dependence on consonants attested in other parts
of the world. Furthermore, the connection between the initial consonant and the
tone pattern of a word is especially unclear in Musey because the phonetic
nature of many of the contrasting consonants is itself obscure. This
dissertation project will analyze the tone system and investigate the
relationships between consonant type fundamental frequency, and tone in Musey.
Fieldwork will be conducted in Northern Cameroon. The student will examine tone
in Musey and then construct and record the materials for a series of acoustic,
aerodynamic, and perceptual experiments. The data collected will be analyzed in
the field using portable phonetic instrumentation; supplementary analyses will
be conducted at the UCLA Phonetic Laboratory as well. This study will provide a
comprehensive analysis of the Musey tone system, with particular attention given
to consonantal effects on tone. The phonetic experiments will determine the
phonetic characteristics of an obscure consonantal contrast and examine the
phonetic effects of these consonants on fundamental frequency. The phonetic
analyses will provide new data leading to reconsideration of the interdependence
between phonetic and phonological effects of consonants on fundamental frequency
and tone and the implications for a theory of the synchronic and diachronic
relationships between consonants and tone.
