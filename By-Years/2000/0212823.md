Richard Stratt of Brown University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop methods employing the instantaneous
normal mode (INM) approach to explore intramolecular vibrational energy flow
within polyatomic molecules in liquids, and the intermolecular liquid dynamics
revealed by fifth order two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy. Recent progress in
incorporating dynamical anharmonicities and nonlinear interactions into the INM
formalism are expected to help reveal the ways in which molecules choose between
competing pathways for intramolecular vibrational energy relaxation, and help to
identify the amount of dephasing to be expected from different intermolecular
motions. Insights are also expected into the events that lead to homogeneous
broadening in a variety of spectroscopic venues.

Chemical processes in liquids take place over a tremendously wide range of time
scales, but many of the key "triggering" events seem to occur in times well
under a trillionth of a second. This dichotomy is especially evident when one
examines how energy flows in liquids at a molecular level. It can take anywhere
from a trillionth of a second to seconds to release the energy buried within the
vibrations of a molecule into the surrounding solution, but such processes are
driven by a solvent friction whose lifetime is invariably less than a trillionth
of a second. Only relatively recently, experimental techniques have been able to
examine vibrations in liquids at these ultrafast time scales and with sufficient
sophistication to learn about underlying molecular mechanisms in the dynamics of
liquids. This project aims to develop a framework to interpret the results from
these challenging new experiments that study vibrational energy relaxation
pathways in molecules dissolved in liquids.
