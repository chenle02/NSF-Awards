With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Bates College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
the development of chiral NMR shift reagents; b) the biomimetic synthesis of
paeciolospirone, a marine polyketide; and c) the development of
metalloporphyrin-based heterogeneous catalysts for use in the decomposition of
toxic chemicals or for environmentally-benign synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in a number of areas, in particular environmental
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
