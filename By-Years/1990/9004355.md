The research performed under this award will include performance evaluation and
design for communication networks of the future, particularly large, high-speed
optical networks. The main topics are 1) improved bounds and approximations for
circuit-switched networks, 2) dynamic local routing strategies, 3) massively
parallel switching algorithms, 4) optical interconnection patterns, and 5)
computation with unreliable components. The approach includes modeling,
analysis, and design. The models will be based on current and anticipated future
technology and will cover the spectrum of networks from circuit-switched to
datagram packet networks. Analysis will consist of a mixture of exact
probabilistic methods and simulation. Design will be motivated by modeling and
analysis and aided by optimization tools of both combinatorial and nonlinear
iterative types. Inequalities from information theory, mathematical physics,
decision theory, and combinatorics will be applied to yield new performance
bounds, providing a bridge between design and performance evaluation.
