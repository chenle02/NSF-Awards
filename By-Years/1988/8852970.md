This award will provide funds for equipment to establish a microinjection
facility at Union College, specifically to introduce substances such s Lucifer
Yellow and fluorescent dextrans by iontophoresis and direct pressure injection
into opaque, penetration-sensitive embryos. The facility will be used for
demonstration of a modern experimental technique in the undergraduate embryology
course and by students doing individual research projects under faculty
supervision. The instruments to be purchased included an Olympus stereo-
dissecting microscope with photographic attachments, a helium-cadmium laser,
micromanipulators, an intracellular amplifier and a vibration isolation table.
This facility will significantly upgrade the offerings in developmental biology,
which have historically been classical, by incorporating a new technique into
the embryology course and increasing the sophistication of the equipment
available to the research students in animal development. The grantee
institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
