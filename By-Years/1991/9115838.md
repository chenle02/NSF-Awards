In this Experimental Physical Chemistry program (Chemistry Division) project,
Professor Mark Berg (University of Texas, Austin) will use picosecond laser
techniques (time resolved hole burning and Raman echoes) to study the dynamics
of solvent interactions with reacting, non-polar solute molecules in liquids.
Effects of solvation on electron and vibrational states, local diffusional
motion near solutes, solute-solvent thermal energy transfer, and correlated
solvent motion will be studied. %%% Professor Berg will use ultra fast laser
pulses to directly observe effects of solvent on chemical reactions in liquids.
The new methods developed as part of this study are important because they can
be applied to a much wider class of reactions than was possible previously.
