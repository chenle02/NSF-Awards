High-skilled immigrant entrepreneurs contribute to U.S. economy by starting
companies that create jobs and promote innovation. Much of our current
understanding of the contribution of highly skilled entrepreneurs is based on
popular accounts as available data sources do not allow for the identification
of entrepreneurial firms in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) fields. To provide empirical evidence this project will create new
databases and new methods that will define high-skilled immigrant entrepreneurs
in a systematic and rigorous manner. The project will then examine the choices
faced by immigrants when deciding to start a new firm versus the decision to be
employed by a larger corporation. Beyond the decision to start a firm the
project will examine potential constraints that limit the growth and expansion
of firms started by high-skilled immigrant entrepreneurs when compared to
similar firms. The project contributes an understanding of the contribution of
new firms started by highly skilled immigrants to the pace and direction of U.S.
innovation and employment growth and makes suggestions to address policies that
constrain the growth of these firms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project creates a
longitudinal data platform to answer specific questions both at the person- and
firm-level using micro-data on individuals and firms, including the Longitudinal
Employer ? Household Dynamics (LEHD), Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the
Decennial Censuses and the American Community Surveys (ACS). The work covers a
long time horizon (1991-2011), containing the most recent recession and initial
recovery period. The specific research questions the project addresses include,
the trends in the number, size, location and type of firms founded by
immigrants; the number and quality of jobs created by those firms; the pathways
leading immigrants into entrepreneurship; and, innovation patterns in the new
start-ups. The LEHD based measures of immigrant entrepreneurs constructed under
this project provide the basis for future research on this topic. &lt;br/&gt;
