The Geospatial Line of Business (LoB) is an Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) E-Government initiative to identify ways in which services commonly found
in numerous agencies can be provided in a more efficient manner. The
establishment of the Geospatial LoB will result in a more coordinated approach
to producing, maintaining, and using geospatial data, and will ensure
sustainable participation from Federal partners to establish collaborative model
for geospatial-related activities and investments. The contribution by the
National Science Foundation will support full participation in the Geospatial
LoB development activities designed to achieve the planned improvement to the
baseline for each performance measurement indicator outlined in the FY 2009
Geospatial LoB.
