The primary aims of the present proposed project is to study
entanglement&lt;br/&gt;decoherence of many-body qubits or multilevel quantum
systems and to develop a&lt;br/&gt;quantum trajectory approach in several
important AMO physics domains. Two examples&lt;br/&gt;are: entanglement dynamics
of multilevel atomic systems coupled to a quantized field&lt;br/&gt;and non-
Markovian trajectories for quantum systems coupled to a
fermionic&lt;br/&gt;environment. Our primary interest of application is quantum
decoherence of quantum&lt;br/&gt;open systems in AMO and condensed matter
systems and the simulation of quantum&lt;br/&gt;entanglement dynamics of many-
body systems.
