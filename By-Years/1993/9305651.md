Propagation of electromagnetic pulses in thick optical media are investigated
using numerical techniques. The problem is to try to understand whether resonant
radiation can propagate in an undistorted fashion over long distances. The extra
flexibility offered by two driving fields makes the problem interesting in
optical fiber technology.
