This project provides Masters-level education in the science and practice of
Information Assurance. Students with undergraduate computer science degrees are
placed in a specially designed two-year computer security track at CISR, one of
the world's preeminent programs combining research and studies in information
systems security and information assurance. Through courses involving extensive
laboratory exercises and projects, students learn how to design, build,
configure and manage systems and networks securely. The program provides
students with a firm grounding in the foundations of computer science and
conveys concepts and techniques vital for understanding Information Assurance.
Students receive regular mentoring by CISR faculty on curriculum and employment
options. Experience in leadership and teambuilding are fostered through an
innovative computer science program, while students establish esprit de corps
through weekly meetings, common study areas, and an IA outreach program to the
local community. Each student completes a thesis project in collaboration with
other students, faculty, and research staff. The thesis research permits
exploration of a topic in depth and ensures an appreciation of the unsolved
problems and challenges in Information Assurance, as well as providing valuable
experience in critical thinking and writing.
