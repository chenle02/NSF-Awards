EIA- 0113679 Black, Michael Brown University ITR/SY: The Computer Science of
Biologically-Embedded Systems

Biologically-embedded systems that directly couple artificial computational
devices with neural systems are emerging as a new area of information technology
research. The physical structure and adaptability of the human brain make these
biologically-embedded systems quite different from computational systems
typically studied in Computer Science.

Fundamentally, biologically-embedded systems must make inferences about the
behavior of a biological system based on measurements of neural activity that
are indirect, ambiguous, and uncertain. Moreover these systems must adapt to
short- and long-term changes in neural activity of the brain. These problems are
addressed by a multi-disciplinary team in the context of developing a robot arm
that is controlled by simultaneous recordings from neurons in the motor cortex
of awake behaving monkeys. The goal is to probabilistically model the behavior
of these neurons as a function of arm motion and then reconstruct continuous arm
trajectories based on the neural activity. To do so, the project will exploit
mathematical and computational techniques from computer vision, image
processing, and machine learning.

This work will enhance scientific knowledge about how to design and build new
types of hybrid human/computer systems, will explore new devices to assist the
severely disabled, will address the information technology questions raised by
these biologically-embedded systems, and will contribute to the understanding of
neural coding.
