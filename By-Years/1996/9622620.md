Cavalier 9622620 This research centers on making effective use of real-time
measurement data to develop and implement the concept of Sequential Tolerance
Control. The approach uses measurement information at the completion of stage j
to exploit available space inside a dynamic feasible zone and reposition the set
point for operations j+1 to n. The procedure is repeated at appropriate
locations along the n operations so as to optimize the production of an
acceptable part. A model and solution procedure for a generic n-constraints,
n-operations problem is sought. The performance of the procedure will be tested,
as well as technological implementation demonstrated. Conventional tolerance
control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and permissible variation
about this set point to insure compliance with specifications. This approach is
inadequate for complex, low volume, high value added parts such as those found
in aircraft, nuclear or precision instrument manufacturing. The above research
should prove useful to alleviate the above concerns, as well as provide useful
ramifications for the production of complex, low-volume, high-value-added parts.
