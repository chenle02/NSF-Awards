The history of the Central American avifauna will be addressed using molecular
methods and methods of vicariance biogeography. The relatively well known
history of southern Central America makes it appropriate for using the
vicariance approach to avian biogeographic analysis. Starch-gel electrophoresis
of proteins and analyses of nucleic acids (amplification and sequencing of
specific regions of the genome) will be used to estimate phylogenetic
relationships among Central American endemic taxa and their South American
sister taxa. Specific hypotheses concerning the evolution of Central American
taxa will be tested by comparing these phylogenies. Levels of genetic
differentiation will be used to assess relative ages of splitting events of
South and Central American highland and lowland taxa.
