9705195 Tu It is the purpose of this research to investigate the wetting
behavior of Pb-free solders on thin film metallization. Emphasis is on the
wetting tip behavior and intermetallic compound formation during soldering.
Investigated is a unique thin film reaction where the grains ripen and spall
resulting in dewetting. To understand the basic science of reactive wetting and
the applications to thin film metallization in electronic packaging, two main
topics are the focus of the research: (1) the instability of a reactive wetting
tip and (2) the mechanisms of spalling and dewetting. The dependence of wetting
angle on the composition of Sn in dilute Pb(Sn) alloys is examined. It is
expected that the wetting angle changes observed in the case of Pb(Sn) on Ni
will be less than that of Pb(Sn) on Cu, which, in turn, will be much less than
that of Pb(Sn) on Pd. Previous work shows that the wetting angle of molten
eutectic SnPb on Pd is unstable and changes with time. A systematic and
comparative study on Ni, Cu, and Pd surfaces is conducted.. %%% Solder
technology is essential for electronic packaging. The Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) has projected a trend of increasing use of solder in device
manufacturing. The US Congress and Environmental Projection Agency (EPA),
however, has expressed a concern over the use of Pb in the electronics industry.
As a consequence, lead (Pb)-free solders and their processes, properties and
reliability need to be studied. ***
