9728206 Feller Atomic-level computer simulations will be used to probe the
structure and dynamics of bilayer membranes containing a variety of
phospholipids, as well as small solutes, nonionic surfactants, and peptides.
Because of the inherent disorder in the liquid-crystalline phase in which lipids
exist at physiological temperature, atomic level structural data are extremely
difficult to obtain experimentally. Thus these simulations will complement the
existing body of experimental data. These experimental data will be used in two
ways for this project. Where possible, comparison will be made between
properties observed in the simulation with those obtained experimentally in
order to test the validity of the work. Secondly, many of the analyses of these
simulations have as their goal the extraction of bilayer properties which can be
utilized in the interpretation of experiments. The specific objectives of this
research are the determinations of the volumes of fragments of lipid molecules
with a precision not available experimentally. These data will be used to
introduce packing models into the interpretation of membrane diffraction
experiments. The fraction of free or void volume associated with each fragment
will be determined. This will address the role played by specific parts of the
lipid in the permeation of the membrane by small solutes. This project has
biological relevance because of the importance of bilayer membranes to cell
structure and function. This work will provide a detailed picture of bilayer
systems at the atomic level, and will provide information on the roles of
specific parts of the lipid in permeation. ***
