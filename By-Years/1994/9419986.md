NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY Capaldi, IBN 94-19986, Stimulus selection effects in
conditioned preferences and aversions Many organisms, including humans, have
strong food preferences and aversions which are important influences on diet.
Most of these preferences and aversions are learned. The mechanisms involved in
this learning are quite complex, involving both the sensory qualities (taste and
odor) and the dietary value of the food. For example, rats can learn to prefer
an arbitrary flavor (such as unsweetened cinnamon) if it is associated with a
food that has either calories or a good taste (such as sugar). Previous work has
suggested that tastes are more easily learned as the basis for aversions while
odors are more easily the basis for learned preferences. Capaldi will carry out
a series of experiments which will investigate the relationships between
preferences and aversions on the one hand and odor and taste on the other in an
attempt to determine why this might be the case. The results will reveal new
information about learned food preferences and aversions, with important
implications for both general learning theory and the understanding of the
origins of human food choice.
