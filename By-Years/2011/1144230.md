The goal of the conference is to have talks by both well established and
promising probabilists. We intend to continue to invite women to speak and to
seek speakers from other underrepresented groups. The meetings will have four
featured talks, two on Thursday morning and two on Friday morning. Thursday and
Friday afternoons will be set aside for informal sessions where participants
will be encouraged to give ten-minute presentations of their recent work or to
discuss open problems. The proposed areas of coverage for this year's conference
include Brownian motion, local times, Markov chains and processes, random
structures and algorithms, particle systems, and stochastic analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialized mathematical meetings like this are very
important. They give people an opportunity to exchange ideas and try out new
theories. They also give young people an opportunity to question experienced
mathematicians. Regional meetings are especially important because it is easy to
follow up on significant conversations. They also foster the sense of belonging
to a group of active researchers---in this case the Northeast Probability group
