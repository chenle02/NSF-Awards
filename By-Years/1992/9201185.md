This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
develop the technique of Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy for the
characterization of the surface structure and chemistry of "soft" material
surfaces. In addition to work on problems of instrument development, calibration
of the scanning optical microscopy methodology will be carried out. Application
of the method to a number of problems involving biological interfaces,
membranes, and organic monolayers will be pursued. The development of a
microscopic technique which can provide very high resolution structural
information on these difficult surfaces, in combination with spatially resolved
spectroscopic and chemical information, will have a very wide impact in the
field of surface analysis and characterization. %%% The ability to characterize
the structure of the surfaces of biological and macromolecular samples is
crucial to the understanding of membrane processes and polymer properties. The
research being carried out in this project will develop a promising new
technique for the structural characterization of these "soft" material surfaces.
This scanning optical microscopy method will have a great impact on the
understanding of this important class of materials.
