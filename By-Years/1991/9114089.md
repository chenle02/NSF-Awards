In 1987, the Engineering Foundation Conference on Composite Construction was
held in Henniker, New Hampshire. Composite Construction II, a continuation of
the 1987 conference, is organized to fulfill the intent of the 1987 resolution,
and to again provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners form
around the world to meet and exchange vital information in this fast developing
area of engineering practice. The conference will be limited to approximately
100 participants, with one-half of the participants invited from abroad, and
will cover all phases of design, construction and research related to composite
steel- concrete structures. Repair and strengthening of existing structures, as
well as new construction will be discussed. Composite Construction II will
provide an exciting opportunity for an international exchange of ideas that will
benefit the structural engineering and construction fields both inside and
outside of the U.S.
