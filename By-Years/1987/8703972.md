This proposal requests funds to purchase an advanced graphics workstation that
will enhance the computer services for users in the areas of biochemistry,
biology, and chemistry. The workstation will serve as a local host for the
PROPHET system, a national resource sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health. The PROPHET system will serve the needs of approximately l50 scientists
at the Atlanta University Center Schools, a consortium of seven independent
historically black institutions, and other neighboring universities through an
easy access to the software via an existing broad-band local area network. In
addition to software packages for graphics and molecular modeling, molecular
mechanics and reaction kinetics calculations, the users can access gene,
protein, and x-ray crystallographic data banks. Support is strongly
recommended.//
