9112251 Wang This grant provides funds for the acquisition by Florida State
University of a resin transfer molding (RTM) technology testbed. The RTM
instrumentation will consist of four integral components: an RTM machine,
process tooling and molds, an intelligent process controller, and sensors. The
RTM instrumentation will support four research programs, RTM process modeling,
process design, process control, and an integrated RTM product and process
development environment. This instrumentation will build upon traditional
materials projects to create an infrastructure that will consider life cycle
issues of new composite materials from initial concept and design to prototype
production and in-field practice. This instrumentation will enhance the research
and educational facilities of Florida State University, which seeks to increase
the pool of minority engineering and science students educated in this
discipline. The facility development will include the establishment of a
specialized RTM research and training facility, training of faculty and
students, recruitment of minority students and development of new courses. ***
