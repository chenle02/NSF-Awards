The Delaware Valley Faculty Exchange is a regional collaborative of colleges and
universities designed to break down the isolation too often felt by faculty at
undergraduate teaching institutions by integrating them into a regions that
contains several outstanding universities, the largest scientific research park
in the country, numerous medical schools, teaching hospitals and pharmaceutical
companies. A regional faculty seminar for 35 science faculty is being introduced
in an attempt to build a set of enduring relationships between research faculty
and their colleagues who teach at undergraduate institutions. The creation of a
Biological Basis of Behavior; Motivation and Perception Faculty Seminar, with an
added summer practicum component for eight of the faculty is a first step. It is
expected that the faculty seminar for the natural sciences will provide a
regional means of linking teaching faculty with their colleagues, enrich the
understanding of teaching faculty of the kinds of research that is going on in
the Delaware Valley and at the periphery of their discipline and encourage
change in the undergraduate teaching of science. Additional funding is being
provided by the University of Pennsylvania and by the individual colleges
involved.
