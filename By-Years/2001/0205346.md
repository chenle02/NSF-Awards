This project will develop a new, integrative theory of software problem
management by studying software problems in their ongoing sociotechnical
contexts. The researchers willcomparatively analyze large bodies (gigabytes) of
longitudinalproblem-report data from open-source software development projects
such as networked computer games, Internet/Web infrastructure, X-ray
astronomy/deep space imaging, and academic software research, using grounded-
theory and automated concept, data, and text-mining methods. The project will
analyze instances of (mis-)alignment between software artifacts, problem
episodes, problem-management activities, problem-management infrastructure, and
underlying social organization. Explanatory models will be built by linking
patterns of (mis-)alignment among these elements to outcomes such as ease-of-
repair, persistence of problems, amount of information exchanged, kinds of
skills needed, and structure of social organization. The resulting models can
guide the development of new tools, infrastructures, and organizational
practices for software. They will also provide new perspectives on community-
wide practices of capturing and managing knowledge. This research will provide a
conceptual shift in understanding how system development and use are bound
together with the richness, variety, and temporal evolution of the socio-
technical contexts provided by the global software industry.
