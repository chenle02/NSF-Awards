This research focuses on the application of microwave discharges to plasma
processing of integrated circuits. The experiments make use of a new microwave
discharge reactor called a microwave plasma disk reactor. The reactor, which can
be operated from above 10 Torr to less than 10;i-;i3 Torr in any gas, consists
of a disk-shaped microwave discharge inside a tuneable cylindrical microwave
cavity and is adaptable to many different experimental conditions. The research
consists of three major tasks: plasma reactor characterization; microwave plasma
oxidation experiments; and microwave plasma etching experiments. Although the
experimental systems employed for each of these are to be similar, the
investigation makes use of three separate experimental setups: one setup to
characterize the microwave plasma, a separate experimental system to investigate
oxidation, and an entirely new setup to investigate microwave plasma etching.
