The primary objective of this proposal is to quantify variation in the anatomy
of the head and jaw of four, closely related species within a subfamily of New
World monkeys, the Atelinae. Currently there are a number of diverse approaches
by which quantification of the morphology of complex structures has been
attempted. Each has a number of advantages and disadvantages. The PIs will
utilize several of these in order to provide data which can then be used to
explain cranial variation within these monkeys. Hypotheses related to function,
such as the role of dietary adaptations, will be tested to clarify the role of
developmental factors in the production of variation. The results should help to
clarify the forces which were involved in the diversification of these related
species for it is thought that much of the variability seen today results from
alterations in the patterns of growth in the species. The results may also have
explanatory power regarding the relationship of form, function and evolution in
other primate groups.
