The problem-oriented geology curriculum at Bates College, emphasizing
quantitative field-based inquiry, is being improved significantly by the recent
acquisition of gravity surveying equipment. Student experiences with problem-
oriented, quantitative investigations begin in the introductory courses and
continue through the required two-semester senior thesis. The additional
instrumentation expands research opportunities for students to explore questions
of crustal structure (e.g. the subsurface shape of plutons or the location and
kinematics of faults). Students at various levels of instruction become familiar
with the basic principles of gravity, the geologic applications of gravity
studies, the procedure for conducting a gravity survey, the quantitative
reduction of gravity observations, and 2- and 3-dimensional modeling of gravity
data.
