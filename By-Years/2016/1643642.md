"Advancing Women's Education in STEM (AWE-STEM)" addresses the national need to
prepare more women for careers in STEM. The project plans to provide
scholarships to three cohorts of twelve students over five years. AWE-STEM
scholars will have the opportunity to participate in several high impact
activities, including STEM summer workshops, research activities on- and off-
campus, field trips, seminars, and an introduction to STEM professional
experiences through an annual speaker series. As a women's institution producing
a high number of K-12 science teachers Meredith College has the potential to
positively influence the number of women pursuing STEM careers as well as have a
positive impact on the STEM pipeline through increasing the pool of qualified
STEM teachers and providing female role models for young
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWE-STEM focuses on three significant issues: the
identification of High Impact Practices (HIP) having the greatest impact on
student retention overall, the greatest impact on retention of under-represented
or low-income students, and the greatest impact on student knowledge gains for
underrepresented students as measured by GPA. Cohorts are fostered through a
shared first year experience course and an institutional structure in which STEM
majors in the same year typically enroll in the same courses. Mentoring events
such as dinner at a faculty member's house and other HIP activities are also
instrumental to cohort building. Results of the project will be presented at
professional meetings of the Mathematical Association of America, the Chemical
Education section of the National American Chemical Society, and the American
Society of Parasitologists, as well as at the Meredith College's annual
Pedagogy, Innovation, and Enhancement workshop.
