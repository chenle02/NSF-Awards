With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Wheeling Jesuit University will acquire an Anasazi
EFT-NMR conversion package, which will allow the department to upgrade an
obsolete nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) to a Fourier transform
(FT)-multinuclear system. Faculty at Wheeling Jesuit are synthesizing indium and
gallium dithiocarbamates for photovoltaic applications, and this equipment will
allow them to identify products and impurities. The instrument will also be used
by undergraduates for their required thesis research and in their course work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including materials chemistry.
