Career: This research is designed to address two major problem areas in managing
infrastructure deterioration, renewal, and rehabilitation. First, environmental
laws are changing faster than we can design and construct infrastructure
systems. Second, because of these rapid changes, there is a critical need for
assessment technologies to evaluate economically `smart` infrastructure
alternatives that can sustain changes in environmental laws through its life
cycle. The ultimate goal of the research is to use the proposed `sick building`
application as a first to develop an innovative methodology that could give
engineers and policy makers the support system that will provide infrastructure
planners a fundamental assessment technology to quantitatively evaluate current
and future infrastructure systems in light of scientific, social political
(national versus local), fiscal, and environmental constraints. The objective of
this research is to develop an integrated quantitative and qualitative life
cycle cost analysis assessment technology for cost benefit evaluation of `sick
building` renewal and rehabilitation within environmental compliance
constraints.
