A number of so-called massively parallel computers exist today. While some of
these support an easier-to-program shared memory programming model, the greatest
potential for highly efficient use of non-shared memory parallel computers will
require use of some form of non-shared memory programming model. Distributed or
decentralized control applications also require use of a non-shared memory
programming model. This research continues previously supported work towards
developing and refining Petri-Net based models of distributed computation, and
carries the models into automated and semi-automated software tools to aid
programmers. The tool environment, called eXplicitly Parallel Algorithm analysis
Tool (XPAT), supports graphical/visual programming as much as possible and also
supports visualization of programs once written.
