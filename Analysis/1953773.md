Analysis of large sets of data is important in many contexts. Usually data is
endowed with a natural distance or metric (degree of dissimilarity) of its
elements. One of the useful approaches to analysis of such sets of data is to
use some low-distortion embeddings of the set into a space whose structure is
well-known; for example, into a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. The
more general spaces considered are called Banach spaces. After that one can use
many algorithms available in computational geometry and many tools from
classical parts of mathematics such as Calculus. If a low-distortion embedding
into a plane is available, one can even visualize the structure of the set; for
example, it is possible to see its clusters. Another application of embeddings
is to construction of approximate algorithms. This means that in cases where the
algorithms for finding the exact solution of a combinatorial optimization
problem are not practical (i.e., consume too much time) we are looking not for
the optimal solution, but for a solution close (in one or another sense) to
being optimal. In many cases, the best known approximate algorithms for exact
solutions are based on metric embeddings. The main goal of this project is to
study embeddings of discrete metric spaces into Banach spaces. Such embeddings
form a well-established tool in Theoretical Computer Science and Topology.

The existence of a low-distortion embedding into a plane is rather rare in
applications. In many contexts, weaker types of embeddings are still useful, and
even embeddings into high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional Banach spaces lead
to important results. The PI will study embeddings of discrete metric spaces
into Banach spaces. This project will contribute to the following general
problem: Find new classes of embeddings of finite and locally finite metric
spaces into Banach spaces and find new types of obstructions to such embeddings.
The main directions of proposed work are: 1. Study relations between
embeddability into different classes of Banach spaces, expansion, and girth of
graphs. 2. Study geometric properties of transportation cost spaces, known to
contain isometrically metric spaces on which they are built. 3. Find
characterizations of well-known classes of Banach spaces in terms of embeddings.
4. Study relations between embeddability of metric spaces and embeddability of
their parts. The methods are expected to be a mixture of methods of geometric
functional analysis and graph theory, with occasional usage of methods of
probability theory and geometric group theory.
