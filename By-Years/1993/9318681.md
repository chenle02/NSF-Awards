9318681 Ryan All vertebrates use their forelimbs for locomotion whether it be
for walking, swimming or flying. Yet there is a great deal of diversity in
forelimbs: The wings of a bird are anatomically different from the wings of
bats, the flippers of a seal, and the legs of a mouse. Despite these structural
and functional differences, the neurons from the brain and spinal cord
responsible for controlling movement are thought to be "wired" in basically the
same manner in all vertebrates. This has come to be known as the motor control
conservatism hypothesis. In this research, Dr. James Ryan will test the
conservatism hypothesis by locating and comparing the populations of neurons
controlling forelimb movements in vertebrates that use a primitive type of
locomotion (lizards) with those that use more advanced types of locomotion (bats
and birds). For example the split second maneuvers of a flying bat as it homes
in upon a moth illustrate the precise sensorimotor control of the forelimbs that
is possible. Bats are the only mammals capable of powered flight, and they
evolved flight independently from birds. These three organisms represent ideal
models for the the comparative study of locomotion control by the nervous
system. Ultimately, this research will lead to the formation of a general model
of the neural control of vertebrate locomotion. ***
