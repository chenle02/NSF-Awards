This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Developing gene expression tools to
identify the physiological states of natural populations of a marine
cyanobacterium." The important physiological activities of microorganisms that
facilitate their survival and define their roles within an ecosystem are largely
unknown. This research focuses on adapting new gene expression technologies (DNA
microarrays, in situ RT-PCR, and proteomics) to identify the environmentally-
significant physiological activities of the highly-abundant, globally-
significant marine cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus spp.
