Delaware Valley College S&A Doylestown, PA Mertz, John Delaware Valley College's
PREP Initiative is an enrichment program which will target average achieving
seventh and eighth grade students who have been traditionally underrepresented
in the areas of mathematics and sciences. The College has collaborated with four
Philadelphia School District Middle Schools for student and staff recruitment.
Each of the four schools will identify a maximum of fifteen students per school.
A four week summer encampment at the Delaware Valley College will provide
students with the opportunity to engage in group and individual educational
programming. The program will run during the month of July (students return home
on weekends). Parental participation is an essential component of program
activities. The thematic educational focus will be on environmental issues.
Through the emphasis on the environment, students will learn basic scientific,
mathematical and communication skills. In addition, an on going sub theme will
be career development/ exposure. This component will be carried out in follow up
activities as well. Follow up activities will include mentoring visits to the
four schools and evaluative activities.
