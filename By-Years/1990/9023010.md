It has become evident that for a proper understanding of public debates about
technology policy, it is necessary to take into account the normative values at
issue as well as the technical concerns. This study will contribute to our
understanding of the way normative values and technical knowledge, as a tightly
linked package, influence and are used in political conflict over technology. In
examining the case of solar energy, the project will synthesize a theoretical
framework that explains both the dynamics and the complex linkages between
normative values and scientific knowledge in the policy process. It should also
illuminate an interesting and important recent episode -- the swift rise of
solar energy in funding and visibility within the government, in response to the
energy crisis, and its swift fall back into obscurity. The analysis of documents
will be the principal methodological tool. Energy policy in general and solar
energy in particular are richly documented issue areas, replete with books,
articles, reports, and congressional hearings. The specific values involved in
this controversy will be brought out in association with policy options, and the
driving force of these associations will be examined in the course of the
research. Results will be widely disseminated in journal articles on both solar
energy policy and theoretical issues involved in studying value conflicts in
technology policy. In addition, the investigator plans to produce a monograph as
a contribution to the scholarly literature and to present reports of results at
relevant professional society meetings. This proposal is a modest request for
support to enable a talented young scholar to investigate the close links
between values and scientific knowledge in a particular debate over technology
policy. The principal investigator is well qualified; institutional support is
very good; the research design shows originality and is well worked out;
dissemination is likely to be broad and to reach appropriate audiences. Support
is highly recommended.
