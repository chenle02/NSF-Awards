This NSF REU project will provide research opportunities for 8 talented
undergraduate students to spend 8 weeks working with four faculty mentors at
Georgia State University, an outside faculty mentor from Georgia Tech, two
industrial mentors from McAfee and Barracuda Networks, and graduate students.
The teams will conduct hands-on research projects in high performance data-
mining for bioinformatics and network security. The students will work on
research projects to master professional research skills and submit research
papers for real publications. Summer activities will include participation in
student data mining competitions such as the Data Mining Cup and the UC San
Diego Data Mining Contest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project recruit students
from small colleges with limited research resources. The project will include a
web-based student data mining club (a global student data mining e-community)
that can be used by not only the REU students but also other students interested
in high performance data mining research and its applications. Opportunities to
explore broad future career opportunities will be provided by the student's
research and access to graduate students, scientists, engineers, and faculty
members. &lt;br/&gt;
