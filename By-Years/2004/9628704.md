This grant continues research of the launching and propagation of primarily ELF
waves, or "slow tails" associated with tropospheric lightning. The larger events
are frequently accompanied by mesospheric optical emissions known as "red
sprites" and/or "airglow events." The new equipment proposed will make more
precise measurements to enable much more definitive science. Digital recording
and subsequent digital filtering will eliminate the waveform distortion inherent
in analog systems. The PI will conduct measurements from two different
locations, enabling the evaluation of propagation independently of uncertain
ionospheric models, facilitating extrapolation to the source. Finally, the PI
will look into the feasibility of building a "sprite mapper," in conjunction
with "lightning locator" data.
