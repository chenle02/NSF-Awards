0345400 Stein&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NatureServe has been awarded a grant to
provide an informatics infrastructure for facilitating dynamic combined access
to large amounts of biodiversity data from its member state Heritage Programs
and other sources. The project will create an enabling database technology
framework that uses XML and web services to promote and enable open access to
data from the NatureServe network's 75 member institutions. It will also promote
interoperability and advanced data standards and best practices in the
biodiversity data community. The technology will facilitate data sharing between
the providers and other major community efforts such as the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF) and allow much better access, to distributed spatial
informatics and data integration services. The project will also enhance
NatureServe's already significant facilitation of biodiversity awareness and
education in the K-12 community. It will build capacity in historically
underserved jurisdictions such as the Navajo Nation and Puerto Rico in addition
to significantly enabling conservation and environmental management and research
on a national scale. &lt;br/&gt;
