This project is designed to provide ten undergraduate students with research
experiences in physics, astrophysics and astronomy under the supervision of
faculty members of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at San Francisco
State University. Students will be solicited from the greater San Francisco Bay
area with an emphasis on the participation of women, minority and disabled
students. This project is supported under the Program of Research Experiences
for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the
future.
