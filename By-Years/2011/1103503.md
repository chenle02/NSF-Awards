Conventional wisdom holds that the productivity of Antarctic phytoplankton is
controlled by limitation of the trace metal Fe, provided there is sufficient
light to support photosynthesis. This study involves the investigation of
additional micronutrient (trace metal) requirements, specifically cobalamin
(vitamin B12), for the growth of eukaryotic algae (e.g. diatoms,
prymnesiophytes) commonly found in abundance in polar waters. Past approaches to
this question have stressed either the biogeochemical understanding the marine
chemistry and chemical transformation of physiologically active elements such as
cobalt, or targeted biochemical and molecular biological studies of the
metabolism of this micronutrient as utilized by phytoplankton. Both of these
disciplinarily distinct approaches are needed to fully understand the effects
trace metal limitation may have on community composition of phytoplankton in the
Antarctic. In turn, understanding micronutrient controls on ecosystem
productivity are needed to interpret carbon fixation and export rates of the
marine carbon cycle in these highly productive waters, and how these may change
.

A key aspect of the study is to derive specific protein biomarkers for vitamin
B12 stress in vitro, and in turn use these to explore cobalamin stress in field
situations. Using RNAi cell lines, the researchers will conduct physiological
assays at low and high concentrations of vitamin B12 to follow expression
profiles of two potential B12-trafficking proteins. These experiments should
shed light on how these proteins are involved in acquisition and metabolism of
B12. Additionally the subcellular localization of proteins involved in B12
metabolism will be studied using fluorescent fusion tags. High resolution
transcriptomic analyses of Antarctic diatom cultures under high and low B12
concentrations will be performed to assess whether proteins are regulated by B12
availability.
