Cornell University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will collaborate on
an ocean sciences instrumentation development project to upgrade a MOCNESS
(Multiple Opening / Closing Net and Environmental Sensor System) by adding a
dual beam bio-acoustic sonar system plus an electro-fiber optic cable. The
project represents the next logical step in improving the quality of data
collected by these widely used systems that are employed in studies of plankton
distribution and ecology. The dual beam bioacoustic sonar will enable scientists
to correlate acoustic signals with animals actually captured in the net system.
Investigations of animal distributions will be improved by being able to modify
ongoing sampling programs based on concurrent data, and study small scale
distributions of organisms relative to what the net captured. The data stream
from the bioacoustic sonar plus the environmental sensors exceeds the telemetry
capability of currently used electro-mechanical cables. The new system will make
use of rapidly advancing fiber-optic cable technology that can carry larger data
streams. The system will have broad application in planned ocean science
research initiatives.
