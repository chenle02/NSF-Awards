The Fifth International Conference on Forensic Statistics will be held at Isola
di San Servolo, Venice, Italy, on August 30th to September 2nd, 2002. The
conference is intended to allow statisticians, forensic scientists, lawyers, and
scholars from related disciplines to discuss the many and varied uses of
statistics and probability in legislative, administrative and judicial
proceedings. Forensic Statistics, the application of statistics and probability
to legal matters, is an expanding field. The current debates surrounding the
presentation of evidence based on DNA profiling, epidemiological studies on the
health effects of various drugs, and racial profiling are just three examples.
There is a great need for statisticians to provide guidance to forensic
scientists, and lawyers and the courts. By bringing together statisticians,
forensic scientists, lawyers and other scholars, this fifth international
conference will further the interdisciplinary understanding of Statistics and
Probability applied to legal matters. Previous conferences in this series have
been held at North Carolina State University, the University of Edinburg, and
the Arizona State University. This proposal provides funds to insure that U.S.
participants will be able to hear and network with experts on this topic from
around the world, and to provide access to the conference for selected new
researchers and members of underrepresented groups
