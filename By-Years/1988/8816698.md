This research, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is
making important contributions to the understanding of energy flow and
intramolecular dynamics in the excited electronic states of polyatomic
molecules. Professor Hudson's research group has developed unique spectroscopic
capabilities that allow the study of the initial motion of a molecule that has
been excited by a single vacuum ultraviolet photon from its ground electronic
state. Resonance Raman spectroscopy performed with excitation wavelengths as
short as 125 nm will be used to provide new information on the electronic
symmetry, geometry, and coupling mechanisms of molecular excited states.
Emphasis will be placed on triatomic molecules that undergo rapid changes in
geometry when excited, polyatomic molecules with unexplained vibronic
progressions in absorption, vibronic coupling in forbidden transitions, and
highly excited vibrational states of molecules with interesting motional
coordinates.
