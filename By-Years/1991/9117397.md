In plate tectonic reconstructions the Caribbean Plate (area of present-day
Caribbean Sea and West Indies) is assumed to have originated in the Pacific and
was, in fact, a part of the Pacific Farallon Plate during Mesozoic times. We
plan to examine ophiolite masses (remnants of oceanic crust) to determine the
genesis and age of the Caribbean Plate. Clues to the origin and actual oldest
age of the Caribbean Plate can be found by examining microfossils (Radiolaria)
occurring in cherts within ophiolite remnants in the West Indies. It is
conceivable that remnants of older ophiolite complexes are present that pre-date
the formation of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico and that contain a
radiolarian assemblage having a unique paleolatitudinal imprint.
