Noyce Scholarships are enabling 52 students who would not otherwise have the
financial resources to continue as graduate students to pursue a science
teaching credential at UCLA. This project targets and recruits senior science
majors who are interested in teaching, who have family ties and commitments in
the local communities of our partner schools, and who wish to remain in the
geographical region. The persistence of these credentialed teachers stems from a
research-based Science Teacher Education Program that prepares teachers to have
the commitment, capacity, and resilience to teach in schools with diverse
populations who are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. As students in this
program, they are supported by a cadre of faculty and peers from the first
credential year of coursework, through the challenging initial year of teaching
and M.Ed completion, and into the subsequent early career years. Teacher
isolation is addressed by developing cohorts within the targeted schools and
placement into the schools in pairs, providing a built-in peer support network.
