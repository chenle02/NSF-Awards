Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) are the dominant sites of star formation in the
Galaxy, yet the nature and distribution of their young stellar content has yet
to be thoroughly or systematically investigated due to the large distances to
and large angular sizes of the clouds. Dr. Elizabeth Lada and her colleagues, at
the University of Florida, have been awarded roughly 200 nights of "survey" time
allocated over 5 years from the National Optical Astronomy Observatories. This
extremely large allocation of time on the 2.1-m and 4-m telescopes at Kitt Peak
will be used to study the full mass range of young stars within nearby GMCs.
These researchers are using the world's first near-IR multi-object spectrometer
called FLAMINGOS, to obtain sensitive near-IR imaging surveys and for the first
time extensive near-IR spectral classifications for stars in GMCs. The survey
observations will provide a statistically significant census of near-infrared
sources within the nearest giant star forming molecular clouds to a depth and
completeness unequaled by any other existing or planned survey. A complete
catalog of the near-IR photometry and spectroscopy for all sources will be
constructed and provided to the entire astronomical community. This database
will provide a unique and valuable resource for studies of star formation and
molecular clouds using both ground based optical and radio telescopes (e.g.
Gemini & ALMA) and space missions (e.g. SIRTF, Chandra & XMM). ***
