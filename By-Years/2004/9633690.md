ABSTRACT OPP-9633690 Cochran, Jorgensen, Black, Kraus This proposal is for a
series of workshops and working sessions to coordinate the scientific data and
results of the project "Social Transitions in the North: Alaska and the Russian
Far East" (OPP-9496351). The Principal Investigators of the original project,
Steven McNabb, Alexander Pika, and William Richards, died while doing fieldwork
in the Russian Far East. They were completing the fourth year of a study
examining social change and health in Native villages in Alaska, the Aleutian
Islands, Chukotka and Kamchatka. The Alaska Native Science Commission (ANSC)
will serve as successor institution and coordinate the activities of a senior
advisory group which will oversee the completion of the project. This group
consists of Patricia Cochran, Executive Director, Alaska Native Science
Commission, Professor Lydia Black, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Professor
Joseph Jorgensen, University of California Irvine, and Professor Robert Kraus,
University of Kentucky. The ANSC will convene the meetings, facilitate the
archiving of project materials, manage the budget, and help produce a final
report.
