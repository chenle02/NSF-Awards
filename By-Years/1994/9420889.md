U. Maryland This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in
support of the research of Professor Patrick Mariano at the University of
Maryland. The theme of the research will be single electron transfer (SET)
photochemistry. Specific goals will be to define the mechanisms of photoredox
processes, to define the nature and reactivity patterns of ion-radicals which
are intermediates in SET reactions, and to develop new SET-photochemical
reactions. Specific areas of investigation will be heterolytic fragmentation
reactions of SET-derived cation -radicals, synthetic applications of SET-
photochemical and metal-catalyzed oxidative cyclization reactions, and the
photochemical generation and reactions of azomethine ylides. Photochemical
single electron transfer reactions provide reactive radical and radical ion
species which are of inherent fundamental interest, as well as key intermediates
in a variety of technologically significant synthetic applications.
