The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to significantly decrease the cost of environmentally friendly, new
home construction. Currently, more than 1/6 of American households spend over
half of their income on housing. This project is developing an artificial
intelligence (AI)-based autonomous heavy-lift unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
capable of building homes out of the cheapest, most abundant building material,
earth. Such homes, referred to as adobe, are historically expensive due to high
labor costs. However, the hhigh precision and versatility of AI-controlled UAVs
enable autonomous construction that is cost-competitive and offers significant
additional benefits, such as energy efficiency, fire resistance, and
soundproofing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project will prototype an autonomous heavy-lift UAV capable of
performing the individual tasks necessary to build the walls of a monolithic
adobe structure with a novel robotic arm. For example, forming the adobe
requires pushing a still-wet wall into the desired shape with a trowel. This
force transfers to the UAV which must generate an equal-but-opposite force to
maintain stability. No current UAV flight controller can handle these forces
while maintaining stable flight. The company will use deep reinforcement
learning to train a flight controller that can handle these and related forces
while remaining in stable flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
