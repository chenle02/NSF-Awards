Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project
between Norfolk State University and Purdue University is conducting a Delphi
study as a first step towards creating a concept inventory for laser theory.
Concept inventories are typically multiple choice tests that are designed to
evaluate whether or not a student has a working knowledge of a fundamental set
of concepts in a given discipline. Concept inventories are being developed in
many areas of science and engineering in order to better measure and understand
student learning. This project is conducting Delphi studies with recognized
experts in laser theory in order to determine the appropriate conceptual content
for the inventory instrument and to identify common areas of misconception in
laser theory. A second and complementary thrust of this project is the
development of teaching strategies and interventions to be used in introductory
laser theory courses to improve student learning. The course materials and study
results are being disseminated through conference presentations and journal
publications. The study is being conducted with particular attention to
producing an instrument that is valid for diverse students and institutions.
