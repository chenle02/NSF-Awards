The Physics Department will purchase 8 IBM PC's, 3 AT's, analog and digital
input and output boards, and the hardware for a network. The computers will
provide the facilities for data collection and analysis in introductory and
advanced laboratories. They will provide students a way of obtaining larger
quantities of data than can conveniently be obtained by hand, and they can
collect data on rapidly changing phenomena. In addition, the computers will
allow improved data analysis and graphical presentation.
