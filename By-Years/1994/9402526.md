OCE-9402526 GILLIGAN This is a collaborative proposal between Savannah State
College and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution to provide minority
undergraduates with a summer program that is a transitional academic experience
from a supportive HMCU instructional setting to a marine laboratory environment.
The students will spend five weeks at Savannah State where the students will
participate in research- related training sessions. The final four weeks will be
spent at Harbor Branch where the students will be introduced to up-to-date-
technology and work on a research project. This project is seen to be a "bridge
to research" program to interest and involve minority students in marine science
at an early state of their college career and guide these students into other
NSF supported undergraduate research programs.
