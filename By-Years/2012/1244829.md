The National Research Council (NRC) Board on Science Education, in collaboration
with the Board on Higher Education and Workforce, the Teacher Advisory Council,
and the National Academy of Engineering, requests support for a study to
understand the barriers to completion of two- and four-year STEM degrees and
opportunities for overcoming these barriers. The study will explore the role of
motivation, interest and attitude in shaping undergraduates' trajectories in
STEM, especially in the transition from two-year to four-year institutions. It
will give special attention to factors beyond the quality of instruction that
influence diverse students' decisions to stay in or leave STEM majors' such as
grading policies, course sequences, undergraduate learning and living
environments, students' general self-efficacy and self-efficacy in science, high
school preparation, family background, career and life aspirations, and
knowledge of STEM careers. The study will build on related NRC work, including
the recent summit on community colleges in the evolving STEM education
landscape, the study of Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation:
America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads and the ongoing study
of Discipline-Based Education Research.
