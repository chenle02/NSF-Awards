Society is increasingly reliant on software, but deployed software contains
security vulnerabilities and other bugs that can threaten privacy, property and
even human lives. When a security vulnerability or critical error is discovered,
a software patch is issued to attempt to fix the problem, but patches themselves
can be incorrect, inadequate, and break necessarily functionality. This project
investigates the full workflow for the developer to rapidly diagnose the root
cause of the vulnerability or error, for the developer to test that a
prospective patch indeed completely removes the defect, and for users to check
the issued patch on their own configurations and workloads before adopting the
patch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the use of mutable replay to
help reproduce, diagnose, and fix software bugs. A low-overhead recorder records
the execution of software in case a failure or exploit occurs, allowing the
developer to replay the recorded log to reproduce the problem. Mutable replay
allows logs recorded with the buggy version to be replayed after the modest code
changes typical of critical patches to show that patches work correctly to
resolve detected problems. This project leverages semantic information readily
available to the developer to conduct well-understood static and dynamic
analyses to correctly transform the recorded log to enable mutable replay. The
results of this research will benefit society and individuals by simplifying and
hastening both generation and validation of patches, ultimately making software
more reliable and secure.
