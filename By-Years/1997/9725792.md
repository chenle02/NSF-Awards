9725792 Silver This study will investigate how the distribution of strain rates
across the Papua New Guinea (PNG) convergent margin evolves from oceanic
subduction at the New Britain trench to the broader continental collision.
Because the overall rates of motion are high, a geodetic network in PNG can be
used to determine the extent to which deformation is distributed rather than
focused on discrete faults and the degree to which the primary basal decollement
is locked. Working together with scientists from Australia and PNG, the P.I.s
will measure an expanded GPS network (48 sites) across the Huon Peninsula and
Finisterre Range and across the Markham valley to the New Guinea Highlands, an
area of approximately 350 x 350 km. They will occupy the expanded network during
June, 1998, and again in June, 2000. Purchasing an additional instrument, an
Ashtech Z-12, to leave in PNG between campaigns, will give scientists at UNITECH
the opportunity to remeasure baselines between campaigns, an effort of great
value for the study of interseismic and intraseismic slip. ***
