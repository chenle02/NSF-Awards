Barbara A. Imperiali, Department of Chemistry, MIT, Karen Allen, Department of
Physiology and Biophysics, Boston University School of Medicine and Harald
Schwalbe, Department of Chemistry, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Germany, are
supported with an award from the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program
with funds provided by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biology and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The team will
carry out research aimed at producing a novel and generally applicable chemical
tool for structural and functional proteomics. Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs),
comprised of short peptide sequences (fewer than 25 amino acids) that are
optimized to bind trivalent lanthanide ions, can be incorporated into a protein
for applications in luminescence spectroscopy, NMR and X-ray analysis that rely
upon the unique photophysical properties of the bound complex. These will
supersede the capacity of a variety of existing tools in a single entity. LBT
sequences will be evolved in the Imperiali lab at MIT through state-of-the-art
strategies that include both combinatorial synthesis and directed design stating
from simple protein scaffolds. These sequences will be integrated into target
proteins and tested by a multidisciplinary, collaborative effort by experts in
nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography, fluorescence spectroscopy and
cell biology.

The lanthanide binding tag strategy provides a single tool, a chemical tag, that
encompasses the breadth of applications, including nuclear magnetic resonance,
X-ray crystallography, and fluorescence spectroscopy and cell biology, needed to
conquer the proteome challenge. The goal of the program is to provide the LBT
technology in a form that can be readily implemented by a diverse set of end
users in the chemical, biological and biomedical communities. Additionally,
postdoctoral research scientists, graduate students and undergraduates will be
involved in multidisciplinary, multi-institution research that includes an
international collaboration at the forefront of proteomics research.
