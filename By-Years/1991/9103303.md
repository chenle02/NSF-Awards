This award supports the research of Professor L. Walling to work in automorphic
functions. She intends to study the Fourier coefficients of theta series
attached to lattices arising from quadratic forms. She also intends to study the
analogous situation over function fields. Modular forms arose out of Non-
Euclidean geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians
and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental
importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is principally
concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and
analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems in
areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in
information theory.
