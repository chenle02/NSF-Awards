This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Stephen P. Cramer in the Department of Chemistry
and Uwe Bergmann, Assistant Research Scientist in the Department of Applied
Sciences, at the University of California at Davis to develop x-ray resonance
Raman spectroscopy (XRRS) as a tool to probe low-energy excitations. The low
energy transitions will involve charge transfer and d-d bands as well as
molecular vibrations involving metal ions in protein systems. In nickel enzymes,
with either Fe or Ni, metal 3d to ligand (CO) pi* transitions are obscured by
sulfur to iron excitations in Fe-S clusters. In photosystem-II, Mn d-d bands can
only be seen over a narrow spectroscopic window above the chlorophyl cutoff and
below water near infrared bands. The development of XRRS as applied to protein
systems will enable the observation of metal-centered transitions that are
obscured by other chromophores, which could help to characterize some of the
poorly understood, but important, intermediates in Fe-Ni dehydrogenase, carbon
monoxide dehydrogenase, photosystem-II and other important Mn and Ni enzymes
that are essential to understanding fundamental biological processes.

A new x-ray spectroscopic technique will be developed to probe active sites in
important protein centers.
