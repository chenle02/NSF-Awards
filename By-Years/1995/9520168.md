Abstract - Barkey - SGER There are a number of technological applications of
intrinsically conductive polymers. The unique advantages of electrochemical
fabrication of intrinsically conductive polymers include the ability to
reproduce surface structure with high fidelity. Electrochemically fabricated
conductive-polymer microfilaments will be evaluated for potential application as
sensors. The principle of the application is the dependence of polymer
conductivity on oxidation state and the doping effect of absorbed compounds. The
evaluation will focus on the differential response of polymer conductivity to
complete and incomplete combustion gases, where the latter act as reducing
agents which should lower the conductivity of the filaments. Filaments of poly
(3-methyl thiophene) of diameters less than 100 nanometers have been fabricated
by the PI by electrooxidative polymerization across a highly ordered poly(tetra
fluoroethylene) thin-layer. The polymer grows in the form of filaments which
follow the microstructure of the PTFE layer, producing a regular array or
grating. The small size of the filaments allows very rapid diffusive response of
the material. This exploratory project will determine if the principle of
operation can be applied to detection of incomplete combustion products in flue
gases, and lay a foundation for further development and application of this new
structure.
