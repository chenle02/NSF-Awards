The proposed research is an extension of a SBIR Phase I research. In that work,
the feasibility was shown of methods for characterizing electromyographic (EMG)
noise by a set of lattice reflection coefficients, and for canceling EMB noise
by utilizing a gradient adaptive lattice (GAL) algorithm. The thrust of the
research is to extend these methods to: (1) develop a recursive least squares
(LS) lattice adaptive joint process estimator; (2) characterize non-stationary
maternal EMG noise from recorded fetal ECG data; (3) develop a real time
implementation of the lattice LS estimator based on AT&T's DSP-32 IC chip; and
(4) extend the development of this recursive LS lattice J-P estimator to provide
a purely-order update algorithm to obtain long term stability.
