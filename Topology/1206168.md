This proposal is to fund the Undergraduate Knot Theory Conference 2012 to bring
together undergraduates and undergraduate faculty interested in knot theory, to
be held at Denison University from July 15-18, 2012. Knot theory is a field very
amenable to research by undergraduates. There are a variety of REU programs with
a knot theory component. Moreover, there are many faculty members who would like
to involve their students in undergraduate research in knot theory. This
conference will bring together experts in knot theory with undergraduates who
are either currently participating in knot theory REUs, undergraduates who have
participated in knot theory research, current graduate students who participated
as undergraduates in knot theory research, and perhaps most importantly, faculty
who either have involved undergraduates in knot theory research or who would
like to involve undergraduates.

As a centerpiece, we will have a collective problem session to give participants
numerous ideas for future research directions. This conference will provide an
opportunity for students to experience a mathematics research conference that is
specifically designed and directed toward them. Moreover, the conference will
establish a supportive network of students and faculty with an interest in knot
theory research, thus furthering the involvement of students in the field of
mathematics. The conference URL is www.denison.edu/unknot.
