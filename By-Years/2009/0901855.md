Objective: the objective of this effort is to study and demonstrate adiabatic
bandgap shift in type-II quantum wells, and use this process to cool a heat load
to below 10 degrees Kelvin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
proposed research provides an excellent testbed to study many important
adiabatic and diabatic quantum processes such as Quantum Refrigeration, Quantum
Heat Pumps, and Quantum Amplifiers. It also helps advancing research
in&lt;br/&gt;many related devices, such as quantum sensors and computers. Using
type-II quantum wells, this research advances the deep physics involved in Type-
II heterojunctions, including their non-linear electrooptic effects, carrier
lifetime, and built-in electric field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
Small, non-mechanical cryogenic coolers resulted from this program can
revolutionize the way we live, since they lead to practical access to our most
sensitive optical sensor (superconductor single photon detector), magnetic
sensors (SQUID), the most accurate voltage standard (Josephson Junction) and
time standards (Superconductor Oscillators) to name a few. Simulation tools that
will be developed in this research effort will become publicly available and
shared with the scientific community through World Wide Web. Also, some of the
results of this research will be incorporated in a solid-state course and an
advanced course on modulators. Undergraduate and graduate students from under-
represented and minority groups will be encouraged to take part in this research
through Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professorate program at
Northwestern University. We will also collaborate with a major company to
validate the results, solicit feedback, and produce a commercialization path.
