Palm Beach Community College requests support from NSF to connect the main
campus and three remote campuses to the Internet. The College serves the greater
Palm Beach County, Florida. It has approximately 50,000 students enrolled in a
wide range of academic programs which lead to associate degrees or to a transfer
to a four year institution. The college will connect to the Internet through a
local Internet service provider to be selected competitively. The campus needs
the Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout
the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty,
staff students of this institution as well as the community in general. The
award provides partial support of the project for two years.
