Envirostabilized References for Applications in SoC Compatible&lt;br/&gt;Process
es&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Voltage References are
critical components in many integrated circuits. Unfortunately, the best
existing voltage references do not have the thermal stability needed for a wide
range of commercial and military applications and the limitations of existing
voltage references will be of even more concern in a host of emerging electronic
systems. This initiative focuses on an entirely new approach to designing
voltage references that uses a new environmental stabilization technique that
can be applied in standard processes used in the manufacture of integrated
circuits. Central to this work is the investigation of the concept of using a
local on-chip heater to measure relative thermal characteristics of an
uncalibrated voltage reference and of using information obtained from these
measurements to significantly improve the performance of the reference. Although
the concept of using an on-chip heater would be of major concern in most
integrated circuits because of the increased power dissipation requirements, it
is of essentially no concern in the proposed approach since the total power
dissipation when the local heater is on is very small and because the total time
the heater will be on throughout the life of the integrated circuit will
typically be much less than 1 sec. The concept of using a local on-chip heater
for thermal stabilization of key properties of integrated circuits should have
applications well beyond voltage references and offer potential for providing a
much broader impact in the semiconductor field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
