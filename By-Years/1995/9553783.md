The CESME Demonstration Project will demonstrate a portion of our original
Hawaii Collaborative for Excellence in Science and Mathematics (CESME) proposal
submitted in June 1995 to the NSF CETP program. We propose to develop, test, and
evaluate a small-scale model for effective collaborative reform of science and
mathematics preparation for pre-service elementary teachers in the University of
Hawaii system. The Project brings together scientists and mathematicians from
the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and Kapiolani Community College (also
within the University of Hawaii system), science and mathematics educators from
the College of Education at UHM, and specialists and inservice teachers from the
Hawaii Department of Education. The Project aims to restructure four existing
courses to reflect reforms in science and mathematics content, teaching, and
assessment standards; to better integrate science and mathematics in these
courses; and to better articulate these content and education courses. Hawaii
has both a statewide higher and a lower public education system that makes the
proposed Project collaborations possible.
