9633531 Lowell Title: Numerical modeling of two-phase seawater flow in oceanic
hydrothermal systems using parallel computers Hydrothermal circulation within
the ocean crust controls both heat and mass transfer between the crust and the
ocean at mid-ocean ridges. We can not view this process in action because of its
inaccessibility but computer simulations can help us understand the reactions
that occur. These reactions are complex because they involve the boiling of
seawater under high pressure, which can be an unstable process. The PI has
developed a computer program that simulates the circulation of fresh water
through a hydrothermal system on land and has applied it to Lassen Peak. New
measurements of the temperature and pressure of boiling of seawater, and the
formation of salt-free vapor and salt-laden brine will be incorporated into this
computer model to determine the effect of circulating seawater in a sub-seafloor
hydrothermal system.
