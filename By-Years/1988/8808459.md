This award is an Accomplishment Based Renewal. Previous research by the
principal investigator has established the conditions under which cooperation
can get started and maintain itself in simple environments. The environments
previously examined include the two-person Prisoner's Dilemma, and an n-person
norms game. In the last five years, this work has seen numerous applications to
international political economy, antitrust law, government regulation, economic
theory, artificial intelligence, and other fields. The current research
investigates how collective properties (such as cooperation or conflict) emerge
from the actions of individuals who adapt to each other within a complex
population structure. The method is to develop a series of parallel adaptive
models of whole populations. The models will be parallel in that all the
individuals will be active at one time. The models will be adaptive in that the
individuals will adjust their behavior, in light of their own goals, to the
effects that they are experiencing from others. Rather than assume that the
adjustment process is based upon rational calculation, the investigator will
assume it is based upon learning from experience or differential survival of
relatively successful strategies. This research is important for the social
sciences because standard theoretical and mathematical approaches have
traditionally assumed that only one or two things are happening at a time. In
politics and society a great many events occur at once. Im particular, many
people make interdependent choices that influence each other's environments.
Thus an understanding of parallel adaptive models has the potential to enhance
our insight into a wide variety of political processes such as: political
leadership, public participation, domestic influences on foreign policy, regime
formation in international political economy, and alliance politics in
international security affairs. While this project may not provide definitive
treatments of any one of these areas, it promises to promote the appreciation of
certain features that are common to all of them.
