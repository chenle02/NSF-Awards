This Small Grant for Exploratory Research to Oglala Lakota College will support
preliminary work on a "cohort model" to provide a common experience for pre-
engineering students at the tribally controlled college in South Dakota on the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The students will move through a series of
courses together, including introductory mathematics, chemistry and physics.
Most importantly, the students will also work together on application based
engineering research projects that will introduce the students to the field of
engineering and demonstrate the application and relevancy of engineering to the
needs of their community. As the students progress they also will be exposed to
the mainstream university and plan their transition to the four year engineering
program there. Native American students who have already successfully
transferred to the four year engineering school will advise and guide them.
Faculty from the four year institution will also serve as mentors to the
students so they learn more about the students and their background well before
the students enroll in the four year institution.
