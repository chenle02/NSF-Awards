Attine ants (tribe Attini) are unique among ants in growing a symbiotic fungus
for food. The ecology of many species of attines has been studied extensively
due to their economic and ecological importance. Fundamental evolutionary
questions, however, have remained unanswered due to poor understanding of the
phylogenetic relationships of the ants and of their fungi. A study to establish
the phylogeny of attines and of their fungi using molecular genetics in order
to: 1) infer the origins of this obligate ant/fungi and the habits of the most
closely related non-attine ants and fungi, and 2) determine whether the attine
fungi have speciated in parallel with the ants will be conducted. In such a
case, the cladograms of the attine ants and their fungi should be exactly
congruent. This pattern would suggest that the different lines of attine ants
have coevolved with their fungi in close mutual dependency. Alternatively,
disparities between the two cladograms may suggest that some attine lines have
acquired new unrelated species of fungus to cultivate. The nature of the
disparities should provide insight into the coevolutionary interactions between
the ants and their fungi.
