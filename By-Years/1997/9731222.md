9731222 Liu The proposed research project represents a joint effort by U.S. and
Chinese researchers to establish the tsunami modeling and mitigation capablility
in China. A numerical model developed by the U.S. investigator will be used to
investigate the impact of tele-tsunamis generated in the Pacific seismic rim on
the China coast. The effects of the continental shelf and the offshore island
chain will be examined. By so doing, a database for bathymetry and topography
along the China coast will also be established and will be available to the
international research community. The second task of the poposed reseach project
is to study the 1992 Hainan island tsunami. Since there are five tidal gage
records available for the event, it is an ideal situation to test the
hydrodynamic inverse algorithm for determining the seismic parameters in the
source region. The P.I. of the proposed research project is Professor Phillip
L.F. Liu, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. A
half-time graduate student will assist on the project. The Chinese investigators
are Mr. Yu Fujiang and Ms. Ye Lin of the National Marine Environmental Forecast
Center of China. The duration of the research is 24 months.
