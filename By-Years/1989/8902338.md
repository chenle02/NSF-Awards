Recent evidence has implicated a role for the phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation of specific MTOC components in regulating the functional
activity of the mitotic apparatus. The purpose of this proposal is to define the
functional properties of the centrosome and kinetochore with respect to the
nucleation and capture of microtubules respectively, to determine the role of
phosphorylation of centrosomal or kinetochore components in modulating their
functional properties, and to identify kinase and/or phosphatase
dephosphorylation of the mitotic microtubule organizing centers. We will
initially characterize the microtubule nucleation capacity of the centrosome in
lysed cell models, and compare this activity with isolated centrosomes.
Functional properties of kinetochores will be determined using isolated mitotic
chromosomes. The phosphorylation state of the MTOCs will be analyzed by 32P
incorporation and also the phosphate specific antibodies. The affect of
dephosphorylation on the defined functional properties will be determined
following in vitro dephosphorylation. The functional assays will then be
utilized to screen fractions of mitotic cell lysates for appropriate enzymatic
activities. Defining the role of phosphorylation in MTOC function is a key facet
of a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the regulation of cell
division in general and the function of the mitotic apparatus specifically.
