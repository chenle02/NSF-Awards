Dr. Mark R. Goodale, of George Mason Univesity, will undertake short-term rapid
response research on events surrounding the constitutional referendum in
Bolivia, currently scheduled for January 2009. In August 2008, a recall vote set
in motion a vote on a radical new national constitution. The researcher has
developed an innovative hypothesis that the broader social conflict in Bolivia
has its roots in a clash over two competing theories of the person, one dervied
from the discourse of international human rights and the other asserts a notion
of the person and society in which essential difference is seen as fundamental
and is made the basis for state and social institutions.

In order to test this hypothesis, the researcher will (1) conduct ethnographic
interviews with those actively involved in the election; (2) perform
observational analysis on the constitutional process before, during, and after
the vote itself; and (3) perform a content analysis of various print and media
sources in order to understand how public opinion is being influenced during
this period of rapid social change in Bolivia.

This brief project lays the groundwork for improving social scientific
understanding of both social and political conflict in the post-Cold War period
and the role that competing theories of the person play in these conflicts. The
PI will forge institutional linkages with universities and NGOs in Bolivia that
are working on the peaceful resolution of the social conflict. The project also
supports the education of a graduate student from an underrepresented group who
will assist the researcher in the field.
