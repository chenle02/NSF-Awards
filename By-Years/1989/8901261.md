Most of the techniques used in solving engineering problems such as system
identification are valid for linear systems. However, in certain engineering
applications on nonlinear systems one must consider nonlinear effects. In
addition input loading on some systems such as soil or building, offshore
platforms etc., can be viewed as random and are usually difficult to predict or
characterize by traditional means. This project is to develop a general system
identification approach to characterize and analyze nonlinear systems with
unknown and unmeasured random input. The proposed studies will extend and verify
the effectiveness of the random decrement technique to cover the non-stationary
cases. Such applications make it possible to use this procedure to analyze
nonlinear system problems. In addition the nonlinear form of the system and
system signature will be identified from the measured system responses without
knowing the random input. The effectiveness of this general approach will be
investigated by laboratory simulation. The new technique developed would improve
our ability to investigate and predict the seismic response of soil and building
taking into account the nonlinear effect of the soil-building system.
