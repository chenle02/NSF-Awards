An automated X-ray diffractometer will be used to improve the curriculum of the
Geology Department at Vassar College. The X-ray equipment will be used to
upgrade courses in Mineralogy, Optical &amp; X-ray Mineralogy, Igneous &amp;
Metamorphic Petrology, and Structural Geology. In addition it will be used for
Senior Thesis research projects and for summer research as part of the Vassar
College Undergraduate Research Summer Institute (URSI). The X-ray diffractometer
will be used for identification of unknown minerals in mineralogy, and for
careful investigation of structural and compositional variations of minerals in
Optical and X-ray Mineralogy. It will be used for phase identification of fine
grained metamorphic rock in Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology, and for studying
fabric development in Structural Geology. The college will match the award with
an equal amount of funds.
