Professor Sidney Benson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform thermochemical and kinetic studies of
important radical reactions. Professor Benson will continue his studies of
reaction kinetics using the Very Low Pressure Reactor (VLPR) which he has
developed. Two specific areas of research will be pursued: 1) kinetics of
reactions of alkyl radicals with oxygen in an effort to distinguish the addition
mechanism from the methathesis mechanism, and to identify both if they are
competitive; and 2) kinetics of atom-radical reactions between chlorine and
hydrogen atoms and species such as alkanes, alkenes and chloro- and fluoro-
alkanes and alkenes. %%% A more complete understanding of gas phase chemical
reactions is essential in order to improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon
combustion, and to mediate the environmental impact of various combustion
byproducts in the atmosphere. Professor Benson's research has led to an
understanding of the phenomenon of hot ignition, and the factors which
contribute to engine knocking. Using a specialized instrument known as a Very
Low Pressure Reactor, Professor Benson is able to study the underlying free
radical mechanisms for these processes in a controlled laboratory environment.
