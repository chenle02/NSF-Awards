This award provides partial support to help defray the expenses of participants
in the 2020 East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), which will be held on
the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville, Virginia, October 17-18,
2020. The symposium expects to host between 40-60 participants, including many
graduate students and postdocs. This will be the eighteenth annual meeting in
the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference focuses on operator algebras (C* and von Neumann algebras) and non-
commutative geometry. This year we are particularly focusing on connections to
quantum information theory, quantum algebra, conformal field theory, unitary
representation theory, deformation/rigidity theory, and C*-classification. The
ECOAS enables participants to become acquainted with the modern developments in
operator algebras, non-commutative geometry, and neighboring disciplines. A
major goal is to highlight the work of early-career researchers and facilitate
them networking with other junior as well as senior researchers. More

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
