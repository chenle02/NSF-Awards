Mathematical Sciences (21) This project develops software material for teaching
mathematical statistics to advanced undergraduate students in science,
mathematics, and engineering. The project is a collaborative effort of educators
and researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Davis, the Naval
Postgraduate School, and Lucent Technologies.

The software integrates case studies based on real-life problems from diverse
fields with multimedia demonstrations of statistical concepts that use
visualization, animation, and simulation to create a unique interactive learning
environment. The philosophy behind the project is well represented by Moore's
statement, "The case for substantive change in statistical instruction is built
on strong synergies between content, pedagogy, and technology," (ISR, 1997). The
case studies from Stat Labs: Mathematical Statistics through Applications (Nolan
& Speed, 2000) provides a model and example content for integrating cases into
the software. A distinguishing feature of this interactive environment is the
use of professional statistical software, R, as a plug-in to the browser for
running demonstrations. Some implications of this feature are that: extensive
Java programming of plotting and numerical routines are avoided, the content
(cases) and demos can be integrated into one cohesive document, more attention
can be paid to the pedagogical aspects of the software. Further the project
provides an electronic framework that is easily extensible and adaptable to
different contents, therefore making it easier for instructors to incorporate
the material into their teaching and to adapt the material to special audiences.
