9404552 Castner Technical abstract: This Small Grants for Exploratory Research
project is devoted to the development of a helical resonator (HR) electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectrometer. The key component of the spectrometer is the high
Q (quality factor) HR coil, which employs superconducting wire. In contrast to
existing, single- frequency ESR spectrometers, the HR-based spectrometer will
have a coil that resonates at several frequencies. The successful development of
such a spectrometer would have a number of immediate scientific applications,
but in the longer run might also lead to easily transportable commercial
spectrometers with applications to a range of fields encompassing physics,
chemistry, geology and biology. Non-technical abstract: Same ***
