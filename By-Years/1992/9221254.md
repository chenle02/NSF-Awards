This dissertation research focusses on an important evolutionary problem - how
closely related populations of recently diversified species begin to diverge in
their niche utilization patterns. The primary question is, when such groups live
in the same area, do competitive forces drive them to begin to utilize different
resources, or are they able to continue to subsist on the same sorts of regimens
as other populations of their species, living separately. Alternatively, are
such groups driven to live in the same area because of competition of each with
other members of their species living in other areas. The principal investigator
is very experienced and well regarded in the field, and has the necessary
contacts in northeast Zaire to carry out the work over the course of a year.
Besides the evolutionary questions, this is the first long term study of
primates in such a species rich area of Africa, and should be relevant to
conservation interests.
