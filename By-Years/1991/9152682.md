The primary objective of the proposed project is to enhance the laboratory
experience of undergraduate engineering students, especially mechanical
engineering students, studying fluid mechanics and general laboratory
instrumentation by introducing them to a state-of-the-art subsonic wind tunnel
with ancillary pressure, flow and force transducers. A second objective is to
acquaint non-science majors with fundamental principles of fluid mechanics via
experimentation as a component of two newly developed introductory courses. In
addition, the strong appeal of model aircraft aerodynamic testing will be
exploited to attract local minority junior and senior high school students to
engineering via a special minority engineering program.
