This project will mainly investigate arrangements of curves and surfaces.
Specifically, it will study Combinatorial and algorithmic problems related to
substructures (lower envelopes, single cells, zones, levels, vertical
decompositions, etc.) in arrangements of surfaces in higher dimensions. Related
algorithms in real algebraic geometry for computing connected components,
stratifications and the dimension of real semi-algebraic sets. Applications of
these results to motion planning in robotics, to various visibility and
intersection problems in computer graphics, to generalized Voronoi diagrams in
higher dimensions, and to many geometric problems at large. Combinatorial and
algorithmic problems involving planar arrangements of segments or curves (also
known as geometric graphs.)
