In this project, the PI will collaborate with PI's from two other institutions
to measure Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), F-11 and F-12, from water samples
collected on three separate legs of a hydrographic cruise along 32|S in the
Pacific from Chile to Australia as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP) (referred to as WOCE line P-6).
This particular project will focus specifically on the western portion between
New Zealand and Australia. Subsequently, similar data will be collected on a
meridional line along 177|W (P-14C), on a cruise immediately following P-6. Data
will be used to examine ventilation and circulation of water masses found in the
western basin of the South Pacific Ocean.
