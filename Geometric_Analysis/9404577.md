9404577 Sparling The research covers topics relating the geometry of the
solution spaces of classes of partial differential equations and that of an
associated complex manifold. Integral geometric techniques can be combined to
study Radon-like transformations which may have potential applications to
CATSCAN and magnetic resonance imaging. Problems relating to solitons and
integrable systems will also be pursued. ***
