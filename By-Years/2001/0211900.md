Professor Neal Armstrong of the University of Arizona is funded by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to prepare and characterize ordered
thin films of organic materials for electronic applications. Interface-induced
disorder in layers lowers carrier mobility and therefore could limit organic
materials' use in molecular electronics. The PI proposes to modify
phthalocyanine-based discotic materials to facilitate polymerization and
alignment by self-organization. Two surface modifications will be used to enable
the alignment: chemically modified substrates and capillary channels. The
materials will be characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), including
conductive tip AFM, and photoemission spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
technologically relevant class of organic materials has potential uses in
electronic devices such as field effect transistors and photovoltaics. Molecular
electronics for miniaturization is one of the goals of nanotechnology.
