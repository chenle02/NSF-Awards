This is an award to support research to determine the stability of viral nucleic
acids homologous to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) under differing
environmental conditions as encountered in primary, secondary and final
effluents from domestic wastewater treatment plants, tap water and other aqueous
fluids using the polymerase chain reaction method for detection of viral
ribonucleic acid in samples being examined. The investigators plan on
determining the duration of the persistence of this nucleic acid after the virus
has lost its ability to infect cell cultures. This proposal was submitted to NSF
under conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER). Results of prior studies reporting the presence of nucleic acids
"homologous" to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater
concentrates suggest the importance of determining whether these nucleic acids
are degraded after the ability of this virus to infect cell cultures has been
lost. This, in turn, would assist in assessing the potential of infectious viral
transmission through environmental media.
