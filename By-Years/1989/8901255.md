The principal investigator will continue his study of path properties of
Brownian motion, and he will apply his knowledge and techniques to several
areas: fractal models related to Brownian motion, harmonic measure on
3-dimensional Brownian paths, non-intersection problems, to name only a few. To
elaborate on the first topic, Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal" to describe
mathematical models of nonsmooth real world phenomena. One family of fractal
which he considered was derived from Brownian motion paths. The theory of
fractals is still in its early stages and one of the most important research
tasks in this area is to study the most elementary properties of fractal models
in order to learn if and to which extent such models are realistic. In
particular the Hausdorff dimensions of several fractals will be estimated.
Moreover, computer simulations will be performed to find the Hausdorff
dimensions of several fractal sets.
