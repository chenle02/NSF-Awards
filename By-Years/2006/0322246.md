A Program to Award Dissertation Fellowships in Hazards, Risk and Disasters

This program will fund up to ten merit based fellowship grants to PhD candidates
performing dissertation research in any academic field relevant to natural,
technological and human-made hazards, risks and disasters. Relevant academic
fields include, but are not limited to, the natural, physical, social or
behavioral sciences, engineering specialty programs, and interdisciplinary
programs such as environmental studies. By fostering the development of scholars
who have a career-long commitment to research in the hazard, disaster and risk
management fields, these fellowship grants will increase the nation's future
research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to knowledge and practice in
these fields.

A partnership of the Public Entity Risk Institute - a nonprofit grant-making
organization that seeks to improve the practice of risk management in public
entities, small nonprofits and small businesses - and the Natural Hazards
Research and Applications Center - a national and international clearinghouse
for information on natural hazards and the human adjustment to them - will
establish and test the pilot program for two years.
