This award partially supports a study by the Board of Mathematical Sciences of
the National Research Council to: (1) identify and describe areas where the
mathematical sciences have significantly aided materials research; (2) identify
areas of the mathematical sciences in which increased research would accelerate
progress in materials sciences; (3) identify obstacles, if any, to increased
collaborative research; and (4) make recommendations for facilitating
collaborative work, including recommendations on how to attract students and
young investigators to this area. Particular attention will be paid to the areas
of materials synthesis and processing. An interdisciplinary committee of the
Board of Mathematical Sciences will perform the study. In addition to National
Science Foundation support, this project will be supported by the Air Force
Office of Scientific Research and the Army Research Office.
