Once every four years the International Commission on Cloud Physics which is a
commission of the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric
Physics organizes two international conferences: one on Cloud Physics and the
other on Atmospheric Aerosol and Nucleation. Such international conferences are
essential to promote the exchange of ideas in the international scientific
community. Funds will be provided for travel support in order to ensure
participation of a strong contingent of United States scientists at these two
meetings. Selection of recipients of travel support will be made upon the
recommendation of a panel of experts consisting of two members of the American
Meteorological Society Committee on Cloud Physics, Chairman of the International
Organization Committee for the 10th Cloud Physics Conference and the Co-Chairman
of the International Organizing Committee for the 12th International Conference
on Atmospheric Aerosol and Nucleation.
