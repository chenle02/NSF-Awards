The Noyce STEM Teacher Education in the Arkansas Delta (N-STEAD) project is a
Phase I effort to recruit and prepare a minimum of nineteen science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors to teach in high-needs secondary
schools (grades 7-12) in the Arkansas Delta region. An internship component
focuses on providing first- and second-year STEM majors the opportunity to teach
within an informal STEM context. Students gain an early experience in science
education through planning lessons, presenting science to children, and
assessing the outcomes through participation in a science outreach program known
locally as "Ridin' Dirty with Science," a cooperative venture between Hendrix
College and the Boys and Girls Club of Faulkner County. For juniors and seniors
a scholarship component supports STEM majors who are pursuing the completion of
licensure requirements for secondary life/earth science, physical/earth science,
or mathematics certification. Scholarship recipients participate in an education
apprenticeship in a high-needs area, complete eight of their twelve-week student
teaching experience in a cooperating Delta region school district, and then
teach two years in a high-needs school in the region. A two-year induction
program is also a part of their initial teaching experience upon graduation and
provides on-site assessments and offers tailored assistance in content,
pedagogy, and Delta culture from Hendrix College STEM and Education faculty, and
Delta-based master teachers. Membership in either NSTA or NCTM is also provided
for these novice teachers to support their enculturation into the profession.
