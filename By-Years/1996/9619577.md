This project will bring eight highly motivated and capable undergraduate
students from among the region and the nation to the Williamsburg campus of the
College of William and Mary during each of the next three summers. The students
will spend eight weeks experiencing mathematical research first hand, with close
faculty guidance. Faculty advisors will come from William and Mary's mathematics
department, widely known for its research in matrix and operator theory.
Students will work with faculty mentors, either individually or in small groups,
on research projects in matrix theory and its applications that have been chosen
by the faculty for their accessibility and appropriateness for well-prepared
undergraduates. During the program, seminars on mathematics topics and field
trips to nearby installations that employ mathematicians will be provided for
the students. Informal discussion and interchange of ideas among students will
be strongly encouraged. Each student or group will make several oral
presentations and will prepare a final written report. In the past, such reports
have been the basis for scholarly publications co-authored by the students and
their faculty mentors.
