&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to explore the applicability of classical
3-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;topology techniques in the study of the ``finite type"
invariants of &lt;br/&gt;knots and 3-manifolds. She would like to investigate
the relation&lt;br/&gt;between intrinsic invariants (e.g. knot genus, satellite
structures) &lt;br/&gt;of knots that cannot be distinguished by their finite
type invariants.&lt;br/&gt;For this she proposes to use the general machinery
that has been developed&lt;br/&gt;over the years to understand how the topology
of 3-manifolds changes under &lt;br/&gt;surgery. The resulting work will shed
some light on how the finite type &lt;br/&gt;knot invariants relate to the
topology of the knot complement and could&lt;br/&gt;lead to progress on the open
question of whether these invariants&lt;br/&gt;distinguish all knots. She would
also like to search for relations between &lt;br/&gt;the Jones polynomial of
knots and the fundamental group of the 3-manifolds&lt;br/&gt;obtained by Dehn
surgery on knots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of the project lies in the
area of 3-dimensional topology the&lt;br/&gt;central objects of study of which
are spaces called 3-manifolds. A&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold is an object that locally
looks like the ordinary 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space but whose global structure
can be complicated. A main goal of&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional topology is to
understand these structures and achieve a&lt;br/&gt;classification of
3-manifolds. An important part of 3-dimensional topology&lt;br/&gt;is also the
study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds) and
their classification. One of the ways that topologists have&lt;br/&gt;been
approaching these problems is through the use of ``invariants". In
the&lt;br/&gt;recent years, ideas originated in physics, lead mathematicians to
the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The
central&lt;br/&gt;theme of the PI's project is to understand the properties of
these&lt;br/&gt;invariants, using ideas from traditional 3-dimensional topology
and from&lt;br/&gt;physics, and investigate the extent to which they
distinguish&lt;br/&gt;knots and 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
