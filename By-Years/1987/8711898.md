Optical bistability, as the name implies, involves phenomena which can have two
states which are stable. The common example is a thin semi- conductor which
transmits nearly all of a light beam impinging upon it, or nearly none at all;
depending upon the range of intensity of this impinging light beam. The
transmission switches from low to high at a particular intensity (or small
range). In addition, once switched, it tends to stay high (high transmission)
even though the intensity of the impinent beam is brought below the particular
switching intensity referred to just above. It will subsequently switch to a low
transmission state but with a switching intensity less than that referred to for
the switch from low to high. Obviously these two state devices are fascinating
from both a fundamental viewpoint and from a practical viewpoint (the low is 0
and the high is 1 for a computer). Since they have historical predecessors which
operate totally on electrical principles, they have been analyzed, considered
for computation, and so on. These previous analysis present a pessimistic view
for applications to computation. However, the optical situation is different in
several respects - the nature of the signal, the way the material interacts, and
some of the fundamental chaotic behavior. Because of this there is considerable
controversy and the field of optical bistability continues to generate new and
exciting results and approaches. This conference will bring together experts
worldwide and should prove to be exciting and important for this rapidly
changing field.
