9417577 O'Halla Davenport College requests support from NSF for connection of
its campus to MICHnet. MICHnet is the midlevel network located in the state of
Michigan that will provide operations and network information services. It will
give the Davenport College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the
NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The college needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to
access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able
to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
