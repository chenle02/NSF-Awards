This REU site at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is partially supported by
the Department of Defense through an interagency agreement with the National
Science Foundation. The REU program is part of a larger summer Undergraduate
Research Program (URP) at CSHL, providing an opportunity for students to learn
about bioinformatics and computational biology by conducting intensive research
under the supervision of a mentor. Ten students are accepted to the 10-week NSF
REU summer research program. Students learn about scientific reasoning,
laboratory methods, theoretical principles, and scientific communication. In
addition to research, participants attend seminars, workshops, panel discussions
on careers in science, lectures on ethics, and special events designed
specifically for them. At the URP Symposium held at the end of each summer,
students present a summary of their research to their peers and advisors.
Students also write a final report, similar to a scientific abstract, to
describe his or her project. Students are also encouraged to attend advanced
courses at CSHL to learn the latest experimental techniques in different fields
and to seek advice about their future schooling and research. By the end of the
program, students are well equipped to decide whether scientific research is a
career they would like to pursue. The program is open to all US citizens or
permanent residents, and applications from under-represented minority groups are
encouraged. Further information can be obtained by visiting
