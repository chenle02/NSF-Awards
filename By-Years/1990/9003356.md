The study of algorithms involves two important aspects, correctness and
complexity. This project addresses these two aspects from a machine independent
viewpoint by using formulas of mathematical logic. Logic formulas can provide
descriptions of solutions to problems which can then be analyzed for their
correctness and complexity. Of particular interest is to develop a feasible set
of logical formulas for P, the class of problems which are tractable, i.e.,
whose solutions require only a polynomial number of machine steps, and in
addition, to provide a system for reasoning about the properties of these
logical formulas. Finding a comprehensive description of such a set of formulas
would exhibit a machine independent definition of P and have a significant
impact on our understanding of the algorithms for this important complexity
class. If successful, this system could provide a method by which one could
demonstrate that a given formula is the correct solution to certain problem. As
an alternative to program correctness, this may provide a deeper understanding
of algorithmic correctness.
