Computing - Other (35) These workshops provide models for teaching undergraduate
genomics - the emerging field of computational analysis of DNA sequences. The
key feature is the creation of collaborations between biologist and computer
scientists who link their courses in order to include coordinated material. The
use of workshops over a two-year time span allows for development, feedback and
dissemination of models and educational materials.
