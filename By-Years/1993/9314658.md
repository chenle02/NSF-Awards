9314658 Banerjee The research will explore novel system architectures for the
next-generation optical networks, specifically wave-division- multiplexing
(WDM)-based reconfigurable, scalable, and modular optical networks with
arbitrary and regular structures. The goal is to provide flexible and cost
effective sharing of the aggregate optical communication spectrum, composed of a
plurality of optical fibers, among a large and scalable user population.
Specifically, the investigator will study WDM-based reconfigurable, scalable and
modular optical networks with arbitrary and regular structures. He will also
explore lightwave networks capable of supporting both circuit and packet
switched traffic covering a scalable geographical region with optimized physical
topologies. ***
