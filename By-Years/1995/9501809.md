9501809 Bungay This project is on research to improve and quantify the
performance of a rotating biological contactor (RBC) for the production of
microbial cellulose using the organism Acetobacter xylinium. The objectives of
this research include: (1) the rational design of a RBC process for microbial
cellulose; (2) an integrated program of modeling and experimentation to devise
optimum feed rates and concentrations and spent medium withdrawal rates for a
semi-batch process; and (3) a preliminary economic analysis to compare semi-
batch and continuous operations as a basis for scale up to commercial
operations. ***
