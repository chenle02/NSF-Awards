This award supports two undergraduate researchers working under the supervision
of the principal investigator on problems in two areas of mathematics. In the
first, number theory, the students will consider convergents of continued
fractions reduced by an integer, with special attention paid to cases involving
very small periods. Work will also be done in graph theory. Here the research
will focus on polynomial invariants: distinguishing graphs by Tutte polynomials
and unimodality of Whitney numbers. If the schedule permits, studies of network
reliability will also be conducted.
