Quantum information processing (QIP) uses quantum phenomena such as
superposition, interference, and entanglement to perform information-processing
tasks that are difficult or impossible with classical resources. This research
project studies two important tools in QIP, and their relationship to each
other: quantum walks and weak
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum walks are analogous to
classical random walks. A "walker" at one of the vertices of a graph repeatedly
moves randomly along the edges to neighboring vertices. In the quantum version
the walker simultaneously moves in a superposition along every possible edge,
producing novel interference effects. These effects are strongly influenced by
the global symmetry of the graph, opening up the possibility of new quantum
algorithms. However, in quantum mechanics measuring the location of the walker
disturbs the state of the system and destroys the interference effects. To avoid
this problem we use weak measurements that give less information but also
disturb the state less. Choosing the optimal measurement strength maximizes the
likelihood of finding the system in the desired state while minimizing the
expected hitting time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers address
several important problems involving quantum walks and weak measurements. They
study the effect of symmetry on hitting time for continuous-time quantum walks,
the existence of infinite hitting-time walks, and how these allow a new class of
quantum algorithms. They are developing path-integral techniques for quantum
walks on graphs. They also study how to decompose strong generalized
measurements into a sequence of weak (or continuous) measurements. It is an open
problem, given a family of possible weak measurements, to determine which
generalized measurements can be produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
