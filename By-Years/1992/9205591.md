This research is to conduct geological studies of the two principal fault zones
of Sumatra, Indonesia, in concert with ongoing geodetic studies of the region.
Dating of uplifted coral reefs to document the timing, geographical extent and
uplift of two great historical subduction-zone earthquakes and their prehistoric
predecessors should provide a precise and complete record of great subduction
zone earthquakes in the region. The right-lateral Sumatran fault will be dated
by offset channels of datable pyroclastic deposits from the Sumatran volcanic
arc. The research will address fundamental issues in earthquake mechanics and
neotectonics and provide a firmer basis for seismic hazard evaluation in
Sumatra. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
