A newly instituted undergraduate laboratory integrates molecular biological and
computer technology in a format designed to simulate the research laboratory
setting. All experiments focus on a single eukaryotic gene, the UAR3 gene from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is isolated, amplified, sequenced and expressed
under various conditions. All laboratory exercises are accompanied by computer-
based tutorials, which present fundamental principles of the lab exercises and
then challenge the student to solve hypothetical problems using laboratory
techniques.
