Tools for the Development of Memory-Efficient Sparse Linear
Solvers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in both hardware and algorithm
development have increased&lt;br/&gt;the effect of memory access on the runtime
of large scale linear algebra&lt;br/&gt;applications. The PI proposes to create
tools that will provide the code&lt;br/&gt;developer with information about
memory costs of codes in preparation&lt;br/&gt;as well as with software building
blocks designed to lessen those costs.&lt;br/&gt;First, a framework for memory-
efficient implementation of the sequences of&lt;br/&gt;sparse Basic Linear
Algebra Subprograms that typically constitute a sparse&lt;br/&gt;linear solver
will be provided. Second, a collection of metrics for the&lt;br/&gt;prediction
of memory usage of linear algebra software will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;Working
from those metrics, a tool to automate the prediction process&lt;br/&gt;will be
built. Finally, keeping in mind that the performance of a
code&lt;br/&gt;ultimately depends on how it compiles, a comprehensive study of
compilers&lt;br/&gt;and the performance of the executables they produce will be
carried out.&lt;br/&gt;
