The PIMS Undergraduate Workshop in Supersymmetry will be held at the Pacific
Institute for the Mathematical Sciences at the University of British Columbia,
on May 25-31, 2014. In physics, supersymmetry is a pairing between bosons and
fermions appearing in theories of subatomic particles. One may study
supersymmetry mathematically by using adinkra symbols, which are graphs with
vertices representing the particles in a supersymmetric theory and edges
corresponding to the supersymmetry pairings. The workshop will combine lectures
on the mathematics of supersymmetry, emphasizing graph theory and algebraic
structures, with problem-solving sessions. Sylvester James Gates of the
University of Maryland, recipient of the National Medal of Science, will be the
keynote speaker. The workshop's website is
https://people.uwec.edu/whitchua/supersymmetry/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will have direct impact on undergraduate education, by introducing
students to a thriving area of research outside the standard curriculum.
Students will gain tools to choose and evaluate a graduate program and valuable
skills in using computer algebra systems for mathematical experimentation. The
speakers and problem session leaders will build a community of mathematicians
interested in undergraduate research in supersymmetry; they will use this
experience to enhance the undergraduate research program at their home
institutions. This award defrays travel costs for eleven US-based undergraduate
students participating in the workshop.
