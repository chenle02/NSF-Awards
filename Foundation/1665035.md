The subject of this project is model theory, a branch of mathematical logic
which is about the ways in which mathematical objects or classes of objects are
defined linguistically. Model theory develops various ways of measuring the
complexity of a class of functions or sets, one of which is called Vapnik-
Chervonenkis (or VC) dimension and was independently discovered by researchers
in statistical learning theory in the 1970's. One part of the project is
studying the fine structure of systems with finite VC dimension. A related
measure of the complexity of a class of sets is called stability and another
aspect of the project is using the model-theoretic understanding of stable
systems to compute the equations satisfied by special functions such as the
exponential function. Describing the symmetries of spaces and systems is a
pervasive aspect of the research which ties together its various components.

The project has four interrelated aspects, (i) stability theory and theories
without the independence property, (ii) topological dynamics, model theory, and
pseudo-finite groups, (iii) tame theories of differential fields, (iv) Ax-
Lindemann for semiabelian families and differential Galois theory. At the
abstract level model theory is about the classification of first order theories,
and part (i) is firmly of this nature. The methods and results obtained in
"pure" model theory are often mathematically meaningful in concrete contexts,
leading to new interrelations with other areas of mathematics. In particular in
(iv) the PI will study transcendence properties of "exponential" functions
relative to certain families of commutative algebraic groups, making use of a
certain Galois theory of differential equations which is given by constructions
in stability-theory (part of model theory). The project also connects to and
impacts on topological dynamics, and also potentially and indirectly
combinatorics (via the study of certain measures on definable sets in theories
without independence property).
