With the democratization of cloud computing, increasingly diverse software tasks
demand computation from cloud computing. Scalable datacenter computing is a 21st
century imperative and energy efficiency is the most pervasive challenge.
Increasing capability to extract value from the data deluge requires order-of-
magnitude gains in efficiency. While heterogeneous hardware systems provide
efficiency, they also complicate resource management. Managing new hardware
architectures with economic mechanisms is a qualitatively new approach to
mitigate this complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose
resource allocation mechanisms that encourage truthful participation in
datacenters with heterogeneous hardware. Resource allocation pairs hardware with
software. Users may explicitly request specific amounts and types of hardware.
Or users may define their value for performance, which agents then use to bid
for hardware. Both allocation mechanisms rely on the truthful representation of
preferences from users. The investigators will quantify inefficiencies arising
from strategic behavior in datacenters and will design allocation mechanisms
that are robust when strategic agents participate in the system. Women and
under-represented students will benefit from this research experience.
