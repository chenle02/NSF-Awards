9410428 Hubel This Research Planning Grant was designed to aid in the
preparation of a proposal by the principal investigator to facilitate
preliminary studies in the application of magnetic resonance imaging to measure
the transport of water and cryoprotective agent in a synthetic dermal
replacement. A preliminary assessment of the viability of using localized
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will also be examined to determine the
extent of osmotic damage during the permeation and equilibration processes.
These studies provide the foundation for subsequent experimental and theoretical
studies on transport issues in the dermal replacement as well as other
engineered tissues. ***
