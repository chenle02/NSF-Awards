The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the
technology (robotic hardware and data analytic software) has the potential to be
developed into a new product as a complete, self-contained robotic inspection
tool that carries a RGB-depth camera and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor
with vertical mobility for detecting surface flaws and sub-surface defects. The
use of the tool will allow the inspection of human-built structures to be
performed significantly faster, more thoroughly and at a lower cost by
eliminating the need for scaffolding or blocking traffic. It will also improve
inspection safety and speed which leads to more frequent and on-demand
inspections, thus making the national infrastructure more secure.

This I-Corps project has the following innovations: 1) novel design of robotic
inspection system carrying a RGB-depth camera to detect surface flaws, and a
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor to detect sub-surface defects on both
ground and vertical surfaces that other robots cannot do; 2) a novel method that
enable the robot to scan the surface in an arbitrary trajectory with accurate
positioning and integrate the control with GPR signal processing to identify
areas of delamination and locate subsurface embedment (rebar, pipes, fractures,
voids, delamination, etc.) in concrete structures that will revolutionize the
way GPR data is interpreted and displayed. The value proposition of the robotic
inspection system includes: 1) automating the vision/GPR data collection process
with minimal human intervention; 2) simplifying the robot control to scan the
surface in an arbitrary trajectory; 3) making inspection results easy to
understand by non-professionals; 4) and improving the inspection speed and
accuracy.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
