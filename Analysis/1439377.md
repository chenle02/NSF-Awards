This project addresses several open problems related to approximations of
groups, graphs, and operator algebras by finite structures. The project aims to
advance the technique that is used to prove amenability of the full topological
group of a Cantor minimal system to other classes. The Connes embedding problem
(CEP) concerns a fundamental approximation property of tracial states on von
Neumann algebras. The principal investigator plans to develop an algebraic
approach to CEP that she started in several recent papers. This approach is
based on certain algebraic properties of noncommutative polynomials over unitary
variables. One of the rapidly developing areas in group theory is a study of
approximations of discrete groups by finite groups, in particular, so-called
sofic approximations. Several long-standing conjectures are known to be true for
sofic groups. Among them are CEP for group von Neumann algebras, Gottschalk's
conjecture, the determinant conjecture, and Kaplansky's direct finiteness
conjecture. Moreover, there are currently no known examples of nonsofic groups.
One of the aims of the project is to study properties of sofic approximations
for several classes of groups in the hope of shedding greater light on this
state of affairs.

Groups and operator algebras arise naturally in all areas of mathematics and
also in certain parts of physics and chemistry. In particular, the methods of
group theory lie at the roots of many parts of algebra. The notion of an
"amenable group" was introduced by John von Neumann in 1929, and in recent years
many famous conjectures have been shown to be true for the class of amenable
groups. The core part of the proposed project is to develop recent results of
the principal investigator in order to establish that certain classes of groups
are amenable or to prove that they exhibit certain weaker forms of this
property. In the process, the project is expected to strengthen the connections
between several areas of mathematics. Finally, the principal investigator will
seek to attract young researchers to the field and organize conferences and
seminars on the subject.
