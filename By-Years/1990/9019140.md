Problems of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic stability are of considerable
interest in the framework of geophysics as well as of fundamental importance in
physics. It is anticipated that combining the complementary expertise of U.S.
and Soviet scientists will lead to significant results related to better
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which the Earth's magnetic field
as well as planetary and solar magnetic fields behave and are generated. This
U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative scientific workshop, organized by Dr. Susan
Friedlander of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Dr. M. M. Vishik of the
USSR Academy of Sciences' International Institute of Earthquake Prediction
Theory and Mathematical Geophysics, will bring together distinguished scientists
from the United States and the Soviet Union whose range of expertise covers
applied mathematics, mathematical physics, astrophysics, and geophysics. It is
expected that this initial meeting will generate further long-term collaborative
activities in this field. This project fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United
States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple- mentary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific
research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
