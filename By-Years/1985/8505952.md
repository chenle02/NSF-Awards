Support is provided for the University of Michigan to acquire hydraulic testing
equipment and accessories. The support will complement the State of Michigan's
effort to upgrade the university's experimental earthquake research facilities.
Hydraulic testing equipment will enhance the new experimental research
facilities and will allow the University of Michigan structural research staff
to continue to make significant contributions to their fields of study. After
the completion of the project, the upgraded testing facilities will be utilized
for development of pseudo-dynamic testing capability, for three-dimensional
loading and testing of continuous systems, etc.
