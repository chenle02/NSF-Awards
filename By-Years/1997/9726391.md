We propose a new paradigm for system design in which the algorithm and circuit
implementations are jointly designed to achieve high-performance while
minimizing average power consumption. We propose to drive the research using a
case study of an adaptive equalizer/decoder where both algorithm selection and
asynchronous hardware design will be tackled using a Minimum Average Complexity
(MAC) approach. In particular, we will develop a detailed asynchronous design of
representative components of a MAC optimized mobile radio receiver, variable
complexity algorithms for joint adaptive equalization and decoding, a
characterization of the average computational load of these algorithms for a
typical mobile user, general procedures for MAC algorithm optimization, an
architecture for the new algorithms and a quantitative estimate of the power
savings relative to a standard design.
