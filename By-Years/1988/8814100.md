The National Science Foundation (NSF) aeronomy community has initiated a
science program, "CEDAR", directed towards understanding of the Coupling,
Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions. To implement this program, new
thrusts in theoretical modelling and new upgraded experimental capabilities
using optical and radar techniques will be needed. To coordinate the effort
among individual researchers in the community and to provide scientific advice
to NSF, a science steering committee (CEDAR-SSC) was formed with membership
selected by the NSF program officers. This committee has been in operation since
1984 and has been active in the planning of meetings and workshops, preparation
of reports and articles about CEDAR, definition of scientific campaign
strategies, etc. This award is to continue the activities of this committee.
