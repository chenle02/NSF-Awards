This research examines the physical and cellular biochemistry of a novel
exchange protein found in the gram-negative anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes. In
this anaerobe, the exchange of divalent oxalate for monovalent formate forms the
basis for generation of proton-motive force. This antiport reaction is
unprecedented among "chemiosmotic" carriers for its role in cellular
biochemistry and unique among anion exchange proteins for its electrogenic
character. Assays have been devised to reconstitute this antiport reaction
without loss of function and are used as a guide to purify the exchange protein
from membranes of O. formigenes. After the protein is purified experiments will
reveal the kinetic reaction mechanism (Ping Pong or Simultaneous) and that
portion of the reaction cycle which carries charge over the membrane. Using
residue-specific chemical probes, monoclonal antibodies directed against the
antiport protein, and the derived amino acid sequence predictions will be made
about the physical structure. Oxalobacter formigenes, a gram-negative anaerobe,
is a cell whose sole source of metabolic energy derives from the decarboxylation
of oxalic acid. It has been established that membranes of O. formigenes contain
a carrier that displays the electrogenic exchange of divalent oxalate and
monovalent formate. This reaction is of particular interest to cellular
biochemistry as a mechanism whereby the organism sustains a proton-motive force.
Thus, the antiport of precursor and product results in the net entry of negative
charge, while consumption of a proton during oxalate decarboxylation changes
internal pH. This is a novel use for such a "secondary" carrier and is of
interest to determine whether other cells that utilize carboxylic acids also
exploit such antiport reactions. This research will examine the molecular
properties of this carrier and its overall function in cellular biochemistry.
This work will contribute to the current understanding of how bacteria organize
their cellular functions.
