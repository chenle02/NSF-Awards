The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses for participants to
the conference entitled, "Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar
on the Physics and Chemistry of Microfluidics: Microscale technology for
advancing and translating discovery" to be held in West Dover, VT, May 30-June
5, 2015. This conference will offer a unique forum and intimate professional
setting for the exchange of new ideas, presentation and discussion of
unpublished results, speculative discussions, and opportunities for
new&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary collaborations among attendees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past two decades, advances in microfluidic
technologies have impacted manufacturing (with good control of parallel
reactions in small scales and specialized manufacturing with the use of minimal
resources), separations technologies, bioanalytics, and self assembly processes.
In this conference, the speakers will discuss the very latest progress in their
research in the area of microfluidic and nanofluidic systems for a wide variety
of applications from genomics to proteomics to nanotechnology to chemical
synthesis to energy. The areas of focus for this conference include the
following: 1) Water filtration and desalination, 2) Energy and Carbon
management, 3) Point-of-care diagnostics, 4) Concentrated suspensions in
confined systems, 5) Rare cells capture and analysis, 6) Manipulation and
analysis of single molecules, 7) Droplet microfluidics, 8) Microfluidic
biotechnology.
