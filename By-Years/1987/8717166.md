This award supports continuation of theory for supernova spectra, especially
their changes with time. The new information from supernova 1987A is expected to
provide a strong stimulus for understanding other supernovae. Supernova
explosions terminate the lives of selected stars. Among the gases flung into
space are newly created chemical elements which are later used in new stars and
new planets. Wheeler and his associates have studied the spectra of supernovae
appearing in rather distant galaxies. Vastly more detailed data were obtained
for the relatively nearby supernova 1987A. This award supports mainly the
continued theoretical study of supernova spectra, expanded as needed to
interpret the spectra of supernova 1987A. The differences between this and other
recent supernovae will provide substantial clues to understanding the exploding
stars and how they come to generate the energies and elements that are observed.
