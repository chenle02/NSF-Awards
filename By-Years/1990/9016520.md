In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Heaven will study the electronic spectra of open-shell van der
Waals molecules. Such studies should help understand collisional processes
involving atoms or molecules having unpaired electrons. High resolution
electronic spectra will be obtained for several prototype molecules consisting
of diatomic radicals and a noble gas atom such as neon or argon. Molecular
constants derived from these spectra will be used to determine potential energy
surfaces for the electronically excited and ground states. Electronic and
vibrational predissociation rates will be measured for excited states, and
calculations of these rates will be made based on experimentally derived
potential energy surfaces.
