It has long been perceived that control of the flow to a gas bearing might aid
in stiffening or stabilizing it. There is rapidly increasing interest in
precision instrumentation and machine tools, and bearings may provide convenient
adjustment points in their structures for compensating thermal distortion,
effects of load movement, and vibration. This research is designed to exploit
the potential for feedback control in the gas supply. The parameters to be
examined include: gas bearings as vibration isolators, stabilization of
pneumatic hammer, stiffening and stabilization of dynamic systems, and
positioning over an absolute frame of reference. The industrial potential for
these applications in principally in high precision instruments and machine
tools to control static deformation and dynamic force transmission. An actuator
invented in the program promises much broader applications. Control of pneumatic
hammer offers much broader application in that bearing stiffness and bearing
load may be increased beyond the present limits.
