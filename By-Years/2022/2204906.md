This award supports student and postdoctoral fellow attendance at
the&lt;br/&gt;SIAM-ACM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), to take place
during&lt;br/&gt;January 9-10, 2022 in Alexandria, Virginia. SODA is one of the
few&lt;br/&gt;major conferences with broad coverage of Theory of Computing
and&lt;br/&gt;Discrete Mathematics. SODA has a record of strongly
encouraging&lt;br/&gt;participation by students, for whom the conference serves
as a valuable&lt;br/&gt;educational experience, both for the technical content
of the talks and&lt;br/&gt;for the opportunities for networking that it
provides. This award will&lt;br/&gt;provide partial support to about 20
students/postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
