This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of surface vibrational spectroscopy and electrochemistry.
Unenhanced surface Raman spectroscopy (SURS) will be developed as an analytical
tool for studies of adsorption and reaction in electrochemical systems and to
study short-range or chemical enhancement in surface- enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS). Charge-coupled device detectors will be employed to
increase optical detection sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude,
thereby making a wide range of surface chemical systems accessible for study.
Orientational phase transitions and electrochemical reaction pathways will be
studied on smooth electrode surfaces using SURS as an in situ probe of the
molecular nature of the adsorbed species. Comparisons will be made to systems
previously studied using SERS. Electron spectroscopic studies using high
resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy combined with Raman excitation
profiles and cross-section measurements will be used to study chemical effects
in SERS studies of well-characterized model systems. Unenhanced surface Raman
spectroscopy is a powerful probe of the structures and reactions of molecules
adsorbed on solid surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum, in high pressure gas ambient
phases and in the electrochemical environment. It offers high molecular
specificity, high spectral and spatial resolution and relatively high
sensitivity. In contrast to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, this technique
does not depend on the electronic properties and surface structure of the
substrate, which may be a metal, semiconductor or dielectric.
