Reaction and Diffusion in the Presence of Fluid Flow

Abstract of Proposed Research Andrej Zlatos

This project is to investigate the mathematical analysis of equations that
model systems that involve both reactions and fluid flow. This will help our
understanding of issues such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear
reactions in stars, forest fires and the production of ozone in the atmosphere.

Specifically we shall study systems of reaction diffusion equations coupled to
the Navier-Stokes equation. A particular problem is to analyze the quenching of
reaction due to the presence of fluid advection. Another is the study of
traveling fronts for the reactive Boussinesq system. This work will involves the
use of functional analysis, probability theory and special techniques, including
spectral theory and comparison principles, for these classes of nonlinear
partial differential equations.
