CMS-0123932&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of this symposium is to bring together,
engineers, scientists and applied mathematicians from a variety of scientific
disciplines who are working on duality, Complementarity and symmetry in
nonlinear mechanics and computational methods. The original proposal of this
IUTAM symposium has been approved by the IUTAM Symposia Committee with the
maximum grade A. The purpose of this proposal is to apply for a very limit grant
from NSF to cover partially the travel expenses for about ten important
participants from different institutions in US. The symposium proceedings will
be published in a hardbound volume by Chapman &amp; Hall / CRC in the book
series Advances in Modern Mechanics and Mathematics. It is expected that this
IUTAM Symposium will lead a new trend of nonlinear mechanics, and the
proceedings will be an important IUTAM documentation in the development of this
fascinating subject. &lt;br/&gt;
