The lead PI has been working on th inversion of the refraction arrivals from all
multi-channel seismic data from Atlantis Massif which is now complete. They are
funded to incorporate these velocity models of the shallow crust in a re-
examination of the reflectivity, extending the prior MCS analyses by other
investigators. There are reflectors within the Oceanic Core Complex at Atlantis
Massif at depths below the paths of the refracted waves. Incorporating these
events in new tomographic inversions will extend current models into the core of
the massif. The PIs also hope that the study will advance knowledge beyond
current depths and will determine what type of experiment(s) can obtain seismic
constraints across the full depth range necessary to truly test the
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts include postdoctoral training,
enhancing the outcomes of IODP drilling investments in igneous oceanic
lithosphere, and development/sharing of tools for seismic analysis of shallow
lithospheric structure. The work will also support two current IODP proposals
under consideration for scheduling. Insights obtained on the seismic properties
of intrusive ocean crust may feed into research/planning for a deep crustal and
mantle penetration (MoHole) by the next ocean drilling program.
