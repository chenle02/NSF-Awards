Large-scale floating platforms for purposes such as airports (both military and
civilian), manufacturing facilities, bases for hazardous waste disposal, ocean
energy, etc., have been discussed in the literature for a number of years. Such
large-scale floating platforms can easily be twice or three times the length of
the largest ship ever built and many times wider. Many different geometries for
these platforms have been discussed. On one end of the spectrum, barge-like
forms which are wall-sided, shallow rectangular shapes have been proposed (this
is the form of most floating bridges). On the other end of the spectrum, forms
which are composed of many low-motion column stabilized oil platforms joined
together have also been proposed. Each configuration has its own set of
advantages and difficulties both in assembly and operation. It is a primary goal
of this research to develop the technology to investigate and quantify these
differences, so that the designer will have the information to choose an
appropriate configuration for a particular environment.
