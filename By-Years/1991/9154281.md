In the summer of 1990 a "Transforming Physics Content Using New Technologies"
workshop was held at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.
The response from the physics community at large and the selected participants
in particular was enthusiastic. There is a real interest and need within the
physics community for information on and experience with using the new
interactive technologies in physics teaching. Based on the lessons the we
learned from the 1990 workshop and from the comments of the participants we are
conducting a new workshop on using the new interactive technologies to teach
physics. The goals of the new workshop are much the same as the first: to enable
physicists to use the new interactive technologies to teach physics, to foster
discussions and formulations of new teaching strategies using these
technologies, and to disseminate the information learned beyond the workshop
confines to the physics community at large.
