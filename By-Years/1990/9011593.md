This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is made to
Dr. Frank J. Feher of the Chemistry Department of the University of California
at Irvine to support work on transition-metal-containing silsesquioxanes. In
previous work, a vanadium complex of this type was found to catalyze
polymerization of ethylene and propylene. In this study, the structure of the
active polymerization catalyst and the mechanism by which it operates will be
investigated. The results may be relevant to the reaction chemistry of silica-
supported transition metal complexes generally. The understanding of silica
surface structure and reactivity is of practical importance for applications in
catalysis, ceramics, adsorbents, abrasives, thickeners, and lubricants. Large,
incompletely condensed silsesquioxanes with structural similarities to silicon
dioxide polymorphs have been prepared and used to prepare polyhedral
oligometallasilsesquioxanes (POMSS). Vanadium, zirconium, titanium, molybdenum,
and chromium complexes will be prepared, their catalytic reactivity tested, and
the structure of their active sites determined. Solid state NMR will be used
extensively.
