King 9528552 Carbon monoxide (CO) plays a major role in atmospheric chemistry.
Through a series of reactions, CO can contribute to the formation of
tropospheric ozone, which poses a serious health concern on a regional scale.
While anthropogenic sources of CO are reasonably well understood, relatively
little is known about natural CO sources and sinks. Wetlands have been
discounted as CO sources on the basis of sediment CO concentrations. However,
plant leaves and stems produce significant amounts of CO when illuminated by the
sun. Because of their large amounts of plant biomass, wetlands are likely strong
net CO sources. Our work will determine the extent and controls of CO emission
from wetlands, and contrast the behavior of CO with that of methane, another
important atmospheric trace gas for which wetlands are a primary global source.
Our work will also examine links between CO production and increased ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion.
