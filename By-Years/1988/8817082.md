This is a continuing project on Pb, Sr and Nd tracer studies of carbonatites and
alkaline-complex rocks as probes to study the geochemical evolution of the
Earth's mantle over the past 3,000,000,000 years. They now plan to study
avariety of specific rocks; calcites from Finland and Uganda, C and O in
carbonatites from Uganda, O isotopes from ancient syenites, Hf from carbonatites
of the Canadian Shield, and Pb, Nd, Sr, O and C isotopes on carbonatites from
the Canary Islands provided by LeBas. There will also be an attempt to obtain
carbonatites from India, China and Greenland. A new thrust will be a measurement
of age and isotope patterns of coesite- and almandine-bearing rocks from Dora
Maira, Italy. The reasearch will be done in collaboration with other workers
from Germany, Canada, Italy and Switzerland.
