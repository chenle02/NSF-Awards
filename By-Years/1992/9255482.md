This proposal is to renew funding for a faculty enhancement workshop in
molecular biotechnology. A two-week summer workshop in the well-equipped
laboratories and computer facilities of the Department of Biological Sciences
will provide hands-on experiences in molecular biotechniques including
recombinant DNA technology, protein purification, vector construction, cDNA and
genomic library construction for college faculty from regional two- and four-
year colleges. The Workshop is designed to allow the transfer of molecular
technology from the workshop laboratories to the participants' home
institutions. A faculty enhancement seminar series aimed at the professional
development of participating college faculty will continue throughout the post-
workshop year.
