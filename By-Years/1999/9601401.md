Among the central concerns of this project are such questions as: How is
feminine technology distinctive? What do these distinctions tell us about
technology and about women? How have Americans' cultural perceptions of gender
differences shaped and been shaped by technological change? To explore such
questions this project will examine seven `feminine` technologies, meaning
technologies associated with women either by virtue of biological difference or
by virtue of sex role prescription (especially through the division of labor).
Unlike other studies of women and technology that focus on exceptional women
using technologies that are predominantly masculine in character, this project
will ask what sorts of technological knowledge common American women have
historically possessed, how they have used that knowledge, and why women's
technological knowledge has been largely undervalued.
