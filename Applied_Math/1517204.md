This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigator in the
general area of signal processing, which concerns itself, for example, with the
electronic transmission of information: digitization, compression, encoding,
decoding, and the like. Modern sensors are ubiquitous. They measure signals of
interest and digitally store or transmit large amounts of data. Sophisticated
computer algorithms then process the data, to recover the signals or to perform
other tasks. To allow accurate signal recovery and optimize subsequent use, it
is critical that the measurement and digitization processes be well designed. It
is also important that their theoretical properties, performance guarantees, and
limitations be understood.  Under practical constraints, we theoretically
investigate not only how measurements should be made, but also how they should
be digitized (i.e., how they should be converted into bit-streams and
subsequently compressed). The Principal Investigator will focus on nonclassical
signal models (including sparse vectors and low-rank matrices)
whose importance has been increasing in recent years due to their relevance to
modern applications.

This project aims to understand the interplay between sampling of structured
signals, digitization, and compression---all in the modern setting of signal
reconstruction by non-linear algorithms.  For example, it focuses on
approximately sparse signals measured using compressed sensing techniques, low-
rank matrices measured by randomly sampling their entries, and vectors whose
phase-less measurements consist of the magnitudes of inner products with other
vectors.  In short, the Principal Investigator seeks sampling and quantization
theorems for the digital world. This requires developing and using tools from
various areas of mathematics. As the measurement models related to this research
rely heavily on randomness, the project must develop and use methods from
geometric functional analysis and nonasymptotic random matrix theory. In the
formulation of quantization methods for redundant measurements, connections with
frame theory and the mathematical literature on noise-shaping quantization will
be established and used. The encoding (compression) algorithms proposed in this
research use randomness extensively, and here the Principal Investigator
anticipates connections with the randomized numerical linear algebra literature.
In analyzing new reconstruction algorithms, he will employ and develop methods
from convex optimization and numerical analysis.
