In renewed taxonomic studies of the large neotropical genus of sunflowers
Viguiera, Dr. Edward Schilling of the University of Tennessee will conduct field
work in Mexico and Argentina to amass samples for intensive morphological and
molecular analyses of characters useful in delimiting species and in assessing
relationships with other sunflower genera. Preliminary analysis of mutations in
chloroplast DNA demonstrates that restriction- site mapping will be especially
informative. The phylogenetic framework provided by the molecular data will then
permit rigorous study of morphological and chromosomal changes in the several
Mexican and Central-South American lineages of the group. Also, Dr. Schilling
will be able to test whether a single migration from ancestral Mexican stock or
multiple migrations best explains the diversity of related species in Andean
South America.
