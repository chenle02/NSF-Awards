9315099 D'Hoker This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Eric D'Hoker, Department of Physics, University of California,
Los Angeles, and Professor Norisuke Sakai, Department of Physics, Tokyo
Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan. The objective of the joint research is to
investigate five projects-- four in non-critical string theory and one on non-
decoupling effects in four dimensional particle theory. The collaboration has
been in progress since 1988 and has produced numerous publications to date. The
first four projects on non-critical strings are closely related and require
experience in supergeometry, superstrings, topological quantum field theory, and
matrix models. Both investigators have worked on non-decoupling effects and
continue to do so. The joint research is a natural extension of the
investigators' respective studies and will benefit from the fact that they have
worked on different sides of the problem. ***
