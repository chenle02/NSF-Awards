This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) award funds the acquisition of a high performance computer cluster at The
New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). The cluster will be used to study a wide
variety of topics in plant biology including evolution, gene function, three-
dimensional image reconstruction, ecosystem function, and DNA based specimen
identification. The analyses conducted with the computer cluster will be
published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A computer
cluster at NYBG will broadly impact the research of a wide variety of
constituencies: (1) An internship program formed between NYBG and the Bronx High
School of Science, a school of highly gifted students from predominantly
minority background, will give at students the opportunity to perform
independent research in a laboratory. (2) The quality of the graduate program
will improve as students will have a more powerful data analysis option and will
be more broadly trained in current techniques. (3) Undergraduate and graduate
students will be offered a class on Computational Methods in Biology at Lehman
College (CUNY), a predominantly minority institution.
