9418008 Cashman Processes of volatile exsolution and gas expansion strongly
influence eruptive styles of volcanoes. For this reason, rates and mechanisms of
magmatic vesiculation have long been a fundamental question in volcanology. The
relationship between pumice clast vesicularity, vesicle structure, permeability,
and eruptive style will be determined by (1) making detailed structural
measurements of pumice clasts; (2) developing techniques for determination of
pumice permeability in both the solid and the liquid state, and (3) making
experimental measurements of rates of bubble coalescence through use of a
microscope-based heating stage and video recorder. This work will provide
critical new data that are necessary input to rapidly-developing models of magma
ascent, fallout of tephra eruption columns and magmatic fragmentation.
