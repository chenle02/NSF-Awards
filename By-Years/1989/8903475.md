Biostratigraphic analysis of Late Devonian, Frasnian conodont sequences in
Euramerica has led to a thirteen-fold zonation in the Montagne Noire, France and
a different twelve- fold zonation in the Alberta Rockies. A correlation
hypothesis derived from graphic correlation resolves the differences between the
two sequences and allows development of a semi-quantitative composite range
chart, consisting of 34 composite-standard units. Testing and modification of
this standard will be pursued using data from other sequences in Euramerica and
the recently acquired collections from Australia, where Montagne Noire zones
3-13 have been identified in preliminary analysis. The Australian sequence will
provide a crucial location for an ongoing comprehensive analysis of Frasnian
conodont biogeography. Underpinning these studies is a taxonomic base developed
from multielement taxonomy and shape analysis. The former was the major
taxonomic breakthrough of the 1960s, which has had little impact on Frasnian
conodont studies at the species level until the research carried out under PI's
previous grants. Shape analysis, especially automated outline analysis, has the
potential to quantify evolutionarily significant morphologic characters and
transform many of the subjective aspects of taxonomy into a precise methodology.
