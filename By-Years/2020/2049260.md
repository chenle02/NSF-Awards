Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common assumption in economics is that the
debt issued by the government of a country like the United States is risk-free.
This project builds on the notion that this assumption is unlikely to hold. The
public debt is like an asset whose cash flows are the government’s future
primary surpluses. Because surpluses are cyclical in the short run and track the
country’s output in the long run, this cash flow is risky and should earn a risk
premium. The proper discount rate must exceed the risk-free interest rate. This
project develops a model for pricing government debt considering the risk in
cash flows and assesses the implications of this for taxpayers and for
bondholders. This research points to the important distinction that risk-free
rate should not be compared to the GDP growth rate, but to the risk-adjusted
growth rate. The project has potential deep and broad contributions to policies
on government debt capacity and sustainability of fiscal policies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any equilibrium model with permanent shocks to output
and reasonable asset pricing implications for the returns on stocks and bonds,
the time series properties of the surplus that are consistent with the U.S. data
result in government debt that is risky. Assumption of risk-free debt impose
tight restrictions on the government’s surplus dynamics such that these
restrictions are violated in the data. This project analyzes the underlying
trade-off between the insurance provided to bondholders by keeping the debt
risk-free and the insurance provided to taxpayers and transfer recipients. This
insight gives rise to key questions that are explored in this project. First,
the project looks at why the returns on the U.S. Treasury portfolio are so low
if the surpluses are risky. Second, the research explores other developed
countries in this regard to understand whether U.S. is different, and then
considers the role of the demand for safe assets and the role of the U.S. as the
world’s main supplier of safe assets within this
context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
