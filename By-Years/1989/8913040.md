This grant will support work on partial constraint satisfaction, both in theory
and in the development of a constraint-based reasoning shell for building expert
problem-solving systems. Partial constraint satisfaction requires relaxing
mutually exclusive conditions until an approximate solution to the original
problem can be found. The computer will accept constraint networks as input and
will produce inferences by backtracking and relaxation (rather than by forward
and backward rule chaining). The shell's interface will be a symbolic
spreadsheet where the effects of changing constraints can be observed. Specific
applications in wildlife management may be studied.
