The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 represent the greatest homeland
threat to America since Pearl Harbor. As in times of war, the attacks have
prompted increased patriotism and national identification. This small grant for
exploratory research will examine Americans' national versus racial/ethnic
identifications in the wake of the terrorist attacks. Among the questions to be
addressed are the following: How strongly do Americans identify with their
national identity? Does national identity correspond with an inclusion of
traditionally stigmatized groups (e.g., African Americans) into the common
national in-group? If so, is this inclusion observable in unconscious
associations of stigmatized groups with the category American? Or, instead, is
it merely a conscious extension of patriotism, unlinked to underlying
representations of social categories? What factors predict the magnitude of
these identity effects? Are these identities durable or will they fade over
time?

The research entails a multi-site study of white Americans' national identities
and their inclusion of African- versus Arab-Americans relative to the broader
category American. To date, empirical examinations of the malleability of
identity and inter-group bias have been largely limited to manipulations
involving minimal groups of relatively low self-importance to participants. The
recent terrorist attacks represent a unique opportunity to explore the impact of
extreme threats upon social identities of significant self-relevance. National
identities such as these are likely to be stable except in times of relatively
severe national threat.
