This SGER award has the following objectives:

(i) To upgrade the radiation scheme to include improved treatments of radiative
transfer and parameterizations of optical properties; and (ii) To provide
expanded capabilities including the ability to provide radiances, fluxes, photo-
synthetically active radiation (PAR) and other quantities required of other
modules of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM).

The work is important because it will lead to flexible tools to allow either the
existing CCSM radiation code or the new code to be used for future work on
simulated satellite radiances, actinic fluxes and other parameters of broad
interest to the community.
