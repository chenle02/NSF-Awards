The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved programs and faster
computers have generated the need for still faster machines. Experienced users
wish to solve larger and larger problems of more and more relevance to the
experimental chemist. Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these results,
are compelled to become new users. The acquisition of state-of-the-art computing
equipment is essential to the modern chemistry department whose faculty are
carrying out frontier research. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will be used to help acquire a research mini-
supercomputer. The acquisition will enhance research activity in the following
areas of chemical research: 1) Computer-assisted studies of structure-activity
and structure-property relationships using Adapt 2) Molecular dynamics in
condensed phases 3) Quantum chemistry by random walk 4) Molecular dynamics
simulations of surface reactions 5) Molecular dynamics simulations of solvation
in polar fluids 6) Ion beam-solid interactions 7) The structure of apocytochrome
b-5 in solution 8) Cluster dynamics and bonding 9) Predictions of carbon-13 NMR
relaxation parameters for polysaccharides in solution.
