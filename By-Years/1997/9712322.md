9712322 Rai Description: This proposal provides final funding to support
participation of Delhi University scientists currently resident in the US and
working on the DO Experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The
project is headed on the US side by Paul Grannis, Stony Brook with coPI, Hugh
Montgomery, Fermilab. The cooperating Indian scientist is Dr. Ram Shivpuri,
Director of the Centre for Detector and Related Software Technology. The Delhi
group has extensive experience with the study of quark and gluon structure, with
detectors, and have the computational techniques required for particle physics
studies. They also have a strong capability with the design of software systems
for offline computer analysis of data. Scope: The collaboration brings technical
capabilities from India, as well as equipment provided from Indian sources, to
allow participation with American scientists in the particle physics studies
carried out at Fermilab. This is a unique opportunity for the Indian
participants to work on high energy experiments at one of the world's most
powerful accelerators. On March 3, 1995, Fermilab announced the discovery of the
TOP quark by this group of high energy physicists. ***
