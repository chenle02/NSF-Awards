9407177 McDonald This project is to advance and broaden our knowledge in the
areas of plant cell biotechnology, ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs), and
plant cell bioprocess engineering. This project has three specific goals, which
include: (1) characterization of the transformation of plant cell cultures by
the plant pathogen Agrobacterium rhizogenes; (2) quantification of cell growth
and RIP production in suspension culture; and (3) purification and
characterization of proteins obtained from the cell cultures. RIPs are naturally
occurring plant proteins thought to be ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, and are
currently receiving considerable attention for their antiviral, antitumor and
abortifacient properties. They are also being considered for their potential use
in immunotoxin preparation and for their ability to confer resistance to plant
pathogens. ***
