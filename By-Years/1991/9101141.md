This program involves twelve undergraduate students in research in the
Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University
of Cincinnati. The students are recruited primarily from other universities in
the region and selected for the program on the basis of their academic
achievements. Specific projects are selected from ongoing research in
computational fluid mechanics, biomechanics, experimental fluids and propulsion,
large space structures, mechanics of materials, rocket engine diagnostics, and
guidance and control. The participants spend one summer at UC usually between
their junior and senior year. Activities include: participation in the research,
attendance at weekly REU meetings, attendance at local professional meetings,
and visits to private and government research facilities.
