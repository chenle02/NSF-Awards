This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide
interactive software to improve the quality of data obtained in environmental
monitoring projects that involve chemical analysis. It will facilitate
understanding and successful implementation of the complex interactions between
project data quality objectives, sampling and analytical method selection, and
numbers and kinds of samples analyzed. Developing an expert system that can be
used as a tool for cost-effective project planning will do this. Although the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency initiated systematic planning for
environmental sampling and analysis over ten years ago, successful
implementation of it has been difficult. This SBIR project will provide
solutions to the frequently misunderstood areas of data quality, information
quality, and method performance. It will enable scientists and engineers to
generate environmental analytical data at a quality level (and resulting cost)
based on the use of that data (i.e., performance based measurement systems -
PBMS) instead of only using current prescriptive protocols. Interactive software
will be developed that facilitates more rapid and cost-effective environmental
sampling and analysis which is based on the interrelated factors of confidence
levels, numbers of samples, and analytical method selection. The software will
combine method performance information from a new National Environmental Methods
Index (NEMI) with U.S. EPA's Data Quality Objective (DQO) Process and a user's
desired Measurement Quality Objectives (MQOs). Although it will be primarily a
commercially useful product for industry and government organizations, it will
also function as an educational tool to support university and technical school
curricula. Another potential application is for the software to be incorporated
as a technical basis for a future front-end user interface to NEMI.
