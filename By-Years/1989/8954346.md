This project gives faculty from fifteen colleges the expertise necessary to
manage a multi-user, multi-tasking computer system and integrate its use into
their curricula. There are three phases to the project. In the first phase,
participants attend an intensive two week workshop in systems use and
management, with the practical emphasis on the UNIX operating system. Materials
from the workshop are used to configure computing systems of the individual
schools for the use of the participants. With the aid of the program, these
systems are set up and connected into a communications network involving all of
the participating schools. During the next year, the systems at the school will
be supported by a software support group at the University of Kentucky, while
the participants develop group projects. These projects are oriented to
upgrading the computer science and/or mathematics instructional environments and
curricula in the individual schools. At the end of the year, the participants
run a conference on the UNIX system in the small college environment; at which
time they will report on their projects and evaluate the program.
