The objective of the proposed research is the study of the design, analysis, and
implementation of algorithms for computing the global minima of a class of
nonconvex energy functions. One of the most significant and challenging problems
in molecular biophysics and biochemistry is that of computing the native
3-dimensional conformation (folded state) of a globular protein given its amino
acid sequence, possibly in the presence of additional agents (e.g. drugs). The
minimization of potential energy functions plays an important role in the
determination of ground states or stable states of certain classes of molecular
clusters and proteins. Since, in almost all the cases, the potential energy
function is nonconvex and therefore has been made; the primary impediment is the
lack of adequate global minimization methods for these large-dimensionality
problems. Our research will focus on: (a) determination of suitable energy
functions that can reliably model protein behaviour and (b) global optimization
methods that can find global minima of nonconvex energy functions given the many
degrees of freedom available to protein structures.
