An Algorithm Suite for Computational Nonlinear Analysis of Power Systems This
effort targets the original development of CNAPS, an innovative suite of
numerical algorithms for continuation analysis of multi-segment trajectories in
large-scale, nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple slow and fast timescales,
coupled components, and with triggers, resets and switches. Continuation methods
have proven very successful for analyzing system behavior of low-dimensional
systems. In CNAPS, we aim to dramatically scale continuation methods to complex
networked systems with hybrid system trajectories and tens of thousands of
states, by developing new multiscale, multisegment, trajectory-discretization
algorithms based on asynchronous collocation methods; developing new mesh
adaptation algorithms suitable for the asynchronous collocation methods, which
accommodate segment-specific discretization error bounds; and constructing
domain decomposition methods particular to the network topology and the
asynchronous collocation formulation, which enable efficient parallel execution.
The core application of CNAPS considered in this multidisciplinary effort is
modern power systems that include renewable sources of generation, specifically
wind power, and newer forms of load, characterized by multiple coexisting time
scales and trigger-induced switching behavior. Analysis of large-disturbance
dynamic phenomena in such systems currently relies almost exclusively on forward
simulation. While such tools may reveal complex behavior, they offer little help
in the design process required to address unacceptable behavior, especially
emerging phenomena associated with the increased use of power electronic
converters. The development of CNAPS enables intelligent and efficient
exploration of transient and steady-state responses of complex power systems,
aimed at quantifying design and uncertainty margins for stable, faultless
operation.
