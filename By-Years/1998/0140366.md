This proposal concentrates on the experiment E158 at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, which will determine the weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle)
at low momentum transfer by measuring the&lt;br/&gt;parity-violating asymmetry
in Moller (electron-electron) scattering. The experiment will provide the
world's best low energy measurement of this fundamental parameter of the
Standard Model of particle&lt;br/&gt;interactions. By comparing the E158 results
with the existing high energy measurements of the weak mixing angle, we will
establish, for the first time, its momentum transfer dependence, predicted by
the Standard Model. Deviations from the prediction would signal the presence of
new phenomena beyond the Standard Model, including new neutral currents mediated
by Z' bosons in the mass range of up to 900 GeV and new contact interactions
with a scale of up to 11 TeV. This sensitivity matches or exceeds the direct and
indirect search sensitivities of the high-energy collider experiments at CERN
and FNAL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small asymmetries associated with measuring
parity violating effects at low momentum transfer mount many challenges to the
experimenters, in particular, in controlling systematics effects related to
the&lt;br/&gt;polarized electron beam. The UC Berkeley Nuclear Physics group
brings an extensive experience in the beam instrumentation and data analysis to
the E158 experiment. We take major responsibilities in the running of the
experiment, physics analysis, and possible upgrades. While being at the
forefront of the fundamental research, this project also provides unique
opportunities for training and education of graduate and undergraduate students,
giving them hands-on hardware experience as well as exposure to the
modern&lt;br/&gt;analysis techniques. &lt;br/&gt;
