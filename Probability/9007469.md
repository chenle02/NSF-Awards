The principal investigator is continuing his work in theoretical probability.
He will be collaborating with a number of different scientists on problems
relating to limit theorems of independent random variables. These problems arose
originally from questions in mathematical statistics. In particular, he will
work on problems dealing with refinements of the Berry-Essen theorem, strong
limit theorems, and multilinear forms.
