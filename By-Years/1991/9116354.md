This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research between Brian
Hauge of the Massachusetts General Hospital and Jerome Giraudat of the Institute
of Plant Sciences, the French National Center for Scientific Research. The
objective of their research is to investigate plant-hormone action at the
molecular level. They propose to characterize plant hormone biosynthetic and
response genes in Arabidopsis. They will clone genes which are involved in
abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. Dr. Hauge is experienced
in cloning the GA biosynthetic pathway. This is complemented by Dr. Giraudat's
involvement in synthesis of the ABA hormone and his expertise on hormone
receptors. Their combined efforts, coupled with the clones and maps from their
respective laboratories, will facilitate rapid and efficient cloning of these
genes. The molecular and genetic characterization of GA and ABA hormonal action
will provide important data regarding the mechanism governing plant-hormone
interaction. Since this project will also generate physical maps in the vicinity
of the interaction, the collaboration will contribute to the overall mapping of
the Arabidopsis genome.
