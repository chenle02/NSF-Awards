This collaborative research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP)
program supports work by Prof. Richard C. Holz of the Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago to carry out fundamental studies
on the catalytic mechanism of iron- and cobalt-type nitrile hydratases (NHase,
EC 4.2.1.84), in collaboration with Prof. Brian Bennett at the Medical College
of Wisconsin (CHE-1058396). NHase's catalyze the hydration of nitriles to their
corresponding commercially valuable amides in a chemo-, regio-, and/or enantio-
selective manner at ambient pressures, temperatures, and physiological pH. For
these reasons, NHases have attracted substantial interest as biocatalysts in
preparative organic chemistry and NHase containing bacteria have found some
industrial applications in the large scale production of acrylamide and
nicotinamide.

Since little is understood about how NHase enzymes function, a better
understanding of the structure and reaction mechanism of NHase enzymes will
enable access to nitrile-hydrolyzing materials with broader substrate ranges,
higher activities, and greater stabilities. These biomaterials will also provide
a "green" alternative to the harsh industrial conditions required for nitrile
hydration.
