This workshop discusses the role of chemical and physical processes which are
of importance for the distribution of atmopsheric trace constituents and their
variation in the atmopshere. The emphasis will be on the modeling aspect of
these constituents. At the workshop, the present state of knowledge will be
presented, key scientific issues will be identified, and future research
priorities will be discussed.
