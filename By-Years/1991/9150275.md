Resource materials for use in abstract algebra are being developed to support a
mathematics computing laboratory. The materials and the laboratory allow the
integration of high- level computing into advanced mathematics courses; courses,
which to date, have felt very little of the benefits of computing. The materials
are uses as teaching and learning aids, exploiting the power of computing to
give students a new perspective on traditional topics. In addition, to show
students that in research, engineering, and business, computing is used as a
flexible problem solving tool of immense power.
