Fruit represent a significant portion of human diets and a major constituent of
global food security. Fruit are significant contributors of vitamins, minerals,
carbohydrates and fiber, yet present day fruit and vegetable intake is well
below dietary guidelines. Inadequate fruit consumption is due partly to
practical production, storage and shelf-life constraints limiting fruit
availability at affordable prices. In addition, reduced flavor, appearance and
aroma qualities, often attributed to early harvest and incomplete ripening
(necessary for produce survival through modern supply chains), decreases
consumer interest in fruit and fruit products. A better understanding of the
genetic control of ripening and associated nutrient, flavor and quality
characteristics, will provide growers, breeders and seed companies with tools
for selection of higher quality fruit crops. Recently numerous ripening control
processes have been resolved in tomato due to its short life cycle, providing
insight into strategies for improving fruit quality while minimizing product
loss. The primary objective of this project is to investigate the extent to
which findings in tomato hold true for additional fruit crops, thus providing
paths toward crop improvement. We have selected melon and banana as research
targets due to their global consumption and economic value, and because they
represent a range of ripening mechanisms and genetic diversity that will
distinguish specific from more general ripening and fruit quality control
components. Genes and genetic processes conserved among these species are likely
to be common to most other fruit crops and will provide practical selection
targets for fruit quality and shelf-life improvement. This project will also
provide international exchange of students and postdoctoral fellows between the
US and Israel as part of the scientific training and collaboration.
