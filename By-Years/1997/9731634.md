Robert Cave of Harvey Mudd College, a RUI institution, is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to
investigate electronic coupling elements in electron transfer reactions. He will
use his own recently published methods to treat ground and excited state
electron transfer reactions in a variety of systems of experimental interest. He
will address orientation and distance dependences of electronic coupling with
and without solvent, superexchange processes in hydrogen-bonded transition metal
adducts, and effects of thermal averaging and dielectric continuum
electrostatics on the electronic coupling matrix element. Electron transfer
processes play an important role in a wide variety of chemical reactions, such
as photosynthesis. The ubiquity and importance of these reactions in organic and
inorganic chemistry has led to concerted experimental and theoretical research
attempting to unravel the details of this simplest of chemical reactions.
Sophisticated electronic structure methods in combination with molecular
dynamics simulations are being used in this study to characterize donor-acceptor
electron coupling in electron transfer reactions.
