This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a portable, rapid, fully - automated, non-Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) based, electronic DNA identification device for field use that is capable
of accurately detecting low concentrations of biological agents in a broad range
of samples. Prior Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of using palladium-
catalyzed nickel to form conductive DNA wires for use in constructing this
device. The Phase II project will further advance the DNA detection technology
by refining the metallization protocol and integrating the technology into an
automated, easy to use format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application
of this project will be for use by the military and / or for homeland security.
The proposed biosensor system is expected to be readily incorporated into
existing nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) detection and reporting systems,
enhancing total force protection by enabling the rapid identification,
containment and neutralization of biological agents.&lt;br/&gt;
