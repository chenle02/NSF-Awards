This award, co-funded by the Brazil Program and the Eukaryotic Genetics Program,
supports cooperative research in biology to be conducted by Dr. Joyce L. Hamlin
of the University of Virginia School of Medicine and Dr. Francisco J.S. Lara of
the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The focus of the research is to gain an
understanding of replication in complex eukaryotic genomes. The project will
study the control of replication of the DNA puff regions in the salivary glands
of the sciarid fly, Rhynchosciara americana. The system offers an unusual
opportunity to examine special regulatory controls over replication that are
exercised during development. The collaboration between the two laboratories is
synergistic, thereby allowing studies that would be impossible to carry out in
either of the individual groups. The Hamlin group offers expertise in molecular
biology while the Lara group is expert in all aspects of the biology of
Rhynchosciara.
