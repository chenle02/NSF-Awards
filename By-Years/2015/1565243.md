The Heisenberg uncertainty principle asserts that the order in which
measurements are made matters; measuring the position of a particle before or
after measuring its momentum affects the result. John von Neumann realized that
the best way to capture this feature in a mathematical formulation was in terms
of mathematical objects called operators. Studying operator theory is still
fundamental not only in quantum mechanics, but in many areas of both pure and
applied mathematics. Control theory, which is the design of things like
automatic pilots and self-driving cars, depends critically on operator theory,
and as these systems get more complex, new mathematical questions arise. The
principal investigator will work on answering such
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study problems in operator
theory, in function theory, and in the theory of noncommutative functions.
Noncommutative functions are functions whose input consists of two (or more)
matrices and whose output is a matrix. Roughly speaking they are generalized
noncommutative polynomials in the same way that an analytic function is a
generalized commutative polynomial. The theory of noncommutative functions is
very new, but it has been successfully applied in diverse areas, including
control theory, realization formulas, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and
semi-definite programming. The principal investigator will use noncommutative
function theory to study spectral theory, and operator monotonicity of
functions, shedding light on the commutative theory also. In addition, he will
work on using mathematical models to help understand the development of
Alzheimer's disease.
