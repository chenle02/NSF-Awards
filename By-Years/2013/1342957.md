This project includes organization of the 2013 Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
Principal Investigators (PI) meeting. This will be the latest in a series of
annual meetings held for CPS program grantees, at which they are able to present
research results and collectively identify future research directions.

Cyber-physical systems use computations and communication deeply embedded in,
and interacting with, physical processes to add new capabilities to physical
systems. These cyber-physical systems range from the very small to the very
large, and can increasingly be found in a wide variety of technologies we use in
our daily lives.

The purpose of this annual CPS PI meeting is to discuss the latest developments
in the field and to help develop ideas for future research. The attendees of
this workshop will hear general plenary talks by leaders in the field, then
participate in breakout sessions to discuss more specialized aspects. The
meeting will feature broad, diverse participation comprising the CPS PI
community.
