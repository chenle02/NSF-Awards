The principal investigator is working in the field of representation theory of
finite groups. Mainly he studies questions related to the conjectures of
Alperin, Dade, and Broue. These conjectures state that certain invariants of a
finite group and a fixed prime number can be determined by the same invariants
of subgroups which are again related to that prime. The first conjectures are
concerned with invariants that are integers, whereas the third conjecture
predicts equivalences of categories. The first two conjectures and consequences
of the third have been verified for a convincing number of examples. It is
likely that these three conjectures are consequences of a single fact, object,
theory, or construction which is still hidden. Probably more important than
solving these particular conjectures would be the discovery of this hidden
feature. The principal investigator works on general ideas of how to approach
these conjectures. Graduate students are involved in this effort by writing
computer programs which will either discard or give more evidence to the
applicability of one of the suggested approaches.

The principal investigator studies representations of groups. Groups can be
viewed as mathematical abstractions of the notion of symmetry. They are among
the most basic notions in many fields of mathematics and are applied widely, for
example in cryptology, physics, chemistry, and computer science. Representations
of groups are manifestations of a particular type of symmetry on other
mathematical objects, as for example the four rotations and four reflections,
that a square in the plane allows, form a representation of a group with 8
elements on a two-dimensional vector space. More specifically, the principal
investigator studies mysterious coincidences in the representation theory of
finite groups which have been discovered about fifteen years ago but could not
be explained so far. This research is not aimed at immediate applications
outside mathematics. However, in the history of the interplay between
mathematics and other sciences, in particular with physics, it is a repeated
pattern that theories and results which were considered as important within the
edifice of mathematics became precisely what was needed in the other sciences in
order to describe our real world. For example, group representations which have
been studied a century ago became much later the right tool to describe
particles in nuclear physics.
