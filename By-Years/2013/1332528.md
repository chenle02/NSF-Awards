Paine College proposes to implement a project entitled "Undertanding Barriers to
STEM Education for African American Women". The project will investigate the
underlying factors linked to the disproportionate participation of African
American women in STEM fields. Specifically, the PI will identify the
psychological and contextual barriers that limit their preparation in STEM
disciplines using a consolidated longitudinal mixed methods research design. The
study will investigate the link between career decisions and self-efficacy and
the impact of the learning context on African American women's persistence in
STEM. The study will also identify patterns of secondary education preparation
in math and science that differentiate STEM and non-STEM African American
females. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance the body of knowledge on
ethnic minorities by presenting a rigorous research study beyond anecdotal data
that gives a better understanding of the socialization experiences of ethnic
minority students, especially African American females. The study can be
replicated at other HBCUs and other institutions seeking to circumvent
contextual barriers through holistic interventions designed for African American
female students. It also could provide new insights into the intersectionality
of gender and race.
