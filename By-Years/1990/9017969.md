This award is an accomplishment-based renewal of an ongoing study of the
katabatic winds in East Antarctica, in cooperation with French and Australian
scientists. It depends on surface meteorological data derived from two lines of
automatic weather stations; one from Dome C to the antarctic coast, the other
along the coast from Commonwealth Bay to Dumont d'Urville. Three new stations
will be installed, which will connect this network with that maintained by the
Australian Antarctic program. These new stations will have the capability of
providing heat flux data in addition to the standard observations. The expanded
coverage will allow an examination of the influence of synoptic weather systems
on the katabatic winds, as well provide information on the spatial variability
of individual wind speed maxima. Additionally, improvements in the calibration
of the instrument to measure blowing snow will be introduced, and the formation
and heat budget of offshore polynyas resulting from katabatic winds will be
studied.
