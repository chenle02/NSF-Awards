This project establishes a capability in computer assisted cartography in the
Geography program. Computer assisted cartographic techniques and processes are
an integral part of several undergraduate geography courses, significantly
enhancing the level of learning among both geography majors and other students
who look to Geography as a corollary science to their major discipline. In
addition to integration of the equipment into four technique courses,computer
assisted cartography is introduced as a discrete learning unit into the entire
array of geography courses, thus serving a wide audience from the entire
University. The goal is to provide students with an opportunity for hands-on
experience with computer assisted cartographic techniques and to allow them to
participate in the expanded geographic analytic processes associated with these
techniques. The award will be matched by an equal amount from the grantee.
