Investigations will continue into the use of formal methods for developing
concurrent and distributed programs, particularly programs that must exhibit
fault-tolerance and satisfy real-time constraints. The research will concentrate
on assertional methods. These methods allow a program to be understood in terms
of a small number of static relations based on its text, rather than in terms of
possible executions.
