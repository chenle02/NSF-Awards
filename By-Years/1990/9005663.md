An area diffractometer for crystallography has been installed at x-ray beamline
X12-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The diffractometer that was chosen was the FAST by ENraf/Nonius of
Delft, The Nether-lands. Several projects are proposed to exploit the multi-
wavelength phasing methods. Also, there is a tremendous pressure for use of the
diffractometer among the existing community of crystallographers who have used
film methods at the beamline. This pressure will drive the development of
standardized but flexible methods for data collection and reduction. Funds are
requested for an additional computer for use in this development project.
