This award will support collaborative research between Prof. K.P.C. Vollhardt of
the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Max Malacria of the Universite
de Lyon, France, in the area of the synthesis of antiviral antibiotics. In
particular, the project is aimed at the total synthesis of the antiviral
Aphidicolin. Because of its antiviral and antineoplastic properties, the
versatile, short, and efficient construction of this molecule has considerable
synthetic and medicinal significance. The goal of this work is to compare
alternative approaches to the synthesis of this antibiotic developed by the two
collaborators. In both approaches, cobalt is used as a catalyst to unravel the
organo-molecular structures of the starting material. However, the mid-points of
the process, in which new molecular structures are formed, are conceptually
different and follow different sequences of molecular formation and breakage.
The U.S. and French researchers have worked together in the past; this award
will facilitate increased interaction between their respective laboratories.
Comparing the two approaches to the synthesis of Aphidicolin will provide
important new insights into the scope and limitations of both methods.
