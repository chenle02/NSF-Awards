Dr. Hounshell and members of the Carnegie Mellon University Department of
History are directing an STS `Small Grant for Training and Research` (SGTR) to
support a sustained research and training program focused on science and
technology during the Cold War. They have chosen this area because they have
already developed an excellent set of core competencies to advance research on
Cold War science and technology while also serving an important training
function. Cold War science and technology is a subject that continues to be an
important area for STS and, with its end, represents enormous opportunities for
pursuing new sources, new approaches and new questions for researchers. Further,
the NSF Workshop on Cold War Science and Technology, which Dr. Hounshell
directed, noted, fundamental questions about science, technology, and democracy
during the Cold War remain to be resolved. These questions go well beyond the
community of practitioners in science and technology studies. This SGTR will
support three graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow and a Research Colloquium
in Cold War Science and Technology. The support will help focus the students and
postdocs' research and instruction in a concerted manner on issues of great
importance for the future of S&amp;T in a post-Cold War era.
