This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a unique
combination of biological and inorganic materials for fabrication of
nanostructured photovoltaic (PV) or solar cells. Photovoltaic cells offer an
attractive low cost and renewable source of energy, which is becoming
increasingly competitive to conventional sources as the materials used in their
construction become more efficient in converting the solar energy to
electricity. Current commercial PV cells use inorganic materials, e.g., silicon,
amorphous-silicon, or thin layers of gallium arsenide, indium phosphide and
cadmium telluride, the semiconductor materials with bandgap energies very near
to optimal values for energy conversion in PV solar cells. Unfortunately their
fabrication is complex and they cannot compete with the cost of conventional
energy sources. For instance, even thin layers of GaAs and InP used in the solar
cells are very expensive and some of them, e.g., CdTe may be environmentally
unacceptable because of their toxicity. Recent developments in nanotechnology
offer material design control at the nano- and molecular scale allowing the
properties of the materials to be orderly controlled, taking advantages of the
high surface area of nanostructured materials.

The broader impacts from this technology would be a new type of nanostructured
photovoltaic panel which would capture solar energy in a more efficient way and
that could make this source more cost effective.
