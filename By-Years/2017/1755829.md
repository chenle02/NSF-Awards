Decision-making in the presence of randomness has been a fundamental and
longstanding challenge in many fields of science and engineering. In the wake of
recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, there has been a prominent
transition of interests and demands from classical (single-stage) stochastic
optimization to multi-stage stochastic programming. In contrast to classical
stochastic optimization, multi-stage stochastic problems are known to suffer
from the curse of dimensionality, for which efficient universal oracle-based
algorithms are not readily available. The goal of this research is to build
bridges from classical stochastic optimization to multi-stage stochastic
problems by developing an understanding of the fundamental limits of an
intermediate class of optimization problems - conditional stochastic
optimization - in the hopes of closing the algorithmic and theoretical gaps.
Because of its specificity (i.e., it involves nonlinear functions of conditional
expectations and lacks unbiased stochastic oracles), this class of optimization
problems falls beyond the theoretical and practical grasp of the vast majority
of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.

The investigator will undertake a systematic study of this subject by (i)
establishing new techniques for the design of algorithms adapted to different
observation schemes and exploitable structures and (ii) developing sample
complexities and non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the proposed
algorithms. This research will significantly extend the current scope of
stochastic optimization in both theory and applicability. It will also lay the
foundation for achieving the long-term goal of bridging to multi-stage decision-
making problems and enriching the computational toolbox and theoretical
developments for optimization under uncertainty.
