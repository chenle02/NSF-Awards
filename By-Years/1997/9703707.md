9703707 Parsons The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Geoffrey B. Parsons to work with Dr. Victor L. J. Tybulewicz at the National
Institute for Medical Research in London, England. Dr. Parsons proposes to study
an innovative way of assessing the role of a suspected participant, Syk tyrosine
kinase, in mouse B cell differentiation and signal transduction. The host lab of
Dr. Tybulewizc has created transgenic mice that lack Syk. Using these mice will
allow the study of Syk's role in BCR (the antigen receptor of B cells) signaling
as well as more long-term tests of B cell function, such as examination of the
role of Syk in somatic hypermutation and B cell memory. The experiments they
have jointly developed will shed light on how Syk functions in the mature B
cell. ***
