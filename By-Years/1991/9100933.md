This project will develop a chronology for the Paleogene by integrating
magnetostratigraphy, stable isotope stratigrajphy, Sr.isotope, and
biostratigraphy. the stratigraphic goal is to developa Paleogene time scale, and
to test biostratigraphic correlations between low and high latitudes. In
addition, the work has the paleoceanographic goal of reconstructing deep.and
surface.water fluctuations by makeing synoptic faunal and isotope comparisons
across two climat transitions, the Paleocene/Eocene boundary and the late middle
Eocene to early Oligocene.
