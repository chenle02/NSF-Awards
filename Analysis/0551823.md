ABSTRACT

Quantum Unique Ergodicity and Rigidity in Dynamical Systems

The research proposed lies at the interface of dynamical systems and several
other mathematical disciplines, and in particular number theory and the
mathematical theory of Quantum Chaos. It is well known that the collections of
invariant probability measures and closed invariant sets for hyperbolic maps or
flows is very large; remarkably, in many dynamical systems of algebraic origin
where there are two (or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is
conjectured that there are actually very few measures or closed sets invariant
under this bigger action. Despite (or perhaps because of) important
contributions by several authors, the mystery of this rigidity property of
multidimensional actions is still one of the central problems in modern ergodic
theory.While seemingly unrelated, the methodology of the study of rigidity of
multiparameter actions is very suitable to study the arithmetical case of the
Quantum Unique Ergodicity Conjecture, regarding the limit of the spatial
distribution of a free particle on certain manifolds in a quantum steady state
as the energy of the state tends to infinity (the semiclassical limit). This
question has been considered previously by many authors mostly using tools from
analytic number theory; the approach proposed, using the dynamical approach, is
new and has already borne fruits.

The theory of dynamical systems gives tools to study complex systems, for
example the evolution of a complicated deterministic process over time. There is
a rich and distinguished tradition of using these powerful tools in other
mathematical disciplines, most notably in number theory and combinatorics. The
research proposed is connected to several of the most exciting possible
applications, including new implications to the theory of quantum chaos in
mathematical physics.
