This award will support four postdoctoral visitors per year at the Courant
Institute of Mathematical Sciences (CIMS), New York University. The purpose of
the CIMS Visitors Program is to expose new Ph.D.s to problems of applied
interest from a wide variety of fields (fluid flow, statistical mechanics,
biology, etc.) and to the mathematical tools (partial differential equations,
small and large-scale computation, etc.) appropriate to their solution. This
marriage of pure and applied mathematics was pioneered at CIMS under the
direction of Richard Courant. The open character of the Institute encourages
contact between visitors, faculty and students, participation in a wide variety
of seminars and advanced courses of instruction in both pure and applied
mathematics, and collaborative work crossing the conventional lines of
specialization.
