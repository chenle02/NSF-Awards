The Young Investigator (NYI) intends to apply the principles of metabolic
engineering to plant biotechnology for the production of useful biochemicals
from genetically-transformed plant cultures. Novel research activities are to
include the use of in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for
measurement of cellular kinetics in micro-reactors, and environmental and
genetic methods for manipulation of cellular metabolism.
