The flexible eddy-current probe array concept, which was developed by Failure
Analysis Associates, allows coverage of the test area without scanning, by
placing an array of probes, fabricated on a thin flexible substrate, against the
test surface and electronically multiplexing through the array elements in a
selected sequence. The goal of this project is to advance the flexible eddy-
current array concept to a position of practical utilization. The application of
holographic inversion of the data obtained from stacked, staggered arrays will
be explored in order to improve the resolution. A closer packing of the elements
is obtained by a matrix electrical interconnection scheme. This involves a
matrix inversion operation to extract the individual element response from the
mixed signal of the entire array. The algorithms developed in the course of this
project will be incorporated into software that will run on a PC- based eddy-
current instrument.
