Tufts University This research proposal focuses upon spatial aspects of
economies with interacting agents. A hybrid approach is sought to construct
models which combine fixed and a random topology of interactions. It is argued
that in depth studies of circular patterns of interaction are crucial for
understanding diverse issues such as micro aspects of social structure and the
emergence of monetary economies. The model development emphasizes two empirical
applications. First, a study of urban neighborhood dynamics in U.S. cities is
proposed. Second, a study of the spatial aspects of the evolutionary behavior of
the U.S. system of cities will be examined. The neighborhood example will focus
on the dynamics of residential segregation and equality as a way of
understanding the dynamics of webs of interaction which constitute the structure
of the urban economy. PSID and AHS data are used within a spatial econometric
framework to derive generalizable results and insights. This analytical approach
also allows the researchers to link their work to interacting agent theory.
