This award to the University of Michigan's Department of Atmospheric and
Oceanic Science is made in response to a proposal submitted to the National
Science Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The
award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire equipment for
meteorological observations. The University is committed to matching the NSF
support for this acquisition. The equipment will be used to develop a number of
field experiments for undergraduate meteorology majors to study and observe
directly the basic physical characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer.
