This Research Planning Grant will allow the principal investigator to carry out
optical activity measurements of selected inorganic and organic solids. The
materials include tellurium dioxide (TeO2), used in optical holographs and as an
acousto-optic light deflector, and the complex bismuth silicate, Bi12SiO20,
which is a photo-refractive material. The work will extend optical activity
measurements into the infrared region, to wavelengths of 3.39 um and will also
include new measurements at temperatures to 70 K. These investigations will
provide new data which will test extant theories for optical activity in these
materials.
