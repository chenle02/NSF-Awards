Cardiovascular disorders are the leading medical cause of disability and deaths
in the United States. For example, systemic arterial hypertension afflicts
approximately 20% of the adult population, and is the prime cause of congestive
heart failure, stroke, and renal disease. It is known that the lower brain stem,
particularly its medulla oblongata portion, plays a primary role in the central
governance of vital visceral functions. Hence, Dr. Hirsch will concentrate his
research efforts on neurons within this important brain region. Using innovative
chemical neuroanatomical and physiological methodologies, he will determine
which population of medullary cells synthesize and co-localize the
neurotransmitters thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and serotonin (5-HT). In
addition, Dr. Hirsch will determine how these chemical messengers differentially
regulate peripheral arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and glandular release
of adrenaline-related hormones. The long-term goals of his multidisciplinary
program is to provide the basis research necessary for the development of novel
medicinal pharmaceutical agents to ameliorate these crippling and life-
threatening human illnesses.
