This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Prorgam in support of the research of Dr. Myron Rosenblum of Brandeis
University. The objective of the research is the design, synthesis and property
characterization of a new class of sterically constrained metallocenes held in a
face-to-face orientation. Such materials are expected to have interesting
electrical conductivity and possibly nonlinear optical properties. Triad
molecules consisting of three such metallocene units either all identical
(homonuclear) or different(heteronuclear) will be prepared. The synthesis of
homonuclear polymers composed of chains of such face-to-face metallocenes will
also be carried out as well as those in which two different metals alternate in
the polymer chain. Synthesis of branched-chain polymers in which
cyclopentadienylmetal clusters containing two, three or four
cyclopentadienylmetal centers form repeating units within the polymer are
planned. Analogous metallocene systems derived from
2,2'-bis(metallocenyl)-1,1-binaphthyls will be made and studied. These
substances are capable of exhibiting electronic interactions either through the
face-to-face conformation or through the binaphthyl rings, and are, in
principle, preparable in optically active form. Collaborations are in place to
characterize the electrical and magnetic properties of the polymers.
