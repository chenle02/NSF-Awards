This award supports the research in number theory of Professors Carl Pomerance
and Helmut Maier of the University of Georgia. Dr. Pomerance's research will
center on integer factoring algorithms and studies of the distribution in
arithmetic progressions of integers with no large prime factor as well as
properties of the sequence of divisors of an integer. Dr Maier's project is to
continue his work on irregularities in the distribution of prime numbers in
short intervals, and also to study the coefficients of the cyclotomic
polynomials. Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of the
properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern
days, problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to creation of
new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of
the most recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have appeared
in theoretical computer science and coding theory.
