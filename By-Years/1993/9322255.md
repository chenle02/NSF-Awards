9322255 Sipcic This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will focus
on Simulation and Computational Modeling in Science and Engineering. This
research centers on the cutting-edge problems that challenge engineers and
scientists that typically cannot be solved by other methods. The Boston
University Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering features active
research groups in Acoustic and Wave Propagation; Nonlinear Dynamics Chaos and
Turbulence; Control and Robotics; Fluid Dynamics and Transport Phenomena; and
Engineered Materials. These research groups are supported by state-of-the-art
computational facilities. ***
