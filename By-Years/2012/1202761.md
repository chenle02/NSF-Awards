Mutual mate choice in the bushcricket Ephippiger
diurnus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few decisions are more important for individual
fitness than choosing when and with whom to mate. Although mate choice is a
widely studied topic, little is known about cases where mutual mate choice
occurs. The bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus provides a unique opportunity to
explore mutual mate choice: females choose males based on their acoustic calls,
and males provide females with a nuptial gift (nutritious spermatophores). The
fellow will test the hypothesis that males display mate choice, and that their
degree of choosiness depends on their nutritional status. The fellow will also
investigate the relationship between the traits females use to evaluate males
and male quality. Finally, the interplay between male and female choice as it
relates to body mass will be investigated. Interactions between male and female
preferences have received little attention, yet are likely to be an important
selective force on mate choice in many species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
project the Fellow will receive training in working with Orthopterans, in
recording and analyzing acoustic signals, and in analyzing spermatophore
quality. The Fellow will pursue several outreach activities through the host
institution. She will engage students in her research, and she is especially
interested in engaging students from groups that are underrepresented in
science. This project will foster integration between research and teaching: the
Fellow will teach Behavioral Biology at the University of Tours using inquiry-
based activities that will involve having students work on independent research
projects relating to her research. This international teaching experience will
expose the fellow to a rich cultural diversity and broaden her perspectives in
the classroom, improving her skills at engaging students from diverse
backgrounds.
