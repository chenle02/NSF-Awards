The motion of defects (disclinations) in liquid crystal polymers will be modeled
theoretically and numerically. A regular array of such defects, their
interaction, and their effect on bulk flow properties will be investigated. In
addition, flow effect on defect orientation will be determined. These issues are
of great importance for the prediction of processing conditions to achieve
highly oriented arrangements in composite materials.
