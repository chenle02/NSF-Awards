In this research project funded by the Office of Special Projects of the
Chemistry Division, Tilley will explore new, metal-mediated routes to
electroactive and charge-transporting polymers with an eye to developing
polymeric materials with tailor-made properties. Chemical information from
mechanistic studies will be used to design and synthesize the next generation of
dehydrocoupling catalysts. Electronic properties of polystannanes will be
investigated in detail, and new types of polystannanes will be synthesized in a
search for new electronic properties and more narrow band-gaps for sigma-
conjugation. Functionalized, nano-porous networks with charge-transport
properties can be developed from some of the supramolecular materials being
studied here. %%% Polymers containing redox-active metal centers will provide
access to new conducting polymers, magnetically active polymers, macromolecular
catalysts or electrode mediator systems. Applications can be expected in
catalysis, molecular sensing, and chemical separations.
