9421950 Ehsani Recent earthquakes have demonstrated the life safety hazard posed
by unreinforced masonry (URM) wall structures. It is proposed to strengthen the
URM walls by fiber composites. The flexibility, light weight and high tensile
strength of composites makes them an ideal material for strengthening masonry
structures. A recent study has demonstrated that significant increases in
strength and ductility could be achieved for static loading. The primary
objective of this research project will be to study the out-of-plane cyclic
behavior of unreinforced masonry (URM) walls strengthened with fiber composites
and to develop analysis and design procedures or seismic strengthening of
existing URM structures. Six wall specimens, each approximately 8 ft wide and 10
ft tall, will be tested. Two different height to thickness ratios (h/t = 14 and
28) constructed of one or two wythes of bricks will be examined. Composite
fabrics epoxied to the wall will either fully cover both faces of the wall, or
will be applied as vertical strips spaced apart and staggered on the opposite
faces of the wall. Test results will be used to develop design guidelines for
retrofitting of URM structures. The proposed research will be closely
coordinated with a parallel research investigating the in-plane cyclic behavior
of fiber reinforced URM wall at the University of Michigan. ***
