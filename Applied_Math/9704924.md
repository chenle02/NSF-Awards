9704924 Pego Nonlinearity helps to create wave phenomena in a variety of
important systems of partial differential equations that arise in science and
engineering. The focus of the proposed research is on developing and improving
methods for analyzing the stability of waves in several systems of physical
interest. These include 1) Solitary waves in nonlinear dispersive media,
including lattice dynamics and water waves; 2) A recently discovered class of
localized nonradial solutions of nonlinear Schrodinger equations in 2+1
dimensions; and 3) Internal waves in fluids near the liquid-vapor critical
point. The methods under development involve improving the use of: a) Evans
functions to analyze eigenvalue problems in two dimensions with symmetries; b)
singular perturbation theory for resolvent operators, to study how stability
results for integrable systems persist in nonintegrable systems for lattice
dynamics and water waves; c) infinite-dimensional center manifold theory in ill-
posed systems, to study the existence of traveling water waves in three
dimensions; d) zero-Mach-number asymptotic analysis of low-velocity flows, to
study hydrodynamic phenomena near the critical point, specifically: damping
rates of internal waves about a strongly stratified equilibrium, and possible
capillary effects in one-phase flows of near-critical fluids. The general goal
of the first part of this research is to understand how "robust" are nonlinear
wave phenomena. Nonlinear waves in rare, so-called "integrable" systems can be
very well understood due to what seems miraculous -- they can be solved in
closed form. But most realistic systems are not integrable, so one needs to know
what phenomena depend on integrability and what do not. An important
infrastructural technology where nonlinear waves are important and are not
completely understood is long-distance communication via optical fiber. The
second part of the work was motivated by physics experiments carried out on the
spa ce shuttle; also, the use of supercritical fluids in materials processing is
extensive and growing. The behavior of flows of such fluids near the critical
point is unusual and little understood, and this has led to costly failures in
experimental design in the past. Fundamental investigations are needed to build
the knowledge base about such flows that can serve as the foundation for the
development of applications.
