We will apply the 11129 I system to the study of the origin and migration
history of brines in the Louisiana Gulf Coast Basin. This basin consists of a
sequence of sedimentary layers ranging in age from Jurassic to recent.
Generally, there exist three different flow regimes in this basin, a shallow
fresh-water system, and two deeper systems, one hydropressured, one
geopressured, which are characterized by fluids with higher concentrations of
solutes. Although the depositional sequence of the sedimentary formations in
this basin is well undeerstood, the relation of the brines to their host
formations is often not clear. The geochemical characteristics of iodine
combined with the half-life of 129 I (15.7 Ma) make this isotope system
potentially useful for the determination of source ages for fluids and orgainic
material in this basin and, in conjunction with determination of 36 Cl, for the
estimate of residence times of waters in their respective host formaiton. The
results of this study will give information on the age relation between the
fluids and their host rocks, on the relation between fluids in the different
parts of the basin and on communication between different reservoirs. Because
the presence of iodine is related to that of organic material the result will
given information on the origin and the age relation of hydrocarbons in this
basin. Since this project represents the first time that this isotope system is
to be used on a regional scale in a sedimentary basin, the study will also
indicate to what extent the 129 I system is useful for the investigation of
fluid movement in basins containing organic material. This has very strong
implication for understanding basin evolution, oil accomulation and formation of
sedimentary ores.//
