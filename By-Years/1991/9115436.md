Study of the evolution of major early Paleocene planktonic forminiferal
lineages from Danian eoglobigerinids is poorly understood. This study will trace
the skeletal evolution and reconstruct phylogenies using cladistic methods.
Stable-isotopic data will provide information about depth habitat and lead to an
understanding of the relationship of morphology to ecology.
