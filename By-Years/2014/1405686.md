This award supports travel for participants in the semi-annual Wasatch Topology
Conference series, held in the winter and summer in the years 2014-2016 at Park
City, Utah and Salt Lake City, Utah. The Wasatch Topology conference is focused
on topology and geometry, including interactions with ergodic theory and
dynamical systems. Each conference presents the work of eight speakers to an
audience of primarily local research mathematicians and graduate students. Funds
from this award also support the participation of non-local
mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wasatch Topology Conference allows
mathematicians from around the United States the opportunity to gather and share
their results with a larger audience of experts and junior researchers. Research
opportunities will be created through interactions among the conference
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current website for the Wasatch Topology
Conference is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.utah.edu/wtc/
