ABSTRACT 0325653 Paul Barford U of Wisconsin Madison

This project addresses the longstanding and difficult problem of detecting and
classifying spatially distributed network anomalies from multiple monitoring
sites. To characterize baseline vs. anomalous behavior of the Internet requires
deployment of collaborative data collection, anomaly detection and pattern
recognition for complex largescale systems. The project combines the forces of
leading researchers in three complementary disciplines: (i) networking and data
collection; (ii) statistical data analysis and signal processing; (iii)
decentralized decision-making. The research goes well beyond the state-of-the
art anomaly detection for centrally administered networks. In particular tools
and practical data sharing algorithms are being developed for detecting
coordinated intrusions, distributed denial of service attacks, and quality-of-
service degradations in decentralized networks such as the Internet. The project
also includes activities with broader impact including: creation of a public
network anomaly database, K-12 educational outreach, and university-industry
collaborations. The research approach is based on a modular and distributed
monitoring paradigm that is organized into a three level hierarchy: local level
measurement of data from servers, routers and switches; intermediate level data
analysis and processing of end-to-end traffic measurements, summary statistics
and alarms transmitted from the local level; and upper level decision-making and
processing of information transmitted from the intermediate level. This modular
structure is scalable to large networks of monitoring sites. However, this
structure also imposes constraints on data analysis, which requires development
of new approaches. Three approaches are being pursued: distributed spatio-
temporal data analysis using wavelets over graphs; event detection and
classification using distributed pattern analysis and learning; and multi-site
event correlation using discrete event dynamical systems and decentralized
stochastic systems.
