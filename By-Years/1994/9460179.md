Hundreds of thousands of orthopedic implantations are performed each year in the
U.S., yet failure rates of these replacements remain significant. Second
generation cementless prostheses, the hopeful alternative to poly-
methylmethacrylate fixation, have not fulfilled their promise of long term
stability. The cause remains essentially the same: differential stress at the
bone-implant interface which impairs osteointegration and results in the
formation of particulate debris and the reactive formation of poorly defined and
mechanically unstable fibrous tissue. Lynntech, Inc., proposes to develop a
bioelectronic coating for porous prostheses which combines the osteoconductive
properties of a biological matrix with a piezoelectric polymer (polyvinylidene
difluoride) that has proven osteoinductive capability. It is anticipated that
this combination will not only lead to improved initial osteointegration of
implants, but that PVDF, being bioinert, will remain associated with newly
formed tissue at the bone-implant interface. Being permanently piezoelectric, it
may then provide the basis for response to changes in stress at this interface
by electrically stimulating further bone remodeling. The result would be a
prosthetic surface capable of active response to a dynamic environment, thus
decreasing failure rates.
