Representations of Graphs by Sets. This work will focus on p-intersection
equivalence and general representations of graphs. Randomized algorithm
techniques, algebraic graph theory and the probabilistic method will be applied
to solutions of problems in the focus area and provide a better understanding of
the relationship to computer science and other areas of mathematics.
