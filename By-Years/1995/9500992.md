The focus of this research is the development of new approaches to the
synthesis of phosphonopeptides that can be adapted to solid state synthesis for
application to combinatorial chemistry. The key building blocks will be
protected phosphorus(III) amino acids. Specific studies will include the
synthesis of model phosphonate and phosphonamidate dipeptides in solution using
dichlorotriphenylphosphorane for activiating the phosphorus(III) amino acids;
the evaluation of benzyl protection of phosphonates and phosphonamides;
applications of these methods to solid-phase synthesis of phosphonopeptides and
their thio derivatives; enantioselective synthesis of H-phosphinate amino acids;
ald measurement of enzyme inhibition for these newly synthesized compounds. With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities are supporting the research of Dr. Robert P. Hammer of the Department
of Chemistry at Louisiana State University. Professor Hammer will focus his work
on the development of new, general and high-yielding methods for the preparation
of phosphono-substituted peptides that can be applied to solid state procedures
for the production of combinatorial libraries. This approach will provide
thousands of compounds simultaneously which can be screened for a variety of
biological activities, such as protease inhibition.
