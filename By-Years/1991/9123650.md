It is a goal of our proposals to investigate the collisionless processes for
energy and momentum exchange in plasma via excitation and absorption of plasma
waves. Two different types of waves are to be considered: Alfven waves that
organize the momentum transfer between counterstreaming ion populations via
pitch angle scattering of resonant particles and lower hybrid waves that are
very effective in energy transfer from ion sources of free energy to plasma
electrons. For Alfven waves we are planning the solution of two following
problems: the excitation of strongly nonlinear Alfven waves in a form of
shocklets by counterstreaming ions, appearing in the solar wind in the upstream
region of planetary and cometary bow-shocks, and the cosmic ray transport by
galactic wind due to coupling between these two plasmas caused by Alfven waves.
For lower hybrid waves, excited by ion beams in a plasma, the nonlinear theory
is to be contructed describing the saturation of the lower hybrid instability by
nonlinear wave cascading and wave absorption by plasma electrons and ions. The
most important cascade mechanism that is to be under detailed analysis, is the
modulational instability and collaspe of lower hybrid waves. Finally, as the
possible example of collective interactions in collisional dominated plasma, the
formation of the weak electrostatic shock inside the cometary ionosphere would
be considered.
