NRI will conduct a research program on very high speed networks in cooperation
with industry, academia, national laboratories, and several major supercomputer
centers to explore alternative very high-speed architectures and to determine
how to utilize them most effectively. Three wide-area testbeds and two
metropolitan testbeds will be established to carry out experimental portions of
the program. Applications of very-high speed networks shall be used as vehicles
to explore network performance. These applications include distributed
computation, composite visualization, and interactive control of a distributed
computation and will be conducted on two of the wide-area testbeds. The
technical foci of these testbeds are supercomputer-network interfaces and
network integration, respectively. The primary focus of the third wide-area
testbed is on switching and network control. One of the metropolitan testbeds
focuses on interfacing workstations and supercomputers to a gigabit network and
developing software to make them work together. The other demonstrates
sequential use of distributed resources for interactive display and modification
of computer generated images.
