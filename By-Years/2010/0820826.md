Support for Young US Scientists Attending the 2008 International Accelerator
School for Linear Colliders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first International
Accelerator School for Linear Colliders was held May 19-27, 2006 in Sokendai,
Japan. The second one was October 1-10, 2007 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. Both
schools were very successful. These schools were jointly organized by the
International Linear Collider Global Design Effort (ILC GDE), the International
Collider Steering Committee (ILCSC), and the International Committee for Future
Accelerators (ICFA) Beam Dynamics Panel. These schools were generously sponsored
by major laboratories and funding agencies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. They
gave young people (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young
researchers) from all over the world the opportunity to learn about future high
energy physics projects, namely, the ILC and CLIC. The interest was enormous.
The first school received more than 500 applications and the second one about
250 applications. These applicants were competing for the 70 available spaces,
which were limited by the capacity of the school. Based on the successes of the
first two LC schools and demand from the world accelerator community, the ILC
GDE and ICFA decided to continue the school series and have a third one in 2008
in the U.S. It will take place October 19 to 29, 2008 at the Oak Brook Hills
Marriott Hotel near Chicago, Illinois. The school has an Organizing Committee
chaired by Barry Barish, Director of the ILC GDE, and a Curriculum Committee
chaired by Weiren Chou, Chair of the ICFA Beam Dynamics Panel. The number of
participants and format will be similar to the previous LC schools. This award
will provide partial support for the young scientists and students.
