The main research objective is to investigate the interaction between users and
computers in order to design more productive human-computer systems. To pursue
this goal several experimental studies are being performed. The first set
involve primarily theoretical issues in perceiving and processing computer-
displayed 3-D graphical images undergoing various image transformations. The
second set of studies focuses on determining the optimal number of machines in a
flexible manufacturing system (FMS) which can be effectively supervised by an
operator, and the optimum allocation of tasks between operators and computer
systems across FMS tasks. The third set of studies examine expert-novice problem
solving differences for tasks which require high levels of expertise (such as
programming).
