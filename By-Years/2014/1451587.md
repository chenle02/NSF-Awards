Every day, infants encounter an enormous amount of new information. Every new
object, person, or place introduces new sights, sounds, and experiences to
interpret, learn, and remember. Infants are remarkably good at learning new
information, especially when it occurs during interactions with parents or
caregivers. Many times each day, adults point out and name new objects in books
or in the environment, talk to infants about those objects, and describe how
objects are similar or different. Research has shown that this type of
interaction helps older children learn about the world around them. This project
is aimed at understanding the kind of support for learning (often referred to as
scaffolding) that parents provide for their infants, and how this scaffolding
actually helps infants learn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight- to fourteen-month-old
infants and their parents will engage in a picture-book reading task that
involves introducing two novel object categories. The instructional strategies
used by parents and the dynamics of these interactions will be analyzed. Infant
category learning will be subsequently tested using a paired-comparison novelty
preference paradigm. In a follow-up study, instructional strategies will be
experimentally manipulated to test predictions regarding optimal learning
conditions. Thus, this project will allow understanding of how parents'
strategies facilitate infants' learning of specific features of the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work not only provides insight into how infants
learn, but may also inform ways in which parents or caregivers can better
structure learning contexts for infants at risk for later problems. The results
of this work will be broadly disseminated, not only in the scientific community,
but also to parents and childcare professionals through social and traditional
media, lectures given to parenting groups, and participation in the Yolo County
Child Development Conference.
