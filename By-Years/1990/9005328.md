This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a multi-anvil, high-
pressure-temperature system to be installed and operated at the Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory of Columbia University. The acquisition and assembly of
the high-pressure system is being jointly supported by NSF (37%), DOE (37%) and
Columbia University (26%). The high-pressure apparatus is one of original design
by the PI on this award, and it will be capable of routine operation up to 250
kilobar and 2000C on several cubic millimeters of sample. The equipment will be
used primarily in investigations on the properties and behavior of planetary
interior materials at high- pressure and temperature.
