This instructional software package, called Populus, is designed to support
university courses in ecology and evolutionary biology, and has proven to be an
extremely successful pedagogical tool in several institutions, worldwide. The
goals of this project are to move research techniques into the classroom, using
computer simulations to reduce mathematics anxieties by providing concrete
demonstrations of dynamic behavior in a graphical and intuitively understandable
way, allowing students to "play" with a model by running different parameter
values until they understand the model's behavior. The PIs are expanding and
enhancing an earlier version of Populus, which currently consists of 30 major
models that span introductory to advanced topics in ecology and evolution. The
intention is to thoroughly convert the program using "object oriented"
programming techniques, which will lay the foundation for further development,
and to improve and add new simulations modules and make functional additions to
the program shell. They intend to build toward a product containing 50-60
modules.
