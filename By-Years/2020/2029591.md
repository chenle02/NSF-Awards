The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a COVID-19 diagnostic tool using
artificial intelligence. The proposed Cough Detector and Cough Classifier is
able to “listen” to sounds in a given environment, then detects and classifies
coughs. When a cough related to COVID-19 is identified, the individual and
relevant personnel in a potential germ circle can be immediately notified.
Functioning as an early warning system, the tool will work on a mobile device or
laptop, and can be embedded in other technology, such as infrared cameras with
microphones or other sound detection equipment. The tool will support ongoing
outbreaks and mitigation of social distancing considerations. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
utilize deep learning and transfer learning to develop a COVID-19 cough
classifier. The unique features of a COVID-19 cough require distinguishing
between characteristics of widened airway, narrowed airway, fluid filled air
sacs, airflow patterns of spirometry, stiff lungs, and others. The unique
characteristics or features are learned while classify cough types on a training
data set. A tuned deep learning model is able to distinguish COVID-19 cough from
other types of cough in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
