ABSTRACT: CMS-9726240, Philip Liu, Cornell U. The occurrence of a tsunami cannot
be accurately predicted; instead, it is necessary to focus on reducing the
damage through such measures as establishing Tsunami Warning Systems, and by
implementing sound coastal zone management policies. Modern geographical
information system (GIS) technology provides a powerful tool for managing the
data, for interfacing with external analysis programs, and for presenting the
results in the manner useful for disaster planning, hazard mitigation, and
rehabilitation strategy comparison. The objective of this research project is to
develop a preliminary tool to assist engineers and planners in tsunami hazard
mitigation by integrating GIS with the numerical models for tsunami propagation
and runup, thereby permitting engineers and planners to evaluate the data to be
used in the numerical model; to visualize the results from modeling exercises;
and to determine potential flooding areas, evacuation routes and the potential
damage to structures and utilities in the affected area. The project focuses on
establishing the framework of a GIS for tsunami hazard mitigation, using Hilo,
Hawaii as the specific site for the preliminary development.
