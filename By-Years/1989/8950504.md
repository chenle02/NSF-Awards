This project provides laboratory and field-oriented instructions in underground
mine blast design. This project significance lies in the fact that blasting is
the most common and cost-effective method of breaking hard rock in mining and
tunneling operations and during blasting dynamic stresses induced by the
detonations create cracks thereby resulting in instabilities in the remaining
rock. This project provides the students studying blasting techniques the
knowledge and skill to design and monitor blasts and recommend measures to
control blast damage. The major items of equipment include a signal processing
system and a borescope. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
