The work is in the field of submillimeter wave detectors. A multiple-layer
metal/insulator device of the form MBMBMBM is prepared. Because of the triple-
barrier configuration, two metal layers are isolated to form a dual quantum-well
structure. In theory, such multiple-quantum-well, or resonant tunneling devices
show prominent region of negative resistance phenomena, and fall short in terms
of both the expected magnitude and definition of negative resistance features.
To ameliorate this situation, efforts are underway to employ state-of-the-art,
thin-film deposition techniques to individually prepare and obtain optimal
characteristics of both metal and electron-barrier films; and to use
superconducting test studies of metal/barrier layers to assure the firmation of
high quality electron tunnel barriers.
