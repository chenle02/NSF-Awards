This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the
development of a catalyst to control NOx emissions from combined cycle power
plants using natural gas fired turbines (natural gas fired power plants). During
the Phase I effort, Guild Associates developed an environmental catalyst for the
control of NOx emissions using NH3. Operating in the presence of excess (about
20-33%) NH3, the catalyst was able to achieve greater than 95% NOx reduction
without NH3 slip. NH3 slip is avoided because the catalyst is able to
simultaneously reduce the excess NH3 to N2 and H2O. The objective of this
project is to modify the catalyst developed during the Phase I effort in order
to enhance its commercial viability. Enhancing the commercial viability will
involve increasing the reactivity of the catalyst and eliminating platinum
metals from the formulation. Enhancing the reactivity will allow the catalyst to
operate at higher space velocities. Eliminating platinum metals from the
formulation will greatly reduce the cost of the catalyst. Successful completion
of this effort will result in a simple, low cost technology for control of NOx
emissions from natural gas fired power plants without NH3
slip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Commercial Applications include the control
of NOx emissions from natural gas fired power plants. Other commercial
applications include controlling NOx emissions from semiconductor manufacturing,
fine and specialty chemical manufacturing and nitric acid manufacturing
processes.
