The principal investigator will study the asymptotic stationary behavior of
stochastic systems that are approximated by diffusions. His investigations will
center on stochastic systems arising from population genetics. He will use a
large deviation approach to advance the understanding of certain finite-
dimension problems motivated by recombination effects between two or more
genetic loci. He will also study the recurrent or non-recurrent behavior of
basic infinite- dimensional processes that model the migrations of genetic
populations.
