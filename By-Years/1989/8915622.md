The objective of the research is to resolve several major problems related to
the active tectonics of the Philippine Sea Plate and its boundaries,
specifically, the following topics: (1) determination of accurate Philippine Sea
- Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea-Pacific poles and rotation rates; (2) the
magnitude of plate driving forces at trench boundaries; (3) the mechanism of
back-arc spreading; (4) the mechanism of strike-slip in the forearc; (5) the
mechanics of arc-continent collision; and (6) the distribution of deformation
and seismic hazard in southeast Japan. The procedure is to collect and analyze
GPS measurements as sites strategically placed along the eastern, western and
northern boundaries of the Philippine Sea Plate in southeast Japan, and in the
Bonins, Marianas and Micronesia. The information provided by the GPS
measurements will test hypotheses that have been proposed to explain a variety
of tectonic processes, prime examples of which are found in the Philippine Sea
Plate and its boundaries. These results will be integrated with those from
ongoing seismic and tectonic investigations of the area.
