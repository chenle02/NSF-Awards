The primary area of research supported by this award is partial differential
equations, especially those used to model wave phenomena. Work includes the
investigation of smoothing properties for a large class of linear and nonlinear
dispersive evolution equations. Dispersive waves are characterized by the
property that the group velocity depends in a nontrivial way on the wave number.
An example would be Korteweg deVries equation. The smoothing phenomenon refers
to the observed behavior of solutions of certain equations - they are smoother
than their initial conditions. The approach to this work is the use of the
commutator method together with scattering theory. One needs microlocal versions
of Sobolev weighted norms to replace the standard norms which do not persist
with time. Other research directions include regularized determinants: the study
of variational formulas for the regularized determinants of elliptic operators
on Riemannian manifolds of dimension two; global aspects of completely
integrable Hamiltonian systems and the Schrodinger operator on tori and
Heisenberg manifolds. Partial differential equations form the backbone of
mathematical modeling in the physical sciences. Phenomena which involve
continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials and energy are known to
obey certain general laws which are expressible in terms of the interactions and
relationships between partial derivatives. The key role of mathematics is not to
state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative and quantitative
meaning from them and validate methods for expressing solutions.
