This project is concerned with the study of properties of solutions of systems
of nonlinear algebraic equations in many variables. A major open problem in this
field is to determine when these solution spaces can be parametrized by
independent variables; it can be done for linear or quadratic equations, but is
already unknown in degree three. Such algebraic questions have wide-ranging
applications, e.g., in data science, optimization, or robotics. Translating this
problem into geometry, by focusing on geometric invariants of shapes defined by
the systems of equations, opens the door to a plethora of more intuitive
techniques: the study of small deformations, or limit shapes. The project also
provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the research project is to
understand this parametrization property in dimensions 2 and 3, i.e., to study
rationality and stable rationality of Del Pezzo surfaces and Fano threefolds
over nonclosed fields. Among concrete problems to be addressed are: Obstructions
to rationality and stable rationality, such as unramified cohomology, integral
decomposition of the diagonal, and Burnside groups; Variation of rationality in
families of algebraic varieties, and specialization; Invariants in equivariant
birational geometry, in particular, the equivariant Burnside group, as well as
its applications to the study of the Cremona group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
