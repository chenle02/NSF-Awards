ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0327252&lt;br/&gt;Edmund Clarke&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie-Mellon
U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that there is both a need and an opportunity
to bring together important problems in software&lt;br/&gt;development praxis
with the theoretical advances that promise solutions. After consultation with
the US National Science Foundation, the Chinese National Science Foundation, and
the European Commission IST program, we propose to form an International Working
Group in order identify such problems and related theoretical advances, and
bring together the appropriate practitioners and scientists in a series of
workshops. The outcome of a workshop may be the recognition of a gap in the
theoretical foundations; filling that gap would then become an item in the
research agenda. A different outcome may be the recognition that applicable
theory is available but needs to be packaged for practical use. For example, the
theory may be used as the foundation of a systematic method that can be applied
in normal design; this work would become an item of an agenda for development
rather than for research.
