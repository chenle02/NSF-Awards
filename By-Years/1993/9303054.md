This award will support two postdoctoral associates and a few short-term
visitors and workshops at the Center for Nonlinear Analysis. The Center's
scientific activities emphasize mathematical research in materials sciences and
various aspects of continuum mechanics, phase transitions, composite materials
and microstructures and magnetoscrictive materials. %%% The Center's activities
are central to the Advanced Materials Processing Program initiative. This award
supplements the Center's major funding provided by the Army Research Office.
