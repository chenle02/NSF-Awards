This award provides funds for the establishment of a shared instrument facility
for studies of the systematics of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. The
equipment permits automated analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA content,
chromosome structure, anatomical variation, and of electrophoretic variation in
individual proteins. The equipment to be purchased consists of a flow
cytometer/cell sorter, digital imaging system for computer enhanced karyotype
analysis, and an image analysis system for morphometric analysis. Studies of
organismal variation play a crucial role in our understanding of the
evolutionary relationships of organisms and of the role of genetic and
developmental variation in the adaptation of organisms to their environment and
in their ability to compete with each other. By their nature, such studies
demand statistically meaningful data obtained by repetitive and often tedious
analysis of many individuals. The development of advanced imaging systems and
other equipment capable of measuring variation at the organismal, cellular and
subcellular level has substantially improved the ease and accuracy of
measurement of variation between individuals, and between closely related
species.
