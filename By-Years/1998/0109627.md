This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show the
efficacy of using small hollow glass microspheres, "Plasma-spheres", as
cellular-size gas containers for plasma display panels. Current plasma panel
technology utilizes an "open" plasma system, which captures ionizable gas
between two glass panels. This system is difficult to fabricate. Production
costs are high due to time consuming gas processing techniques presently in use.
If successful, the new system is expected to decrease the gas processing time
significantly, thereby lowering costs, and it will allow the production of
flexible plasma panels. Phase I will fabricate and gas fill the microspheres,
construct prototype, monochrome Plasma-sphere panels, and compare their critical
characteristics, such as efficiency, brightness, life, operating voltage
requirements, with those achieved with a standard monochrome plasma
panel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful replacement of extant open plasma systems
with plasma-sphere systems can reduce costs sufficiently to make high definition
television available to the home consumer market. Plasma-spheres may also extend
plasma panel use to low pressure environments, e.g., high altitude and space
applications, and to high-pressure environments, e.g., undersea applications.
The possibility of an open flexible plastic substrate can lead to various
aerospace, military, and consumer applications.&lt;br/&gt;
