9801395 Buhler This award supports a five-day international conference on
algorithmic number theory to be held at Reed College in June 1998. This is the
third conference in the Algorithmic Number Theory Symposia (ANTS) series. The
ANTS conferences were organized to encourage not only the usual kind of number-
crunching associated with number theory, but also some of the newer aspects,
including algebraic number theory and geometry, applications to other fields
such as cryptography, and theoretical investigations of computational
complexity. Twenty years ago many of these ideas would have seemed very foreign
to number theorists, but their increasing importance has led to a widely
perceived need for a conference devoted entirely to algorithmic concerns, both
practical and theoretical. This conference falls into the general mathematical
field of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of
the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,
cryptography, and communication systems.
