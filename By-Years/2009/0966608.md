With support from this International Research Experience for Students (IRES)
grant, engineering students from California Polytechnic State University will
travel to Malta and Italy to collaborate with Maltese archaeologists to
investigate previously unexplored underwater archaeological sites, including the
mapping of coastal shipwrecks and ancient cisterns located beneath fortresses,
private homes, and churches. Using sonar-equipped Remotely Operated Vehicles
(ROV), students will develop (1) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms to construct 3D maps, and (2) new 3D visualization techniques for
underwater robotics applications. In parallel with the research activities,
students will participate in a Global Engineering course that explores the
historical, archaeological and cultural aspects of research, education and
collaboration through multiple national contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research activities bring together an international team of archaeologists,
robotics and visualization experts and has a range of broader impacts. For
example, by systematically surveying cisterns, investigators are better able to
understand the development of Malta's ancient water storage systems and
subsequently inform current water management strategy and policy. The robotics
and visualization technology developed will also be relevant to applications in
oceanography, biology, homeland security and defense. Throughout the project,
student investigators will communicate their results to multiple audiences,
including bilingual English and Spanish students at Pacheco Elementary School in
San Luis Obispo, CA.
