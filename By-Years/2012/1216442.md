This award will support a bilateral international workshop between U.S. and
Japanese scientists. The workshop is being driven by the Fukushima nuclear power
plant accident that was caused by the massive earthquake and subsequent Tsunami.
The primary focus of the workshop is to bring together researchers in both the
U.S. and Japan to define the research needed to better understand how to
ascertain the quantity of released radioactive material. This is a problem that
requires fundamental scientific understanding of a variety of physical processes
and it also has substantial practical value for not only the Fukushima incident,
but for any that may occur in the future.
