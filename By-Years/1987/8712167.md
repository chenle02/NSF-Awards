The engineering profession is rapidly changing in both technical content and in
the methods used to solve problems. As a result, experienced engineers are
having difficulty in keeping abreast of the needs of their activities and are
less productive than they should be. This grant provides support for the
initiation of a program that will contribute to the problem of lifetime learning
for engineering professionals.
