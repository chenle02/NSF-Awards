Over the past 30 years researchers have become aware of long-term declines in
amphibian populations, often starting earlier in this century. Over this same
time period, humans have dramatically increased the amount of mineralized
nitrogen (N) across the planet. In the Midwest and other areas of similar
latitude, early breeding amphibians enter breeding ponds in spring often before
ice has completely melted. At this time snowmelt and early rains flush mineral N
into surface waters, but there is very little biological uptake. Hence,
amphibian embryos and young larvae are exposed to elevated concentrations of N.
Preliminary evidence suggests that amphibian embryos and larvae are susceptible
to mineral N at concentrations found in the environment, concentrations well
below those considered safe for human consumption. In this study I will address
the following research questions: 1) does exposure to elevated concentrations of
mineral N as embryos and larvae in the laboratory decrease hatching and
survival, and increase the time to metamorphosis and deformities in the wood
frog and eastern tiger salamander, and 2) do experimentally increased
concentrations of mineral N in the field decrease egg hatching, larval survival
and development, and increase the frequency of deformities when amphibians are
protected from predation. I expect to demonstrate that nitrogen can
detrimentally affect amphibian embryos and larvae under realistic conditions and
at realistic concentrations. I also expect that this research will show that
exposure to mineralized nitrogen as embryos can have very large negative
implications for the amphibians once they develop into larvae. My results will
potentially provide major insights into the effects of mineral N on amphibian
populations and freshwater ecosystems; thus, revealing a previously unrecognized
factor in the declines of some &lt;br/&gt;amphibian populations.&lt;br/&gt;
