The PI and his collaborators have shown that the method of factorizing the
operator exp[-dt(T+V)] to fourth order with purely positive coefficients, which
has produced superior symplectic integrators for solving classical dynamical
problems, has also yielded excellent numerical algorithms for solving the time-
dependent Schroedinger equation, the Fokker-Plank equation, the Kramers
equation, and the imaginary time Schroedinger equation. The latter has resulted
in a number of new fourth order Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. These new
algorithms require knowing the potential and the gradient of the potential. The
fourth order error coefficients of these new algorithms are orders of magnitude
smaller then those of the existing split operator (second-order) method and can
produce converged results using time steps 10-50 times as large. This operator
factorization approach suggests a new class of more efficient algorithms for
solving diverse quantum many-body and dynamical problems in nuclear, condensed
matter and atomic physics. This proposal seeks to develop further fourth order
algorithms for solving large scale, grid based, Hartree-Fock, Kohn-Sham and
Gross-Pitaevskii equations in arbitrary three-dimensional geometry.
