A protein chemistry laboratory will be enhanced by the acquisition of a
microbore HPLC; the laboratory also has a amino acid analyzer and an amino acid
sequencer. The projects to be supported by the new instrumentation include
protein crosslinking by glucose and free radicals, the active site environment
of thymidylate synthase, proteins involved in nuclear DNA condensation during
spermatogenesis, the role of selenium in biomolecules, the molecular basis for
human complement protein interactions, and the proteins involved in electron
transport in photosynthetic bacteria. The university will provide salary support
as well as capital cost sharing toward the establishment of the protein
chemistry laboratory.
