Abstract Narrative The doctoral student supported by this dissertation award
will conduct a field study of the areas covered by the Tioga/Hilgard glaciers in
the Sierra Nevada of California. He will use air photos, maps, analysis of
glacial deposits, and coring of selected lakes and meadows to reconstruct the
surface forms of the glaciers at different times during their retreat in the
late Pleistocene. The purpose of the research is to determine more precisely
when the region was deglaciated and to infer from that information and other
field observations what climatic conditions existed at the time of deglaciation.
The methods that will be used in this project are innovative and the research
will fill a large gap in our knowledge of late-Pleistocene environments in the
western United States. More generally, the project will contribute to our
understanding of midlatitude alpine glacier dynamics during warming periods.
