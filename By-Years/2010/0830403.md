Roberto&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Collaborative Research: Algorithms for Graphs on
Surfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses
fundamental questions on geometric and spatial aspects of graphs and networks,
with applications to road networks, sensor networks, computer networks, and
social networks. In particular, methods will be developed for constructing
effective geometric layouts of networks on surfaces and in three-dimensional
space and for analyzing properties of networks by exploiting their geometric
structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the project is the design and
analysis of algorithms for graphs on surfaces in the following three thrust
areas: (1) algorithms for embedding graphs on surfaces, including methods for
greedy embeddings of graphs to facilitate geometric routing, algorithms for
manifold triangulation for a set of points sampled from an embedded surface, and
techniques for drawing trees in the plane; (2) algorithms for graphs embedded on
surfaces, including the study of connections between partial cubes and integer
lattices, the development of algorithms for graphs embedded in non-Euclidean
spaces, and the design of methods for solving graph problems on quadrilateral
meshes; (3) applications of algorithms for graphs on surfaces, including
applications of geometric graphs to computer security and algorithms for road
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
