This is a RAPID to study Massive Open Online Courses as to how and in what
context learning best occurs. This is a collaboration between MIT and Harvard on
their edX initiative. The course studied is the MIT Circuits course "Circuits
and Electronics" first offered in the Spring of 2012 as a MOOC. Data was
collected from the 154,763 students enrolled in the course and this award will
fund analyses of that data and additional data on students that needs to be
collected quickly before too much attrition takes place. Additionally, the
learning outcomes and experiences of students in the classroom version of the
course will be compared to the outcomes and experiences of students in the MOOC
to best determine both the effectiveness of MOOCs and the contexts in which
MOOCs work well.

MOOCs are a recent phenomenon and MOOCs have not been studied as to their
effectiveness in a learning environment. This study will answer many such
questions and provide guidance for improvement in MOOCs and in their deployment.
