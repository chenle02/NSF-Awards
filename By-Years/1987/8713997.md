Nitrogen is generally believed to be the most limiting nutrient in marine
environments. Several indirect lines of evidence indicate that the many tropical
symbiotic cnidarians (corals, jellyfish and the like) may be limited by
nitrogen, not energy. The proposed studies will quantify uptake and
intracellular transport of different sources of nitrogen to analyze nutrient
limitation. This award will be a Career Advancement Award in the Research
Opportunities for Women program. The focus on nutrient physiology and dynamics,
and the use of the modern technologies of isotope analysis and high performance
liquid chromatography will constitute new areas of research for Dr. Kremer.
