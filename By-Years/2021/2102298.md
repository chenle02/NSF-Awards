Professor Michael Mirkin of CUNY, Queens College, is supported by the Chemical
Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Division of Chemistry
to visualize and quantitatively measure electrochemical surface reactivity with
a high spatial resolution, detect and analyze single biological and artificial
vesicles. The unifying theme of this project is the development of new
methodology for mechanistic studies of electrochemical reactions based on unique
capabilities of carbon nano-electrodes. They are employed for quantitative
nanoscale studies of several important chemical and biological systems. The
broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from an
improved understanding of electrochemical processes on the nanoscale that can
facilitate the progress in sensors, energy storage, and other technological and
biomedical systems. The students involved in this project are getting
multidisciplinary research training in interfacial electrochemistry,
bioanalytical chemistry, and nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon
nanoelectrodes will be chemically modified and used as scanning electrochemical
microscopy (SECM) tips to investigate electrocatalytic processes, such as
hydrogen evolution and hydrogen peroxide production via two-electron oxygen
reduction reaction that cannot be measured at bare metal nano-electrodes.
Another way to probe local heterogeneous reactivity is by measuring electron
tunneling current between the carbon nano-electrode and a nanometer-sized
electroactive object, such as a two-dimensional catalytic nanoflake. Carbon
nanocavities are to be employed for mechanistic studies of processes involving
single vesicles by recently introduced electrochemical resistive-pulse
technique. The goal is to identify a specific nano-object as the source of an
electrochemical signal and then analyze its contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
