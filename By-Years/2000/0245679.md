The neutron interferometer is a device that uses the quantum mechanical (QM)
wave-like properties of free neutrons to measure certain properties of nature
very precisely. It functions much like an optical interferometer, except that it
detects the interference of neutron "waves" rather than light waves. A slow
neutron (speed less than about 2000 m/s) has an associated QM wavelength
comparable in size to the spacing of atoms in a solid, so it interacts with
matter coherently, i.e. like a wave rather than a particle.

When a slow neutron enters the interferometer, its QM wave is diffracted in a
perfect silicon crystal and splits into two sub-waves, each taking a different
path. These two sub-waves then strike a second silicon crystal and are
diffracted again, into four sub-waves, all still associated with the original
single neutron. Two of these four sub-waves meet again in a third silicon
crystal and can interfere with each other. The degree of interference determines
the probability of detecting the neutron in a neutron detector placed behind the
interferometer. We can place a piece of matter, a magnetic or electric field, or
even a gravitational field inside the interferometer to shift the phase of one
sub-wave relative to another and change this interference. By noting the
resulting change in the neutron detection rate we precisely measure the amount
of phase shift. This gives important and often unique information about the
strength and nature of the neutron's interaction in the material or field.

In one experiment, we single out the neutron phase shift caused by its
interactions with electrons in a silicon crystal. Overall the neutron is
electrically neutral, but it does feel a force from charged particles such as
electrons because of its magnetic moment, and because it contains charged
quarks. Our measurement will lead to a much better understanding of the internal
charge distribution in the neutron. In another experiment, we precisely measure
the phase shift due to the neutron's interaction with He-3, a rare light isotope
of helium, and how it changes when the neutron's spin direction is made the same
or opposite to the spin direction of the He-3 nuclei. This will provide
important details about the nature of the force between neutrons and protons
inside atomic nuclei. A third experiment measures the neutron's phase shift in
the Earth's gravitational field using a special neutron interferometer that
floats in a zinc bromide solution. We will try to resolve a long-standing
discrepancy between past neutron experiments of this type and Einstein's Weak
Equivalence Principle, which states that a particle's gravitational and inertial
masses are equal.
