This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will further
develop a core facility for molecular biology. Investigators using the facility
will perform research on bacterial, protozoan, and mammalian systems at the
cellular and molecular level. Key research instruments needed by thise
researchers are those that determine gene and protein structure and function
including a peptide/protein sequencer. Researchers will gain the capacity to
sequence purified proteins and make synthetic peptides or oligonucleotides for
identification of specific genes. The installation of a molecular biology core
facility will strengthen the research capability of a predominanty minority
institution. The principal investigators are well-trained and have published
widely in refereed journals. Faculty and students involved in this project will
have their research skills sharpened and they become involved in various
recombinant and molecular biology techniques and procedures.
