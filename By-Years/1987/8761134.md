The objective of this project is to design a solid-state instrument which uses
non-contact sensing to sample and record stage. Stage is the height, in feet, of
the surface of the water above an arbitrary datum. This measurement is of prime
importance in estimating stream discharge and level of groundwater in bodies of
surface water and in monitoring wells.
