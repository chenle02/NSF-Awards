This award to the National Academy of Sciences will provide partial support for
the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA). NASA will fund the remainder
of the cost of maintaining this committee. The overall objective of the CAA is
to encourage scientific progress in astronomy and astrophysics and to assist the
federal government in planning programs in these fields. The CAA will build on
the current decadal survey of the field, "New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy
and Astrophysics," (NWNH) and monitor the progress of its recommended priorities
for the most important scientific and technical activities. Among the mechanisms
the CAA will use to fulfill its charge are the initiation and oversight of
report-generating studies, meetings, teleconferences, discussions with agency
representatives and the scientific community, and special fora such as
workshops.
