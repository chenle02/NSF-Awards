In this project, the P.I. will apply available numerical models of the Indian
and Pacific Oceans, recent "gappy" boundary layer theory, and available wind,
pressure, and sea level data to understanding the dynamics of ENSO (El
Nino/Southern Oscillation), particularly in the region of the "gappy" western
boundary. In particular, the P.I. will attempt to establish whether or not there
is a link between reflection of waves from the western Pacific boundary and
subsequent anomalies at the equator.
