With National Science Foundation support, Dr. David A. Peterson will conduct
linguistic research in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh with the goal of
providing high-quality documentation materials for as many indigenous languages
spoken in the region as possible. Most of the indigenous languages in question
belong to the Tibeto-Burman family of languages; they are all under-described
and in several cases endangered. Building on materials already collected for
Khumi, an important Kuki-Chin language, Dr. Peterson will produce a reference
grammar, dictionary, and collection of texts. He will then turn his attention to
the documentation of Mru, a virtually undescribed language whose position in the
Tibeto-Burman family is not yet firmly established. The project will provide
data which will advance comparative linguistic studies for this language family.

The project also includes research training for Bangladeshi fieldworkers and
students at Dartmouth College. Dr. Peterson will teach workshops at the
University of Dhaka for advanced undergraduate and graduate students on
conducting fieldwork in the Hill Tracts, and direct year-long research programs
on other indigenous languages for Bangladeshi fieldworkers. Speakers of Khumi
and Mru will be brought to the U.S. to work with the PI during the academic year
and to serve as consultants in field methods courses at Dartmouth College.
Through the workshops and the funding of Bangladeshi fieldworkers, the project
aims to initiate a tradition of field research among indigenous communities in
Bangladesh.
