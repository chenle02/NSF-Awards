This project involves the use of surgery theory to study symmetries of
manifolds, with emphasis on finite groups of symmetries of the sphere. The
project includes four parts. The first part studies the role of the rational
numbers in geometric topology and surgery theory, and in particular aims at the
determination of the rational homotopy types of manifolds with finite
fundamental group. The second part involves a mix of knot theory and high-
dimensional techniques, and this mix could lead to an interesting synthesis. The
third part examines connections between group actions and numerical invariants
in L-theory, which in turn leads to number theory. Finally the last part is
algebraic considerations in L-theory and Galois cohomology. Such interactions
between algebra and topology have been quite fruitful in the past.
