Chlorosomes are light-harvesting structures attached to the inner surface of the
cytoplasmic membrane in green photosynthetic bacteria. The polypeptide
composition of Chloroflexus chlorosomes consists of three major protein
components and a fourth minor polypeptide. Functional roles for all four
proteins have been tentatively assigned. This project is aimed at determining
the role played by these proteins during the development of the photosynthetic
apparatus. Recombinant genetic techniques are being used to isolate the genes
for two major proteins components of the chlorosome. The gene for one chlorosome
protein (Mr 5700) has already been cloned: it contains a coding region for a
carboxyl-terminal extension that is not present on the mature protein and which
may be important for targetting the protein to the appropriate assembly site
within the chlorosome. This investigation deals in detail with the genetic
structure, organization and regulation of genes encoding chlorosome proteins.
The green and purple photosynthetic bacteria possess a simpler type of
photosynthesis than that occurring in higher plants. In these bacteria light is
harvested as an energy source to support the synthesis of sugars and other
organic components of the bacteria from atmospheric carbon dioxide, but oxygen
is not produced. Because of their relative simplicity these bacteria provide
useful model systems which are often more amenable to detailed analysis than are
higher- plant systems. Studies of bacteria have made major contributions to the
advancement of fundamental knowledge of photosynthesis. Dr. Fuller's
investigations provide essential information about the structure and function of
the biological compounds and complex cellular structures that are responsible
for the useful harvesting of sunlight by green bacteria.***//
