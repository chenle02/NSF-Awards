9501909 Fernandez This project is on research to exploit the detailed residue-
level structural information available from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to
examine proteins in non-native environments relevant to manufacturing. Proteins
will be examined in a variety of environments with the goal of developing a
general understanding of protein denaturation during precipitation. Changes in
conformation that occur in the solution state before aggregation/precipitation,
conformation changes that occur upon phase change, and the rates of these
changes will be examined with NMR. In addition to this research activity, the
investigator will enhance education by engaging in activities on curricular
development, laboratory development and mentoring. ****
