9401276 Gellman This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, applies the concepts of physical organic chemistry to the
study of surface reaction kinetics. The electronic structure of the transition
state of several surface reactions will be probed by fluorine substitution. The
substituent effect on such reactions as hydride elimination, deprotonation, and
alkyl coupling on copper surfaces will be explored using electron spectroscopic
and kinetic probes. Quantum chemical calculations will be carried out to compare
with the results of the kinetic and thermodynamic measurements which form the
bulk of the proposed work. This approach may be widely applicable to the study
of catalytic and electrochemical reaction chemistry. %%% An understanding of the
energetics of the transition state in surface chemical reactions would help to
design efficient catalytic systems. This research project, supported in the
Analytical and Suface Chemistry Program, addresses this question experimentally
and theoretically. By using proven methods of physical organic chemistry, the
substituent effect will be exploited to probe the transition state in a number
of important surface chemical reactions. ***
