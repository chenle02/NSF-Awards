The proposal deals with the interaction of photons, neutrinos and electron with
few-nucleon systems. One part deals with the properties of the axial vector
current and threshold pi-zero photoproduction. A second part focusses on
individual transition multiple amplitudes to get information on specific
components of few-nucleon wave functions and the nuclear current operator.
