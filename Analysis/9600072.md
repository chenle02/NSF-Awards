PI: Fefferman DMS-9540525 The PI will investigate analytic problems which arise
in differential geometry. One project is concerned with semilinear elliptic
equations on simply connected domains in Euclidean 4-space. The domain is viewed
as the universal cover of a complete conformally flat manifold. The second
project will be the study of coupled elliptic-parabolic equations. By coupling
an elliptic equation to Hamilton's Ricci flow, one can impose control on the
scalar curvature, so that if the scalar curvature is a negative to begin with,
then it remains so at least for short time. Partial differential equations form
a basis for mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of
mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide
qualitative and quantitative information about the solutions. This may include
answers to questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition,
analysis often develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on
the accuracy of these approximations.
