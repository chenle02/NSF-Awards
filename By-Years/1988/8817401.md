Cerium is the only rare earth element which exhibits a redox chemistry in the
marine water column. Understanding its geochemistry may provide important
insights into the role of redox processes in minor element transport. A
preliminary investigation of Ce redox chemistry indicates that it exhibits a
dynamic redox chemistry, with Ce(III) oxidation on oxide surfaces and
photoreduction of Ce(IV) in surface waters being potentially important processes
in its preferential removal and remobilization relative to the trivalent rare
earths under different conditions. Furthermore, Ce redox chemistry shows a close
similarity to that of manganese. Dr.Sholkovitz and Moffett propose to carry out
a detailed laboratory and field investigation of the redox chemistry of Ce in
seawater, to expand our basic knowledge of its natural water chemistry and
identify the processes important in its transport. The data will be used to
evaluate the usefulness of Ce anomaly data as a tracer of metal oxide mediated
transport and a geochemical analog of manganese.
