A pilot project has been designed to develop a component of student
participation in research for an introductory physics curriculum. The initial
test of this project will involve a partnership program between a university
physics department and a local community college. A summer session introductory
course will consist of morning introductory sessions and afternoon time in
various research laboratories. Graduate student mentors will assist students in
their choice of research area ans provide individual tutorials.
