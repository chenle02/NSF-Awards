9306265 Hale The thrust of this proposal is to continue to develop the theory of
infinite dimensional dissipative systems by the consideration of specific types
of problems. For example, in Partial Differential Equations, we study the
dependence of the flows upon parameters, concentrating on the boundary
conditions, diffusion coefficients, dissipation coefficients and the shape of
the domain. Comparison of flows defined by such equations will be restricted
mostly to the global attractors. For Functional Differential Equations, we will
be primarily interested in singular perturbation problems which relate the
solutions to the properties of maps defined by limit equations. Many physical
systems are modeled by partial differential equations defined on a bounded
domain. The study of the effects of the domain (its shape, etc.) on the dynamics
is of paramount importance. This is especially true if the geometric properties
ofl the domain act as a control variable, as, for example, those included under
lthe name lof optimal shape design, as well as others. Also, many domains are
small in some directions and it is advantageous to make a reduction to a lower
dimensional domain for design as well as computational purposes. The present
proposal addresses questions of this type. In lazer optics and models in ecology
and biology, one encounters singularly perturbed delay differential equations.
In such cases, the limit equation for the singularly perturbed parameter equal
to zero is mapping. We address in this proposal the relationships between the
dynamics of the delay equation and the dynamics of the map. ***
