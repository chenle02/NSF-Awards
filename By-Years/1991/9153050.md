The primary objective of this project is to make available to undergraduate
physics majors and other students the equipment necessary for fabricating
material samples by means of sputtering technology. The Department of Physics
and Astronomy at CSUS is presently revising its program to include more emphasis
on applied topics, especially in the areas of Solid State Physics and Optics.
The preparation of material samples and the subsequent characterization of their
electrical and optical properties is an important basic skill in any such
program. Students are being introduced to the theory and practice of sputtering
and then using the technology to fabricate and characterize samples with
interesting electrical and optical properties in several upper-division
courses.The physics department is in the final stages of modernizing and adding
elective concentrations in the BA and BS degree programs. These changes make the
programs more closely match the career goals of present-day students and
introduce subject matter into the curriculum of more relevance to the
semiconductor and optics industries that are moving into the Sacramento area in
ever greater numbers. Eventually the department expects that this will attract
more students to a physics major. The purchase of this sputtering equipment
makes it possible to offer students hands-on experience in a very important area
of solid state physics and optics which is of particular importance to those
pursuing an advanced degree or a job in experimental research or industrial
work.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
