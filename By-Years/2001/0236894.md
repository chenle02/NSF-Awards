This interagency transfer to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
supports publication of a workshop report, associated with the workshop held on
"Air Pollution and Climate Forcing" held April 29-May 3, 2002 in Honolulu,
Hawaii. The purpose of the workshop was to illuminate the role of air pollution
as a global climate forcing and to place climate-related impacts of air
pollution in the context of its other human health and environmental impacts.
The workshop itself was an interagency effort, held at the East-West Center of
the University of Hawaii, and sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
National Science Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the California Air
Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, the International Pacific
Research Center, and the East-West Center. Specifically, this transfer covers
the production of 500 copies of the report, "Air Pollution as a Climate Forcing:
A Workshop."
