This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. Janos H. Fendler of Syracuse
University and Dr. Alexander G. Petrov of the Laboratory of Liquid Crystals and
Molecular Electronics of Georgi Nadjakov University, Sofia, will examine
flexoelectricity in bilayer lipid membranes. The Bulgarian researchers have
found that periodic bending of a bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) results in
microvolt-range transmembrane potential. The Bulgarians have a theoretical
rationalization of the phenomenon and have examined it by electrical
measurements which included the direct determination of Uf and indirect
determination of c. The Americans have used optical interferometry to determine
ultrasmall, hydrostatic-pressure-induced movements of BLMs. In this proposal,
the researchers propose to: (1) use real-time stroboscopic interferometric
measurements to determine directly c in the periodically bent BLMs; (2)
determine simultaneously electrical and optical flexoelectric coefficients of
BLMs, to test theories of flexoelectricity; (3) investigate a variety of
structurally different BLMs; (4) study converse flexoelectric effect
(transmembrane voltage-induced membrane curvature) with interferometric
holography and optical interferometry; (5) establish a correspondence between
the direct flexoelectric effect (curvature-generated membrane polarization) and
the converse one on the same BLM preparation; (6) investigate changes of the
flexoelectric response of a photosensitive BLM under illumination to reveal a
new phenomenon, photoflexoelectricity; and (7) attempt to observe
photoflexoelectric phenomena by applying repetitive laser pulses to a pigmented
BLM. This project in biophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
