The current research in Bayesian model prediction and validation of computer
models mainly focuses on computer experiments with single output and fixed input
variables. The proposed research focuses on Bayesian approach for calibration,
validation, prediction, and experimental design of computer models with
functional output. Bayesian predictive models for calibrating computer models
based on functional computer outputs and physical observations will be
constructed. Methods and metrics for calibrating and validating computer models
will be developed. Experimental design and optimization strategies for data
collection will be established. Theoretical properties of the developed
methodologies will be investigated and assessed.

If successful, the research results will bridge the gap between statistical
researchers and engineering practitioners, and stimulate additional research
that improve effective and efficient utilization of expensive computer models
developed by scientists and engineers. There is an increasing demand for
accurate predictive models and metrics for calibrating and validating computer
models from model analysts and engineering designers. The proposed research will
allow scientists and engineers to effectively assess and evaluate expensive
computer models for various scientific and engineering applications, including
IC packaging and fabrication, chemical and nuclear energy equipment development,
cellular material design and manufacturing, nano material design and
manufacturing, etc. The major impact of the proposed research is to improve the
effectiveness of computer model developers (model analysts) and users
(scientists and engineering designers) in scientific understanding as well as in
design and manufacturing in various important scientific and engineering
applications.
