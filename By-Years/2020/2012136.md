This award provides support for students and post-doctoral associates to attend
the 6th Midwest Single Molecule Workshop being held in Omaha, Nebraska, August
of 2020. Single molecule biophysics techniques make it possible to observe the
transient interactions, multiple structural states, and dynamics of biological
molecules and their assemblies. The applications of single-molecule techniques
are rapidly expanding, and a constant exchange of ideas is essential to ensure
further developments. Topics to be covered at the workshop include direct
visualization of molecular dynamics with high-speed atomic force spectroscopy,
single molecule fluorescence, single molecule detection, and optical and
magnetic tweezers. The two-day meeting will include invited lectures, poster
presentations, short talks, and a keynote address â€“ all organized into thematic
sections focused on a specific single-molecule methodology. The meeting will
provide an essential professional development opportunity for young scientists
and expose undergraduate students to timely research topics. Abstracts of the
subjects covered will be compiled for a conference
booklet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
