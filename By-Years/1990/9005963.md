Professor Miller is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to
investigate the spectroscopy of various transient chemical species. Such
chemical intermediates as reactive atoms, free radicals, and molecular ions
often play critical roles in reactions in combustion, solvation, synthetic
processes, and the chemistry of the atmosphere. Spectroscopic identification and
characterization is important both for monitoring these intermediates and for
understanding their structures and interactions. Two facilities constructed
under prior NSF support are used in this work. One facility, dedicated to the
study of ionic clusters, uses laser-induced fluorescence to probe cluster
structure and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to determine the number of atoms.
The second apparatus prepares neutral radicals in a pulsed supersonic jet for
ultra-high resolution pulsed laser spectroscopy designed to reveal details of
rotational structure. Species under investigation range from small polyatomics
to multi-ring aromatic radicals and include clusters containing ions or open-
shell radicals.
