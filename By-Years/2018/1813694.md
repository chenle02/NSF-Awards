Cosmological observations over the last few decades have provided us with a
standard model of cosmology, where the six parameters that describe the data are
constrained with percent-level accuracy. However, fundamental questions in our
understanding of the universe remain unanswered. This project will address the
following major puzzles in fundamental physics: (1) What is the physics that
seeded the first structures in the universe? (2) What is the nature of Dark
Matter and how is it related to particle physics? Dr. Dvorkin will continue to
collaborate with the Boston Area Girls STEM Collaborative in an effort to
improve gender imbalance in academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shape of
temperature fluctuations across the sky in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
can potentially contain important information regarding the hypothetical
earliest phase of the universe known as inflation. This project will develop
methods to analyze CMB data to help narrow down the shape of the inflation
potential. Possible dark matter particles lighter than hydrogen will also be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
