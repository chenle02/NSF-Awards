High density tactile sensor arrays based upon ultrasonic pulse- echo ranging
will be developed to cover curved surfaces of a dexterous robotic hand. An array
of transducers generate ultrasonic pulses which traverse an overlying elastomer
sheet and are reflected at its upper surface and return to the transducers. A
measurement of the time-of-flight corresponds to the thickness of the sheet.
When these sensors are used on a robot end effector to grasp an object, the
induced deformation of the sheet is indicated by a change in the time-of-flight.
This proposal addresses the problems associated with placing these sensors on
curved surfaces on the finger segments and hemispherical finger tips of a
dexterous robotic hand. High density arrays with elements 0.5-3 mm square
properly distributed on all surfaces will give a mechanical hand near
anthropomorphic touch sensing capability.
