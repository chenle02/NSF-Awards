This award will establish a Marine Genomics Center at the University of
Washington’s Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) by remodeling an underutilized lab
building, already equipped with a flow-through seawater system, into a wet lab
with dry procedure spaces containing the modern tools for molecular genomics –
tools for nanopore sequencing, amplification, purification, and quality
assurance. The new lab will attract new researchers, will allow established
researchers to expand their work at FHL, and will be used as a training center
for the next generation of biologists participating in FHL programs involving
genomics research. Having the lab configuration easily modified will also enable
its use for&lt;br/&gt;short-term training workshops with 15-20 participants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Center will contribute to research on understanding
the relationship between organismal genomes and phenomes. A lab with the
capacity for DNA barcoding, whole genome sequencing, real time PCR, and disease
detection will significantly expand on FHL’s existing strengths in bioimaging,
libraries of CT scans, apprenticeships, workshops, and undergraduate training
programs in phenomics research. An onsite molecular biology lab at FHL will
attract new principal investigators and graduate students and maintain its
relevance as a research institution. Investing in infrastructure for molecular
biology research at FHL will have broader impacts in human health and will help
communicate the connections between molecules, organismal morphology, and the
ocean. For more information about Friday Harbor Laboratories, see

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
