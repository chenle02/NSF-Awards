A laboratory is established to investigate programs in optical image processing
and optical computing. In optical image processing, new methods for defect
detection in materials such as semiconductor wafers and devices will be
examined. In the area of optical computing, the research will seek applications
to artificial intelligence and will investigate III-V materials for fast optical
switching.
