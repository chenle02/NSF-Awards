This project involves analysis of borehole temperature profiles, seeding
evidence of climatic change over the past two centuries. The investigation will
include (1) detailed analysis of borehole temperature logs in data archives; (2)
relogging of boreholes from which temperature profiles were acquired more than
25 years ago, and analysis of the quarter century of change observed; and (3) an
integration of results with similar research being conducted in eastern Canada
to enable a regional assessment of surface temperature trends.
