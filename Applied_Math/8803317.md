The goal of this project is to study the applications to continuum mechanics of
a mathematical tool developed by the principal investigator. This tool, called H
theory, is an outgrowth of homogenization theory, which was also developed
largely by the principal investigator. Particular areas to be studied include
effective properties of mixtures, non-local effects induced by homogenization,
long-time behavior of fluid interfaces, evolution of the microstructure of
composite materials and nonlinear vibrations of solids.
