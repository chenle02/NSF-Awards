This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop oral
vaccines for controlling white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)in marine shrimp using
transgenic algae. In recent years shrimp production on Latin American shrimp
farms has been reduced by up to 50 percent by WSSV outbreaks. Current
technologies for controlling WSSV have had limited effectiveness. This Phase I
Project will test the hypothesis that transgenic algae expressing WSSV capsid
proteins can function as ideal vaccine delivery vectors for nearly all life-
stages of shrimp. Larval shrimp feed on microalgae and adult shrimp consume
dried microalgae in their diet. Recent work by the investigators has
demonstrated that both live and freeze-dried microalgae expressing foreign
antigens can induce an antigen-specific immune response in fish. It is therefore
likely that microalgae can deliver functional antigens via oral delivery.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of shrimp farming.
