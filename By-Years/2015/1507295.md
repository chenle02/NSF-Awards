In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew Tarr of the University of New Orleans is
developing new methods to understand how oil spilled in ocean environments is
transformed by sunlight. Such methods help identify the chemicals formed when
crude oil is subjected to photochemical changes in the environment. The nature
and behavior of these products are important in oil spill remediation. The
project involves collaboration with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.
In addition, the project trains young scientists through direct involvement of
high school students, high school teachers, and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project identifies the types of compounds
formed when crude oil is exposed to sunlight and investigates structures of
photoproducts present in the gas phase, the aqueous phase, and the oil phase.
The project utilizes fractionation methods, chromatography, and derivatization
to assess the functional groups present in photoproducts. The study also
utilizes a wide range of analytical tools, including gas chromatography, liquid
chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (including GC-
MS, LC-MS, electrospray MS, and high resolution electrospray FTICR-MS) in order
to gain a complete picture of oil photochemistry. The results of this project
will be important for understanding the fate of spilled oil and improving
predictive models for oil spill remediation. Additional broader impacts include
training of future scientists and exposing teachers to environmental research.
