The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to foster
research and discussion of major policy issues by economists from academia and
various policy making organizations. Economists in universities are often
unfamiliar with the constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the
shaping of policy issues whereas economists in government are often less aware
of current research developments and their implications. The principal
objectives of the conference series are (i) to stimulate policy relevance in
theoretical and empirical research in economic science, (ii) to encourage
interchange of scientific ideas among analysts with different approaches, and
(iii) to generate greater understanding by academic economists of practitioners'
environments. The conferences are held semi-annually at Carnegie Mellon
University and the University of Rochester. About 50 participants plus faculty
and graduate students from the host institution are invited to each conference.
Participants from U.S. and foreign central banks and U.S. and international
agencies attend regularly, and special care is taken to involve promising young
scholars. The papers and formal discussions are edited and published so as to
broaden the impact of the conference.
