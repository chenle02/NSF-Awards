This award will support the planning and assessment of future continental
scientific drilling (CSD) opportunities for the Earth sciences community. As a
result of recent meetings (2011, 2012) of the Science Planning and Education and
Outreach Committees of DOSECC a plan was put into place to provide NSF with
broad community input concerning specific CSD science objectives in six broad
areas for which the Science Planning and Education and Outreach Committees
concluded that significant opportunities existed for CSD advances in the near
future:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Scientific Drilling and the Evolution of the
Earth System: Climate, Biota, Biogeochemistry, and Extreme Events.&lt;br/&gt;2)
Drilling, active tectonics and magmatism (volcanics, fault zones, Geoprisms,
post-SAFOD).&lt;br/&gt;3) Drilling into High-enthalpy Geothermal Systems: A
Collaborative Initiative to Promote Scientific Opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;4)
Drilling, sampling, and imaging the depths of the critical zone.&lt;br/&gt;5)
EarthCube GEO Domain Workshop: Cyberinfrastructure for
Paleogeoscience.&lt;br/&gt;6) Broadening the Scope of Education and Outreach to
Enhance the Scientific and Societal Impacts of Continental Scientific
Drilling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an on-campus IT support
analyst and an off-campus workshop coordinator who will both assist the
individual conveners with routine pre- and mid-workshop tasks and, most
importantly, will help assemble a combined workshop report that documents and
synthesizes the findings of all of these meetings, vis-Ã -vis the needs of the
continental scientific drilling community.
