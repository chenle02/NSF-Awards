The advent of powerful microcomputers and the development of Computer Algebra
Systems (CASs) has set mathematics on a revolutionary course, providing the
potential for one of the most important and beneficial changes in undergraduate
mathematics curricula in decades. Despite the importance of CASs, most
undergraduate mathematics teachers have little or no experience with computers
as a teaching tool. There is a need for "hands-on" introductions to CAS to
prepare teachers to use CASs in their classroom, and to seed new initiatives. A
number of Colleges, Colby among them, have been experimenting in the use of CASs
through the help of grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The project
director of the present program, in conjunction with an Advisory Group of
experts, will design and offer an intensive series of ten two-day workshops and
five extended five-day summer workshops. Using CAS as a teaching tool requires
restructuring the calculus curriculum in terms of both content and topic
emphasis. Thus, the primary result of this program will be curriculum
development. It is anticipated that out of this workshop series 200 teachers
will be introduced to CAS at a serious level; 125 will gain experience in
developing a calculus CAS curriculum and be prepared to use CASs in their
courses; 15-20 people will become experienced CAS workshop instructors and
consultants: 325 teachers will receive current CAS curriculum materials; 340
teachers will be involved in several hours of curriculum discussion and
development; and a network of several hundred CAS users will be established. The
project will plan and present the workshops at institutions around the country,
and it will significantly influence the further development and implementation
of a major reform in the teaching of mathematics. In addition to grant funds,
participants' institutions will provide an additional 30% in travel expenses.
