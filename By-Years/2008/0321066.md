This project, supporting various collaborative and integrated research projects
in networking, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, wireless communication,
molecular/cell biology, and molecular electronics, expands an existing 200-node
cluster to an 800-node cluster at LASCA (VaTech Laboratory for Advanced
Scientific Computing and Applications). The computational increase enables 8
projects:&lt;br/&gt; Advanced networking in massive parallel network
emulation,&lt;br/&gt; Cell cycle modeling, &lt;br/&gt; Multidisciplinary design
optimization,&lt;br/&gt; Microarray bioinformatics, &lt;br/&gt; Nanoscale
molecular electronics, &lt;br/&gt; Quantum mechanical descriptions of molecular
properties, &lt;br/&gt; Molecular modeling of proteins, &lt;br/&gt; Design and
analysis of wideband wireless communication system.&lt;br/&gt;The cluster serves
as the LASCA focal point for minority internship programs enabling team oriented
multidisciplinary graduate education. Moreover, new courses in networking and
high performance computing are under development.&lt;br/&gt;
