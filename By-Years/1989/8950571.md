This project will support the establishment of a microcomputer laboratory which
will be used to implement a revitalization program for basic mathematics courses
for science and engineering undergraduates. It is being funded under the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of
improving the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to
develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field
courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the project will
integrate high-level graphics calculators and microcomputers into courses in
calculus/differential equations and linear algebra. The laboratory will allow
the students to conduct exploratory sessions and will enable them to learn
mathematics in a manner not currently available with paper-and-pencil methods,
to witness the dynamic nature of mathematical processes, and to engage in
realistic applications.
