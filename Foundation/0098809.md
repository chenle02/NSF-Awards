One of the major quests of Kim's research project is to investigate stable
relations occurred in simple structures. Major problem is to know when the
simple structure has generic stable reduct. A generic stable reduct of a simple
structure is the definitional stable reduct preserving forking independence. If
a stable reduct of a simple structure is found, then every problem is reduced to
the stable context from the simple context. Hence then stationarity can be used,
which will resolve many open problems such as definable infinite group existence
in 1-based structures, and group configuration problems. Unlike the well-known
opposite process of constructing simple structures from stable structures,
questions on finding stable fragments in simple structures seem to be rather
difficult.

Over the last 3 to 4 decades, model theorists have worked on stable structures.
Kim's thesis in 1996 opened new research areas in model theory enlarging the
scope of study of stable structures. Namely he proved the fundamental notion of
independence in stable structures also exists in the wider class of structures,
called simple. After then the study of simple structures takes place one of the
major research area in model theory, and grows rapidly. Kim's continued work on
simple structures will deepen and strengthen the model theoretic understanding
of mathematical structures more.
