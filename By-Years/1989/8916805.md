Dr. Spangler at the University of Iowa will conduct a multifaceted research
program to study interstellar turbulence on relatively small scale sizes. The
program includes both radio wavelength observations and computational plasma
physics. The character of interstellar turbulence has implications for the
overall energy balance of the interstellar medium, since density fluctuations
will eventually be damped out as heat. Likewise the physical locations of the
turbulence, the nature of its origins, and the driving energy inputs for the
turbulence have implications for theories of cosmic ray acceleration and
propagation and for the dynamics of the interstellar magnetic field. Dr.
Spangler has originated a series of methods to get better observational data on
density fluctuations in the interstellar medium.
