0243779 Auchincloss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Rochester for
research opportunities in optical science and engineering. The REU site will be
based at the Institute of Optics in the University of Rochester's School of
Engineering and Applied Science. Student participants will work with faculty at
the institute and experience the interdisciplinary nature of the field of optics
at related on-site facilities - The Rochester Theory Center for Optical Science
and Engineering, the Rochester Center for Quantum Information, the Center for
the Next-Generation Atom Chips for Quantum Information Technology, the Center
for Future Health, the Center for Visual Science, the Laboratory for Laser
Energetics, the Center for Optics Manufacturing, and the Center for Electronic
Imaging Systems. The program includes mini courses in machining and electronics
as well as preparation for the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). REU students will
have the opportunity to attend weekly lunches with informal presentations by
university faculty and affiliated industrial researchers; tour industrial
research facilities; and participate in outings to local community sites and
events. The program aims to foster participants' capacity to undertake
collaborative research. This REU site offers students an experience in forefront
research integrated with the teaching, mentoring, and community outreach
activities that sustain scientific enterprise. The program will recruit students
nationwide with an effort to attract students from population groups that are
underrepresented in research fields in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
