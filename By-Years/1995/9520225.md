This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Trinity University acquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer
which will be used in research investigations in the following areas of
chemistry: (1) highly enantioselective transformations catalyzed by chiral
dirhodium(II) carboxamides; (2) anti-aromaticity and hypervalency in hydrocarbon
dications; and (3) site directed photochemistry: cycloadditions to anthracene
derivatives perturbed by electronic and strain effects. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
