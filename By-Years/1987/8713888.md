Dr. Schechter, at the Mount Wilson and Las Campanas Observatories of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, is conducting an observational research
project which consists of three separate but related components, all of which
will aid the construction of three dimensional models of the mass of the Milky
Way Galaxy. The project focuses on using three different tracers of mass to
determine the relative contributions to the mass of our Galaxy from the disk,
the bulge, and the halo. It has proven especially difficult to determine the
relative contributions of a disk, a bulge, and a dark halo to the total masses
of external galaxies. A better understanding of the relative importance of dark
and luminous matter in a galaxy is a prerequisite to understanding how galaxies
formed. The premise underlying Dr. Schechter's research efforts is that
projection effects make it virtually impossible to construct well constrained
models of the mass for external galaxies. However, in the Milky Way one can
measure all three components of position and velocity for a wide variety of
tracers of mass. Our knowledge of the mass distribution in our Galaxy can then
be applied to understanding the structure of other galaxies.
