The Semantic Robot Challenge is a photo treasure hunt for robots. Competing
mobile robot platforms equipped with multiple cameras and laser range scanners
are given a text list of objects dispersed on furniture or on the floor in a
conference room. They can learn about what the objects are supposed to look like
by connecting to the Internet and finding images of them. Then they have to
autonomously search the environment and take snapshots of as many objects as
they can, adding bounding boxes around the objects in the pictures and labeling
them. The winner is the robot that takes pictures of the largest number of
objects, with correct bounding boxes and labels (evaluated by human judges
according to well-defined rules). This competition challenges the teams to
successfully implement a large number of strategies that humans would use to
accomplish the same task. Successful robots are able to perform navigation,
exploration, obstacle avoidance and mapping, peripheral vision, foveal vision,
observation from multiple viewpoints, bottom-up feature detection and top-down
object model verification.

The PI is with the organizing committee of the Third Semantic Robot Vision
Challenge (SRVC), and this NSF award supports travel scholarships for all
participating teams. This challenge is scheduled to take place as a Special
Track of the Fifth International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC09) in Las
Vegas on December 1, 2009. The first SRVC event took place at the AAAI
Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 2007. The second SRVC event
was organized at CVPR in Anchorage, Alaska in 2008. The practice of providing
travel support to participating teams has been shown to provide a great
encouragement for teams to attend, and it was implemented for the past two SRVC
events.
