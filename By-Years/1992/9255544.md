This two-year program is designed to serve as a model for the utilization of
cooperative relationships between university professors and outstanding two-year
college physics faculty members working together to provide professional
inservice enrichment training for two-year college physics faculty in the
Southwestern United States. The program focuses on recent developments in
physics research, innovative physics teaching methods, and successful techniques
for recruiting local minority students into two-year college science and
engineering programs. The program includes an annual May Institute at Texas
A&amp;M University, academic year follow-up workshops, local projects by
participants, and staff visits to participant's campuses.
