Traditionally, relational databases have emphasized static aspects of data. For
instance, data modeling has been done using just static constraints, and data
manipulation has emphasized queries over updates. This was due in part to the
nature of early database applications, which were mostly business oriented.
Consequently, the relational model has not reflected semantics relating to data
behaviour. This feature has been widely regarded as a drawback of the relational
model, particularly at a time when new applications have led to increased
emphasis in conceptual modeling on behavioural aspects of data. However, many
basic aspects concerning data behaviour and its connection with structure are
not well understood. The primary focus of the present proposal is the study of
update languages and specification methods for behaviour. A variety of update
languages are studied and their expressive power characterized. One tractable
update language of special practical importance, called domain-based, is studied
in detail with respect to optimization, parallelization, and concurrency
control. The other languages range over a spectrum of procedural and declarative
update languages. Next to update languages and specification methods for
behaviour, of special concern is the connection between behaviour (expressed by
valid updates or dynamic constraints) and structure (specified in relational
databases by static constraints). This will be investigated under the present
proposal subject to time and resource availability. It is expected that this
research will lead to better database design methodologies integrating
structural and behavioural aspects, better means for checking the soundness of a
specification, and a more efficient approach to database integrity. Some of the
results will be relevant to adjacent areas, such as Programming Languages and
Artificial Intelligence.
