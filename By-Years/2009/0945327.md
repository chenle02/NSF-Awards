This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to demonstrate a
novel nanolithography process, i.e. Hybrid Holographic Lithography (HHL)
combining interferometric optical lithography with a Spatial Light Modulator
(SLM) imaging technique to enable maskless pattern generation.

If successful, the new lithographic method will provide a cost effective means
of generating nanostructures that can be applied in many fields.
