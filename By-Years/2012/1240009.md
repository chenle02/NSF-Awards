The Mathematics Enhancement for Detroit Area Teachers (MEDeATe) Project is
developing a cross-institutional infrastructure for systemic improvement in
mathematics instruction driven by elementary and middle school master teachers
in Detroit area schools. The activities build capacity for a potential Noyce
Master Teacher Fellowship (MTF) project and bring together a multidisciplinary
team to enhance the strengths of Detroit area MTFs with explicit intention to
cultivate an expanding cadre of excellent mathematics teachers and document
their instruction in order to better understand and replicate successful
mathematics teaching in high-poverty urban settings. Knowledge of these
processes is essential for systemic improvement in mathematics education locally
and nationally. The partners are Detroit Public Schools, Wayne Westland
Community Schools, and Wayne State University and they serve a diverse urban
student body. MEDeATe is working inside existing school structures with
outstanding teachers who are already in place and is building from their
strengths to expand excellent mathematics instruction.
