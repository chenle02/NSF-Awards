This grant supports the 2019 Maine-Quebec Number Theory Conference, which will
take place on October 5-6, 2019 at the University of Maine. This is an annual
conference, held at Laval University in Quebec in even years, and at the
University of Maine in odd years. It provides a forum for number theorists from
New England, Quebec, and beyond, to discuss their research and develop
collaborations.

The conference features approximately 35 lectures addressing recent progress in
different areas of number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with roughly
65 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young
mathematicians to interact with leading researchers. This award may also provide
some travel support for US-based participants to attend the 2020 meeting in
Quebec. The conference website has more information, including participant lists
and programs from recent years. More information can be found at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
