This project will test two competing models of the origin of the Indo-Europeans
(I-E) with computer simulation utilizing genetic information obtained from
modern populations. The traditional model views the I-E population of Europe as
having originated in three waves between 4500 &amp; 2500 BC. A more recent
theory says that the I-E languages are connected with a much earlier origin of
agriculture. A series of tests, utilizing genetic data from 3481 locations in
Europe, will examine which of these two models is more likely in terms of the
available biological information. The outcome of these tests will be of
considerable interest to anthropologists, archaeologists, and linguists
concerned with the origin of the peoples representing this major language group.
