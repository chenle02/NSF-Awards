The Nebraska Wesleyan University will initiate a three-week, multidisciplinary,
residential Young Scholars project for 48 students entering grades 11,12.
Students will undertake laboratory and field experiences in two of four
disciplines offered (Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Computer Science) as well
as a research project in a single discipline. They will report results to school
personnel at a special banquet; other evenings will focus on science-related
careers. During 1991-92 instructors will maintain contact with participants and
make at least one visit to each participant's school to consult with teachers
and conduct demonstrations involving the participant and classmates.
