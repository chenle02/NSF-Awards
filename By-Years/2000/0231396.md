The goal of the workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of
researchers to identify promising research directions in authentication,
information hiding, and related areas. The researchers come from diverse
communities including: signal processing, information theory, coding theory,
cryptography, and computer science. Each researcher will present a 20-minute
talk followed by questions from the audience. There will also be a few short
panel-type sessions in which everyone participates.
