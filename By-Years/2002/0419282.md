This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is concerned with
the development of a radically new class of molten-salt produced anodized
coatings for the advanced corrosion protection of magnesium alloys. More
specifically, this proposed work will develop the electrochemical basis and
technical effectiveness of this new class of recently discovered inorganic
coatings. These new coatings are producible via low temperature non-aqueous
molten-salt electrolytes and will contribute toward increasing magnesium alloy
usage as part of the national effort (United Sates Automotive Materials
Partnership) to reduce vehicle weight and increase vehicle mileage.

Corrosion of magnesium is an important problem in its industrial use especially
in the transportation industry. The discovery of a new class of inorganic anti-
corrosion coatings presents an opportunity for significant improvement in
corrosion protection for magnesium. The potential applications of this research
include coatings for aeronautical as well as vehicular magnesium engineering
components and devices. Additionally the electrolytes used to prepare this new
class of coatings are environmentally benign and do not have the waste disposal
problems associated with currently used coatings.
