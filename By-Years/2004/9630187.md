9630187 Konig The goal of this research project is to elucidate the molecular
basis regulating interactions between the T cell coreceptor CD4 and molecules
encoded by the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC Class II). The CD4
glycoprotein interacts with the same MHC class II molecule as the antigen
specific T cell receptor, and regulates intrathymic T cell selection and
activation of mature T cells. The contribution of the interaction between CD4
and MHC class II molecules to intracellular signal transduction via the antigen
specific T cell receptor (TCR) is not known, however the engagement of CD4 by
MHC class II molecules contributes quantitatively and qualitatively to the
activation of T cells. This project will test the hypothesis that antigen
specific T cell receptor mediated signal transduction depends on the structured
and sequential oligomerization of TCR, CD4 and MHC class II molecules. The PI
has developed assays that measure adhesion of CD4+ T cells to MHC class II cells
and to purified MHC class II molecules. Binding data will be correlated with
antigen induced T cell responses. Mutations have been introduced into MHC class
II molecules to define regions that mediate the interaction with CD4. Mutant MHC
class II molecules will be combined with CD4 molecules having mutations in
identified MHC class II binding regions to define the interface formed by
interacting CD4 and MHC class II molecules. Results from these experiments will
enhance our understanding of structure- function relationships responsible for
important immune regulatory mechanisms. ***
