The project deals with a scientifically and technically important problem,
namely the physical/mechanical/chemical processes as the underlying factors in
the evolution of flank wear pattern in machining of steels with ceramic tools.
His approach of this project is to consider the separability of thermal and
athermal aspects of wear in a novel description of worn surfaces. Preliminary
arguments for constructing a theory is outlined. The development of the theory
wil be buttressed by a parallel experimental program to qualify various thermal,
chemical and metallurgical parameters of wear.
