This grant would fund a conference exploring connections between the disciplines
of mathematics and biology within the constraints of the high school curriculum.
The conference will explore topics in mathematics and computer science that
could be included in biological science courses, as well as topics in biology
that could be included in mathematics courses. The agenda of the conference will
include the availability and development of materials supporting these linkages,
developments in undergraduate education that might inform teachers in high
schools and alternative models for teacher training at the interface between
biology and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will produce a
report focusing on future challenges in making the interface between biology and
mathematics accessible to high school students. &lt;br/&gt;
