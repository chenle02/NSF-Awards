Behnke, Steve U. of California, Santa Barbara The Nelchina caribou herd in
south-central Alaska has been a focus of conflict for over thirty years. While
the herd has been closely managed since the early 1970s, biologists disagree
about the relative impacts of weather, range, wolves, bear and hunting on herd
dynamics. This scientific dispute is exacerbated and complicated by allocation
conflict in respect to the subsistence preference of local peoples who rely on
wildlife. The research will explore how science, culture, and nature are co-
produced in the case of the Nelchina caribou. It examines natural resource
management at a site where divergent interpretations and representations of
nature and society are negotiated and resolved. Theoretical aspects of cultural
geography and the sociology of science are utilized. Data in written and oral
form that was presented to the Board of Game during deliberations on regulatory
proposals will be gathered and analyzed. Subsequent investigations will seek to
understand the background of the representations.
