9451480 Glaunsinger The first multidisciplinary scanning probe microscopy (SPM)
laboratory for undergraduate students using research-grade instrumentation will
be created in this project. The primary goal of this initiative is to create a
unique SPM undergraduate laboratory using affordable, state-of-the-art
instrumentation for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM). The proposed laboratory is designed to serve as a magnet to
bring together students from different disciplines and ethnic backgrounds to
help prepare them for the imminent revolution in nano-science, engineering and
technology. The proposed laboratory will be built around research-grade
instruments that are capable of operating in both STM and AFM modes at nanoscale
resolution under ambient conditions, in vitro and in situ under electrochemical
control. The multidisciplinary SPM laboratory will be completely equipped with
(i) sample and probe preparation equipment, (ii) four SPM workstations, (iii)
post-acquisition data processing equipment, and (iv) testing equipment. This
project will involve expert faculty from the Department of
Chemistry/Biochemistry, Physics/Astronomy, Geology, Biology,
Chemical/Bio/Materials Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The proposed
laboratory will serve a new multidisciplinary SPM laboratory course, complement
many of the existing undergraduate courses and laboratories in the above
disciplines, provide highly qualified students for undergraduate research
projects, and strengthen special programs such as the federally funded
Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program in Materials Synthesis and Processing
and the Coalition to Increase Minority Degrees. The proposed multidisciplinary
SPM laboratory will have a positive impact on the quality of science and
engineering education at the university, local, regional and national levels.
