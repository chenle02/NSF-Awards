9404755 Zettl The electronic and thermal properties of fullerene-based
materials, pure and alkali-doped carbon-60 and carbon-70, will be examined using
various transport, structural, mechanical and tunneling measurements. Electron
phonon coupling in the normal and superconducting states will be investigated
through transport, tunneling, and isotopic replacement on both the alkali and
carbon sites. Carrier concentration and possible correlation-induced
localization effects will be explored using Hall measurements. High pressures
will be applied to probe transport properties and superconductivity as a
function of lattice constants and variable density of states. % % % % The
properties of novel carbon materials formed from so called fullerenes will be
explored using a variety of probes, including transport of electricity and heat
through the materials at atmospheric and high pressures. The mechanical strength
of the structures will be determined using elasticity measurements. Atoms of
different masses (different isotopes) will be introduced in the structures to
help understand the interactions between the electrons and the vibrations of the
atoms. This interaction may be responsible for some of the materials being
superconducting (zero electrical resistance). ***
