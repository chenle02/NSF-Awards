This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Support from the NSF MRI-R2 program allowed Lycoming College to acquire a
microbial ID system for the identification of bacterial species, a high
performance Liquid Chromatograph, and a combination automated microplate reader
and incubator. These systems enable characterization and description of novel
microbial species, discovered by undergraduate researchers, allowing the
organisms to be added to international microbial culture collections that serve
as biological resources used by scientists throughout the world. The resulting
data will improve documentation of microbial biodiversity in environments such
as freshwater ecosystems, including pristine streams, streams that have been
damaged, and those that are in various stages of recovery. The research
experience will inspire and motivate the many first generation college students
from rural central Pennsylvania studying in the college. Teaching methodologies
will be presented in conferences for undergraduate educators, and at a High
School teacher workshop, held annually at Lycoming College, facilitating the
final steps that currently form a bottleneck in novel microbe characterization
for faculty mentoring undergraduate microbiology researchers. Results from the
studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented by students
and faculty at regional and national meetings.
