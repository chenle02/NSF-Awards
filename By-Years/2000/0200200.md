This project deals with questions in commutative algebra. While the questions
address a variety of topics, there is an underlying common thread that unifies
them all: the theory of integral closure. The PI, together with her
collaborators, first plans to develop methods that produce the integral closure
of an ideal. In joint work with Bernd Ulrich the proposer has established that
linkage is a method for capturing integral elements over a complete
intersection. Now the investigator wants to extend this same procedure to
Gorenstein linkage and residual intersections. Second, the PI intends to clarify
the connection between the core of an ideal and the adjoint of Lipman (or the
multiplier ideal of Ein and Lazarsfeld), find an explicit formula for the core,
and compute the core of monomial ideals (a question posed by Eisenbud and
Sturmfels). The investigator intends to use linkage theory, residual
intersection theory and Groebner basis theory. Third, the investigator would
like to study the special fiber ring. This object is very important from a
geometric point of view because it encodes algebraic information on the special
fiber of the blowup. The focus here is on finding conditions that force the
fiber to be unmixed or even Cohen-Macaulay. Last, the PI plans to study the
Hilbert function of zero-dimensional normal ideals (an ideal is normal if all
its powers are integrally closed). One of the proposer's goals is to show that
all the Hilbert coefficients of such ideals are non-negative, while another goal
is to characterize the vanishing of the Hilbert coefficients in terms of the
Cohen-Macaulayness of the associated graded ring of the ideal itself or of one
of its powers.

The proposed research is concerned with problems in commutative algebra. On a
basic level commutative algebra is about techniques for solving systems of
polynomial equations. Commutative algebra had a revolutionary growth in the past
fifty years as it provided the tools for understanding many problems in pure and
applied mathematics. In many applied problems, polynomial equations and hence
commutative algebra play a crucial role. Applied areas where commutative algebra
results have been used in the past include operations research, computer
science, robotics, control theory, coding theory and cryptography to mention a
few.
