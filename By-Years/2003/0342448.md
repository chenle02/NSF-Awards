The Primeval Structure Telescope (PAST) is intended for location and study of
the earliest luminous objects in the Universe. This primeval structure contained
the first stars, supernova explosions, and/or black holes. All these objects
were strong sources of ultra-violet radiation, so they ionized the material
surrounding them. This ionization will be sensed and studied. The structure of
this ionization reflects the overall density structure at the redshift of
luminous-object formation. By mapping this structure the PAST array will image
the end of the Universe "dark ages". The PAST will sense emission from hydrogen
atoms, the most common atoms in the Universe, and because their wavelengths (21
cm) provide the clearest possible view, PAST may allow cosmologists to see back
to just 100 million years after the Big Bang. The original proposal was for
deploying about 1000 small antennae, but under the revised program a small
prototype for PAST (an array of 2 x 3 antennae) will be constructed and deployed
at the South Pole Station for one winter - to test the instrument design concept
and the suitability of the South Pole as a site for very-high frequency
cosmology.
