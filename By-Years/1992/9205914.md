This research is a study of synoptic-scale evolution and vertical structure of
intense convective events and westerly wind bursts in the equatorial western
Pacific. the main objectives are to : 1) complete a trial case study of such an
event that occurred during November, 1989, with pre-TOGA COARE data, 2) monitor
the synoptic situation during TOGA COARE to identify candidates for subsequent
case studies, and 3) analyze case studies drawn from the TOGA COARE period in a
similar way to the pre- TOGA COARE study to gain a more complete understanding
of how these events evolve and interact with the ocean in that region. Objective
3 includes the analysis of data from four Integrated Sounding Systems,
consisting of surface meteorological instruments, a boundary layer wind
profiler, and a portable omegasonde for vertical soundings of temperature, wind
and moisture. These observations will be supplemented with operational gridded
analysis products from NMC and ECMWF, OLR satellite data (as a proxy for
convection), and oceanographic data from moorings in the TOGA TAO array. The
collective analysis of these data will provide insights into the structure and
evolution of synoptic-scale convective events and atmospheric circulations
thought to be associated with coupled air- sea processes in the region. This
research is important because it is one of the TOGA COARE studies examining the
relationship between the convective-scale physical processes and the larger
scales of atmospheric circulation in an especially climate sensitive region of
the world, the western Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
