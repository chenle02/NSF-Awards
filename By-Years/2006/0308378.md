&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of catalytic,
stereoselective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. New ligands for asymmetric
catalysis will be synthesized and hydrovinylation of prototypical vinylarenes,
dienes and strained olefins will be carried out. Further, heterodimerizations
including dienes and strained olefins will be probed with the goal of solving
the problem of exocyclic stereochemistry and applications of palladium-
catalyzed, X-Y-mediated ([X-Y] = [Si-Sn], [B-Sn], [Sn-Sn]) cyclization of
diynes, alleneynes and allenylaldehydes will be provided for the stereoselective
synthesis of carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Thaliyil V. RajanBabu in the Department of Chemistry at the Ohio
State University. Professor RajanBabu will focus on developing methodology for
using abundantly available carbon sources in the catalytic processes for the
synthesis of chemical intermediates. The hydrovinylation of commercially
relevant vinylarenes as well as dienes and strained olefins will be studied. The
utility of the approach will be showcased by the preparation of synthesis of
several biologically active targets. The project has broader impacts for the
pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and provides an excellent climate for
the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
