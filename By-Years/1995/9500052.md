9500052 Ramirez The objective of this proposal is the purchase of a Beckman DU-
7500 UV/Visible Spectrophotometer with complete programming, data reduction, and
multicomponent analysis capabilities for use on NSF funded projects. This
instrument will support three research areas, 1) amino acid-containing
polyanhydrides for peptide and protein release, 2) the design of an artificial
pancreas for insulin-dependent diabetics, and 3) the inoculation of
microorganisms to enhance the biodegradation of methylene chloride, toluene,
phenol, and trichloroethane. The department currently owns two 15 year old
spectrophotometers. The newer machine will allow faster throughput and more
detailed analysis of results. This capability will facilitate planned expansion
of research activities in the department. The equipment could help the
researchers achieve new discoveries in several interesting research area, and
have a substantial impact on biodegradable drug release polymers and the design
of the artificial pancreas. Moreover, the proposed research area may serve as a
basis for improving the technology for several areas of implantable materials.
The requested equipment would enhance a research laboratory substantially, and
would provide more extensive exposure and training for students. ***
