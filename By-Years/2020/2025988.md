The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new optical imaging
techniques for evaluating the health of skin, teeth and gums. Optical imaging
uses light instead of X-rays to produce detailed images of tissues. It has not
yet been widely applied for dental and dermatology applications because the
light does not penetrate deeply enough into tissues to be useful, and these
devices are prohibitively expensive to manufacture. This project will develop a
a new imaging scheme that allows deeper penetration into tissues, providing more
useful diagnostic information; and with current 3D manufacturing techniques, it
could cost roughly ten times less than the current alternatives. This technology
will enable new safe, affordable imaging processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances translation
of a novel optical technique, dual axis deep imaging optical coherence
tomography (OCT), for clinical imaging of skin and teeth. Translation of OCT is
advanced for retinal imaging but has not enjoyed the same success in other
applications. This project will create new instruments for dentistry and
dermatology by demonstrating: 1) how dual axis OCT can penetrate more deeply in
biological tissues using instruments designed for each application; and 2) the
economic feasibility using 3D manufacturing and system
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
