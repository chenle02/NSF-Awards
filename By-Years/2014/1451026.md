Neuronal circuits in the brainstem are at the "front-end" of sensorimotor loops
that underlie behavior and cognitive processing. They control life-sustaining
functions that include breathing, movement and balance, sniffing, chewing,
suckling in neonates, and, in rodents, whisking. These circuits further drive
active sensation through taste, smell, balance, and touch. In this project the
PI will delimit the circuits that control different motor actions and show how
behaviors emerge as an assembly of these actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
"front-end" circuits of orofacial processing control life-sustaining functions
that include breathing, movement and balance, sniffing, chewing, suckling in
neonates, whisking in rodents, and vocalization. The functions, some of which
share common muscles, must occur without compromising the patency of the airway.
The control structure is not understood and nontrivial and it will serve as a
model for the control and coordination of concurrent neuronal processes at any
level in the nervous system. The application of control theory to nervous
systems was proposed by the Cyberneticists of the 1940s to 1960s. These
prescient notions were stymied by a lack of experimental tools to identify and
control the circuits that underlie behavior. We now have sufficient tools to map
brainstem circuits and the PI will exploit the tools of engineering and physics
to gain insight into fundamental sensorimotor processes. The technical aspect of
the the PI's approach involves the introduction of molecular tools based on the
expression of lineage factors and constitutive proteins to identify brainstem
neurons and track tracing tools based on trans-synaptic viruses to reveal
connectivity The project will contribute to the education and the training of
future multidisciplinary scientists through research-based education of
undergraduate and graduate students. Technical aspects of work will be broadly
disseminated through the involvement of the PIs and colleagues in graduate and
post-graduate summer schools.
