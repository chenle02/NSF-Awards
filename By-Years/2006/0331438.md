The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will create "Virtual Stowaway,"
a website designed to be a segment of the WHOI web series "Dive and Discover."
Based upon NSF OCE-0002540, a research project investigating two species of
fragile gelatinous zooplankton (salps), the web site will communicate this
research to public audiences by allowing learners of all ages to become
stowaways on a research vessel studying the biology of these filter-feeding
herbivores living in the upper layers of the ocean. The site will use innovative
virtual reality panoramas (VR) of research vessel labs and submersibles with hot
links as portals to layered levels of learning about ocean exploration,
scientific work on a research vessel, the role that animals like salps play in
the ocean and the diversity of jelly animals as successful adaptations to ocean
life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
