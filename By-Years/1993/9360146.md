9360146 Krieger Synchrotron Radiation Induced X-ray Fluorescence Computed
Tomography will provide a means of non-destructively mapping the three
dimensional distribution of trace elements within a specimen. Micron scale
spatial resolution and PPM level sensitivity are potentially achievable. The
characteristic fluorescent line radiation from a trace element must be detected
against the background flux of scattered radiation and fluorescent radiation
from more abundant elements. In phase I, Radiation Science will design a
wavelength dispersive spectrometer that can be attached to fluorescence CT
collimators within the confines of a beam hutch at a synchrotron light source.
Radiation Science will also develop a practical implementation of an algorithm
for absorption corrected reconstruction of fluorescence CT data. In phase II,
Radiation Science will build a practical fluorescence CT system. *** v s t $ $ $
