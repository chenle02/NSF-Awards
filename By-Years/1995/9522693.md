9522693 Gilat This project is part of a combined theoretical/experimental study
of shear flow localization, a form of catastrophic failure. A novel
implementation of he torsional split Hopkinson bar technique will be used to
obtain detailed information on the evolution of the spatial deformation field.
It is hoped that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
material damage can be obtained over a wide range of loading rates, materials
and length scales. ***
