The Information Assurance and Security (IAS) Education project in the Department
of Computer Science and the Department of Management, Marketing, and Finance at
North Dakota State University (NDSU) helps NDSU achieve Academic Excellence in
Information Assurance and Security Education. It is built upon close
collaborations with consultants and partnerships from academia, industry and
government. Specific tasks developed under this project include:&lt;br/&gt;1.
Training our faculty through the Center of Academic Excellence in
Information&lt;br/&gt;Assurance Education at Iowa State University, in which the
faculty develop and deliver information assurance security modules that can be
readily included in core courses in IAS;&lt;br/&gt;2. Developing new courses and
revising existing ones by integrating IAS modules into selected courses. The
federal training documents provided by the Committee on&lt;br/&gt;National
Security Systems (CNSS) will be consulted.&lt;br/&gt;3. Tailoring student
capstone and course projects to IAS;&lt;br/&gt;4. Establishing partnerships
between disciplines and departments, among the U.S. academic institutions,
industry and government, for developing specific projects and involving their
personnel in teaching;&lt;br/&gt;5. Developing the career interest of junior
high school girls in IAS by organizing a workshop session.&lt;br/&gt;
