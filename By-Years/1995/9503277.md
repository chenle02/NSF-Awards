Abstract ATM-9503277 Shah, Kathryn P. Columbia University Title: Supersonic
Aircraft Emission Signals in Satellite & GCMAM Microwave Maps Aircraft emissions
can potentially change the regional and global climate through their greenhouse
interaction with reaction with radiation and though their photochemical
interaction with ambient atmospheric species such as ozone. Supersonic aircraft
exhaust adds water vapor, NOx, CO2, sulfur, soot, and cloud condensation nuclei
to high altitudes (20 km) in the stratosphere. Current atmospheric forcing by
aircraft emission will no doubt be amplified by the increased supersonic fleet
planned by 2015. A microwave radiative transfer model can be enhanced to work
with Global Climate-Middle Atmosphere Model (GCMAM) experiments. These GCMAM
experiments predicted the atmospheric impacts of water vapor and ozone
perturbations from supersonic aircraft emission. The signature of the supersonic
ozone and water vapor perturbations can be sought in NOAA satellites' Microwave
Sounding Unit (MSU) data based on the GCMAM microwave maps produced by microwave
radiative transfer model. The GCMAM microwave maps can also assess the
progression of changes at different altitudes during the GCMAM's time
integration as compared with actual satellite data. Finally, this would lead
into future research investigating the importance of the emission signal
relevant to other anthropogenic signals and to natural variability given current
and future satellite resolution and sensitivity. This is a Research Planning
Grant.
