9457212 Pollard The principal investigator will investigate electrical waveform
propagation during action potential depolarization and repolarization using
computer models of the heart. High performance computing will be employed to
study propagation across the heart wall, propagation between myocardium and the
conduction system, and the onset of re-entry.
