The focus of this research is the preparation of fluorine containing molecules
from monofluoro subunits. The subunits under investigation are
fluorobutenolides, fluorodienes and fluorovinyl sulfoxides. The fluorobutenolide
research probes the potential of the subunits for the synthesis of
fluoronucleosides and 2-fluor- and 3-fluor-butenolides. The fluorodiene study
stresses Diels-Alder methodology and polymerization reactions and the
fluorovinyl sulfoxides provide entry into a variety of fluorovinyl systems. It
is anticipated that a total of twenty five undergraduate and masters level
students will take part in the research. With this Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Timothy B. Patrick in the Department of Chemistry
of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. With the help of undergraduate
and masters students, professor Patrick will focus his work on designing and
developing new general synthetic methodology for the preparation of complex
carbon-fluorine molecules. Molecules of this type have interesting and useful
biological properties.
