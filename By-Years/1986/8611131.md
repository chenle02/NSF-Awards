Pavements of concrete or asphalt are showing signs of deteriortion and break-up
as a result of weathering, excessive loadings, and repeated heavier than normal
loads. Currently, manual inspections of the pavement are used to determine the
degree of deterioration and the extent of repair necessary to restore the
pavement to a serviceable condition. This technique is time-consuming and not
very cost-effective. This project will investigate the feasibility of using a
mobile equipment with TV cameras to record the surface condition of the pavement
and to store it for later viewing and analysis.
