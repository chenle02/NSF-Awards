This Research Opportunity for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of organic chemistry. Dr. Leah L. Frye of the Chemistry Department of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will synthesize a series of biomimetic
potential ion channels. Once a macromolecule which will facilitate ion transport
across phospholipid layers is prepared, systematic modifications of its
structure will be performed to ascertain what the optimal locations of
heteroatom-containing functional groups (potentially metal binding sites) are
for ion transport and how the rate of transport is affected by different
functional groups. A crown ether will be used to construct the central core of
the macromolecule and cholesterol, attached by ester bonds, will be used for six
side chains. This award will enable Dr. Frye, building on her experience in
organic synthesis, to develop expertise in evaluation of ion transport across
lipid bilayers. If this initial project is successful, many additional projects
will become viable and Frye will have established a new direction for her
research career.
