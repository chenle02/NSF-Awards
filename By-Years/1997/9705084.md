9705084 Manzari This is an equipment proposal. A shaking table is requested for
the Center for Structural Dynamics Research at the Virginia Campus of The George
Washington (GW) University. As one of the research arms of GW's Department of
Civil, Mechanical, and Environmental Engineering, the Center has solid potential
to emerge as a leading site of earthquake engineering research and education.
The shaking table will be used to enhance ongoing experimental research at the
Center. In addition, it will provide a unique opportunity for the Center for
Structural Dynamics Research to offer extensive educational and training
programs in the area of earthquake engineering. The shaking table will also
provide a reliable and versatile tool to help the center integrate its already
well-established theoretical research activities with experimental validation
and evaluation. The requested system is a shaking table with six degrees of
freedom measuring 2 meters by 2 meters bearing a payload of 8,000 pounds. The
George Washington University has committed 38% in matching funds towards
acquisition of the shaking table and is committed to provide the necessary costs
for the site preparation and for the equipment installation. ***
