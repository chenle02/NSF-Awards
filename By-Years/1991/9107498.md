This award will support collaborative research in statistics and probability
between Dr. James Marron, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
Professor Wolfgang Hardle, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. The
objective of the research is to study bandwidth selection and construction of
confidence bands/error bars for additive multivariate regression models The
proposed research concerns nonparametric regression, especially in the
multivariate case. The two main problems to be addressed are smoothing
parameters (i.e. bandwidth selection) and data based assessment of the accuracy
of estimators (in the spirit of confidence intervals). Non- parametric
regression provides a powerful tool for providing insights in situations where
no widely accepted model is available, or where there is some doubt concerning
the appropriateness of a given model. For practical applications, the two
improvements most needed are a really reliable method of bandwidth selection,
and a means of assessing the variability of the estimator. Both Drs. Marron and
Hardle have a strong record of past joint research, which will be of benefit to
this proposed collaboration.
