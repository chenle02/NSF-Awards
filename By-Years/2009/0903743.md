Complex fluids are abundant in many industrial applications, e.g., emulsions and
foams, and commonly found in biology, e.g., blood and synovial fluid. These
materials exhibit rich dynamic macroscopic behavior that stems from the
interplay between microstructure distortion by external forcing (flow) and
microstructure relaxation by intrinsic mechanisms as in polymer recoiling or
cell shape relaxation. Understanding the microscale physics remains a major open
research problem. The non-equilibrium dynamics of soft- and bio-materials is
arguably one of the biggest questions in biophysics. The international summer
school 'Complex- and Bio-Fluids' will provide a forum for discussion about the
challenges and approaches in modeling flows of soft materials. Moreover, it will
foster interactions between different disciplines (physics, engineering, applied
mathematics, computer science, biology and medical science) as well as different
generations (expert senior scientists and students). This award will provide
travel support for the future expert senior scientists.
