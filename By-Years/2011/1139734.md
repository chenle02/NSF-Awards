This engineering education CAREER project supports research in facilitation
theory and team skill education for engineering students. A by product of the
study will be the creation and assessment of an expert system (virtual
facilitator) to facilitate team development and performance. This virtual
facilitator can be used to model the behaviors of an expert facilitator to
engineering student teams as they are working together. Drawing on previous
data, the PI will develop a practical tool that will help engineering students
learn team skills while, at the same time, advancing research in team dynamics
and facilitation. As a research tool, it will provide the opportunity to test
theories about team function and facilitation, especially across large numbers
of teams. Also the use of expert systems as a model for observational learning
of teaming skills has the potential to be applied widely and with significant
impact to improve learning engineering team skills.
