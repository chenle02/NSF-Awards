Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Shlyakhtenko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shlyakhtenko will study
classes of operator algebras arising in connection&lt;br/&gt;with Voiculescu's
free probability theory. The main emphasis of this&lt;br/&gt;research is placed
on the study of operator-valued free random&lt;br/&gt;variables and operator
algebras that they generate. Analysis of these&lt;br/&gt;von Neumann algebras is
intimately tied with the goal of&lt;br/&gt;classification of free Araki-Woods
factors, which are free probability&lt;br/&gt;analogs of ITPFI type III factors.
Such analysis is also important&lt;br/&gt;for understanding of subfactors and
automorphisms of amalgamated free&lt;br/&gt;product algebras. One of the goals
of the present research is to&lt;br/&gt;develop free entropy-based techniques
for dealing with operator-valued&lt;br/&gt;random
variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free probability theory is a highly non-
commutative parallel to basic&lt;br/&gt;probability theory. Matrix-valued random
variables (such as random&lt;br/&gt;matrices) naturally fit in the non-
commutative probability framework;&lt;br/&gt;the asymptotic behavior of large
random matrices is well-modeled by&lt;br/&gt;matrix-valued free random
variables. Applications are in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;to the theory of operator
algebras, subfactors, ergodic theory, as&lt;br/&gt;well as the theory of random
matrices, which have connections with&lt;br/&gt;certain physical
models.&lt;br/&gt;
