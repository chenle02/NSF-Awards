This project uses isotope geochemistry to determine the age and characteristics
of basement rocks of the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Northern Quebec. These rocks may
be up to 4.28 billion years old, making them amongst the oldest on earth. They
have the potential to offer insight into processes of differentiation that
occurred early in the earth?s history, such as the start of plate tectonics and
determining whether the earth had a magma ocean. The broader impacts include
training of a postdoctoral fellow in isotope geochemistry, and outreach to the
general public and an indigenous Inuit community living in the field area.
