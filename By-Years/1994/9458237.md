9458237 Baldwin Molecular phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast and ribosomal DNA
sequence variation in the California and Hawaiian Madiinae (Asteraceae) is
proposed. Published hypotheses of adaptive radiation in the California Islands,
speciation modes, dispersal mechanisms, and chromosomal/morphological evolution
would be tested. This research would revisit classic biosystematic examples from
a new perspective.
