0949384&lt;br/&gt;Rowe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for a
hand-held AXS X-ray fluorescence unit. The unit will be used to obtain rapid
chemostratigraphic information from organic-rich mudstones. The new instrument
will primarily be used to prioritize samples for more detailed laboratory
analysis. Samples will be screened in the field and from a core repository. The
analytical goals are to match geochemical characteristics with sedimentology and
stratigraphy - with emaphasis on the Permo-Triassic Boundary in the Panthalassic
and Tethyan Oceans and the Barnett Shale. The PI intends to survey rock
outcroppings in order to prioritize subsequent laboratory analyses. Of
particular interest is determining mudstone chemostratigraphy. The instrument
will support undergraduate and graduate students, the PI and internal/external
collaborators. The PI routinely uses analytical instrumentation in geochemistry
coursework. This acquisition will support research training for underrepresented
groups. The instrument will be housed in the UT Arlington (UTA) Geoscience
Building when not being used in the core repository or in the field.
