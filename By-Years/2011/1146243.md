Implantable devices for physiological monitoring are in common use in both
clinical and research settings. Even the most advanced current technologies,
however, have limitations due to the need to connect a wire to the recording
site. For example, these systems have particular difficulty recording from
moving or fragile structures (such as the spinal cord) because wire electrodes
shred fragile nerves as the animal moves. Similarly, it has been difficult to
record from freely behaving small animals, particularly those without strong
skeletons (leeches, fish). We have developed a new technology that does not have
these technical limitations. This technology has been tested, and we are now
moving it into working neuroscience laboratories. Consequently this project
includes collaboration between researchers at the University of Minnesota (a
major research university) and St. Olaf College (a liberal arts college) and
will provide opportunities for development in graduate and undergraduate
research and teaching. Our probe devices can be built extremely cheaply, either
hand-built individually by an undergraduate or built en-masse through integrated
circuit production. The technology we have developed will be of extraordinary
use both in research (due to the ability to record from novel preparations) and
in teaching (due to its simplicity, reliability, and low cost).
