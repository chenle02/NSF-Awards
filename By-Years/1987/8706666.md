During Phase I, SDSC will obtain the use of the FORGE CRAY FORTRAN optimization
system from Pacific Sierra Research Corporation on a trial basis. The system
will be implemented on one or more of SDSC's Apollo and/or Sun workstations and
tested by optimizing a series of examples representative of scientific and
mathematical application software in use at SDSC. Optimizations will be
performed by both experienced and novice CRAY FORTRAN users to evaluate the
efficiency and effectiveness of FORGE as an optimization aid for the national
user community. At the end of Phase I, a report documenting the testing and
evaluation results will issued. Assuming favorable results, a permanent license
for FORGE will be acquired. During Phase II, FORGE will be integrated into the
SDSC hardware and software operating environment using a series of computational
chemistry programs as a testbed environment. In particular, FORGE will be
applied to GAUSSIAN86 and MOPAC (ab initio and semi-empirical quantum chemistry
programs, respectively) as well as to MMp2, an empirical force-field molecular
program. The emphasis during phase II will be both on the creation of optimized
versions of highly utilized production codes as well as the development of an
experience base and associated software and documentation for the integration of
FORGE into the SDSC operational environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------- This proposal
involves the testing of commercial software for optimization of scientific code.
Chemistry code in the form of Gaussian 82 and Gaussian 86 (as well as other
code) was chosen as test cases. It is anticipated that even a small return in
optimization will result in a large return in supercomputer hours saved.
Furthermore the optimization routine is expected to improve many other software
applications as well. The New Technologies program (DASC) will provide $38k; the
Computational Science and Engineering (CISE) will contribute $19k; and Chemistry
will provide $19k (six months) for Phase I.
