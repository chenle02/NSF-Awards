This research is part of a long-term editing project, the first comprehensive
edition, in three volumes, of James Clerk Maxwell's scientific letters and
manuscript papers, to be published by Cambridge University Press. Maxwell was
the most important physicist of the nineteenth century, and his work was seminal
in establishing the electromagnetic theory of light and statistical physics,
work that is fundamental to modern science and technology. Under this grant, Dr.
Harman is working on the editorial commentary for Volume II of the edition,
which covers the years 1862-73. The manuscript papers of this period, which are
of especial interest and complexity, shed important light on Maxwell's
scientific maturity, the period in which he wrote the classic works on field
physics and statistical molecular theory on which his unique reputation largely
rests. The edition aims at textual accuracy and completeness. The textual notes
and introductions clarify textual obscurities and establish the historical
context within which the documents were written, employing contemporary
published and manuscript sources. The work, to be carried out at Harvard
University in consultation with historians of physics in the Boston area, will
make available, in a critical edition, fundamental source materials for the
study of modern science.
