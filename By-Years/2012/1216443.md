In the proposed project, Universidad Metropolitana and the University of
Maryland Baltimore County will conduct a pilot workshop that will bring together
noted experts from several communities, including the ADVANCE community, the NSF
and gender studies researchers to broaden the professional and mentoring
networks of Latina postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty. These institutions
have a longstanding partnership in increasing the number of underrepresented
minority students who earn the doctoral degree that dates back to 2003. However,
since 2007, this partnership has been formalized through a memorandum of
understanding that includes a focus on collaborations among faculty at both
institutions. It is expected that the pilot workshop will provide a foundation
upon which more meaningful and deliberate investigation of Hispanic women in the
academic STEM disciplines can be examined. The workshop is characterized by
relevant plenary and group breakout sessions that will provide attendees with
the opportunity to better define the course of study on Latina STEM faculty and
determine pathways to broader and future emphases as it relates to this target
population.
