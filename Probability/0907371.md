This award provides funds to support a joint workshop (Stevens Institute of
Technology and New Mexico State University) in high frequency data modeling. The
main purpose of this workshop is a synergy between Econophysics and high
frequency data modeling. Specifically, the focus of the conference is on models
for high frequency data and in particular applications of statistics and
statistical mechanics to this modeling problem. Furthermore, we are interested
in complex systems and system of systems as applying to this problem. The
scientific motivation for the conference arises from the fact that organizing a
conference in the trade capital of the world has the potential of bringing
together the best mathematicians, practitioners and regulators to help develop
and better the modeling aspect of the marketplace. The main objective of this
meeting is to expose today's economic and modeling problems to mathematicians
and current graduate students in the hope that this will improve the quality of
the research problems studied at the moment of the conference.
