This project concerns research, development, design and implementation of a
large-scale active control structural system. Considerable analytical and
experimental works have been carried out in active control of civil engineering
structures under environmental loads over the past 20 years, and now the
progress is such that large-scale implementation is feasible. Full-scale
prototype systems have been built and tested in Japan in recent years, but no
full-scale research and state-of- the-art system of this important new
technology in the U.S. has been developed to date. The proposed system comprises
a 150- foot high tower research structure to be assembled at the National
Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio. The tower will be capable of dynamic
excitations by (i) simulated earthquakes, (ii) natural winds, and (iii) other
types of motions by mechanical means. The design will be flexible, permitting
the dynamic properties and control configuration of the tower to be varied for
research use, and will incorporate features to enable state-of-the-art active
control techniques to be developed and tested. The project will be carried out
by a collaborative industrial and academic based research team.
