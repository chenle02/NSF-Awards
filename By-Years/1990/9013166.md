This research involves exploring a background electronic trimming principle to
compensate for errors arising from the component mismatch and the process
variations in data converters and filters and to prove its effectiveness through
theoretical simulations and experimental prototyping. The basic idea behind this
work is to replace the component trimming procedure usually done in the factory
prior to chip packaging by a hidden electronic calibration running in the
background. The goal is to improve the performance of inherently fast data
conversion and filtering systems by maintaining simple system architectures and
moving the operation of sophisticated trimming circuits to the background. As a
result, systems of this kind can be faster than systems electronically
calibrated in foreground. This basic research will help to develop a family of
high-performance monolithic analog/digital interface circuits with premium
speeds not readily available in monolithic forms.
