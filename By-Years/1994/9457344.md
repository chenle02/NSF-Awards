John Stanton is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Grant from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and implement many-
body ab initio molecular orbital approaches to the study of photochemical
processes. The approach is based on equation-of-motion and Fock space
generalizations of the coupled-cluster approximation for electronic ground
states. Specific aims of the research include: 1) the theoretical formulation
and computational implementation of techniques for calculating reduced density
matrices, electronic properties and analytic energy derivatives for final states
parameterized by a class of Fock space methods that allow a spin-adapted, size-
extensive, many-body treatment of open-shell states; 2) extensions of existing
equation-of-motion methodology that will permit application of these methods to
the calculation of nonadiabatic processes; and 3) the design of algorithms that
will make these theoretical methods applicable to relatively large systems.
Photochemistry tends to drive many of the important chain reactions that
determine the complex chemistry of the stratosphere, as absorption of solar
photons typically leads to photodissociation. Of current importance is the
photolysis and subsequent photofragment chemistry of chlorine containing
compounds, as these systems have unambiguously been implicated in catalytic
mechanisms leading to destruction of ozone in polar stratospheric regions.
Stanton's studies of excited states of these open-shell molecules will assist in
their theoretical characterization and detection by spectroscopic techniques.
His research will also contribute to the calculation of potential energy
surfaces for excited states which can be used to simulate photodissociation
events
