*** 9615111 Huberman The need to understand organizing and community formation
phenomena in the National and Global Information Infrastructures is high---for
example, to understand virtual organizations. This is research empirically
investigates fundamental principles of how organizations and communities emerge
in large-scale networked computing environments. The dynamic structure of
communities through time will be revealed by capturing empirical data about
growth and change in links among nodes in regions of the Internet. These data
will be analyzed for structural and temporal patterns, linked to explanatory
phenomena, and used to develop new theoretical models. In order to gather data
and perform measurements on community topology and dynamics, new probes and
instrumentation will be developed and deployed on the Net. This research is
especially innovative, first, in that it will develop new tools for gathering
and analyzing data on organizational activity and network dynamics directly from
the Internet at large. This begins to provide a new kind of research
infrastructure that opens up the Internet as a research tool, as a rich source
of empirical data on large-scale organizing phenomena, and as a source of data
on very-large-scale network dynamics in general. Second, it will provide
exciting empirically-derived models and theories of dynamic phenomena such as
communities and organizations in very large scale electronic environments. The
phenomena uncovered in the data alone can serve as valuable tests of and
challenges to existing models derived from analysis, simulation, or
extrapolation from smaller- scale models. The models built to explain that data
promise to drive empirical theories of network dynamics to new areas and to
inform other fields. ***
