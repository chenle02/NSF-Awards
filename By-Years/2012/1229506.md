Sprays are used in a variety of technology intensive industries from
microelectronic manufacturing to fire-protection applications. Because of the
complexity of the physical processes associated with atomizing a continuous
stream of fluid into a spray and the difficulty associated with characterizing
atomization details, spray formation and its relationship to injection
conditions is poorly understood. As a result, spray related development is
inhibited by analytical concessions, which rely primarily on "cut and try" and
empirical approaches. However, as computer based design tools become
increasingly popular, detailed atomization models will be needed for computer-
aided development, analysis, and evaluation of spray devices and systems. It is
essential to precisely characterize engineered sprays in order to develop models
to describe their behavior and to leverage this understanding for advancements
in spray technology. Building on existing instrumentation and laboratory
infrastructure, this team seeks to develop a major instrument capable of
characterizing large-scale sprays (e.g. sprays used in fire suppression
applications) while also providing the capability to interrogate small-scale
sprays (e.g. sprays used in microelectronic applications). The Spatially-
resolved Spray Scanning System (SSSS) expands on ideas from the PI's NSF PECASE
research and a recent UM invention (PP: 61/548530) that allows for scanning the
near-field of large-scale fire suppression sprays.
