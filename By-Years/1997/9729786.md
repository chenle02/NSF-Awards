This project will acquire and analysis data from a pilot seismic study in the
Oman ophiolite. The primary objectives of the experiment are to investigate the
feasibility of using seismic methods to image subsurface Moho structure in this
well-mapped ophiolite and to compare measurement of seismic anisotropy with
those calculated from petrofacric data.
