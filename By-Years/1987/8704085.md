This project is concerned with virtual Hattori-Stallings rank functions from a
group G to a normal domain. It will be shown that such a function is a sum of
inductions from finite hyperelementary subgroups of G. This will extend the
known situation for linear groups. The research is concerned with applications
of higher K- theory to concrete problems about group rings. If the main result
is established, it will imply Bass' Strong conjecture and will show that the
statements of the Goldie rank conjecture and zero divisor conjecture hold for
all Goldie group rings in charateristic zero.
