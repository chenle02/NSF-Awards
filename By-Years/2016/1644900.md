This award will support student travel to the 2016 New Security Paradigms
Workshop to be held in Colorado in September 2016. The New Security Paradigms
Workshop (NSPW) provides a stimulating, safe, and highly interactive forum for
innovative approaches to computer security. NSPW encourages graduate students
and junior faculty to examine long-held ideas within computer security. It also
strongly encourages non-computer security experts from economics, sociology,
psychology, and other disciplines to bring their expertise to bear on computer
security paradigms. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel expenses
for graduate students and junior faculty to attend the workshop. Supporting
junior researchers' travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a
very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next
generation of researchers in this important research area.
