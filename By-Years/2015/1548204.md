A major issue in future smart grid is how intelligent devices and independent
producers can respectively change their power consumption/production to achieve
near maximum efficiency for the power network. Limited communications between
devices and producers necessitates a transformative approach where the elements
of the network can act in an autonomous manner with limited information or
communications, yet achieve near optimal performance. This is the main topic of
the proposed project.

By combining the two-way power flow with the two-way information flow, demand
response can be applied to reduce the peak demand, shift load for economic
benefits, reduce operating reserves and improve the grid stability. An important
obstacle has been the lack of supporting information, communication and
computation infrastructures that can ensure quality of service (QoS) for various
demand response applications and devices. This project goal is to develop
transformative and applicable distributed algorithms and architectures with
provable performance for demand control subject to communication constraints in
power networks. Results from this project will be applied to achieve high-
performance and high-confidence management of the smart buildings and cities,
and further contributes to the goal of improving urban sustainability.
