Mathematical Sciences (21) This proof of concept project is developing and
evaluating a set of easy-to-use symbolic and numerical "calculators" that
produce exact as well as approximate solutions to ordinary differential
equations (ODE) that are encountered in the introductory course. The
capabilities of WebMathematica underpin these tools, thus making them widely
accessible independent of local hardware platforms. The project is also
developing the early components of a "clearinghouse" of annotated links to other
educational resources. The clearinghouse is expected to facilitate the
incorporation of visualization and computational technology into the teaching
and learning of ordinary differential equations. As such the project has the
endorsement of the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (MathDL), which
provides an important avenue of dissemination for this work.
