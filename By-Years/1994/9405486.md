9405486 Oldow To fully characterize active tectonic systems such as the Pacific-
North American transform boundary, it is important to examine the interactions
at several spatial and temporal scales. This project sets out to quantitatively
assess the spatial distribution of strain in the central Walker Lane Belt of the
western Great Basin, presently undergoing active transcurrent and extensional
faulting that results from the relative motion between the Pacific and North
American plates, complicated by interaction between the Sierra Nevada and the
Great Basin. The work will focus on three duration intervals from Mid Miocene to
present-day deformation rates. Methods vary from mapping to GPS measurement of
deforming Pleistocene lake terraces. Results are expected to provide a balanced
view of the present strain regime of this area, in a historical context, and
fully integrated with known geological data, that will be utilized in
understanding how the basic plate interaction are modified and applied to
continental margins.
