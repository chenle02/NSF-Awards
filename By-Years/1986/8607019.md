Research will be conducted on the potential emissions that would affect air
quality from a process that utilizes sludges derived from treatment of
wastewater in the production of ceramic products. Metal species to be
investigated include arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead,
mercury, selenium, and zinc. Results of this work will be applicable to
determination of the environmental impact of the manufacturing process, a
necessary step in considering its adoption as a sludge management option.
