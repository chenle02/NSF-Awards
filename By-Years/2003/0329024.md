The computer Incident Factor Analysis and Categorization Project, CIFAC, will
accomplish three primary objectives: 1) Identify key managers within the sample
( college, university and corporate settings) and establish trust relationships
and authorizations to permit sharing of data regarding computer-related
incidents; 2) Refine and test a model for categorizating computer-related
incidents and facilitate cross-organizational sharing; and 3) Identify and
investigate factors that are related to the occurrence of computer-related
incidents within the study sample. The CIFAC project will analyze the
relationships between incident types and the occurrence of such incidents. The
work of CIFAC will provide data to encourage best practices for protection from,
and prevention of, computer-related incidents within electronic environments.
