The National Academies of Sciences' Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology
(BCST) and Board on Science Education (BOSE) are collaborating on a three-year
project to develop a framework for effective chemistry communications, outreach,
and education in informal settings. The initiative will include a "landscape"
study that will synthesize lessons learned from practice along with education
and learning science research about chemistry learning and teaching in informal
and formal settings. The overall process will define a set of principles for
engaging the public with chemistry and embed these principles into a broad
framework that chemists and informal science education professionals could use
to identify a set of effective strategies for a given audience and a given
educational or communication goal.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The guidance and tools
resulting from this activity, which is a chemistry-specific case study, should
be more generally applicable to science and engineering communications, informal
education and outreach. Findings are also likely to apply to aspects of formal
education.
