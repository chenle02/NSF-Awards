Hydroforming is a relatively new process for shaping tubular components out of
metals. A simple tube can be hydroformed into a fairly complex shape suitable
for use as a frame for a structural component. A tube is placed between two half
dies and then pressurized internally. It expands, comes into contact with the
dies and is forced to conform to their shape. The simple radial expansion of the
tube can lead to a number of defects, with a major concern being thinning of the
expanded wall. This can lead to tube burst. In order to reduce thinning, the
burst strain can be increased by axially feeding undeformed material into the
dies from the two ends using actuators. However, the extent of the developed
axial compression in limited by buckling and wrinkling and by friction. Thus,
for every part, a working envelope in the axial feed-pressure plane must be
established which is free of these modes of failure. While aluminum in tube form
is ideal for hydroforming, it is less ductile than steel and has more complex
constitutive behavior, which make the hydroforming working envelope tighter.
This need for a better understanding of processing control coupled with the
empirical manner in which the dies and the process have been designed, have not
allowed wide use of hydroforming for aluminum components.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this three-year project is to develop a
scientific basis for establishing the working envelopes of the process
parameters. The problem will be tackled in a three prong manner consisting of
hydroforming experiments, development of constitutive models for appropriate
aluminum alloy extruded tubes, and development of several levels of numerical
models for analyzing hydroforming and establishing its limits. An important
component of the project is a custom hydroforming facility, which will be
fabricated and used to study the process parametrically. Alcoa and GM will be
act as industrial partners to the project and will interact with graduate and
undergraduate students on a regular basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
