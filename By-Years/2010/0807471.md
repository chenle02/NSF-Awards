The focus of this project is the study the mechanisms responsible for driving
turbulence in protoplanetary disks, and the effect of such turbulence on two
critical stages of the planet formation process - the motion of dust within the
disk and the early growth of kilometer-scale bodies called planetesimals. Here,
Dr. Armitage and a postdoctoral scholar will develop new global simulations of
protoplanetary disks that will be used to study two important sources of
turbulence: that driven by the magnetorotational instability and that generated
by the self-gravity of the disk gas. The simulations will improve upon prior
work both by attaining higher resolution, and by more accurately reproducing the
physical conditions likely to exist in young protoplanetary disks. Using the
simulations, they will determine how efficiently dust diffuses within the
turbulence, and in particular whether the large-scale structure of the turbulent
disk enhances the transport as compared to local models. They will also
calculate the equilibrium velocity dispersion of bodies within the disk, whose
orbits are excited by gravitational scattering off turbulent fluctuations and
damped by gas drag. From this, they will determine the prerequisites for
planetesimals to grow rather than suffer destructive collisions. The results are
expected to elucidate where in the disk planet formation can occur, and whether
significant steps toward growth can occur in the earliest phases of disk
evolution when the disk is massive and turbulent.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will directly contribute to the
professional training of a junior scientist. Also, during the grant period, Dr.
Armitage will complete and publish a graduate level textbook entitled
"Astrophysics of Planet Formation," which will cover topics directly relevant to
this project and which will incorporate results of this research. At the
undergraduate level, Dr. Armitage will integrate selected aspects of this work
into a class for non-science majors on "Extraterrestrial Life," make course
materials available electronically, and continue his participation in NSF-
supported experiments into new techniques for teaching science. For the general
public, he will revise an existing planetarium show on extra-solar planets, both
to incorporate new results and to take advantage of improved digital technology
at the University of Colorado's Fiske Planetarium. The technical results of the
investigation will be disseminated widely via journal articles that are freely
via the arXiv preprint server.
