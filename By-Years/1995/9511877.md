This investigation will explore the integration of science into the criminal
justice system of the United States in the 20th century. It will involve an
analysis of efforts nationwide to abolish the elective office of coroner and
replace it with a medical examiner system, of conflicts between scientific and
legal definitions of proof, of reformers' efforts to convince the public of the
inherent validity of professional forensic science, and of reactions of the
legal profession, in particular public prosecutors, to the increased
availability and use of forensic science. Changes in criminal procedure, in the
law of evidence, and circuit court and appellate decisions that detail evolving
interpretations of the province of the jury will form a central part of this
investigation. The ethical conflicts facing forensic scientists who embrace the
ethos of scientific objectivity while working, for the most part, as employees
of the State and witnesses for the prosecution, will also be examined. The grant
provides support for travel to archives in San Francisco, Wichita, Chicago,
Cleveland, and New York, for research assistance, and for use of the facilities
for research in science, law, and medicine at Harvard University. The project
will produce articles and a book length manuscript examining the role of the
jury in the face of increasing fear of crime and desire for law and order and
the efficient administration of criminal justice.
