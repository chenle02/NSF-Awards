Robert B. Lund Periodic ARMA Modeling, DMS 0071383

Abstract

Periodicities naturally arise in data involving tides, climatology, ecology,
sociology, astronomy, economics, hydrology, etc.. This research studies general
periodic time series modeling methods along with some applications to
climatological problems. The specific questions examined here include efficient
computation of the autocovariance structure of periodic time series models,
parsimonious periodic time series model development, changepoint and homogeneity
methods, and trend properties in monthly average and extreme temperatures. The
mathematical and statistical methods center on periodic autoregressive moving
average models (PARMA) time series models - the fundamental modeling vehicle for
periodic series. An efficient algorithm to compute the autocovariance structure
of a PARMA model will be explored. Changepoint and homogeneity methods for
periodic series, an issue that arises when weather recording stations move, will
also be investigated.

The developed mathematical and statistical results are used to settle some
climatological problems. A study of the trends in monthly temperature means and
extremes from United States stations will be conducted. This detailed study will
enhance our understanding of climate change and global warming. The changepoint
aspect is perhaps the data's most important feature. Periodicities in the
autocovariances in the data need to be parsimoniously modeled to compute
accurate standard errors. Standard errors are needed to gauge the reliability of
the computed trends. The methods also yield improved forecasts of periodic
series as a byproduct.
