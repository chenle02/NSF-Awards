The Physics Department is furnishing two dedicated computer laboratory rooms,
each with 13 multimedia computer workstations and a portable capture
workstation. The 26 workstations are being networked to a file server that
contains a library of video clips. The department is also purchasing Pasco
Science Workshop Interfaces, probes, dynamica tracks, and carts for MBL
experiments. Video cameras, VCRs, laserdisc players, and video clips are
available for students to do video experiments. Two student workstations are on
an NT-shaped worktable with a primary group of four students collaborating on an
experiment. Six worktables are placed in a U formation around a lab room so that
the instructor can monitor students' progress at a glance. The Tools for
Scientific Thinking curriculum for MBL experiments and Workshop Physics
curriculum for video experiments are being adapted for the use of multisection
elementary physics courses with large lecture sizes. These curricula encourage
students to take an active role in their learning and construct physical
knowledge from actual observation.
