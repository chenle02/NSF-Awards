This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009.
The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for
the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The
title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Rebecca Davidson
is "Dissecting biochemical pathways associated with plant development traits
using a systems biology approach in rice, a model plant species." The research
and training supported by this fellowship is being conducted at Michigan State
University under the sponsorship of Dr. Robin Buell.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is an economically important crop worldwide. It was the
first monocot plant to be the subject of large scale studies of its genome, its
total genetic makeup, and the patterns of expression of the genes, the
transcriptome. A recent genome-wide assessment of genetic diversity among twenty
distinct varieties of rice (OryzaSNP set) resulted in the identification of over
150,000 polymorphic sites. Given this array of genomic and genetic data, as well
as the availability of advanced plant materials, rice is an excellent biological
system for studying the complex interactions and genetic determinants
controlling plant development traits in nature. This project is generating both
global transcript profiles and metabolite fingerprints for phenotypically
diverse and well-genotyped rice varieties. These datasets are being integrated
with a variety of trait data using a holistic approach toward understanding the
genes influencing biochemical processes that are integral to rice development.

This project affords the Fellow training opportunities in computational methods
for high throughput data analysis, database and website design, statistical
genetic analyses and biochemical pathway modeling. The fellowship increases the
participation of underrepresented groups at the postdoctoral level and through
mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. The extensive biochemical
phenotyping of the OryzaSNP set is part of a larger effort to improve rice
production and provide a comprehensive framework for systems biology studies in
plants.
