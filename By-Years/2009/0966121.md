This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented but financially-
disadvantaged students in computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering. The
scholarships are supporting three cohorts of nine students through completion of
the final three years of an integrated five-year baccalaureate and master's
degree program. Community college transfer students, as well as engineering
students who have completed their first two years of study at the host
institution, are eligible for scholarship support. The program is recruiting
students who would otherwise complete only an undergraduate degree to instead
stay and complete a master's degree. Student cohorts are being formed by having
participating students enroll in common junior and senior projects courses.
Students are being supported by a seminar course specifically designed for
scholarship recipients and by individualized mentoring from faculty members.
Students are also being encouraged to take advantage of paid internship
opportunities with a variety of local companies. The goals of the program
include increasing the number of students from under-represented groups who
complete a master's degree, increasing the number of graduating students who are
successfully placed with local industries, and improving the professional
development aspects of the participating engineering programs.
