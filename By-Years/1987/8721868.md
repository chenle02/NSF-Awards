Forested stream beds in the American Midwest are important components of the
overall ecosystem of the region. They are critical determinants of water flow
and retention, and they are strongly affected by human-induced changes such as
dams and channelization. They are also major sites that affect vegetation
species changes. Professor Malanson will examine seedling establishment and tree
growth in both dammed and less managed rivers in Iowa and determine the
relationships among seedling establishment and growth, flooding, soil moisture,
and light, in relation to species dispersal. Field data will be used to develop
a mathematical model that simulates seedling establishment and tree growth in
different kinds of river corridors. Professor Malanson's research will enlarge
our understanding of processes producing short- and long-term vegetational
change in both managed and unmanaged riparian areas.
