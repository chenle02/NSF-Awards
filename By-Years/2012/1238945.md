This award will provide support for the 2012 NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution
of Infectious Diseases PI meeting in Berkeley, California. The meeting will
facilitate scientific exchange by connecting investigators supported through
NSF's EEID program. Each investigator will present new discoveries and receive
feedback from peers. The conference will provide a venue for scientific exchange
and discussion on research questions and challenges of relevance to the EEID
grant program. The meeting will enhance the quality of research supported by
NSF's EEID program, by promoting networking and peer review among funded
investigators. It will foster productive new research collaborations among
scientists in related areas of study, integrate young investigators into a
research community and enrich their training, and accelerate the pace of
learning, by exposing researchers to others' work.
