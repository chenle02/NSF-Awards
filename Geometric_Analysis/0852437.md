This proposal seeks travel support for the US participants at an international
meeting that will be held in Rome, Italy, in 2009. The topic of the meeting will
be Kahler and Sasakian geometry. These two flavors of geometry currently provide
us with the best methods available for proving the existence of Einstein metrics
on many smooth compact manifolds. The primary intellectual merit of the project
stems from the manner in which the meeting is expected to lead to an exchange of
key technical insights between leading researchers in these distinct but
intimately related areas of global differential geometry. International meetings
play a key role in the development of both pure mathematics and theoretical
physics. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the real importance
of a new idea or technique really only becomes a matter of broad consensus after
it has been given prominent treatment at such an international gathering. The
Rome meeting will thus offer a key opportunity to highlight the ground-breaking
contributions recently made by US-based mathematicians to the study of
Einstein's gravitational field equations in Euclidean signature. This topic
represents an important arena of interaction between mathematical fields as
diverse as topology and partial differential equations, and moreover has
profound ramifications for areas of theoretical physics such as quantum gravity
and string theory. The Rome meeting should thus result in a lively exchange of
ideas, not only between mathematicians and physicists, but also between American
and foreign scientists.
