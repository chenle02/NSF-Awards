Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a curriculum
framework for undergraduate and graduate programs in Information Assurance. The
framework includes: identification of broad areas of knowledge considered
important for practicing professionals in information assurance, identification
of key learning objectives for each of these areas, identification of a body of
core knowledge and skills that all programs should contain, and a model
curriculum including scope and sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The framework's
development is undertaken via a workshop of leading information assurance
educators leading to a draft document which will then be widely distributed for
comment and dissemination.
