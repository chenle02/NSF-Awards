Almost everywhere in the world it is possible to find marine structures, even
some relatively new ones, which contain cracked or spalled concrete usually
involving corrosion of the reinforcement. Several methods of controlling
corrosion, have been adopted, but premature corrosion in the splash zones
continues to be a problem of serious concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic
philosophy of the 60's "to replace and not to renovate" was consistent with
relatively low constructional costs and the "throw-away" attitude. However, the
current concerns regarding economic considerations, energy issues, and
environmental problems have significantly altered this mode of thinking. New and
innovative developments in materials technology make repair procedures feasible
and very cost-effective. This is an identified need for innovative repair
concepts for marine piles with lower costs than conventional patch repair
methods that require expensive maintenance techniques. The repair concepts will
generally be to restore or enhance one or more of the following: durability,
structural strength, function, and appearance. Cost-effectiveness is an
important factor for feasibility of application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project, a joint experimental investigation of Florida Atlantic
University and the Universities of Mayab and Campeche in Mexico, will lead to
the development of appropriate structure-specific and environment-specific
repair procedures. The developed methodology will help the coastal engineer to
design durable strengthening schemes, ii) select the most appropriate repair
procedure from available options, and iii) predict the degree of strengthening
and performance for specific options. The repair procedures will provide
valuable input to Coastal Repair and Rehabilitation Manuals.&lt;br/&gt;
