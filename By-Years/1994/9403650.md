This award will enable researchers at three institutions (Rutgers, Mt. Sinai,
and Rockefeller) to continue strengthening and focusing their collaborative
efforts in the area of computational methods for analyzing genetic regulatory
sequences. Methods for sequencing nucleic acids have made available the fine
structure of many regions known to play a role in genetic function.
Unfortunately, the automated recognition of sequence signatures of these regions
remains problematical. This multidisciplinary team of biologists, biochemists,
and computer scientists will focus on methods for searching for regions of
imputable biological activity in DNA sequence data.
