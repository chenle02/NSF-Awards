This research consists of a three year study of crack healing and pore
morphology evolution using engineered flaws in controlled-misorientation doped
and undoped sapphire bicrystals. The flaws are created by photolithographic
techniques which allow, for the first time, detailed and independent analyses of
the effects of grain boundary misorientation (structure) and chemistry on high
temperature crack healing and pore morphology evolution processes (which occur
in sintering and diffusion bonding of ceramics and multilayer laminates).
Detailed characterization of these processes is being done using optical
microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and scanning transmission electron
microscopy with microchemical analysis.
