Many of the challenges facing contemporary society, such as emission reductions
or vaccination for infectious diseases, are collective action problems. To
address these challenges, new approaches are needed to understand, stimulate and
sustain collective action in large heterogeneous populations. To promote
cooperative behavior at large scales, this project will develop computational
tools to facilitate the context for cooperation - homogeneity, effective
communication - observed in smaller scale case studies and field experiments.
The investigators will test new ways to increase collective action using mobile
applications and social media.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will use
controlled decision-making experiments to test whether contributions to
collective action can be increased by providing the right messages to the right
people, such that cooperative behavior can cascade through a social network.
Empirical research has shown that individuals are more likely to participate in
collective action if they expect others like them to participate. Experiments
will be performed in online social networks of students at Arizona State
University to test the proposed approach to actualizing collective action within
the university community. Data from the experiments will be used to develop
mathematical models of collective action in social networks. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The research will lead to new theoretical frameworks
for understanding collective action and provide concrete tools to apply these
insights. Insights about what kind of feedback to whom is most effective for
increasing collective action may make social media a potential effective policy
tool for organizations. Potentially, the project will have societal impact by
promoting collective action in important areas such as healthcare, voter
participation, and energy conservation.
