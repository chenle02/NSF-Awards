The Mycological Herbarium of the Pennsylvania State University contains
approximately 67,500 specimens of fungi and rust specimens, mostly from the
Western Hemisphere. These collections result from more than 75 years of active
research on fungi by Penn State faculty members. The collection has been
transferred to the University's Mont Alto Campus, and is now the curatorial
responsibility of Dr. C. B. Wolfe, Jr. Dr. Wolfe proposes to inventory the
collection and arrange it in new compactorized storage cabinets. The transfer of
the collection to the Mont Alto Campus means its continued use and supervision
by a highly qualified curator. This important resource will remain accessible to
the research community, and an active training program in mycology will persist
in the Pennsylvania State University system. Natural history collections such as
this are irreplaceable sources of information on the biota of the world. Future
research depends on their continued growth and proper care.
