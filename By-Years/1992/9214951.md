Gray The rapid evolution of LSI and VLSI digital technologies has resulted in
much wider utilization of digital techniques for signal processing and control
applications than in the past. As the level of integration of such systems
continues to increase, it has become more and more desirable to implement the
Analog/Digital (A/D) conversion function on the VLSI control or signal
processing device itself. Great progress has been made in the past ten years in
the implementation of analog functions of various types of MOS LSI technology,
using NMOS initially, then CMOS as that technology matured, and most recently
BiCMOS technology. This research is directed towards new architectures and new
approaches to monolithic A/D conversion which more closely approach the
fundamental limits imposed by the technology used to implement them. Topics of
emphasis include self-calibration techniques for high-speed, high resolution
pipeline A/D converters, properties of parallel pipeline, or "systolic" A/D
converters, micropower high speed A/D converters using charge transfer signal
processing, optimum decoding algorithms and stability and scaling in oversampled
A/D converters, approaches to very high speed oversampled A/D converters, and
performance limits for the electromechanical sigma-delta A/D converter used for
readout purposes in sensor applications.
