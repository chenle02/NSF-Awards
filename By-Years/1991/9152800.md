This project expands the existing undergraduate research program for Computer
Science majors, and enhances certain advanced elective courses which prepare
students to do research. These courses are Computer Vision, Neural Networks,
Graphics, and Artificial Intelligence. Some of the students taking these courses
have been motivated to continue with independent research projects, with at
least three being supported by REU grants. In addition, all seniors are required
to complete a senior research project, and a number of students have presented
papers on their research in national and regional conferences. The addition of
three Sun workstations and a scanner, together with the supporting software,
will broaden the scope of projects that students can undertake, and also provide
facilities for more undergraduates to participate in research projects.
