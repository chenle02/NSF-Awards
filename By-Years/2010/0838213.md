Trichodesmium are colonial marine N2-fixing cyanobacteria that contribute
significantly to new nitrogen pools in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical
oceans. Due to the high iron requirement for diazotrophic growth and the low
availability of iron in oceanic waters, iron availability has been proposed to
be an important limiting factor for Trichodesmium growth and N2 fixation.
Currently little is known about the mechanisms employed by Trichodesmium to
acquire iron. In this project, bacteria living in close association with
Trichodesmium colonies are being studied in their role in facilitating colony
iron acquisition, through the production of Fe chelating agents (eg.
siderophores). These PIs are characterizing the microbial community associated
with Trichodesmium colonies, and investigating the ability of the community to
produce iron-complexing compounds by using cultivated strains, close relatives
of community members, or molecular approaches. Radiotracer studies of
Trichodesmium uptake of dissolved and colloidal iron, including iron complexes
with marine siderophores from Trichodesmium-associated bacteria are being
carried out both in the laboratory and in the field. Molecular and uptake
studies are being carried out with both cultivated and natural populations.
Cultivation of non-axenic and axenic Trichodesmium strains are allowing
comparison of siderophore uptake and colloidal iron dissolution with and without
the presence of bacteria. Collection of natural populations are being carried
out in conjunction with ongoing programs at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series
station (BATS) and the Hawaii Ocean Time-series study (HOT) as well as on
cruises of opportunity.
