The Laser Electro-Optics Technology Department and the Mechanical Engineering
Technology Department are jointly enhancing their curricula by developing a
Laser Materials Processing Lab. According to the Department of Defense and the
Department of Commerce, the field of photonics, which includes laser materials
processing, has been included in the list of critical technologies to be
supported by the Federal Government as an enabling technology that will
significantly enhance global competitiveness. By integrating specific components
from both the Mechanical Engineering Technology program and the Laser Electro-
Optics Technology program, this project can develop a working laboratory that
addresses the need for advanced training in state-of-the-art manufacturing
technology with specific emphasis on laser applications. Over the past decade,
the use of laser technology in the manufacturing sector has increased
dramatically, especially in the areas of materials processing (precision
cutting, welding, drilling, and heat treating), submicron marking and etching,
automated laser-based inspection systems for quality assurance, and laser-based
micropositioning and measurement systems. Access to such equipment by students
enriches the already diverse laser and mechanical engineering technology
curricula. With the opportunity to engage in hands-on applications employing
real-world laser processing equipment in a laboratory setting, students can be
significantly better prepared to pursue technical careers in the industrial and
manufacturing sectors or to continue their studies at the university level.
