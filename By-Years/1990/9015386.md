This research program includes tests of the Newtonian law of gravity on a
laboratory distance scale, searches for new intermediate range forces at
strength levels below those currently detectable, and tests of the equivalence
principle which underlies the theory of general relativity. The Irvine group
plans: (1.) An improved version of their recently conducted experiment for a
composition dependence in the apparent gravitational force acting on lead and
copper test masses due to a local lead attracting mass. They expect to compare
these forces to a few parts in 10 million. (2.) Construction and operation of a
rotatable torsion balance, which will be used initially in the laboratory to
test the equivalence principle using the earth and sun as acceleration sources,
and later at a mountain site with low microseismic background for an improved
equivalence principle test and for an ultra high sensitivity search for
composition dependent forces. (3.) A test of the inverse square distance
dependence of the gravitational force from 2mm to 2 cm. These experiments will
provide a high-precision foundation for our knowledge of the gravitational
force.
