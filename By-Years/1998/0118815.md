The objective of the proposed research is to study the microbial production of
flavor compounds based on metabolic and genetic engineering. The primary
objective is to investigate the response of the central metabolic pathway in
Escherichia coli in the presence of perturbations in the cofactor CoA. The
specific goals of the research are to: (1) study the redistribution of metabolic
fluxes in E. coli with alteration of CoA metabolism by the use of mutant strains
with perturbations either in the synthesis or in the usage pathways of the
cofactor CoA, (2) examine the effect of these genetic manipulations on the
cellular capacity to produce flavor compounds under defined bioreactor
experiments, and (3) perform directed evolution of the alcohol acetyltransferase
to alter its specificity to make a different pattern of esters. The framework
developed in this research could be applied to the improvement of metabolic
function for bioprocess applications related to biobased industrial products.
