Hayes 9504071 The object of this proposal is to test innovative variations of
the IRAM approach so as to extend the range of systems that can be studied
efficiently and accurately using the Miller's cumulative reaction probability
method. Preliminary tests of these variations in the Miller approach, which is
based on the use of absorbing boundary conditions, have demonstrated that it is
possible to obtain accurate eigenvalues for the cumulative reaction probability
matrix without assembling the full, dense matrix. As a result, the basic
algorithm is both scalable and very efficient in an MPP environment because
standard sparse-matrix concepts can be used to assemble the matrix-vector
products required to execute the preconditioned IRAM approach.
