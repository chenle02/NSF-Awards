Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University proposes to support
technical services on R/V Marcus Langseth as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. R/V Langseth, a 235?
seismic survey vessel purchased in 2005 from Western GECO to be operated as a
geophysical research vessel (with some additional general purpose oceanographic
capabilities) is owned by the National Science Foundation It replaced R/V
Maurice Ewing, a 236? research vessel operated by LDEO from 1990 to
2005.&lt;br/&gt;LDEO is requesting funds to support both basic and specialized
services for operation of airgun seismic sources and multichannel seismic data
acquisition in both 2-D and 3-D modes. They propose to provide three technicians
on each seagoing research project to provide basic services and to maintain
equipment, calibrate sensors and provide support for qualified users. Additional
personnel are included for operation of the specialized seismic systems. The
budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing
grant.&lt;br/&gt;
