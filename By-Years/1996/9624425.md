The research component of this CAREER grant aims to uncover and develop
principles for cooperative information systems (CIS). CIS are multi-agent
information systems in which search, enterprise integration, and reactive system
approaches are employed, and which are geared toward open information
environments. The research goal of this project is to uncover principles of CIS
and to realize them in primitives that can be used for building applications in
open information environments. Using formal languages for inter-resource
constraints, communication and activity behaviors of agents, and classes of CIS
computations for applications of interest, a CIS agent toolkit will be built.
The educational component of this CAREER grant focuses on the development of
courses and supporting technologies based on CIS techniques and principles.
