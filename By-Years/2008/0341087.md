In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Darin Ulness of Concordia College at Moorhead will
conduct experimental and theoretical research on the development of noisy light
spectroscopy as a tool for investigations of ultrafast dynamics in liquids. The
interaction of noisy light with liquids in Raman-based nonlinear optical
processes will be studied. The results of this investigation will be used to
develop Raman-enhanced Kerr effect spectroscopy [I(3) RIKES)] into an analytical
tool for probing ultrafast liquid dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project will make a positive impact on the science program of Concordia College
in that it is suitable for participation not only by chemistry, but also by
physics and biology students and faculty. The work will be conducted with the
assistance of postdoctoral research associates and undergraduate students. These
associates and students will receive training and exposure in a forefront area
of contemporary physical chemistry that will prepare them for advanced study or
entry into the scientific/technological workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
