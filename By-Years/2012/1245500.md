This project is developing an innovative introductory biology course to better
prepare K-8 science teachers for the increasing demands of science education.
The Next Generation K-12 Science Standards, which are the national "common core"
for K-12 science education, include an increased emphasis on the use of
scientific practices in K-12 science education. The vision of the new standards
is to more fully integrate the teaching of science concepts with inquiry-based
investigations performed by the students. Because many teachers have come
through a traditional method of science instruction in our colleges and
universities they have no personal frame of reference upon which they can model
the design of inquiry-based instruction. By designing a college biology course
for preservice elementary (K-8) teachers that integrates science content,
scientific processes, and scientific pedagogy, the project is increasing the
ability of teachers to design and implement inquiry-based lessons and better
prepare them to be effective "Next Generation" science
teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project involves improving
teacher quality with the expectation of having a cascading effect on the quality
of science education regionally and nationally. This project is helping develop
and disseminate a new way of educating science teachers that integrates the
science content, practices, and pedagogy.
