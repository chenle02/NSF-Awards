Commercial and government entities now spend around $10 billion per year on
software and hardware systems for managing "data warehouses", which are very
large electronic data archives. Despite the size and importance of this
marketplace, existing data management solutions can be painfully slow (see, for
example, www.tpc.org/tpch/ for recent benchmarking results). It is now possible
to spend millions of dollars of hardware and software for a system that still
takes hours to answer simple analytic questions. This is unfortunate, because
there is much knowledge to be gained by interactive exploration of electronic
archives. Very long processing times make it likely that the data will stored
away, and never looked at again.

The DBO Database System project is concerned with the design and development of
a unique system called DBO. Like traditional relational database systems, DBO
can run database queries from start to finish and produce exact answers over
very large archives. However, unlike any existing research or production system,
DBO uses sampling algorithms to produce a statistical estimate for the final
query answer at all times throughout query execution. An example of the sort of
estimate produced by DBO is, "There is a 95% chance that the true answer is
between $1.75 million an $1.80 million". The longer a user waits, the more
accurate the estimate becomes. The potential benefit of such an estimate is that
a user can stop execution whenever satisfied with the accuracy of the estimate,
which may translate to dramatic time savings during exploratory processing. In
this way, the goal of the DBO project is to render interactive data analysis a
reality, even over the largest databases.
