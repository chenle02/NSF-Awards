This research is concerned with inference for longitudinal data, such as of
survival analysis and time series type. Tests and confidence intervals in such
problems are typically based on the asymptotic behavior of martingales. This
project will focus on more accurate ways of setting critical points in such
inference. One approach to this problem is to transform the martingales to
create statistics more accurately approximated by the asymptotic distribution.
Another approach is to look for better approximations to the law of the
martingale, via Edgeworth or saddlepoint expansions, or bootstrapping. The
research is intended to improve the way statisticians interpret data from
processes that evolve over time. Main cases are (1) long term medical data,
where patients are followed over a period of time, and (2) economic data. These
quite different types of settings can be studied with a relatively unified
technology, which relates to the theory of fair games. Substantial gains in how
data are interpreted can be obtained by further exploiting this connection.
