This grant to the University of Pittsburgh supports research and graduate
education using the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron in Geneva, Switzerland, to
study very high energy proton and heavy ion interactions with nuclei. The
experiment will use a specialized magnetic spectrometer to measure the source
size of the "fireball" produced in the nuclear reactions through the
identification of correlated pions and kaons which are ejectiles in the
reactions.
