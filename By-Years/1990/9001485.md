The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Peter A. Jacobi
of the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University by means of an
Accomplishment Based Renewal award. He will continue to develop methodology that
leads to the preparation of ring-containing organic molecules. The specific
process, known as bis-heteroannulation, affords fused-ring furans, prepared with
complete regiochemical control. The key element in Dr. Jacobi's approach
involves the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction between an oxazole and an
acetylene. In addition to the bis-heteroannulation work, tandem sigmatropic
rearrangements will be used for the tranformation of acetylenic alcohols or
enones into methylenecyclopentanones or phenols. Syntheses of a number of
naturally occuring phenols and sesquiterpenes will illustrate the usefulness of
the methodology.
