In this research Harris will continue to study the arithmetic of holomorphic
and non-holomorphic automorphic forms and relations with special values of
L-functions. It will concentrate on the conjectures of Deligne on the special
values of L-functions attached to the cohomology of algebraic varieties in the
only cases in which these L-functions are known to be tractable: namely, when
they can be realized as automorphic L- functions. Automorphic functions are
complex analytic functions that encode number theoretic information and allow
one to bring the powerful machinery of analysis to bear on the number theory
problems. In this case the area of application is in arithmetic algebraic
geometry, namely in the area of number theory connected with the solutions of
systems of polynomial equations. This then becomes a sweeping area of study
encompassing most areas of mathematics in its tools. Harris is a master of this
and much exciting mathematics will result from this research.
