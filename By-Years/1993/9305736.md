Late-stage contractional orogenesis commonly involves a component of
extensional collapse, due to crustal overthickening, but extension is thought to
affect primarily the upper parts of the system. The Grenville province of
southern Ontario exposes deeper structural levels of a mid to late Proterozoic
collisional orogeny, and recent results indicate that this deeper portion also
underwent significant late-stage extension. This study will examine additional
ductile shear zones that occur in the Grenville in this area in order to test
the idea that late-stage extension is a fundamental component of Orogenic
architecture in both shallow and deep structural positions.
