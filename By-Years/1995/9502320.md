Arun Yethiraj is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the static and
dynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solutions. The conformational properties
of the polyelectrolyte molecules in dilute solution will be investigated as a
function of ionic strength. The predictions of the theory will first be tested
against molecular simulations for a simple model. The theory will then be used
to investigate the conformational behavior of a chemically realistic model for
polyacrylic acid. Simulations of two-molecule systems that incorporate the rest
of the solution via site-site solvation potentials will be performed in order to
estimate the importance of intermolecular interactions in polyelectrolyte
solutions. These simulations will also be used to interpret light scattering
experiments on polyelectrolyte solutions. Finally, single chain and two-molecule
Brownian dynamics simulations will be performed in order to investigate the
viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient as a function of ionic strength.
Yethiraj's teaching goals at the undergraduate level include: 1) promoting in-
class discussions; 2) promoting group learning; and 3) computer aided
instruction. In graduate level courses he will introduce computational
techniques ranging from ab initio and semi-empirical methods in quantum
chemistry to Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of classical
systems. Polyelectrolytes are charged macromolecules. They display a richer
variety of properties than neutral polymers, and they have a wide range of
technological uses, for example: as flocculants, dewatering agents,
demulsifiers, and drag reduction agents; as additives in detergents and
cosmetics; and in the manufacture of membranes, ion-exchange resins, gels and
modified plastics. The behavior of polyelectrolytes, however, is far from well
understood, and there has recently been an increased interest in obtaining a
better molecular level understanding of these systems. Yethiraj's research will
help to elucidate those molecular properties which are important in achieving
desired materials properties for polyelectrolyte systems.
