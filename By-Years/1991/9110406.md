Dr. Nessler is working on the major latex protein of opium poppy in transgenic
tobacco plants in order to provide information as to how hybrid proteins can be
specifically targeted to cellular compartments. The poppy laticifer cell type
has the ability to synthesize medicinally important alkaloids, therefore
understanding the protein targeting mechanism will help to elucidate the
regulation of secondary products in plant metabolism. Mr. Wooten plans to learn
to engineer gene constructs and to transfer them to vectors. He will, also
develop techniques for transforming plants with chimeric gene constructs and use
immunocytochemical techniques to localize chimeric proteins in transgenic
plants.
