9628199 Stixrude The PIs propose to apply their newly developed quantum
mechanical techniques to investigate the physical properties of the constituent
minerals of the earth's mantle. This new technique allows the calculation of
physical properties of minerals with large unit cells at high pressure and
temperature, which has up to now been impossible. These results will enable the
PIs to provide a firm theoretical basis for understanding the physics, chemistry
and mineralogy of the earth's mantle. ***
