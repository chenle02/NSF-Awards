Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project, in
collaboration with the Maine Department of Transportation, is to develop a
learning to learn course in order to initiate self- learning among Civil
Engineering undergraduate students. The core component of this course is a
studio-based learning environment, with opportunities for experience,
observation, conceptualization and experimentation. The basic philosophy is that
one of the essential skills necessary for life long learning is the ability to
self-learn which can be initiated through a self-learning experience. The
experiential learning model of Kolb provides the framework for building this
learning base based course that teaches students how to learn. The course
consists of a virtual tour of full-scale structures, discussion and thought
questions, use of animated schematics, and analysis of real world data from
full-scale structures.&lt;br/&gt;
