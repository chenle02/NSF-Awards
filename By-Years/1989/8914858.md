Antarctic benthic communities exist in an extremely cold and constant physical
setting. Although human activities have been conducted in Antarctica for many
years, little is known of the biological impact of such activities. With an
increasing emphasis on environmental health and safety issues, the United States
Antarctic Program is supporting research in these areas. This project will focus
on data collection designed to be used in environmental assessments, evaluation
of environmental recovery, and environmental decision making. This grant will
establish a benthic monitoring program to compare human-impacted benthic sites
near McMurdo Station to unimpacted sites in McMurdo Sound and Ross Sea. This
will involve four types of sampling and monitoring activities: sediment
chemistry, animal tissue chemistry, benthic communities, and bioassays. Standard
sampling and analytical techniques will be used, and will some include
modifications for the unique Antarctic conditions.
