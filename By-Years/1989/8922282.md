This is a continuation of ongoing research to test the extent to which certain
principles from coordination chemistry can be applied to surface reactions; it
has already been shown that the principle of conservation of orbital symmetry
can model the variation in rates as a function of index plane (crystal face) for
the decomposition of either nitric oxide or ethylene on platinum. In this study,
this is extended to hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons on platinum; ethane,
ethylene, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, and cyclopentane are studied. Past studies
show puzzling variation in structure sensitivity through this series. An attempt
to explain these will be made using a combination of theoretical and
experimental approaches, including electron energy-loss spectroscopy,
temperature-programmed desorption, scanning tunnelling microscopy, radiotracer
studies, and chemical kinetics. The ability to predict sensitivity and
energetics is essential for design and control of catalytic processes at the
molecular level. It is also pertinent to other problems in environmental control
and materials stability and performance.
