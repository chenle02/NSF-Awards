9405311 Flessa PIs and Mexican collaborator will attempt to develop a relatively
inexpensive geochronological tool for the analysis of Holocene, mixed-age
deposits. Amino acid racemization ratios will be calibrated by radiocarbon
dating in modern to 4,000-year-old mollusks from the cheniers of the Colorado
Delta of Baja California, Mexico.
