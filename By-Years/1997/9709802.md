This award is partial support for a workshop entitled "Symposium on Interactive
3D Graphics" to be held in Providence, Rhode Island, April 27-30, 1997. The
focus of the symposium is on the topic "Where is the frontier today in real
time, interactive 3D graphics? The purpose of the symposium is to look at what
research groups are doing with their high-performance, real-time, interactive
graphics systems, to find out what special-purpose graphics engines and
input/output devices are on the drawing board or being tested, and to discuss
which are the most user-friendly paradigms for interaction with 3D graphics
systems, including haptic and sonic capabilities.
