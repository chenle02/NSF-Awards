Abstract: With recent advances in algorithms for state-space traversal and in
techniques for automatic abstraction of source code, model checking has emerged
as a key tool for analyzing and debugging software systems. This proposal is
centered around the role of games in modeling and analysis of software systems.
Games are useful in modeling open systems where the distinction among the
choices controlled by different components (for instance, the system and its
environment) is made explicit. The first thrust of this research will
investigate application of games for component-based design and modular
verification. It will explore how games can be used to generate abstractions
that capture the most general environment assumptions needed to satisfy
requirements, and as dynamic types for interfaces. The second thrust will
address the challenge of scalability in presence of high computational
complexity of the analysis problems. Symbolic techniques and heuristics for
solving games with partial information will be developed using satisfiability
solvers and packages for manipulating binary decision diagrams. These techniques
will be implemented and and applied to case studies in domains such as network
protocols, device drivers, and medical devices.
