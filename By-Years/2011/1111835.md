Arun Yethiraj of the University of Wisconsin is supported by an award from the
Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop coarse-
grained models for polymers and ionic liquids. The quantity of primary interest
is the phase behavior. Physical insight will be obtained by studying single
chain properties, the free energy of association between chains, and the
properties of the polymers in the one phase region. Of particular interest for
ionic liquid solutions is the correlation between the polymer behavior and the
nano-structured heterogeneous nature of the solvent. The proposed research will
focus on the role of chemical details and solvent effects on the properties of
the polymers. This has been an un-explored area of research to
date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yethiraj group will carry out research on
understanding how polymers behave when they are dissolved in ionic liquids.
Ionic liquids have the potential to substitute for environmentally less benign
solvents. The research is aimed at developing chemically realistic models for
polymers and ionic liquids that incorporate a high level of detail, but are
nevertheless amenable to large-scale computation for realistic molecular
weights. This will be achieved by adapting recent advances in the development of
molecular models for biological systems.
