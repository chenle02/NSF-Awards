Professor Michael De Rosa in the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State
University, Delaware County Campus is supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on new syntheses of
2-aminopyrroles and the development of new routes to various polycyclic
compounds by cycloaddition reactions of 2-aminopyrroles. Diels-Alder and inverse
electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions with 2-aminopyrroles will be investigated
to form novel heterocycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic
and Macromolecular Program, Professor De Rosa is developing new methods for
preparing various organic compounds which may have useful pharmaceutical
applications. The research will be carried out with the assistance of
undergraduate students who will receive extensive training in organic synthesis
methodology.
