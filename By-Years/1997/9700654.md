EEC-9700654 Shannon Abstract This award provides funding to the University of
Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), under the direction of Dr. Thomas Shannon, for the
support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled,
"Combined Research-Curriculum Development on Maintenance and Reliability
Engineering." This project's goals are to focus on the incorporation of the
latest developments in Maintenance and Reliability Engineering (MRE) into a
well-structured academic program. New courses to be developed will strengthen
the MRE certification program that involves course work, industrial experience
and research. These courses are: 1. Introduction to maintenance engineering; 2.
Maintenance planning, management and performance evaluation; 3. Machinery
condition monitoring and diagnosis; and 4) Reliability and life prediction
technology. The CRCD program will be managed by the Maintenance and Reliability
Center (MRC), which was formed by the UTK Colleges of Engineering and Business
Administration to broaden the MRE academic and research capability.
