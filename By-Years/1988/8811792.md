Research will be performed in the following: 1) Use of the electromagnetic
probe, mostly with the (e,e'p) reaction, to study the reaction mechanism and
phenomenology: q-dependence, y-scaling and delta-excitation. In addition a
number of experiments to separate the response function L, T and LT are planned.
Future measurement of the separated spin structure functions are being planned
and a feasibility study of a measurement of the neutron charge form factor is
underway. 2) Structure of the deuteron as revealed in selected reactions,
including breakup of polarized deuterons, measuring the polarization transfer,
and separation of the longitudinal and transverse response function in (e,e'p)
and (e,e'n). 3) Study of the emission of nuclear gamma rays following inelastic
transitions induced by polarized protons on nuclei. In addition a new study of
the single charge exchange process for II-'s at rest is to be continued. 4)
Preparation of several experiments for the initial program at CEBAF.
