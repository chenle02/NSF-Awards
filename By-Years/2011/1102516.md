In plasmas, charged particles move together in concert to produce density or
velocity patterns that oscillate in time in what are called collective modes.
Collective modes often dominate the properties of plasmas, such as their
stability, so it is crucial to understand them. This work will study ion
collective modes in ultracold neutral plasmas for the first time. Ultracold
neutral plasmas are created by laser ionization of clouds of atoms that have
been cooled to temperatures as low as 1/1000th of a degree above absolute zero.
In addition to expanding our fundamental understanding of an exotic regime of
nature, these experiments may shed light on the physics of dense plasmas in
thermonuclear devices or the cores of gas giant planets.

The broader impact of this proposal starts with the training of graduate
students for careers in science and technology. It is augmented by the diversity
of Rice's physics program and strength of Rice's geographical location for
attracting minority students to the program. One third of the students who have
worked on these projects in the past have been women, and one third have been
under-represented minorities. An additional goal of the project is to attract
and retain more students in science and engineering through involvement of
undergraduate students. These experiments are ideal for this purpose because
concepts are accessible and lasers capture students' imaginations.
