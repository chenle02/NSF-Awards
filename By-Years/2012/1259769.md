The John Jay Forensic Science and Computer Science Scholarship supports
academically talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining
baccalaureate degrees in Forensic Science and Computer Science at the John Jay
College of Criminal Justice within the City University of New York (CUNY). The
project features culturally sensitive recruiting within diverse student
audiences at CUNY and at New York City public schools, and builds on a prior
successful S-STEM award during which retention rates have steadily risen.
Cohort-building and academic-support activities for scholars include faculty and
peer mentoring, opportunities to participate in undergraduate research, and a
variety of social and community activities to increase both academic and social
engagement. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its thorough and
nuanced approach to support student recruitment and success by supplementing
financial support with practices grounded in the literature on retention and
engagement, particularly for students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The
broader impacts include expanding and diversifying the local and regional
workforce in high-needs areas of forensic and computer science, as well as
providing a model approach for supporting diverse, academically talented
students in these fields.
