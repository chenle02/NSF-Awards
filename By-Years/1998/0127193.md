Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a
powerful method for structure determination in organic chemistry. In addition,
it is critically important in chemical education, since interpretation of the
experiments compels students to confront the details of the structural theory.
Over the past decade the development of pulsed Fourier transform (FT) techniques
combined with the increased capability of small computers has led to vast
improvements in NMR instrumentation. It is essential that undergraduate students
at small institutions have some access to this type of analytical equipment.
Thus, this project has the following objectives: (1) Convert an operational
continuous wave (CW) spectrometer to a pulsed FT-NMR instrument through an
Anasazi upgrade (2) Use the upgraded spectrometer to enhance student learning in
the organic chemistry laboratory and participation in research in organic
chemistry (3) Expand student appreciation and knowledge of chemical concepts
through the use of more advanced FT-NMR techniques in the physical chemistry and
instrumentation laboratories (4) Make the data from the upgraded spectrometer
available through online services (5) Make FT-NMR spectroscopy available to
students at the College of New Rochelle. The conversion process retains the
durable magnet from the older spectrometer, but transfers instrument control to
a computer. The upgrade allows students to obtain hydrogen and carbon NMR
spectra, perform spectral editing tasks and produce correlated two-dimensional
spectra. Of considerable importance is that students are able to obtain routine
spectra rapidly and in a form that is electronically portable. The FT-NMR
spectrometer is being used to expand the current laboratory curriculum by
adapting a number of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education.
Exposing students to the high level of understanding of molecular structure and
dynamic chemical processes offered by FT-NMR is expected to have a profound
effect upon their educational experience.&lt;br/&gt;
