Over the next year, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) will
publish four Arctic environmental assessment reports and a second State of the
Arctic Environment Report (SOAER), and also conduct a Second AMAP International
Symposium on Environmental Pollution of the Arctic. The publication and the
international symposium will be based on updated information and a substantial
amount of additional data that were not available for similar activities in
1997-1998.

Acting on behalf of the U.S. federal agencies participating in AMAP, NOAA will
coordinate Federal support for the publications and the symposium. Other federal
agencies are expected to contribute (or have already contributed) $85, 500 for
these purposes. NOAA's Arctic Research Office will arrange transfer of all the
contributed funds to the AMAP Secretariat and will oversee expenditure of the
funds by the AMAP Secretariat.
