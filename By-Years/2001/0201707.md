This dissertation research will analyze organizational texts to evaluate the
degree of organizational isomorphism: the extent to which organizations come to
resemble each other in response to external institutional expectations. Texts
from universities and corporations will provide the principal data for these
analyses. Comparisons will be made between texts from individual speakers (e.g.,
university presidents) and from organizational sources (e.g., privacy policies).
Texts will be coded using two established computer programs and human coders.
