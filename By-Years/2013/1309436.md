Whether an animal lives alone or with others has important implications for
numerous aspects of an organism's biology. Social interactions and group living
are integral aspects of some of the most exciting and intensely studied topics
in behavioral biology, from the field of human psychopathology to investigations
of cooperative behavior and reproductive suppression in animal societies.
Understanding exactly how and why sociality evolves as an alternative to the
more common trait of solitary living observed in many animals has become a topic
of particular interest because growing evidence suggests that group living can
incur a number of costs; for instance, animals that live in large social groups
often experience an increased risk of exposure to parasites and communicable
diseases compared to solitary species. This project endeavors to elucidate the
ways in which social animals cope with the unique pressures associated with
group living, particularly with regards to immune function, by comparing the
variation in immune genes of closely related and ecologically similar species
that differ in their social organization. To do this, the project uses newly
developed, highly efficient laboratory procedures that allow sequencing of all
active genes at the same time, thereby providing a very complete picture of
immunogenetic variation. Characterizing the differences in immune genes between
social and solitary species will provide insights into which genes are
potentially responsible for allowing social animals - including humans - to cope
with increased pathogen pressures as well as a further understanding of how
disease resistance evolves and is maintained. Thus, by investigating the
behavioral correlates of variation in genes found in all mammals, this work will
inform current understanding of the mammalian immune system in general. This
research will also provide opportunities for undergraduate involvement in
research and training in both biology and bioinformatics
