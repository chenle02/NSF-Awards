A joint meeting of the Population Biologists of the Northeast (PBONE) and the
Southeastern Ecological Genetics Group (SEEGG) will be held at Virginia Tech on
May 17/19, 1990. Formal sessions will consist of three plenary addresses by
nationally known speakers from outside the PBONE-SEEGG area, 24 short talks by
participants, 36 talks by workshop participants, and poster sessions. A special
feature of these meetings are the invitations that have been sent to 200 or more
small colleges in a 5-state area (NC-TN-KY-VA-WVA) urging that their biology
professors and most promising undergraduate students (especially women and
members of minority group) attend. Special field trips and other exercises
planned for these invited guests; more importantly, however, is the opportunity
these meetings will give these young persons for observing how their peers from
larger institutions comport themselves and for these students to make contacts
that may facilitate their acceptance into graduate programs.
