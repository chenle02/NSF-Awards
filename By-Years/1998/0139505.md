This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Florida. Randolph
Duran is the site's Program Director and Benjamin Smith is the Co-Program
Director. Thirty faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the award
period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week
program. In addition to the recruiting efforts used in the past, a partnership
will be established with Tuskegee University to identify additional
underrepresented minority students. The students will live and interact with
French undergraduate students, as part of their experience. The research focus
is a biological and materials chemistry. Students will participate in weekly
seminars and will present their research results in the form of papers, talks,
and/or posters. There will be a three-day weekend post-REU meeting and poster
session each October after the program ends. Students will be surveyed several
times throughout the summer program and research mentors provide evaluations of
each student at the conclusion of the program. All students are tracked after
the program ends.
