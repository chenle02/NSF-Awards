This awards provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar 2014" that will be held November
1-2, 2014, on the campus of the University of Denver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference is the twenty-second installment of the West Coast Operator Algebra
Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of
mathematicians whose primary research interests are in various facets of the
theory of operator algebras. A sampling of the topical foci of the 2014 event is
given by the following: the Elliott program for the classification of
C*-algebras; applications of operator algebras to mathematical physics;
noncommutative geometry; the Baum-Connes conjecture; free probability and its
applications; subfactors and their invariants. The conference program provides
ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
