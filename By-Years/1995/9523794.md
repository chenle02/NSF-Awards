9523794 Suuberg The objective of this project is to conduct fundamental research
on a pyrolysis process that can be used to convert scrap tires into activated
carbon. The research involves establishment of optimum temperature, pressure and
gaseous environmental conditions that are necessary to produce carbon that has
porosity characteristics that permit its use in adsorption processes such as
devices to remove pollutants from water and air. Chars produced will be
evaluated for their adsorption behavior relative to significant classes of
adsorbates potentially present in water, wastewater and in gaseous products of
combustion such as organic substances, nitrogen oxides and mercury. The results
of the experimental work will be used in formulation of models that can be used
in engineering design of processes for converting waste carbonaceous materials
into "activated carbon," a useful form of carbon for removing pollutants from
water, wastewater and gaseous products of combustion. The investigator plans to
collaborate with personnel of Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., a firm that
conducted research under NSF Grant No. 92-15045 on the feasibility of using
discarded vehicle tires for producing marketable forms of carbon.
