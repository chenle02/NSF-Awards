A three day workshop will be held on the topic of marine riser mechanics during
September 29, 1992 through October 1, 1992. The purpose is to establish the
state of the art and outline a rational five-year research plan to address the
various aspects of analysis and design of marine risers. In particular, the
topics of design, structural mechanics, model tests and field measurements, flow
induced vibrations, and loading conditions will be studied. The best forty
people from around the world have agreed to particpate in this workshop,
contribute written discussions or papers and write the final report. The
majority of the people agreed to pay most of their expenses which provides a
high leverage to the NSF money. An important aspect of this effort is that it
will provide well though research advice to the NSF offshore Technology Research
Center of the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M at College
Station. The workshop will be organized and chaired by Professor Michael M.
Bernitsa who will also be the editor of the workshop report. Professor R. Miksad
of the University of Texas at Austin will co-chair the workshop.
