9560625 Mariwala This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will
develop a molecular sieve catalyst for selective hydrogenation of benzene to
cyclohexene. Currently, no commercial catalyst is available for shape selective
cyclohexene synthesis. The molecular sieve catalyst will combine the two unit
operations of reaction and separation into a single reactive separation step.
The selective synthesis will be accomplished by shape and size selective
discrimination of molecules involved in the reaction. In Phase I, molecular
sieve catalysts will be prepared for selective synthesis of cyclohexene. The
catalyst will be characterized for structure, morphology, and metal content. The
catalysts will be tested for shape selective hydrogenation activity. Cyclohexene
is expected to be a major feed stock for bulk chemical production and an
important chemical intermediate for specialty chemical industry. Use of
cyclohexene as a feed stock offers significant environmental, operational and
economic advantages.
