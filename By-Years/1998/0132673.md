CCR-0132673&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Assessment of Open-Source Software for High-
Performance&lt;br/&gt; Computing &lt;br/&gt;Edward B. Allen,
P.I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
implement an integrated program of empirical&lt;br/&gt;software-engineering
research and an exemplar of education in&lt;br/&gt;empirical methods for
undergraduate and graduate students in&lt;br/&gt;software engineering. This will
be achieved through research&lt;br/&gt;focused on assessing the quality of open-
source software for&lt;br/&gt;high-performance computing, and through
development of relevant&lt;br/&gt;courses and teaching
modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-performance computing is the platform of
choice in many fields&lt;br/&gt;of science and engineering that are critical to
modern society.&lt;br/&gt;Off-the-shelf software packages in this category
include tools to&lt;br/&gt;implement mathematical models, and middleware to
manage parallel&lt;br/&gt;and distributed computation. The open-source approach
of software&lt;br/&gt;development is becoming increasingly attractive in this
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities of this program will employ
empirical analysis&lt;br/&gt;methods to find ways to assess the quality of open-
source software&lt;br/&gt;for high-performance computing, enabling scientific
and engineering&lt;br/&gt;users to make better informed choices. Case studies of
selected&lt;br/&gt;software products will validate the practicality and
usefulness of&lt;br/&gt;obtaining such quality
assessments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software-engineering education in America is
largely lacking&lt;br/&gt;instruction in empirical analysis methods. A spectrum
of teaching&lt;br/&gt;materials targeted toward this need will be developed.
Research&lt;br/&gt;results and instructional materials will be disseminated
through&lt;br/&gt;publications and the NSF-sponsored Center for Empirically
Based&lt;br/&gt;Software Engineering (CeBASE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
