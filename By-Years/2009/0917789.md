This award is to support the 2009 Atmospheric Chemistry Gordon Research
Conference. The conference will be held in Waterville Valley, NH on August
23-27, 2009, and will be convened under the auspices of the Gordon Research
Conferences. The conference will bring together a large and diverse group of
scientists from the atmospheric chemistry community and related fields to
discuss new developments in chemical observations, mechanisms and models; the
formation, composition and impacts of aerosols; biomass burning; and the role of
atmospheric chemistry in climate change. Researchers at the frontiers of
atmospheric chemistry will meet in an informal setting and exchange ideas and
new information at the forefront of this field. Broader impacts stem from the
societal importance of atmospheric chemistry to air quality, public health, and
climate change, and also because at least 25 of the participants will be young
scientists at the beginning of their careers.
