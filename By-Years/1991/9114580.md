The objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav workshop in earthquake engineering between
Helmut Krawinkler of Stanford University and Peter Fajfar of the University of
Ljubljana is to identify cooperative research projects on nonlinear seismic
analysis of reinforced concrete buildings. The main topics for study are
mathematical modeling of earthquake-resistant structured walls and energy
response in aseismic analysis and design of buildings. The workshop will also
address repair and strengthening of existing structures and buildings. A total
of ten U.S. scientists from universities and the National Institute for
Standards and Technology and 10 Yugoslav scientists from 6 Yugoslav republics
will participate. This project is supported by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology through a joint fund consisting of
matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S.
contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are
involved.
