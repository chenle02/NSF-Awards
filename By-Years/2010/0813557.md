Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The Louisiana State Museum and Tulane University/Xavier
University Center for Bioenvironmental Research and the University of Rhode
Island Graduate School of Oceanography, along with several other research
collaborators, designers, evaluators, and the Times-Picayune newspaper are
partnering to develop a multi-pronged approach on educating the general public,
school children, teachers and public officials on the STEM-related aspects of
Hurricane Katrina and its implications for the future of New Orleans and other
parts of the country. The major products will be an 8,500 square-foot semi-
permanent exhibit, smaller exhibits for Louisiana regional libraries, a
comprehensive Web site on hurricanes, a set of studies on informal learning, a
case study for public officials about the relevance of science research to
policy and planning, teacher workshops, and a workshop for interested exhibit
designers from around the country.&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the field of
informal science education by exploring how museums, universities, and their
communities can work together to provide meaningful learning experiences on STEM
topics that are critical to solving important community and national issues.
