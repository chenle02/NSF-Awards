The research proposed here seeks the answer to two fundamental questions about
matter. The first is what role does the sea of strange quark-antiquark pairs in
the nucleon play in the determination of its electromagnetic properties? We are
participating in the G0 experiment at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility to address this issue. The experiment will measure the parity-violating
asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons from the proton and deuteron
over a wide range of momentum transfers;&lt;br/&gt;this will allow for the
strange electric and magnetic form factors to be separately extracted. This
experiment will be in a commissioning and data-taking phase during this grant
period. The second question is whether or not there is any new physics beyond
the Standard Model of electroweak physics. This question will be addressed by
the QWEAK experiment at TJNAF, which will measure the proton's neutral weak
charge via parity-violating electon scattering at very low momentum transfer.
This proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in the Standard Model; a
precise measurement of it is sensitive to many poplular scenarios for extending
the Standard Model. This experiment will be in a construction phase during this
grant period.&lt;br/&gt;
