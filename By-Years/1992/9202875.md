The objective of this proposal is directed toward the formation of non-spiking
ohmic contacts to p-type InP. It is proposed here to apply the principle of
solid phase regrowth (SPR) to fabricate such contacts to p-InP. Shallow contacts
(reaction depth&lt;100A) of mid 107n- cm2 contact resistivity have been achieved
on n- and p-type GaAs by the SPR method. The regrowth process begins with a low-
temperature reaction between a metal M (e.g. Pd or Ni) and a compound
semiconductor substrate, AB, to produce an intermediate ternary MxABy phase. A
subsequent reaction at a higher temperature between an overlayer of Si, Ge, or
In and the intermediate phase results in the decomposition of the intermediate
phase and the epitaxial regrowth of a layer of the compound semiconductor doped
or alloyed with the overlayer element. The nonstoichiometry of the intermediate
ternary MxABy phase (i.e. where y is not equal to 1) will allow the doping
element to occupy the preferential sites (site selection mechanism), thus
forming a highly doped surface regrown layer. A thin layer of doping element
(i.e. Mg, Mn, Si, or Ge) imbedded in metal M has been used to successfully
intentionally dope the regrowth layer to reduce the contact resistivity
significantly. In this project, the Pd- and Ni-based contact system will be
investigated since ternary compounds such as Pd4.8InP and Ni2.7InP have been
observed between Pd, Ni and InP at low temperatures. Overlayers of Ge, Si, In or
Sb will be investigated to drive the decomposition of the Pd (or Ni) ternary
compounds and the epitaxial regrowth of Inp. The effects of a thin layer of
embedded acceptor element on the electrical characteristics (i.e. Mn, Mg, or Zn)
will be carried out. In this research cross-sectional transmission electron
microscopy and backside secondary ion mass spectrometry will be used for
structural investigation, and Transmission Line Model measurements will be
utilized for electrical measurement. The SPR contacts are expected to provide
more uniform interfaces and lower contact resistivity compared to.
