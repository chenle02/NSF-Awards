With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the work of
Professor Hien Nguyen of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa.
Professor Nguyen will explore the development of new methods for the effective
preparation of alpha-configured glycosyl ureas and 1,2-cis-2-aminosugars via
transition metal catalysis. Successful development of these methods will provide
new and efficient approaches for the rapid assembly of a number of complex
carbohydrate targets, including potentially glycoconjugate-based tumor-
associated antigens, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and anti-tubercular drugs.
Specific targets for this project include the glycosyl urea antibiotic cinodine,
and glycosylphosphatidyl inositide (GPI) anchor pseudo-
oligosaccharides.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed
project will involve training both undergraduate students and graduate students,
in continuing to build a program that merges transition-metal-based catalysis
with carbohydrate synthesis. In this way, the project will provide
multidisciplinary training for these students, including those from groups
historically underrepresented in the sciences. There are also important
potential scientific broader impacts, as this work is expected to provide new
and generalizable methods for stereocontrolled glycosylation and
glycoconjugation to the glycoscience community.
