This project continues to fund the Committee of Engineering Education. The
particular project is The Engineer of 2020, which will provide a bold vision of
engineering in the future and explore the educational pathways that will enable
us to realize that future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Phase II,
which will develop strategies that will meet the needs of engineers and society
in 2020. The primary activity of Phase II will be a national summit of
engineering educators, employers, and policy makers to initiate a national
dialogue (based on the Phase I vision) on short- and medium-term term strategies
for engineering educators, funding organizations, and government agencies.
Follow-on surveys of a wider audience will provide feedback for refining
strategies and recommendations. The proceedings of the summit, survey results,
and a summary report, including recommendations for action, will be published in
a peer-reviewed National Academies report. Brochures highlighting the major
findings of the project and a specially designed website display will also be
used to publicize the results. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
