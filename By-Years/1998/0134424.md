0134424 Montas The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop an
excellent, unified and integrated program of research and teaching in
engineering computation applied to biological resources systems. The proposed
study consists of two educational components and three research components aimed
at achieving this goal. The educational objectives are to: 1) Develop an
undergraduate electronic textbook on engineering computation in biological
resources, and; 2) Integrate stochastic theory, wavelet analysis and decision
support into graduate level course contents and electronic documents.
&lt;br/&gt;Research objectives are to: 1) Develop the stochastic-continuum
theory of biotransport processes and validate it across biological resources
systems; 2) Assess the ability of wavelet-stochastic techniques to classify
biological resource image data; 3) Develop and evaluate decision support
applications in biological resources areas. Successful completion of this
project is expected to contribute significantly to engineering knowledge and to
excellent teaching of engineering computation applied to biological resources at
undergraduate and graduate levels.***&lt;br/&gt;
