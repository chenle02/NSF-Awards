9412017 Franzblau In this project, the principal investigator aims to obtain the
following results: (1) an implementation of a practical combinatorial algorithm
to compute bounds on degrees of freedom of a network (in 3 or more dimensions),
(2) new combinatorial conditions for rigidity or simple formulas for degrees of
freedom in families of graphs, (3) new, easily computed measures of medium-range
order in network models of glasses. The methods employed include those of
combinatorial optimization, graph theory, and discrete algorithm design.
Problems on network models are addressed largely through computer experiments,
and make use of algorithms developed and implemented by the investigator. This
project has two related aims, and is intended to contribute new results both to
mathematics and materials science. The first aim is to address key open problems
in the mathematical theory of rigidity, including computing the degrees of
freedom of a network (also called a graph). This theory has a long history,
which includes the work of Maxwell (1864) on determining whether a "scaffold"
made of rigid bars and movable joints is itself rigid. The second aim is to
address basic issues on network models of solids; such models (also called ball-
and-stick models), in which points represent atoms and connections between
points represent chemical bonds, are often studied to better understand the
properties of both crystalline solids and glassy materials. One focus is to
characterize the relationship between the structure of a network model and its
rigidity, and the other is to find useful measures which capture this network
structure. The work therefore leads to a better understanding of materials
properties.
