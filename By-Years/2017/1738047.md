Title: 2017 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) on A Spectrum of
Types&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides student travel and subsistence
for the 2017 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). This summer
school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students
to study theoretical topics related to programming languages and
methods/verification. The focus of this year's school is "A Spectrum of Types".
The broader significance and importance include building international community
and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US
students, including women and underrepresented minorities, with exposure to and
interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based
students, the school will thus train the next generation of programming
languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and
academia, nationally.
