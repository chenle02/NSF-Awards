This program comprises an experimental study of weakly- interacting Bose fluids
in one and two dimensions using photons as the interacting Bose particles. The
primary focus is on the fundamental processes of photon-photon scattering and
photon gas thermalization. The secondary focus of the project is measurement of
material properties of the photon fluid, particularly the phonon spectrum,
determined from speed of sound measurements.
