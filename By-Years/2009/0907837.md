AST-0907837&lt;br/&gt;Zweibel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interstellar and
intergalactic gas is pervaded by relativistic charged particles known as cosmic
rays, which account for a significant fraction of the energy density in the gas.
A fluid theory of cosmic rays has been developed in which collisions with tiny
electromagnetic fluctuations mimic collisions with particles, capturing cosmic
ray physics on large scales and allowing some beautiful simulations of galaxy
clusters and large scale structure formation. This project will extend and
generalize the fluid picture of cosmic rays so as to capture viscous effects and
to treat cosmic ray interaction with very weak magnetic fields in the
intergalactic medium and in galaxies and galaxy clusters at early times. This
improved picture will then be applied to assess the thermal stability and
overall viscosity of intracluster gas, to estimate the rate at which
intergalactic plasma is heated by cosmic rays, and to study the effects of
cosmic rays on the stability of hot X-ray cavities in clusters. This work
develops microscale physics through analytic calculation and state-of-the-art
numerical simulations of restricted scope. The small scale processes that will
be studied also apply to interstellar environments, to pulsar wind nebulae, and
even to laboratory plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will help to build
bridges between the plasma physics and high energy neutrino astrophysics groups
at the University of Wisconsin. The work involves postdoctoral training,
undergraduate research, and public outreach using existing facilities and
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
