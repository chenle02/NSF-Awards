This Americas Program award will support Dr. Robert Opila of the University of
Delaware for a planning visit to the Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal
do Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil to discuss a proposed joint
research project with Professor Jonder Morais. The proposed project would focus
on interfaces of importance to electronic and photonic devices. Among the topics
the research would focus on are injection of electrons and holes into organic
conductors for light emitting diode and photovoltaic applications, charge
transfer at dielectric/semiconductor and dielectric/metal interfaces for
electronic and magnetic applications, and methods to limit the susceptibility of
semiconductor lasers to metallic contamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area
of research has direct technological interest and relevance to the global
semiconductor industry. The visit will enable the researchers to discuss not
only the proposed research, but also the teaching and training of the students
associated with each group in terms of expected student exchanges. Such
exchanges would not only transfer research knowledge and expertise directly, but
they also contribute to the students' cultural education.&lt;br/&gt;
