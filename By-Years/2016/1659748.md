This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the SBE Directorate. It has both scientific and societal
benefits, and it integrates research and education. The Crime Analytics REU is a
ten-week summer program designed to help students develop research skills and
technical abilities in the multidisciplinary fields of data science and
analytics, and to prepare them for graduate study or employment in a data-
saturated economy following graduation. Specifically, the program seeks to: 1)
aggressively recruit a diverse subset of undergraduate students to actively
participate in innovative research projects that apply analytic tools to make
decisions about crime; (2) expose students to foundational analytic methods
early in their educational careers in hopes of encouraging their involvement in
data science and an analytics-based field of study; (3) expose and engage
students to research opportunities that demand communication and cooperation
across experts in traditional disciplinary boundaries; (4) enhance students'
educational experiences by exposing them to workshops, seminars, and social
activities that enrich their professional development and inspire them to pursue
graduate school; and (5) foster shared interdisciplinary communication skills by
offering opportunities to disseminate research findings via an annual
undergraduate research symposium, annual professional conferences, and peer-
reviewed journal outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crime Analytics-REU site is
modeled around a team-based pedagogical concept in which students will be
selected and assigned to interdisciplinary research teams that will use cutting-
edge data technologies to explore problems related to crime and criminal
justice. Students will be exposed to data science skills that include working
with large data sets, data mining and manipulation, machine learning, crime
mapping, quantitative modeling, and data visualization. Students will also be
taken to visit leaders in the data industry, such as SAS, Google, Apple, and the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's Crime Analysis lab. The research
projects will culminate with the preparation and submission of a research
manuscript for publication in an academic journal, and a public presentation of
their research. Students will also participate in social and cultural enrichment
activities as well as workshops designed to prepare them for graduate school and
or professional employment in the data analytics field.
