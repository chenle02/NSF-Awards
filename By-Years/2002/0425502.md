This grant will provide partial support for the Eighth International Conference
on Precipitation, planned for August 8-11, 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
This conference series promotes interaction among those atmospheric scientists,
hydrologists, mathematicians, and statisticians who are interested in
precipitation. The theme this year is quantifying uncertainty related to
precipitation, and four sub-themes have been selected: (a) the verification of
climate scale estimates of precipitation; (b) the quantification of
uncertainties in nonliquid precipitation (especially snow); (c) the connection
between atmospheric properties and rainfall statistical characteristics, and (d)
strategies for improving synergies between models and observation. The
conference organizers intend to produce a series of white papers following the
conference that will help define the status of the field and the opportunities
for the future. About 150 conference participants are expected, including many
graduate students and postdocs. Substantial other support for the conference is
also expected; about 10 participants can be supported fully by the NSF grant,
which will also provide some support for travel arrangements and the production
of publications and conference materials.
