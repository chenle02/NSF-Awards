This NSF project aims to develop data-driven algorithms for dynamic state-
estimation of modern power systems with uncertainties of distributed energy
resources. The project will bring transformative change to the state-of-the-art
dynamic state-estimators that heavily rely on accurate physics-based models and
are challenged by model uncertainties and disturbances. A combination of machine
learning and signal processing techniques will be used to convert available
measurements into accurate dynamic models. The intellectual merits of the
project include generating new knowledge on monitoring and situational awareness
in modern power systems as well as developing a novel data-driven paradigm to
improve smart grid resilience through dynamic state estimation. The broader
impacts of the project include addressing grid outages and resolving cascading
failures by better tracking power system asset dynamics in real-time. A number
of educational and outreach activities are also used to address
underrepresentation drivers in electrical engineering, such as summer research
activities for underrepresented students through STEM Summer Institute (STEM-
SI), custom-designed senior projects, and open-source materials available to the
scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to develop efficient
dynamic estimation techniques to better monitor and control inverter-dominated
grids, but there is a technical gap in modeling distributed energy resources
(DERs) that is not fully understood. To address this challenge, this project
will develop advanced data-driven approaches leveraging statistical machine
learning theory and available measurements to identify nonlinear mathematical
models of inverter-based DERs. Using the developed models, uncertainty-aware
decentralized data-driven dynamic state estimation of DER states will be
designed without the need for complex physics-based models or simulations. In
addition to providing accurate and state-aware dynamic models for various types
of DERs (such as storage, solar panels and wind generators), the research
results from the proposed framework will reduce the current complexity of
implementing dynamic state estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
