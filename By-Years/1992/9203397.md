Professor Sheingorn will work on several problems connected with automorphic
forms. In particular, he will study the consequences of the insight that certain
number theoretic objects are equivalent to geometric traits of geodesics on
highly symmetric spaces. Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry
in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have
thus long realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean
in their basic nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about
the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains
connection to its historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as
gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
