The aim of this project is to estimate the effects of cognitive skills,
socioemotional skills, and education on health behaviors, health-related
lifestyles, health, and longevity. In addition, the PI's goal is to uncover the
behavioral mechanisms behind the effects of skills and education on longevity.
He uses mediation analysis to show that health behaviors, lifestyles, earnings,
and job risk are major mechanisms behind the estimated effects. Formal education
is itself a major mediator and helps explain why early cognitive and
socioemotional skills affect health and longevity. The project has both
scientific and policy implications. It aims to demonstrate how college education
and socioemotional skills acquired in early life affect long run health-related
outcomes. The results will inform education policies such as student loans and
grants for college education and social interventions that help children improve
their socioemotional skills. It is expected that these social interventions
improve health outcomes and decrease health inequality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identification of causal effects is based on twin
fixed effects and its generalizations and on identification from a structure.
The PI leverages the fact that identical twins raised together share both genes
and family background. The team will use new data on mortality that were
collected for the Minnesota Twin Registry. Whether or not education has a causal
effect on longevity is still an unresolved question since many results in the
recent literature contradict each other. In addition, the PI investigates
developmental origins of health behaviors and other health-related outcomes.
Exploration of the mechanisms behind the effects of skill and education on
longevity requires a more structural approach. The team estimates a system of
recursive simultaneous equations that links skills to college education choice,
college education to mediators, and mediators to longevity conditional on
detailed background controls.
