The project addresses the theory of universal spaces for birational invariants
of algebraic varieties. One of the fundamental problems concerns the description
of a natural class of quotients of products of projective spaces by the
projective actions of abelian groups which held all finite birational invariants
of varieties defined over algebraic closures of finite fields. The second more
difficult problem which PI is going to address is to find a similar class of
universal varieties for finite and then for infinite l-adic invariants of
algebraic varieties defined over number fields.

The Galois theory of functional fields provides with a series of results
allowing to describe the cohomological birational invariants of algebraic
varieties through the group cohomology. Thus this project addresses the problems
at the interface of algebraic geometry, Galois theory and group theory. The PI
is going to relate finite birational invariants of functional fields which are
higher dimensional analogues of the nonramified Brauer group to the invariants
of special systems of abelian subgroups in finite abelian groups.
