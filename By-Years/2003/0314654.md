The most important traits in agriculture, medicine, evolution, and ecology have
a complex genetic basis. Significant progress has been made recently toward
estimating the number of genes that control these traits and the effects of
individual genes. To understand how trait differences become established between
species, however, the effects of these genes on viability and reproductive
output (i.e., fitness) must be determined in natural populations. In this
proposal, both genetic and ecological approaches will be employed to estimate
the fitness effects of eight genes (or small chromosomal segments that contain
them) that control differences between two sunflower species. The validity of
these estimates will be verified by analyzing the movement of these genes
between the two species when they hybridize in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed activities are anticipated to have broader impacts through research
training of underrepresented groups, undergraduate and graduate students, and
postdoctoral scholars. In addition, the genetic materials created in this grant
will be made freely available to other researchers. Sunflower is the only major
crop plant domesticated in the U.S., and the traits chosen for study are
important both to the diversification of wild sunflower species and to the
domestication and continued improvement of the cultivated sunflower. &lt;br/&gt;
