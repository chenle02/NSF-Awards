9451191 Sullivan The purpose of this project is to provide mechanical
engineering students with a highly interdisciplinary lab experience in the area
of instrumentation and control. The lab content is divided into three sections;
(1) generic characteristics of instrumentation systems, (2) Transducer systems,
and (3) interfacing and control. In the first section of material, dead weight
pressure testers are used to introduce static calibration concepts, while
spring-mass-damper systems are used to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of
instrumentation systems. In section (2), common transducer systems, (e.g. LVDTs,
strain gauges, thermo-couples etc.), are demonstrated. The third section of labs
introduces basic signal processing and control ideas. Noise reduction techniques
will be explored for measurement systems, and micro-computers will be used in
temperature control and motor speed control applications. The lab program
described here is designed to accelerate learning in the area of modern
instrumentation and control by drawing on students existing background in
mechanical engineering. Student projects based on case studies from industry
will be user to provide realistic experiences. The intended result is that
mechanical engineering students would gain very practical knowledge of
instrumentation and control not usually included in a mechanical engineering
curriculum.
