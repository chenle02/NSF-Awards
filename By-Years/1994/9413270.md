9413270 Tierney This award is being made through the Small Grants for
Exploratory Research program to collect data on the January 17, 1994 Northridge,
California earthquake. The Northridge earthquake illustrates the immense
potential for damage and social disruption that earthquakes present. It also
provides a natural laboratory in which investigators can obtain important
insight on earthquake response and recovery. This project will involve the
collection of perishable information that will shed light on emergency response
and recovery patterns and problems following the Northridge earthquake. ***
