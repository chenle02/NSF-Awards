A module for the introductory course in thermodynamics is to be developed which
is to be sufficiently flexible to match the learning styles of most engineering
students. The combined expertise of subject matter experts and teaching
psychology experts are used to define the boundaries and content of the module
and the order and method of presentation of material. Technologies appealing to
the visual senses, including use of computer controlled interactive displays of
full motion graphic images are exploited. Performance of students is to be
compared with that of students exposed to the standard lecture format, and the
results will be correlated. Results will be disseminated by sending a paper
submitted for publication outlining the results of the study and a videotape of
a sample lecture to all the mechanical engineering departments in the United
States. It is expected that this rapid dissemination of results will result in
the incorporation of some or all of this module into thermodynamics courses
taught by many engineering schools. In addition, it is hoped that the results of
this study will encourage professors to utilize the principles developed in this
research to develop courses in other areas such as dynamics, fluid mechanics,
and heat transfer.
