Experiences of structural failures in past earthquakes have shown that
shearwalls offer excellent protection for buildings in seismic regions. As
compared to the cantilever shearwalls, the framed shearwalls have an additional
advantage inasmuch as the wall panels can be used as sacrificial elements to
absorb seismic energy and protect the main structural frame. When a framed
shearwall is under earthquake action, the wall panels inside the frame are
subjected to shearing action. Considerable controversy has been raised in the
past regarding the effectiveness of wall panels in developing shear ductility.
Recent experimental studies in reinforced concrete show that shear ductility can
indeed be obtained in wall panels, if the reinforcement are correctly designed.
Additionally, the development of truss model theories allows for the prediction
of shear ductility. These experimental and theoretical advancements have laid
down the foundation for a scientific treatment of the behavior of framed
shearwalls. This proposal is to study the behavior of framed wall panels
subjected to monotonic, cyclic and dynamic loading. The research is designed to
clarify the interaction of the wall panels and the frame members, so that the
effect of the frame constraints on the shear ductility of a wall panel can be
evaluated. Based on the static and dynamic behavior observed in the proposed
tests, a simple method will be developed for the design of framed shear walls.
This research will be carried out jointly by the University of Houston in the
United States and the Tongji University in Shanghai, China. It will be part of
the US- PRC Cooperative Program, Annex 3 - Cooperation in Earthquake Studies.
The University of Houston will study the monotonic and cycle behavior of framed
wall panels using the universal panel tester. Dynamic tests of framed wall
panels simulating earthquake action will be performed at Tongji University using
a shaking table.
