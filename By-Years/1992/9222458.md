ABSTRACT This research will use a telephone survey of North American dialects
of English to trace the development of linguistic changes in progress on a broad
geographic scale. Telephone interviews offer a rapid and inexpensive method of
sampling broad geographic areas with a sampling density proportionate to the
variation in the data. The survey will establish a network of native speakers
who are available for repeated interviews to obtain both phonetic and
phonological information on a wide range of variables. The data obtained will be
used to investigate general questions in the theory of language change, as well
as provide national maps of the regional features of English. Current research
on English dialects shows continued change and increasing diversification of
broad regional patterns through chain shifts, mergers, lexical splits and the
vocalization of liquids. A number of principals have been proposed to account
for the geographic spread and transmission of these changes across generations,
including specific quantitative models for areal diffusion. Efforts to confirm
these models have been limited so far to sociolinguistic studies of small areas;
the regional data that has been gathered is dispersed over time and space in
ways that inhibit comparison. Furthermore, the traditional methods of
dialectology do not gather the information on perception and categorization of
speech needed to investigate the mechanism of phonological change, and the
traditional focus on rural communities does not provide the data needed to
investigate the correlation between community size and the advancement of
change. Results of a pilot survey of the North Central States show considerable
success in recruiting a number of subjects and in obtaining phonetic and
phonological information that shows clear regional differentiation of sound
changes in progress. Current methods of instrumental analyses of telephone
recordings provide data of sufficient quantity and internal reliability to map
individual vowel systems. An extended survey of the Middle Western United States
will be conducted from the eastern boundary of Ohio westward to the Continental
Divide and from the Ohio River northward to the Canadian border. The survey will
gather data that will trace the progress and mechanism of the Northern Cities
vowel shift, its relation to the southern vowel shift, the merger of long and
short open /0/, ongoing mergers before liquids and nasals, and the lexical
distribution of the tensing of short a and o in those regions where splits have
occurred in the past. The sample will be representative of both geography and
the population size of communities. The basic unit of sampling will be areas of
influence of the largest urbanized centers as established by newspaper
circulation.
