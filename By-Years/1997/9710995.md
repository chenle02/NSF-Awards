Hannes Jonsson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in the development of computer
algorithms for density functional theory simulations and applications to
semiconductor crystal growth. Jonsson will parallelize his own methods for
finding minimum energy paths and transition state activation barriers. He will
also investigate free energy barriers which include anharmonicity, and
algorithms which scale linearly with system size. His applications will focus on
interpretation of current imaging experiments by calculating adatom diffusion
rates and surface cluster formation rates for industrially relevant systems such
as silicon and silicon carbide surfaces, germanium-silicon interfaces, and
silicon dioxide overlayers. Modern density functional theoretical methods will
be developed and used to study a variety of surface growth mechanisms of
technological importance. In particular these methods will be extended to enable
the study of larger, more complex models of materials on new and emerging
massively parallel computers. The methods involve the sophisticated evaluation
of accurate energetics for a number of complex atomic-scale processes on
semiconductor surfaces.
