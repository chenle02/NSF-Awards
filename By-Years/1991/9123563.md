The objective of this study is to investigate infiltration through a soil matrix
possessing dual porosity. The duality is attributed to the existence of
micropores at a length scale consistent with the size of individual soil grains,
and macropores of a size significantly larger than an individual soil grain.
Primary attention is focused on the macropores, as infiltration through a
homogeneous soil with micropores has already been solved with some success. The
project results will impact several fields of soil hydraulics, including
agricultural applications, groundwater recharge, landfill cover design, and
contaminant transport in the vadose zone.
