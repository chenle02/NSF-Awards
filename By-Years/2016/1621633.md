The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable and support the development,
approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection. HIV-1
infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be
cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state. This
latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection. While latent HIV-1 can be found
in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies. To cure
HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.
This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and
scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

The propose project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and
scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.
Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either
non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete. This
project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures
latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours. Specifically, the project
is focused on optimizing the preparation of blood samples and the reaction
conditions necessary for robust performance of this new molecular test for
latent HIV-1, as well as collecting samples from HIV-1 infected individuals to
support future validation studies. Successful completion of this project will
yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be rapidly validated and advanced
towards eventual clinical use.
