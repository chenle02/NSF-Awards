This award supports research in elementary particle physics by Dr. Persis S.
Drell, a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Drell will continue her
association with the Mark II detector at the Stanford Linear Collider and will
also work on the CLEO detector at the Cornell CESR accelerator. Both of these
programs use electron.positron collisions to study fundamental forces in nature.
The Stanford experiment is likely to be one of the first to make precise
measurements of the mass and lifetime of the "Z" particle, one of the quanta of
the electro.weak force field. In her work at Cornell, Dr. Drell will become
involved in the study of symmetry breaking in these forces. This phenomenon has
wide significance; for example, this kind of symmetry breaking is thought
responsible for the small amount of anti-matter in the universe.
