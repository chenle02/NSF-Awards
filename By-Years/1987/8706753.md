Fundamental studies of visible superfluorescence and atom- field interactions
in an optical resonator are proposed. The objectives are: To demonstrate and
study visible superfluorescence and other related cooperative radiation effects
in an optical resonator. To design an experiment to study steady-state coherent
emission of an atomic beam in a resonator. To obtain large enhancement and
suppression of visible spontaneous emission, and to demonstrate a single atom
laser and study other single atom and single photon phenomena.
