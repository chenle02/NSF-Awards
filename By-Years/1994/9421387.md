9421387 Greenberg The Haag expansion (N quantum approximation) will be used to
study quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with emphasis on the relation of the
constituent quark model to the parton model; i.e., the relation of constituent
and current quarks. The goal is to bring quantum field theory methods starting
from the QCD Lagrangian to bear on empirical data ranging from hadron
spectroscopy to deep inelastic scattering processes. Specfic issues to be
investigated include chiral symmetry breaking, confinement, and the description
of relativistic bound states. Theoretical investigations will also include
studies of (i) radiative and electroweak0induced fine structure effects on the
fermion masses in the composite model, (ii) dynamical breaking of supersymmetry,
chiral and vectorial symmetries, (iii) Yukawa unification (which is forced in
the preon model) and understanding large tan B (iv) expected masses of the SUSY-
spectrum in the preon model, (v) the question of the unity of all forces at the
preon level, (vi) cosmological issues related to inflation, baryogenesis and
dark matter and (vii) a possible origin of the preonic spectrum and gauge group
from superstring theories. ***
