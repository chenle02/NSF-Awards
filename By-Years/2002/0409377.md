The Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering
supports Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin to provide travel
funds for a group of young U.S. researchers to attend the Fifth Latin-American
Symposium on High Energy Physics (V SILAFAE) and associated micourses and
workshops in Lima, Peru, July 12-17, 2004. A group of U.S. graduate students and
recent PhD scientists will work side by side with other young scientists from
Latin America in several high-quality minicourses that are part of the program.
One of the main goals of this activity is to stimulate future collaborations
among young physicists from the Americas region with each other and with
renowned physicists from the region. The symposium will also include a round
table discussion on future collaboration between Latin American and U.S.
physicists.
