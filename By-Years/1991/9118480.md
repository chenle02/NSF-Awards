This award supports the analysis of calcareous nannofossil assemblages from high
quality Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling Program (DSDP/ODP) drill cores
from the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean basins in order to reconstruct the
thermal gradient of surface waters of those basins for the Campanian to Cenozoic
time interval (84 million years ago to the present). This research applies
statistical methods based on a polar ordination technique. Using this technique,
and refining it through closer sampling intervals and a wider spectrum of recent
ODP sites, particularly from the Antarctic Sector of the Southern Ocean (mainly
ODP Legs 113 and 114 sites), this work will further refine the zonation and
biochronology of nannofossils of the Southern Ocean, characterize major surface
water masses and infer from biological gradients latitudinal thermal gradients,
and record in detail latitudinal shifts in surface water masses through time as
a means of tracing steps in the deterioration of global climates.
