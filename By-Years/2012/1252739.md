Funds are requested to support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 18th
Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom
2012), which will be held August 22-26, 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey. Since its
inauguration, MobiCom has been one of the premier international conferences in
wireless and mobile networking, covering a wide spectrum of theoretical and
applied research in wireless area. The conference has been held annually since
1994, and has provided a valuable forum for fundamental advances on a wide range
of wireless networking topics. Mobicom 2012 technical program consists of
technical sessions, workshops, panels, and tutorials. This proposal requests
students travel support to boost the participation of US-based students to the
conference. Attending such high-caliber technical venues is extremely valuable
for future researchers. Not only will they be exposed to the state-of-the-art in
the field, but they will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from
institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and take part in
discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of
technology, standards, etc). In particular, higher priority will be given to
female students as well as those from under-represented minority groups
institutions that are not traditionally represented in MobiCom.
