The Science Museum of Minnesota proposes to create a national traveling exhibit
on grizzly and black bears. Marked by an interdisciplinary approach that will
address scientific, ethical, social, and economic issues, the exhibit will deal
with research on bear biology, historical ecology, habitat destruction,
declining populations, myths and bear encounters. The project will combine
objects and specimens, research findings, interactive displays, film and video,
and interpretive programs. Because it will travel to a number of other museums,
the exhibit promises to serve a wide audience number at least two million
people.
