University of Cincinnati TITLE: Imperative Programming with Dependent Types

Programming is notoriously error-prone. As a consequence, a great number of
approaches have been developed to facilitate program error detection. The
proposed research intends to enrich practical imperative programming with a type
discipline that allows for specification and inference of significantly more
precise information on programs than those enforced in languages such as Java
and Standard ML. The primary motivation for developing such a type discipline is
to enable the programmer to capture with types more program properties such as
memory safety and then enforce these captured properties through type-checking.
This practice allows for detecting more program errors in less time. Another
motivation is to use the type discipline to generate memory safety proofs for
low-level code and thus effectively produce proof-carrying code that asserts its
own memory safety. In short, the research studies a type discipline for
practical imperative programming at both high and low levels, aiming for
producing software that is not only more robust to run but also less costly to
maintain.
