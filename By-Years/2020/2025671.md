The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to facilitate safety for medical radiation
workers. Many of these workers must wear radiation shielding as personal
protective equipment for much of their workday. Currently used shielding
garments are often unsterilizable, heavy and rigid, and difficult to inspect for
cracks or tears; these issues add risk and cost to health care. The proposed
radiation shielding materials will enable personnel to easily sterilize garments
between uses, decreasing the risk of transmitting infections in operating rooms.
Garments made from this material are expected to be more ergonomic to wear for
long periods of time as well as easier to inspect and maintain.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will establish feasibility of a sterilizable and non-toxic radiation
shielding fabric and will demonstrate radiation shielding efficacy and
workability. Microparticle materials developed from a novel manufactured
composite. This project will evaluate and screen potential polymers and
processing conditions. The testing and evaluation plan will characterize
materials in terms of strength, resistance to breakage, and chemical resistance.
The project will assess radiation shielding efficacy using X-ray energies and
conditions expected in a clinical setting. The fabric will also be evaluated for
plasticity and its capability to be implemented in a garment that can be cleaned
and sterilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
