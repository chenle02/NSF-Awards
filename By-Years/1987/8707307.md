The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary Cooperative research project between
Dr.Ivan Sellin of the University of Tennessee and Dr. Denes Berenyi with the
Institute for Nuclear Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences is to study
electron transfer to continuum states by light ions in ion-atom collisions. In
addition to expected fundamental achievements in theoretical physics, the joint
effort should yield useful, quantitative and qualitative definition of
apparatus-dependent effects. Knowledge of such effects will help clarify
existing disagreements in impulse approximation calculations and asymmetry data,
which are key factors in this field of scientific investigation. This project in
theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementing talents, pool resources, and share research facilities in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
