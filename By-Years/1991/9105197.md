Robust control has become the central focus of control systems research over the
last 12 years. The objective of this project is to bring together leading
international control researchers to assess the state of knowledge in the
rapidly advancing field of robust control. In particular, several independent
conceptual and mathematical approaches have developed over the years. These are
H-infinity optimal control, parametric robust stability based on Kharitonov's
theorem and related topics, l1 optimal control, mu-analysis, and quantitative
feedback theory. This workshop will being together experts from each of these
areas, for the first time. This will produce a cross fertilization of ideas and
lead to more effective approaches toward developing solutions to the robust
control problem. Some plenary talks and a concluding panel discussion are
planned with this in mind. The papers presented at the workshop will be
published in book form. The results of the workshop will have a very significant
international impact on research, education, and engineering applications of
robust control for many years to come.
