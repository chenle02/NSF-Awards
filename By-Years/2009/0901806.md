The objective of this research is to demonstrate a new table top
photolithography scheme capable to print sub-50 nm features. The approach is
based on projection holographic lithography, consisting of printing photoresist
with the reconstructed image of a computer-designed digital holographic mask.
The illumination source is a highly coherent table-top extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
laser. The project is significant as it promises to realize a nano-patterning
scheme with nano-scale resolution thereby extending laser manufacturing to
wavelengths only available until now at large synchrotron facilities. The
holography projection lithography approach will allow printing in a matter of
seconds patterns with arbitrary motives. Since the pattern smallest feature is
mainly determined by the wavelength of the illumination, which for the table top
EUV lasers used in this project ranges from 47 to 13 nm, the proposed scheme
promises writing resolution in the few tens of nanometers. This project will
have a broader impact in education through the training of graduate students in
an innovative technology that combines optical engineering and metrology, laser
design and material science. The proposed research also will provide exciting
learning opportunities for undergraduate students through summer internships
organized every year in CSU. The implementation of the proposed nanopatterning
scheme will impact other areas of nanoscience and technology, including the
development on nano-structured materials, nano-photonics, plasmonic structures,
etc.. It promises the realization of a table-top patterning tool with similar
capabilities as large synchrotron facilities that could be integrated with other
processing tools in a small laboratory environment.
