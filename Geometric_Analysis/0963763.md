The fifth Pacific Rim Conference on Mathematics (PRCM) will be held at Stanford
University from June 28, 2010 through July 2, 2010. The organizing committee
consists of Tai-Ping Liu and Richard Schoen. It will be a high-profile, broad-
based conference covering a wide range of areas of mathematics which are well
represented in universities on the Pacific Rim. The PRCM will have 10 sessions
each with a plenary speaker and six session speakers. The sessions are in the
following areas: 1) Algebraic Geometry, 2) Combinatorics, 3) Differential
Geometry, 4) Electromagnetic Waves, 5) Functional Analysis, 6) Kinetic Equations
and Gas Dynamics, 7) Mathematical Imaging, 8) Nonlinear Partial Differential
Equations, 9) Number Theory, and 10) Random Systems and PDEs. The full list of
organizers and speakers is available on the conference website at
<http://math.stanford.edu/PRCMindex.html>.

The PRCM was conceived in the middle 1990s by a group of mathematicians from
over 10 major universities on the west coast of the United States, in Canada,
China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Korea, and Australia. It has been held every
three years since 1998 in various locations on the Pacific Rim. This summer's
PRCM will be the first to be held in North America. One of the main reasons for
initiating this meeting was the recognition that the Pacific Rim region is not
only economically vibrant, but also becoming increasingly important in
scientific research. The objectives are to present the latest trends in
mathematical research to a wide audience and to develop stronger ties between
mathematicians in the Pacific Rim region. We expect the PRCM to be attended by
approximately 200 mathematicians from Pacific Rim universities.
