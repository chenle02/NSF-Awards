Minorities are not well represented in careers in science, particularly the
geosciences. Considerable effort is being made to increase the participation of
underrepresented minorities in marine science. To this end, a two-year training
program in marine sciences will be initiated at the Duke University Marine
Laboratory. This will include a semester-in- residence college program, which
provides a comprehensive educational and research experience for minority
undergraduate students. This will include a mentor-in-residence, i.e., a
minority faculty member, who will function as a visiting scholar, a tutor and
role model for these students to enhance the success of their educational and
research experience.
