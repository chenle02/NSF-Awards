Walk-in environmental rooms that provide precision control of temperature,
relative humidity, and light have a great many applications in research and
education. The twin 1980s-era environmental control chambers at Highlands
Biological Station (HBS: highlandsbiological.org) have been real work-horses,
supporting hundreds of studies on plants and animals over the years in many
research areas, from behavior, ecology, and climate change to development,
genetics, and physiology â€” especially work with lungless salamanders, one of the
most ecologically important animal groups in southern Appalachian forests and
streams. In addition to research, these chambers have also supported class
demonstrations and student research projects in HBS field courses. The chambers
are now very dated, however, with aging plumbing, wiring, and analog controls
that no longer function reliably, hampering research and other applications.
This project will replace and upgrade the functionality of these chambers while
also expanding capacity, adding a third walk-in environmental control room. The
goal is both expanded capabilities and expanded capacity in order to support a
broader range of applications in research, teaching, class projects, public
programs, and demonstrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working with leaders in the
design and construction of precision scientific and industrial environmental
control rooms, this project entails fabricating and installing 3 new chambers on
the footprint of the old ones. The design realizes a net gain of over 16 square
feet of working area and 215 cubic feet of conditioned space, reliably providing
the precision temperature, relative humidity, light control and other
capabilities needed by today's researchers and for instructional applications.
The replacement chambers will also feature increased shelf space with interior
electrical outlets to accommodate peripheral equipment such as video or grow
lights, as well as remote-monitoring functionality so that HBS staff,
researchers, and instructors can monitor chamber conditions via mobile device or
desktop on a continuous basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
