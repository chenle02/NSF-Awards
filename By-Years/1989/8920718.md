Global warming is due in part to the increasing amounts of carbon dioxide(CO2)
being introduced into the atmosphere from the burning of both solid and liquid
fuels. New economically viable technologies which utilize CO2 as a chemical
feedstock for the synthesis of useful products are needed. This CO2 would be
readily available, for example from the exhausts of fossil fuel burning power
plants. This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project is directed
towards the identification of optimum conditions for achieving both high
Faradaic efficiencies and current densities for the direct electrochemical
reduction of CO2 to alcohols. Specifically, work will be performed using
perovskite based electrocatalysts incorporated within gas diffusion electrodes
where they will provide sites for CO2 intermediates leading to alcohol
synthesis. Research objectives will include: (1) the systematic selection of
perovskite electrocatalysts based upon their surface oxide bond strengths and
corresponding activity for promoting alcohol synthesis, (2) the performance of
an in- depth electrochemical study for perovskite electrocatalyst optimization,
(3) optimization of component fabrication procedures and electrochemical
conditions for operating perovskite containing gas diffusion electrodes under
high CO2 pressure, and (4) fabrication of prototype electrolytic cells
incorporating optimum gas diffusion electrode designs and perform extended
electrolyses for promoting CO2 reduction to alcohols.
