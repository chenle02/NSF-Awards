The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to use the proposed
system for automation of yield mapping so that growers will be able to improve
their growing and harvesting processes. Yield mapping is critical for fruit
growers. An accurate estimate is enormously beneficial to sales operations,
harvest time logistics, and crop management. Currently, yield mapping is
performed manually in a difficult, laborious process prone to sampling and
counting error. The proposed system would enable growers to sell better fruit at
higher prices while using less resources. By bringing improved certainty to
harvest quantity and timing, the system will also improve the efficiency of the
entire fruit supply chain, making fresh fruit more readily available in stores
at more consistent prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the problem of automated yield
mapping for fruit crops. Rather than relying on expensive sensing equipment such
as laser-based lidar scanners, the company proposes to build a robust, yet
inexpensive, fruit mapping system using commercial, off-the-shelf components. In
order to achieve this goal, significant computer vision and systems challenges
must be overcome. These include: (1) Adapting and developing accurate computer
vision algorithms for fruit detection and segmentation, as well as geometric
algorithms for sizing and tracking fruit and mapping the foliage; and (2)
Building usable and reliable systems for scanning, upload, cloud processing, and
results visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
