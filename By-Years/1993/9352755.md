The College of Engineering at the University of Alabama has a student population
which is more than 19% minority and just under 20% female students. The
Department of Aerospace Engineering has a curriculum designed to provide
students with a broad-based practical education. Accordingly, almost all of the
aerospace engineering courses are complemented with experimental facilities. The
one subject area which is not complemented by a laboratory is that of
propulsion. This proposal hopes to obtain support for a laboratory at the
University of Alabama which is unique to undergraduate propulsion education, not
only due to the equipment, but also in the way in which the subject matter is
taught. The laboratory will be based on a small, fully-operational turbojet
engine, its accompanying test chamber, and a data acquisition and control
computer. The exciting, new pedagogical approach to be taken to teach propulsion
utilizing the proposed laboratory was originally developed by researchers in the
field of secondary school science education. The structure of the new propulsion
systems course will follow what is called a learning cycle strategy. This
teaching approach represents a major departure from that used for traditional
engineering courses. In particular, the laboratory component will have a
different focus; by using the learning cycle, laboratory experiences precede
lecture material. The propulsion laboratory based on this proposed equipment
would primarily support the undergraduate course in propulsion systems. However,
one other exciting use of the equipment would be in support of a new
undergraduate course being taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering.
The new course will be taught to sophomore and junior level education majors,
introducing them to aerospace related science and technology concepts. A
propulsion laboratory, such as the one proposed, will highly complement this new
science course and will expose many students outside of the College of
Engineering to the operation of a gas turbine engine.
