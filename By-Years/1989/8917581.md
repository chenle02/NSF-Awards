Determination by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) of concentrations of the
cosmogenic radionuclides on exposed bedrock surfaces provides instructive data
on exposure times and rates of erosion for those surfaces. Exposure ages ranging
from 10,000 to 5,000,000 years have been determined for a wide variety of
surfaces; the oldest exposure times yet reported have been measured on bedrock
samples from the Antarctic continent. The goals of the research are: 1) to
refine sample-preparation technique to the level that it will represent a
generalized, systematic procedure to extract quartz efficiently from samples of
a wide range of mineral composition; 2) to measure concentrations of cosmogenic
radionuclides in Antarctic bedrock samples provided by collaborators, and to
interpret those measurements in terms of exposure ages, erosion rates, and
Quaternary glacial history; and 3) to collect further sample in Antarctica for
determination of exposure ages and erosion rates.
