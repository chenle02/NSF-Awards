An improved understanding of upper ocean circulation and thermocline ventilation
in the South Atlantic Ocean will be achieved through the use of passive chemical
tracers. The analysis will be based on the use of the high quality three-
dimensional tracer and hydrographic dataset collected in the Atlantic ocean
during the 1980's and simple numerical models to estimate the rate and pathways
of ventilation of thermocline waters.
