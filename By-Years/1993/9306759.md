9306759 Callis The eukaryotic ubiquitin pathway involves the covalent
attachment of the protein ubiquitin to cellular proteins. Ubiquitinated proteins
can then be targeted for proteolysis, or ubiquitination can result in a stable
post-translational modification. Therefore the ubiquitin pathway represents an
important pathway regulating protein levels and their activities in eukaryotes.
The isolation and identification of substrates for ubiquitin modification are
essential for an understanding of the regulation and specificity of this
pathway. While the number of ubiquitinated proteins appears to be large based on
immunoblot studies, the number of identified in vivo substrates is small. In
higher plants, only one endogenous plant protein has been identified as a
substrate of the ubiquitin pathway. Two different approaches towards identifying
and isolating higher plant in vivo substrates using Arabidopsis thaliana as the
model system are outlined in detail and will be performed. Identification of
additional in vivo substrates will further our knowledge of the roles of the ub
pathway in higher plants and contribute toward an understanding of the
regulation of ubiquitination. Two components of the ubiquitin pathway that are
relatively uncharacterized in higher plants and are important for an
understanding of the regulation of the pathway will be cloned. Their isoation
will also contribute toward a long term goal of producing an in vitro
conjugation system with specificity identical to that found in vivo. Ubiquitin
is encoded by a multi-gene family in higher plants. All members of the ubiquitin
gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana have been isolated. The roles of multiple
ubiquitin genes will be addressed through studies of the environmental and
developmental changes in ubiquitin gene expression. In addition, the expression
of ubiquitin genes in other ecotypes will be determined to assist in the
identification of functionally important genes. A combination of these two
approaches will increase our understanding of the ubiquitin pathway in higher
plant metabolism, development, and physiology, and define its role in mediating
plant responses to environmental stresses. ***
