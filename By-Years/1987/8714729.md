This proposal is to develop comprehensive, self-contained methods for
mathematical analysis of the continuous casting process for steel billets in the
early stages of solidification. The interaction of the heat transfer, freezing
and stress development process will be examined using three-dimensional finite
element method techniques. The principal novelty of this project is to
iteratively determine the thermal and stress state of the casting by examining
the coupling between these two states. This controls the formation of an air gap
between the mold and solidifying strand. The project represents a continuation
and extension of earlier work, which was restricted to round billets. Accurate
correlation was found between computed results and experimental observations.
New research will focus upon three-dimensional effects, especially those
associated with defect formation near corners of cast billets.
