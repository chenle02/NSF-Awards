0131287&lt;br/&gt;Hanna-Rose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of the
Hanna-Rose laboratory is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that direct
organogenesis. The focus of the proposed research is a detailed investigation of
the role of the cog-2 gene and of a specific cell-cell fusion in promoting
proper attachment of the C. elegans uterus and vulva. cog?2 encodes a Sox (SRY-
related HMG box) family transcription factor that is expressed in a specific
cell of the uterus called the uterine seam cell (utse). The utse normally
executes a developmentally programmed cell fusion to another gonadal cell called
the anchor cell. This cell-cell fusion promotes formation of an open channel
between the uterus and the vulva in a late stage of organogenesis. In the
absence of cog-2 function, utse cell fate is induced but fusion to the anchor
cell (AC) is not executed. The aims of the proposed research are to determine
whether COG-2 acts to regulate fusion directly or affects fusion indirectly
through an effect on utse cell fate, to identify and characterize additional
genes involved in AC-utse fusion, and to identify COG-2 binding partners.
Results are expected to elucidate mechanisms whereby COG-2 functions. This will
also shed light on potential regulatory targets for vertebrate Sox proteins.
Furthermore, the results are expected to increase our understanding of how the
formation of a proper connection between two organs is genetically programmed
and to promote the development of tools for probing the mechanism of cell
fusion. &lt;br/&gt;
