The purpose of this travel award is to support a visit at the University of
Alaska, Fairbanks by Dr. Eduard Yershov, Chairman of the Department of
Geocryology at Moscow State University, to explore the possibility of developing
a proposal for long-term cooperation on permafrost as related to world climate
change with Dr. Thomas E. Osterkamp of the University of Alaska's Geophysics
Institute. This is a targeted topic under the general category of Arctic
Research under the Memorandum of Understanding between NSF and the Soviet
Academy of Sciences for basic research cooperation. This project fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary
efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in
the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,
and mutuality of benefit.
