The Appalachian College Program, administered by the University of Kentucky,
will hold a conference for science and mathematics faculty from 38 private
colleges throughout central Appalachia. The purpose of the conference is to
allow discussion of the benefits of collaboration in science education and to
identify specific ways in which this group of colleges might collaborate to
improve science education on the campuses. A keynote speaker will set the tone
at an opening dinner for the small group sessions to be held on the next day.
Proposals and recommendations made in group sessions will be presented and
approved on the morning of the following day. These recommendations will be
presented at a meeting of all of the academic deans or vice-presidents of the
colleges and a similar meeting of all the presidents of the colleges. In
addition, a report will be produced outlining the role of these colleges in
science education and the resources needed to fulfill that role. The consortium
and member colleges will contribute an additional 15% of the award toward the
operation of the project.
