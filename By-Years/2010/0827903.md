This project will continue the operation of, data collection of , data
dissemination from the Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS).
The MACCS array now consists of nine high latitude magnetometers covering the
eastern Canadian Arctic. In addition to the operation, data collection and data
dissemination activities the project involves several scientific research
activities. These activities include: (1) understanding the ULF waves associated
with magnetic storms, (2) understanding the coupling of the ionospheric electric
field to magnetospheric processes and the solar wind drivers, (3) understanding
high-latitude transient events such as the formation of polar patches, and (4)
understanding the relation between the location of ULF waves, visual auroral
phenomena and field-aligned current systems.

The project is being carried out at an undergraduate institution and a number of
undergraduates, including students from under-represented groups will be
involved with the research.
