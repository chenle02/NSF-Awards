Eugenio Maria de Hostos Community College and Cornell University Cooperative
Extension collaboratively designed this environmental summer science camp in
which fifty African-American and Hispanic ninth grade students per year will
participate in innovative, inquiry-based scientific projects and learn about
careers in science, engineering, and mathematics. Through hands-on laboratory
activities, participants will learn about the deterioration of the environment
as it affects land, air, and water resources, and the role of scientist and
engineers in protecting and reversing this environmental damage. Utilizing New
York City's natural resources as well as its professional scientists, engineers,
and mathematicians, students will also learn about science from a socially
responsible and ethical perspective. TERRA brings together practicing
scientists, college faculty, and high school teachers to challenge and motivate
minority ninth graders to stay in school, take additional courses in high
school, and learn about career opportunities in these fields.
