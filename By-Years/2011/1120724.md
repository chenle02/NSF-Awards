This Scalable NanoManufacturing research project will investigate digital
optofluidic self-assembly processes for manufacturing heterogeneous
metamaterials with sophisticated building blocks in composition, dimension and
geometry, while achieving desired orientation and spatial distribution over
large area. Specifically our research approaches are: 1) Digital in-flow
nanoimprint lithography processes for massive fabrication of heterogeneous
metablocks; 2) Plasmonic enhanced parallel digital optical trapping and directed
assembly of metablocks; 3)Theoretical modeling and experimental study of the
optofluidic self assembly processes for switchable and active materials; 4)
characterization of self assembled metamaterial for communication and energy
application and scale up analysis. If successful, this approach will move from
trial-and-error assemblies of academic interest to the creation of large-scale
devices with improved performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on
one of the most promising breakthroughs in the field of nanophotonics:
heterogeneous metamaterials to transform, manipulate and concentrate light and
acoustic fields. If successful, our research would transform the vision of
metamaterials from lab science to a commercial reality. It will have profound
impact on a broad range of applications in telecommunication, quantum computing
and energy. A research consortium will be formed with industry partners and
national labs to foster the technology transfer pathways for translating the
technologies developed in this project. The educational objective is to empower
the next generation of engineers and educate them to become part of a world-
class workforce, with knowledge and enthusiasm of nanomanufacturing innovation.
Besides new courses and undergraduate research opportunities, a two week
workshop will be organized with a combined summer school and both will be
located in the New England Area. As part of outreach efforts, an exhibition of
active nanomaterials will be organized at the Boston Science Museum.
