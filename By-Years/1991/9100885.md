This award supports a workshop on the geology of the James Ross Basin,
Antarctica. The sedimentary rock sequence exposed within the James Ross Basin is
a nearly continuous, richly fossiliferous record ranging in age from Late
Cretaceous through Eocene. Prior studies have demonstrated the significant role
Antarctica played in the evolution and dispersal of southern hemisphere
terrestrial and marine organisms as well as in the evolution of global
oceanographic conditions. However, the work has been performed by groups from
various nations with little coordination. As a result the terminology applied to
geological and geographic features in confusing and the work has been repetitive
and overlapping, in some cases. Because it is recognized that cooperative work,
involving scientists from several nations, would permit more efficient and
economical use of financial and logistic resources, a workshop will be held to
provide an opportunity to discuss research completed and to define objectives
for gaining a greater understanding of the area. It is anticipated that such a
workshop will encourage research planning for future expeditions.
