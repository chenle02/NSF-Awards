This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the development of
research collaboration involving quantitative modelling in the geosciences. In
particular the mathematician and the atmospheric scientist will focus their
attention on pseudo-parabolic partial differential equation models for
experimentally evaluable aspects of electrification and lightning.
