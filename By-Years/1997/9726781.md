This award supports the PI and co-PI, Dr. Tissa Illangasekare of Drexel
University to collaborate with Manfred Koch of the Department of Geohydraulics
and Engineering Hydrology at the University of Kassel. The collaboration will
design and construct a large-scale (10-meter) experimental vessel containing
structured porous media with measurable statistical properties comparable to
that of a scaled, heterogeneous sand and gravel aquifer, and to use the vessel
for observation of fluid flow and mass transport under controlled conditions.
The ultimate goal is to improve prediction of aquifer contamination by
comparison of observational results with stochastic and other mathematical
models of a number of non-ideal contaminant transport processes. Almost any
fluid dynamics problem in porous media could be studied in detail in the
proposed vessel. Of special interest in this study are dense, miscible fluid
transport, virus and colloid transport, and immiscible fluid flow. All of those
topics are environmental problems for which widely-accepted, accurate predictive
methods for transport in heterogeneous porous media are not currently available.
