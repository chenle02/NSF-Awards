This project will assist in the development of an aquatic ecology center at
Arkansas Tech University that is designed to demonstrate ecological principles
and promote interdisciplinary research by undergraduate students. The center is
well equipped for sampling living organisms, but these biotic communities can be
greatly influenced by transient abiotic factors that vary regularly (e.g., daily
or seasonally) or are unpredictable (e.g., occur during storm events or
accidental pollutant discharge). Equipping the aquatic ecology center with two
sequential water samplers; two meters for continuous chemical records; two water
level recorders; and accessories to electronically transfer data will permit
students to investigate both short-term and long-term environmental changes.
Multiple meter sets will allow hypothesis testing among stream sites and among
lake depths. This center will provide invaluable experience to upper division
undergraduates in several science majors regardless of whether they enter their
careers directly or pursue graduate degrees. The equipment will also be of use
in a summer conservation course for high school science teachers, and in the
Gifted and Talented program for outstanding high school students.
