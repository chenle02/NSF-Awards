9506305 Greeley The purpose of this research is to investigate the control of a
gut hormone called peptide YY (PYY). Peptide YY is a recently discovered gut
hormone that is found primarily in cells lining the lumen of the lower intestine
(colon). Dr. Greeley's laboratory and others have shown that PYY has numerous
effects on the upper gut (stomach, pancreas, small intestine). PYY acts as a
"brake" on the upper gut. It can inhibit gastric acid secretion by the stomach,
digestive enzyme secretion by the pancreas, and it slows movement of food down
the intestine. In fact, PYY may be a major regulator or coordinator of upper gut
function. In the present research, Dr. Greeley is interested in what controls
PYY. He will examine how dietary fat and messages from the upper gut affect PYY.
He has evidence to show that ingested fat and the stomach hormone, gastrin, can
influence PYY. His research may result in new ideas and concepts in how the
upper and lower gut communicate with each other. There may be universal ways in
mammals in which communication occurs between the upper and lower gut and he
intends to investigate these lines of communication. ***
