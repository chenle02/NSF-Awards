Modernization for an electrical engineering laboratory class teaching physics,
dynamics and control of electromechanical devices is supported. Funds would be
used to upgrade outmoded computer equipment and test benches will be upgraded
and refurbished. New technologies in sensing, actuation and control are
introduced in the laboratory. A variety of sensors and actuators are
characterized and used in control, aided by powerful data acquisition and
control prototyping stations. The course material will be modernized along with
the laboratory to incorporate state-of-the-art engineering techniques, yet
illustrate fundamental physical principles. A unified view of devices, computer
in control, and system dynamics is taught.
