This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
microfluidic based system for the detection of viable pathogens using dielectric
concentration of bacteria as an intermediate step. This system would use a
first-stage concentrator, followed by dielectrophoretic concentration, and
finally by culturing in media with integrated impedance measurements to detect
culture growth.

The commercial application of this project will be on the detection of
waterborne microorganisms in biopharmaceutical manufacturing operations. The
proposed method would electronically detect the viability of microorganisms in
water samples in less than 3 hours, unlike the current technology that takes 2-7
days to yield results.
