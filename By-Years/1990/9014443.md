The Herpetology Collection of the University of Texas, Arlington includes
60,000 catalogued specimens and approximately 350 type specimens. The holdings
have tripled in size over the past decade, particularly in its representatives
from central and South America. This collection is rapidly becoming one of the
most important research resources in the country for studies of tropical
reptiles and amphibians. Dr. Jonathan Campbell, Curator of the collection, now
proposes to initiate a computer database of the collection. The proposed
database will increase the availability of specimens in the collection for
research and teaching. Investigators will have more immediate access to
information concerning specimens, and the growth of the collection will be
managed more effectively. The maintenance and improvement of natural history
collections such as this will assure that future generations of biologists will
have comprehensive data on the diversity of life on Earth.
