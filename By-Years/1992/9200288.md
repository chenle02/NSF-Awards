This project will bring ten undergraduate students to work at the GTE
Laboratories for a ten week period in the summer of 1992. Recruiting for the
program is national in scope, and will build on the past success of similar
projects at the Laboratories. Each participant will be assigned to a member of
the GTE Laboratories Technical Staff. A sequence of oral and written reports
will be included in the experience. Projects will be involved from the following
organizations within the Laboratories: Computer and Intelligent Systems
Laboratory, Service Applications and Technology Laboratory, Systems Technology
Laboratory, Telecommunications Research Laboratory, and Wireless and Secure
Systems Laboratory.
