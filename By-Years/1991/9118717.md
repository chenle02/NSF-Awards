This award will provide for half the funds needed for the acquisition of a
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer. The additional funding required for
this acquisition has been committed by the University of California at Santa
Cruz. It is anticipated that studies utilizing this instrument will provide
fundamental constraints on a number of geochemical and geophysical processes.
These include, but are not limited to 1) examination of the structural changes
taking place in silicate melts at high pressures, and thus potentially on
differentiation processes occurring in the early Earth; 2) characterizing the
speciation of volatiles (primarily water and carbon dioxide) within both mixed
volatile-fluid phases at moderate pressures, and in volatile- bearing silicate
assemblages, with relevance both for the solution properties of fluids at high
pressure and temperature, and for possible retention of volatiles in the deep
Earth; 3) investigating the response of bonding properties of minerals to high
pressures, with implications both for the thermochemical properties of minerals
under extreme conditions, and for the mechanisms by which minerals undergo
metastable phase transitions; and 4) a novel method for potentially
characterizing the thermal conductivity of opaque materials at high pressures.
