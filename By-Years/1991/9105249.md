The Pacific Northwest has been shown to consist of large blocks of exotic
oceanic material accreted to the North American craton. Recent research in the
northern Cordillera has indicated that an ancient continental margin assemblage
of possible North American affinity occurs outboard of at least the northern
part of the Stikine terrane, one of the far-traveled terranes. This project will
investigate the extent of the out-of-place North American continental rocks
along the outboard margin of the Stikine terrane and to determine the structural
or depositional relationships between them and the stikine terrane. The work
will involve mapping, geochronology and isotopic studies. Determining these
relationships is expected to have a major impact on the understanding of the
tectonic evolution of juvenile terranes and continental margin assemblages both
in the northern Cordillera and in other orogens that record rapid crustal growth
by accretion of allochthonous terranes.
