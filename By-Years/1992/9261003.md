Light scattering (LS) is one of the most common techniques for polymer
characterization. The LS intensity and its angular dissymmetry are the two
experimental results that give the polymer molecular weight (MW) and molecular
size (radius-of-gyration Rg) information respectively. When a multi-angle LS
detector is coupled with a size exclusion chromatograph (SEC), the combined
instrument has the potential of determining the absolute MW and Rg distribution
of polymers. In general, the existing LS instruments have been expensive, bulky,
and lack precision. We plan to test a new concept for a high precision LS
instrument that is small, simple and inexpensive. We will incorporate a multi-
wavelength feature into our right angle laser LS (RALLS) technology. The
combination of a multi-wavelength RALLS detector with SEC would be a very
powerful polymer characterization technique. This new approach can provide the
needed accuracy and precision in the MW and Rg determinations for solving
industrial problems that may relate to polymer size and shape changes, chain
branching, copolymer composition, or biopolymer conformational and architectural
differences.
