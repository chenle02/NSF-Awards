Many fluids used in industrial processes are shear-thickening. That is, they
become more viscous the faster they are forced to flow. This feature can make
their use and manipulation costly, require significant energy, and damage
processing equipment. This research will identify low cost and energy efficient
techniques for making shear-thickening fluids less viscous so that they can be
more easily and efficiently used. Experiments are aimed at showing that acoustic
(ultrasound) waves can be generated in a controlled fashion to tune and reduce
the viscosity of shear-thickening fluids. This viscosity reduction will result
in less energy consumption in moving and processing of the fluid. The success of
this work could facilitate many important manufacturing processes, including the
design of self-healing materials and 3D printing
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been shown that shear thickening can
be controlled and mitigated by applying an orthogonal perturbation to the flow.
Previous studies have largely used electrical and magnetic properties of
colloidal suspensions to tune shear thickening, which is only useful for
particles with these unique properties. Boundary-driven shear flows have also
been studied, but are not standard in manufacturing contexts. Thus there is an
urgent unmet need to demonstrate remote viscosity tuning in pressure-driven
flows of shear-thickening suspensions of passive particles. What is currently
unknown is how remote perturbation of pressure-driven flows at the particle
level to break force chains can be implemented in a scalable architecture that
can tune viscosity on macroscopic scales and thus facilitate manufacturing
processes. We will de-thicken colloidal suspensions by inducing orthogonal
perturbations with biaxial bulk-acoustic-wave forcing. By characterizing both
the systemic response and the microscale structure of the colloidal chains, we
will answer the fundamental question of how shear-induced force chains can be
broken in pressure-driven flow. Remote perturbation and de-thickening of fluids
is important to realizing the many exciting engineering benefits of shear-
thickening fluids (self-healing materials, inkjet printing, 3D printing, etc.).
These benefits cannot be achieved unless the manufacturing and processing of
shear-thickening suspensions can be managed in a way that is thermodynamically
and economically efficient and is minimally damaging to
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
