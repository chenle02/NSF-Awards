One of the more persistent questions in economics concern the sources of
randomness in movements of endogenous variables in models of rational economic
behavior. For example, in business cycles, economic theory explains random
movements of endogenous variables in terms of exogenous shocks and randomness.
However, economists are hard pressed to find truly exogenous causes for the
behavior of many enogenous variables (for example, the October, 1987 stock
market crash). This work explores the possibility that economic uncertainty may
in fact be endogenously generated. The authors notion of how agents' beliefs
about endogenous variables affect those same variables and then feedback on
their own beliefs, ad infinitum, is formalized by considering common knowledge
in Bayesian games. They examine the formal properties of the belief hierarchy in
a dynamic game and the question of whether correlated or extrinsic equilibria of
such a game can be endogenous.
