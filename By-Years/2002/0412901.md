With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Franklin and Marshall College will acquire a 400 MHz
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on atranyl-nucleosides as transition state
analogs in the study of the hammerhead ribozyme, in vivo incorporation of
photocrosslinked amino acids to increase protein stability, molecular
recognition using fluorescent chemsensors, the mechanism of the [1,3]carbon
shift, hypercoordination in organogermanium compounds, and the structure-lattice
energy relationship in lead double salts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic organometallic chemistry and biochemistry.
