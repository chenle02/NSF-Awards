9313898 Willsky This three-year awards supports ongoing U.S.-France cooperative
research in image and signal processing among investigators from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California at Davis,
and INRIA/Rocquencourt and Rennes (French National Institute for Research in
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics). The U.S. and French teams are led by
Alan Willsky, MIT, and Albert Benveniste, INRIA. The objective of their research
is to investigate various problems in geometric modeling, nonlinear systems, and
image processing. They will study (1) multiresolution statistical signal and
image processing; (2) failure and event detection; (3) new approaches to
nonlinear parameter systems; and (4) discrete event systems. The U.S. and French
investigators have considerable expertise on all these topics. The project takes
advantage in particular of substantial French advances in nonlinear systems
modeling and different, but complementary, approaches to problems in discrete
event systems. The French are also considered world experts in systems described
by partial differential equations. The collaboration will advance understanding
on analysis and design of circuits for signal processing applications. ***
