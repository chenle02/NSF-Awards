This project incorporates the use of Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
(GC/MS) into the undergraduate teaching and research laboratories at the
university. GC/MS has proven to be an extremely powerful tool for the analysis
of complex mixtures of unknowns from environmental, biochemical, and synthetic
sources. With the commercialization of inexpensive bench-top GC/MS instruments,
this technique is now fully established as a routine method of analysis and is
now used in almost all environmental testing laboratories and most organic
chemistry laboratories. This project introduces this powerful method of analysis
to the university's students through hands-on laboratory exercises and
undergraduate research projects.
