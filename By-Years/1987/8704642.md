A program of basic research on coding problems in symbolic dynamics will be
conducted. Techniques of ergodic theory and the theory of automata will be used
to obtain new results on the classification of symbolic dynamical systems and
the existence of continuous codes between them. This topic has applications in
communication theory and in the study of naturally occurring dynamical systems
such as fluid flows.
