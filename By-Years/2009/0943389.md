The attitudes citizens hold toward judicial institutions are of great political
significance. Social scientists are now generally in agreement that few forms of
political capital are as useful to political institutions as legitimacy, and no
institution is more dependent upon legitimacy than the judiciary. The
conventional view is that courts have neither the power of the purse nor of the
sword and are therefore dependent upon the voluntary compliance that typically
springs from legitimacy. But the truth is that, however useful legitimacy may be
to courts, no political institution could be effective without some mechanism
for inducing citizens to believe that accepting its policy outputs is the right
thing to do. Using a nationwide survey, the PI will investigate public attitudes
about the Supreme Court in light of the recent nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to
fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
Specifically, the PI will test the hypothesis that attention-getting judicial
events (such as the nomination of Sotomayor to the Court) will activate dormant
attitudes toward law and courts. The findings from this study will enhance
understanding of the dynamics of public opinion and the courts as well as
provide unique insights into the process by which members of the federal
judiciary are selected.
