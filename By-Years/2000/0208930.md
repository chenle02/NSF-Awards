This joint award made to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill by the
Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry (MPS) and the Kinetics,
Catalysis and Molecular program in the Division of Chemical Transport System
(ENG) is to design and synthesize porous chiral crystalline and non-crystalline
zeolitic materials based on polymer-metal coordination networks. With this
award, Professor Lin will prepare a variety of enantiopure rigid and bridging
ligands with different functional groups and topologies from readily available
2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthalene. These chiral porous materials will have
tailorable nanometer-sized chiral pockets and functionalities that can be
exploited for potential applications in enantioselective separations and
catalysis. These materials will have both the advantages offered by
heterogeneous catalysts (including facile catalyst separation and recovery, high
stability, and ease of handling), and those offered by their homogeneous
counterparts (including homogeneity of active sites, high efficiency,
reproducibility, selectivity, and controllability, and mild reaction
conditions). In addition, training in materials chemistry will be provided to a
diversity of students with this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award,
porous and non-crystalline zeolite like materials with tailorable nanometer-
sized chiral pockets and functionalities will be synthesized from readily
available chemicals, and these materials are expected to have applications in
enantioselective separations and catalysis for the synthesis of chiral drugs and
fine chemicals. In addition, these catalysts will have the advantages of both
heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts.
