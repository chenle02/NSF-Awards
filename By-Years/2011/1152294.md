With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Lawrence R. Sita
from University of Maryland at College Park will work on discovering and
developing new paradigms, catalysts and polymerization processes that can be
used to significantly expand the range of polyolefins and their end-use
applications in support of new technologies. The primary hypothesis that will be
pursued is that different categories of fast and reversible dynamic processes
that are competitive with chain-growth propagation can be introduced to
establish two-state living coordination olefin polymerization in which the
relative rates of the dynamic process and propagation can be brought under
external control to direct polyolefin production over a spectrum that is
delineated by two extreme boundary structures. Several new paradigms will be
conceived and developed in order to remove existing restrictions that are
presently imposed by classical approaches that are based on a one-to-one
correlation between catalyst structure and polyolefin
product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific impact this work
will provide support for a continued scientific and economic competitive
position of the U.S. in the global polyolefin and chemical industries and
support training of future generation of scientists and engineers for science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related careers. Importantly,
the discovery and development of new technological inventions and innovations of
commercial value will support the national economy.
