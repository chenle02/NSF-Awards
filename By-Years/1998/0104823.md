The goal of research in complexity theory is to classify the complexity of real
world computational problems by providing lower bounds on the resources required
to solve them. To date - in spite of impressive lower bounds for restricted
types of circuits- almost the only useful progress toward this goal has come via
the tool of reducibility, which allows one to show that problem is complete for
complexity class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the most important complexity
classes can be characterized in terms of Boolean circuits of restricted size or
depth, etc. Recently, it has become apparent that arithmetic circuits are also
very useful in this regard. The relationships between Boolean and arithmetic
circuit complexity are still only poorly understood, although there has been
significant progress on this front recently. This project will work to clarify
these relationships further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specially, this project will
exploit new insights about the complexity of arithmetic operation, in order to
investigate the power of small space-bounded complexity classes and complexity
classes defined in terms of small-depth circuits. Also the tools of Kolmogorov
complexity will be applied, in order to obtain a better understanding of the
complexity of graph reachability problems. More generally, the project will
attempt to clarify the relationship among complexity classes, and the various
notions (nondeterminism, unambiguity, symmetry, Boolean and arithmetic circuits,
etc.) that define models of computation characterizing important complexity
classes.&lt;br/&gt;
