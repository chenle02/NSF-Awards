The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the period of time in the early Universe when
it is thought that the first stars and galaxies formed. Understanding the
physics of galaxy formation and feedback during the EoR is one of the key goals
of modern cosmology and astrophysics. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the
early Universe have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of these
first stars and galaxies. This work will improve data analysis with the
Murchison Widefield Array telescope so that researchers can make significantly
better detections of such faint signals, making the observations much more
useful and providing a tool for researchers engaged in similar projects. In
addition, this work will continue and expand the initiative to provide Research
Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates. Undergraduate research is an
essential component in preparing students both for graduate school and for
positions in the broader STEM workforce. Providing this kind of research
experience to non-traditional undergraduate students will enable more of them to
go on to graduate school, increasing the diversity of the broader STEM
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the continued work of a
successful EoR analysis team. Over the past four years innovations by the US
imaging power spectrum (PS) team have driven the field forward and have led to
the deepest EoR PS limits in the world. The investigators will make the next
steps needed to reduce the limits by another order of magnitude with Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) data. Specifically, this work will make improvements in PS
analyses with the MWA that will lower limits on the signal strength by an order
of magnitude, making deep cuts into the possible parameter space for EoR models.
This research will be invaluable for the entire 21 cm
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
