9412825 Frangopol A 2 day workshop on "reliability Incorporation in Highway
Bridge Engineering" is proposed for August 1995, in boulder, Colorado. The
workshop will include modern concepts and methods in structural reliability and
their role in the development of the new load and resistance factor design
(LRFD) code for highway bridges. Also, reliability-based requirements for
inspection of bridges will be developed, maintenance strategies for assurance of
high bridge safety will be explored, and methods for optimization of bridge
maintenance programs will be outlined. Finally, on going research results in
bridge load models, deterioration models, and the integration of reliability-
based assessments in bridge management systems will be discussed. This workshop
will provide transfer of information on modern reliability technology to state
highway officials, state bridge engineers, bridge inspectors, bridge designers,
and bridge maintenance personnel. It will provide a unique forum and opportunity
to individuals who manage the U.S. bridge infrastructure system, to better
understand and apply modern reliability concepts and methods in highway bridge
engineering. The documents of this workshop will be widely distributed
throughout the United States to all Departments of Transportation, highway
bridge officials and practicing bridge engineers. ***
