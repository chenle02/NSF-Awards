This proposal requests funds for continuation of studies of the segmental motion
of polymers at solid interfaces. Since the interfacial regions are quite thin,
spectroscopic techniques are required for their characterization. In this case,
the technique to be used is primarily nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR
studies will be done with deuterium and specifically labeled polymers. Deuterium
NMR has several advantages and the polymers will be studied with line shape,
two-dimensional exchange, and relaxation time studies. These will give a picture
of the motion of the polymer molecules at the interface. Of particular interest
is the quantification of the molecular motion with the deuterium exchange
experiment. The use of the deuterium label can also provide contrast so that the
interface can be studied even in the presence of an overlayer of unlabeled
polymers. The result of the successful completion of this work will be that
knowledge of the structure and dynamics of interfacial materials will help
researchers to design interfacial systems with enhanced properties for advance
applications such as advanced composite structures, electronic devices, and
particle stabilization. %%% Thin films made from polymers are important in a
variety of applications including structural composites, sensors, and
electronics. In these systems, the properties of the thin films are critical to
the success of the devices that use them. Characterization of the properties of
the polymers is crucial to an understanding of how the devices work. Ultimately,
the properties of devices with polymers can be improved if the behavior and
their roles are understood. These determinations become even more crucial as the
size of the devices, and hence the thickness of the polymer films become
smaller. For example, in electronic devices, some of the properties of the
polymer layers change with the thickness of the polymer layer.
