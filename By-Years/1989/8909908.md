In this project, four separate tasks will be carried out, evolving form or
using data obtained by the P.I. over the last three years. Studies will focus
on: 1. Sub-Arctic Intermediate Water (SAIW), a major source of recently
ventilated water in the North Atlantic; 2. Water mass properties nad circulation
in the Cascadia Basin in the Northeast Pacific Basin; 3. Near-surface velocity
structure on sections across the North Pacific; and 4. Oceanic subduction in the
subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic.
