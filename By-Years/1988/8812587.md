Soil erosion on both natural and cultivated slopes is a serious problem in the
United States and throughout the world. Effective solutions to water-induced
erosion are impeded by the absence of basic microlevel understandings of the
relationship between precipitation and erosion processes. In particular, we lack
sound mathematical models that will predict soil erosion resulting from water
flowing across surfaces in broad sheets (interrill erosion), an important form
of erosion in many regions, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Existing
models do not take into account loose sediment that has accumulated on ground
surfaces prior to rainfall (detachment storage), and the omit processes of flow
erosion. This research will refine models of interrill erosion by including and
comparing those variables. Professor Abrahams and his students will apply
simulated rainfall to matched pairs of experimental plots at the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona. One plot will
be covered with a screen that will dissipate raindrop impact; the other will
receive the full impact of the simulated raindrops. Thus the second plot will be
subject to erosion from both raindrop impact and flow erosion, while the first
will experience only flow erosion. The measurements that will be taken on the
paired plots will make it possible to model variations in relative rates of flow
and in raindrop erosion, to calibrate the interrill erosion model and thereby
develop predictive equations, and to compare the characteristics of sediments
eroded by flowing water and by raindrop impact. This project will yield basic
insights into a major geomorphologic process with important implications for
soil conservation programs domestically and abroad.
