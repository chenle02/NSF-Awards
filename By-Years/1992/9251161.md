The aim of the project is to establish a computer-based laboratory to enhance
the teaching and investigation of human memory and cognition. Five computers
with specialized software that can be programmed by relatively inexperienced
users will simulate a number of experimental paradigms that require brief visual
displays and millisecond timing. In addition to enhancing a class in memory and
cognition, the equipment will allow introduction of a new laboratory course as
part of the proposed curriculum revision. Students will use the more advanced
laboratory to pursue individualized research projects, applying the methods and
findings of cognitive science to a problem of their choice.
