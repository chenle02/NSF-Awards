Designing aircraft, skyscrapers, jet engines, medical imaging equipment,
computer chips, communication equipment, etc., have one thing in common: they
are expensive to prototype. It is significantly cheaper and faster to be able to
simulate new designs on a computer before building them. However this requires
the ability to rapidly solve the equations of physics, almost all of which are
posed as partial differential equations. Unfortunately the current state of the
art for the numerical solution of partial differential equations is just too
slow to meet the majority of industrial needs.

This project is investigating a new promising numerical technique. First it uses
a clever variant of the Golomb--Weinberger principle to deal with the infinite
number of unknowns. Second, it picks a finite number of equations but insists
that the error be exactly zero. Since there are more unknowns than equations,
there are many potential solutions, and it uses the Golomb--Weinberger principle
to pick the smoothest solution. Deep mathematical techniques can be used to
prove that the computed solution will be close to the true solution for a very
wide class of partial differential equations, wider than that for current state
of the art methods, and this is what makes the project's approach so
significant. Sophisticated modern numerical techniques are needed to make this
into a practical approach. The initial goal of this project is a working
software system for two dimensional problems, along with a detailed mathematical
analysis to increase confidence in the approach.

Broader impacts of this research include software development for public use and
supporting and mentoring a female graduate student in this interdisciplinary
field.
