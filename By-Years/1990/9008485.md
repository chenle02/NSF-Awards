A three year program of research is proposed on a new class of majority carrier
optoelectronic devices based on a recently developed technique for making
electrical contact to the deep InAs quantum well in pseudomorphic
AlAs/InAs/InGaAs resonant tunnelling diode heterostructures. These radical new
devices all operate on intersubband electronic transitions between the
conduction band levels of a single InAs quantum well and on tunnelling of
electrons into and out of the same quantum well; they represent a major advance
in the state-of-the- art-. Work is proposed on tunnel injection, quantum well
level laser diodes for the 2-5 um region; on sub-picosecond quantum well level,
tunnel barrier infrared photodiodes; and on ultrafast quantum well level, tunnel
barrier optoelectronic modulators and non-linear optical components.
