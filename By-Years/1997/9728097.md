Nerve cells, or neurons, have elongated branches called neurites that sometimes
reach long distances to make connections with other parts of the brain. Inside
the cell are structures called organelles that are important for transport of
materials from one place to another. For transport within the cell, important
biochemicals often are packaged in small bubble-like containers called vesicles.
The actual mechanisms of transport are not fully understood, but some proteins
are believed to act like motors, transporting vesicles along 'tracks' of
organelles called microtubules. This project investigates a recently discovered
neural protein called HAP1, which is associated with microtubules and some kinds
of vesicles. Biochemical and microscopic studies will examine how the HAP1
protein binds to form a molecular complex with some of the motor proteins
associated with microtubule transport mechanisms. Results from this work will be
important in understanding intracellular transport mechanisms, and so will be
important beyond neuroscience to cell biology in general, and to developmental
biology.
