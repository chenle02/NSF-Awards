The main problem to be studied concerns cycle decompositions of complete
graphs. The aim is to find the values of n for which complete graphs with n
vertices have a decomposition into cycles of fixed odd length. Other problems
related to cycle decompositons will be studied, such as the resolvability and
nesting of cycle systems. Cycle decompositions constitute a special case of
neighborhood designs which have found numerous applications in the design of
statistical experiments, in particular of balanced incomplete block designs.
