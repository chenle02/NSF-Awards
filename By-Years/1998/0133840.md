University CAREER: Weaving a Code Tapestry: A Compiler Directed Framework for
Scalable Network Emulation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we propose a
new scalable network emulation test-bed that supports both the simulation as
well as direct code execution paradigms within a single framework. In order to
represent the scale and heterogeneity of the Internet, the test-bed scales to
tens to hundreds of thousands of network nodes. The first major challenge lies
in developing programming models that can represent the digraph relationship of
network protocol stacks within a single process, without manually modifying
either the protocol stack or network applications. Secondly, the enormous scope
of the test bed requires us to address problems in inter application context
switch time, memory usage and parallel discrete event simulation, all of which
present bottlenecks to scalability.&lt;br/&gt;
