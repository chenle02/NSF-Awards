9319698 Humphrey This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory
Research (SGER) to document and analyze a surge, which is in progress, on the
Bering Glacier in Alaska. Surging is defined as periodic, very rapid movements
of large quantities of ice within a glacier, alternating with much longer
periods of near stagnation. The Bering Glacier is the longest (191 kilometers)
and largest (5,173.5 square kilometers) glacier in North America. This study
will monitor the basal hydrology of the surge, by monitoring outlet streams that
emerge from the glacier at different elevations. Automated observations of
water, suspended, and dissolved loads from glacial outlets will monitor the
subglacial hydraulics which, according to present understanding, control the
propagation of surges. ***
