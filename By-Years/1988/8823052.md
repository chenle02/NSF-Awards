Liquefaction is a major cause of structural damage during earthquakes.
(Liquefaction is a loss of shear strength of soils during strong ground
shaking). The accepted procedure for assessing liquefaction hazard is the
"simplified procedure for evaluating liquefaction potential" developed by Seed
and Idriss. Recent observations indicate that this procedure may overestimate
the liquefaction hazard for earthquakes of Richter magnitude 6.5 or less. Since
modifications to a design to prevent liquefaction damage are usually expensive,
any overestimate of the liquefaction hazard is economically undesirable. The
objective of this research program is to examine the hypothesis that the
magnitude scaling factors used in this simplified procedure are too small for
moderate earthquakes. This objective is achieved by analyzing field performance
data, and statistically deriving magnitude scaling factors that are consistent
with observed performance. The tasks being addressed include, (1) the analysis
of sites where geotechnical data have been collected, and where ground motions
have been recorded at or near the site; (2) supplementing these few histories by
drilling and testing additional sites where ground motions and past liquefaction
behavior are known, and (3) reanalyzing tabulated case histories. This research
program is expected to reduce the calculated hazards to a level consistent with
observed field behavior, leading to less costly though equally safe design and
construction.
