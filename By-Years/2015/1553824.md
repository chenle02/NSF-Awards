There are a number of areas of Antarctic research by scientists from the United
States where rebreather technology (which unlike normal SCUBA diving releases
few if any air bubbles) would be valuable tools. These include but are not
limited to behavioral studies (because noise from bubbles released by standard
SCUBA alters the behavior of many marine organisms), studies of communities on
the underside of sea ice (because the bubbles disrupt the communities while or
before they are sampled), and studies of highly stratified lake communities
(because the bubbles cause mixing and because lighter line could be used to
tether a diver to the surface which would probably also cause less water column
disruption). The latter scientific advantage of less mixing in highly stratified
(not naturally mixed) lakes is also a significant environmental advantage of
rebreathers. However, for safety reasons, no US science projects will be
approved for the use of rebreathers until they are tested by the US Antarctic
Program (USAP). This award provides funds for the USAP Scientific Diving Officer
to conduct such tests in conjunction with other diving professionals experienced
in polar diving in general and specifically with rebreather technology in non-
polar environments.

A team of six scientific diving professionals will evaluate seven or more
commercial rebreather models that are being most commonly used in non-polar
scientific diving. This will be done through holes drilled or melted in sea ice
at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. A limited number of test dives of the best
performing models will subsequently be made in stratified lakes in the McMurdo
Dry Valleys.
