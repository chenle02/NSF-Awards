This research addresses physical processes associated with melting and melt
segregation in the mantle, and how these processes affect the geochemical
properties of erupted lavas. There is a wealth of geochemical data with which to
constrain and test various aspects of mantle dynamics, but in order to
effectively use this data one must first understand how melts related to their
mantle source both physically and chemically. A two-dimensional finite element
numerical code will be used to study a hierarchy of two-phase flow models
involving melting and melt segregation.
