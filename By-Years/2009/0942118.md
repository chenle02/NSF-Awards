(99) The Teaching Pipeline for STEM project creates, implements, and evaluates
two new degree programs to facilitate the entry of many more STEM majors into
careers in K-12 teaching. The project describes new minors in science education
and mathematics education; degrees designed to complement the deep discipline
training that upper division courses provide. The new programs provide
40students/year over three years from the Life and Physical Sciences or
Engineering with an opportunity to explore science or math teaching through
seminars and internships at local secondary schools. Individual projects in the
capstone courses of the minors bring these students into collaboration with UCLA
faculty and secondary school science and math professionals, teachers of the
discipline. By embedding these interdisciplinary minors within the fabric of the
science and mathematics departments, the project increases the visibility and
value of teaching careers within the research-intensive university environment.
Collaboration with faculty on other campuses with large graduate teacher
education programs will establish new and flexible pathways and options for UCLA
students to move into credential programs. The evaluation plan uses baseline
data collected to evaluate the change in the attitudes towards and the valuing
of the K-12 education profession in the natural sciences at a research-intensive
university resulting from the infusion of the programs in the departments. The
project serves as a national model for increasing the number of highly qualified
STEM students who enter teaching careers.
