The 5th International Summit on Hurricanes and Climate Change will take place
June 9-14, 2015 in Chania, Crete, Greece with organizing support provided by
Aegean Conferences. The purpose of this summit is to bring together an
international assemblage of leading academics and researchers on various sides
of the debate to discuss new research and express findings about climate changes
and future climate scenarios and their implications regarding regional and
global hurricane (tropical cyclone) activity. The goals are to address what
research is needed to advance the science of the hurricane climate and to
provide a venue for encouraging a lively, spirited, and sustained exchange of
ideas. Specific topics that will be addressed include surface wind fields, storm
surge, seasonal prediction, remote sensing, interannual variability,
paleotempestology, lightning, decadal variability, intensification, extra-
tropical transition, air-sea exchange, and landfall
probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will be a better
understanding of the future hurricane threat to the U.S. and elsewhere as well
as to allow early career participants to have international exposure of their
research and network with each other as well as with leading international
scientists.
