The PI plans research on the kinematics and dynamics of deformation in plate
boundary zones, through field observations( structural mapping to determine
faulting histories and amount and direction of motion), subsurface observations
(including measurements of the stress field in various plate tectonic settings,
particularly around the active plate boundaries), and kinematic predictions from
plate-tectonic observations. An aspect of these studies is the test of kinematic
predictions, derived from a knowledge of relative plate motions, compared
against the strain history observed along a particular plate margin. Such tests
are potentially applicable to many plate boundaries, especially the Pacific
North American Boundary and the New Zealand region. Both areas will be
investigated.
