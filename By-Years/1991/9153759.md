The aim of this proposal is to use project-based science as a vehicle to
improve science teaching and learning so that students will become more
knowledgeable, thoughtful, and motivated to learn science. The staff of the
project will work collaboratively with upper elementary and middle school
teachers to meld the theoretical and research based knowledge of university
faculty with the professional teaching knowledge of teachers. Because of an
interest in the problems and potential of project-based science for different
types of students, half of the participating teachers will be drawn from schools
which service a substantial number of low-income, minority, and high risk
groups. The project will result in the development and dissemination of a
variety of enhancement materials for teachers who want to use project-based
science instruction. These support materials will be based on the detailed
accounts of problems that teachers face and the solutions they devise as they
implement project-based science. They will include central components of
successful project design and implementation such as illustrations of key events
like introducing the project and instructional strategies in the life cycle of a
project. The materials will be expressed through a range of media from written
documents to a computer-based hypermedia project support environment that will
allow the teachers to search and use information to implement, modify and
generate projects.
