The investigator studies three broadly based areas of inquiry involving
dependent observations. In the first area he develops accurate probabilistic
tools for the study of self-normalized estimators in dependent variables. In
particular he explores the intrinsic properties of long range dependence on the
basis of the observed data. In the second area he develops copula based
estimators for the probability of rare events in dependent data and introduces
an approach for assessing the quality of models used in the prediction of these
events. In the third area he develops a (probabilistically based) historical
approach to boundary crossing under imperfect information and develops estimates
for the expected time it takes a process to hit a boundary. The general nature
of his approach provides estimates on ``average times'' rather than ``actual
times''. Sensitivity studies are being performed to quantify the robustness of
the estimates. The methodology is being calibrated by using extensive data banks
on natural phenomena as well as by the use of computer intensive general
circulation models. The investigator is developing tools to aid in the
understanding of the connections between historical information and the average
time for the occurrence of natural events. He works closely with regulators in
the development of general quality control tools with particular application to
banking. His work is enriched by close interactions with graduate students
contributing to the training and mentoring of a diverse group of scientists
knowledgeable in the new approaches and able to formulate, develop and solve the
problems they will encounter throughout their academic, public or industrial
careers. His work has the potential of improving public confidence in banking
and financial institutions as well as in enhancing the understanding of the role
of historical data in the management of natural resources and risks.
