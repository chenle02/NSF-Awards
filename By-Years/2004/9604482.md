Abstract EEC-9604482 Moore This award provides funding for the first year of a
five-year continuing award that initiates the start of a multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Glass which started at
Alfred University and now is incorporating the University of Missouri-Rolla. The
expanded research agenda with the University of Missouri-Rolla research site
will address "A Baseline Study of Refractory Creep and MOE of Unaltered
Glasstank Refractories," "Post-Corrosion Creep and MOE and Creep During
Corrosion of Glassplant Refractories," "Glassplant Refractory Corrosion,"
"Thermal Shock and Thermal Stressing of Glasstank Refractories," "Microscopic
Characterization of Glass Defects, Structures and Glassplant Refractories," and
"On-line Monitoring of Glasstank Corrosion by Ultrasonic and Electromagnetic
Methods."
