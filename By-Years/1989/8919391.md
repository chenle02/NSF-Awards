This impressive, ambitious, complex proposal will investigate some of the most
important features of the family's impact on the development of competence in
children. More specifically, the work will examine the impact of parent-child
interactions on peer relationships, the effects of parental supervision on
children's peer interactions, and the role of the parent as provided of
opportunities for peer interaction. A short term longitudinal study will be
conducted over a 4 year period to study these issues, when children are in
grades K-3. Observational and interview measures of family function will be
taken yearly as will measures of familial management of peer relationships. The
research promises to tell us much about the effects of different parenting
styles and family climate on the development of social competence. This proposal
promises to address issues of important theoretical and practical concern, and
to provide crucial information of the manner in which families produce children
who are capable, or less capable, of forming social relationships that work for
their own good, and the good of others in the society.
