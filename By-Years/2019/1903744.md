The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry and the
Atmospheric Chemistry Program in the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace
Sciences jointly support this project by Professor Marcelo Guzman and his
students. They study the reaction of gases in the environment (for example,
ozone with pollutants emitted during combustion (e.g., of power plants) and
forest fires. Both types of emissions cause tiny particles to be suspended in
air. These particles play a major role in visibility and air quality. The
project investigates oxidation reactions occurring on the surface of particles
because chemical reactions on the surface can further increase or decrease
visibility and air quality. This research provides interdisciplinary training in
environmental and atmospheric chemistry to graduate and undergraduate students
in Kentucky. The project includes a collaboration with the Lexington-Fayette
School District by offering hands-on activities in atmospheric chemistry for
Kindergarten and first- and second-graders. Thus, Kentucky's citizens learn
about the societal impacts of pollution and the interaction of sunlight with
gases and particles in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
develops a mechanistic understanding of chemical processes that generate complex
organic matter via accretion in the troposphere. The production of reactive
species and their coupling to form oligomers is being studied. These reactions
take place at the air-water and air-solid interfaces. The research addresses the
effects of relative humidity on the fate of pollution from combustion and
biomass-burning emissions. The team investigates oxidation reactions (with
ozone, HO and NO3 radicals) on the surface of aqueous microdroplets and thin
solid films under realistic atmospheric conditions. Multiple analytical tools
are applied, including several spectroscopy techniques, mass spectrometry, and
chromatographic analyses. The project investigates the effects of substituent
variation (structural variation) on chemical reactivity of molecules emitted
during combustion and biomass-burning toward gas-phase oxidizers. The
anticipated outcome of the project is a deeper understanding of oxidation
mechanisms with relevance to environmental, biochemical, and technological
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
