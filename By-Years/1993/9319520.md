The PIs propose to investigate "decoy effects," which are the influences that a
new alternative has when it is added to a set of options from which a person has
to make a choice. Occasionally such decoys have quite paradoxical effects, such
as increasing the likelihood of choosing an original member of the set. The
investigators will use techniques which assess the information- gathering
processes used by persons in such decoy effect experiments. Eye movement
monitoring will also be done. A total of twelve experiments are proposed.
