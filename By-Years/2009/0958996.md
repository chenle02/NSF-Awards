This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor William P. Malachowski and colleagues
Sharon N. Burgmayer, Jonas I. Goldsmith and Frank B. Mallory from the Department
of Chemistry at Bryn Mawr College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
outfitted with a broadband probe, a dual 1H-13C probe, and variable temperature
unit. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1)
synthetic tools for therapies and IDO inhibitor development for anti-cancer
treatment; 2) reactions of pterin-dithiolene molybdenum complexes; 3) synthesis
of [n]phenacenes for use as molecular wires; and 4) design of multimetallic
transition metal complexes for light harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research.&lt;br/&gt;
