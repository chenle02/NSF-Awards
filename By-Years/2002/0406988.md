Studying Stellar Evolution and Galactic Halo Formation with Globular Cluster
Abundance Inhomogeneities

ABSTRACT

AST 0406988 Graeme Smith

Dr. Graeme Smith, at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will undertake a
program to investigate the extent to which red giant stars undergo interior
mixing and subsequently produce altered surface abundances, and to probe the
origin of the Galactic halo. Chemical abundance inhomogeneities of Galactic
globular clusters will be used in a three-pronged approach in this effort: 1)
The PI will determine whether deep mixing in globular red giants depends on the
star's metallicity; 2) The PI will investigate if and how the incidence of CN-
strong red giants varies in clusters with different properties and 3) The PI
will determine the extent to which CN-strong giants are present in the halo
field, and globulars associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The broader
impact of this proposed research resides with student training, with the
involvement of a Ph.D. thesis student in the research.
