The research project considers theoretically the observation that household
purchases of durable goods are typically infrequent, rather than continuous. One
explanation for this pattern is the existence of transactions costs that make
continuous updating of the durables stock too costly. This work presents an
analytical solution to the optimal consumption problem of a consumer facing
transactions costs. These costs may take any of a class of forms. They may
represent a linear adjustment costs or search costs, applied to either a
divisible or an indivisible durable good. The infrequent purchases generated in
this model may help to explain the volatility and persistence of changes in
aggregate durables expenditure. The interactive component includes: al informal
lunch/discussion with women faculty and graduate students from Cambridge/Boston
universities, followed by a formal academic seminar by a women scholar; teaching
an advanced graduate course in macroeconomics; and promoting visibility of
academic and research opportunities for women through an undergraduate speakers
program.
