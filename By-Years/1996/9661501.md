*** 9661501 Knudson This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
determine if a heterogeneous catalyst that will rapidly destroy chlorinated
hydrocarbons can be produced from two waste materials. This effort will
determine if an active catalyst can be provided by adding ionic iron by ion
exchange into a low-cost feedstock followed by thermal treatment under a
reducing gas. This process should produce a highly dispersed iron-carbon
supported heterogeneous catalyst. The proposed technology is designed to produce
a low-cost, kinetically rapid, high-capacity heterogeneous catalyst for the
remediation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. These properties mean that it can be
used economically in barrier applications to remediate groundwater. ***
