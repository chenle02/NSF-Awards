Estimation of accuracy of a statistical inference gives a revision of the usual
probability statement (for example: p-value, or confidence coefficient) based on
formalizing the statistical basis for evaluating such data-dependent measures.
In this research these notions of conditional inference will be extended to
multiple inference problems from multiple comparisons procedures to meta-
analysis.
