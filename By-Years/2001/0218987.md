This proposal requests support for investigators from Harvard and Northwestern
Universities for an investigation of the creation and use of application
signatures from the ATLAS high energy physics experiment, at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland, as estimators for resource usage and
adaptation for computing on a Grid. The experiment will be working with the
largest data sets ever used in a physics experiment and will involve physicists
distributed world wide. The access to these data and the analyses of them will
require a grid network. Rather than just transfer the large data sets around the
world, the scientists need to be able to regenerate the data by taking a limited
signature of a specific data set, called an application signature, and invoke
methods to cause a physical materialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group
proposes to develop application signatures for jobs in the ATLAS experiment; to
develop tools to estimate the execution times required to complete computing
tasks based on a limited set of application signatures; to use this information
to help schedule tasks on a set of grid resources; to find the most efficient
way to solve a particular ATLAS analysis problem; and to evaluate their results
in terms of generalization to other applications.&lt;br/&gt;
