Dale Barkey 9306837 This is a study of the spontaneous growth of
electrodeposited metal dendrites. Both experimental and theoretical
investigations of the initiation and propagation of dendrites are included, with
emphasis on interfacial dynamics. Experimental studies of the metal/solution
interface focus on nucleation and growth under pristine conditions with high
spatial resolution. The theoretical component relates these interfacial
processes to the appearance of macroscopic structure and to growth velocity.
Experimental techniques include voltammetry, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy, atomic force and scanning tunnelling microscopies, and optical
methods including shadowgraph imaging and holographic interferometry. Single-
crystal electrodes and needle electrodes are used to examine the effects of
crystalline anisotropy and curvature on the deposition dynamics. Spontaneous
growth of dendrites is often the limiting factor for space-time yields in
technologies using electrodeposition, including electrochemical processing,
energy storage, and metal finishing. (For example, it is the principal cause of
failure in automotive batteries.) This study is an attempt to relate microscopic
interfacial processes with the appearance and growth of macroscopic dendrites.
The emphasis is on metals of commercial significance in plating, energy storage
(batteries), and structural materials.
