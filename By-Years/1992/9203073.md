This Phase II project addresses the problems in the quality of images
transmitted in a computer environment. A common problem is the "tile effect"
which is introduced by compression of the signal for transmission and then
decompression for viewing. The principal investigator is developing a new
algorithm, called the JPEG/RBC algorithm, which is based on a two source
decomposition derived from a noncausal model for image data and fits closely
within the framework of the JPEG standard. A preliminary version of the
algorithm was shown in Phase I to reduce this problem as well as the compressed
data rate when compared to commonly used algorithms. Potential applications
include photo ID systems, medical imaging, intelligence and prepress.
