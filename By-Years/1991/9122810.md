The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from Columbia University requests funding for equipment that
will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V EWING, a 239
foot vessel that is owned and operated by the University.
