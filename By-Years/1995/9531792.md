9531794 Luby This project funds speaker and participant costs for a workshop,
titled ``Randomized Algorithms and Computation'', at ICSI, December 17 -- 22,
1995. The Workshop emphasizes applications to approximation algorithms for
optimization and counting problems, coding theory with network and multimedia
applications, cryptography and security, distributed computation, and
derandomization of algorithms. The Workshop: (1) Brings together leading
researchers from Europe, Israel, Canada and the U.S.; (2) Is being combined with
the Weizmann Institute Workshop on ``Randomness and Computation'' (normally held
in Israel in January); (3) Is organized in cooperation with the ESPIRT RAND
Working Group. This project is a cooperative funding effort with support for
European participants provided by the ESPRIT RAND-REC Project. ***
