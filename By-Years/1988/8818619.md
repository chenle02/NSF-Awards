A major challenge in contemporary biological oceanography is to reconcile the
opposing arguments that nutrient regeneration in the euphotic zone of the open
ocean is highly efficient, while at the same time new production is fare greater
than previously believed. One hypothesis is that two separate biological systems
operate side by side: one composed of small microbes that regenerate most of the
nutrients and contribute little to new production and another composed of large
phytoplankton species that are ever present in background numbers and that grow
rapidly in response to episodic inputs of nutrients at low light levels at the
base of the euphotic zone and then sink out quickly. The former system is well
studied, but the latter is not. The goal of this research is to study the growth
and to gauge the role of large phytoplankton species in new production at very
low irradiance. The results will provide a basis for assessing the potential for
large phytoplankton species contributing greatly to new production while going
unnoticed because of the episodic nature of their growth and sinking.
