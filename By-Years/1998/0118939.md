0118939&lt;br/&gt;Furlong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accommodation of
transpression along plate boundaries can be accomplished in many ways. Along the
Australian - Pacific plate boundary within the South Island of New Zealand,
there is a profound change in the style of transpressional tectonics between the
crustal/lithospheric shortening and uplift of the Southern Alps segment of the
plate boundary and the localized subduction-like behavior of the Fiordland
segment. Why such a substantial change in plate boundary tectonics occurs over
distances of only tens of kilometers without any significant change in plate
kinematics is a fundamental issue of lithospheric geodynamics and most likely
reflects the complex interplay of tectonic history, local lithospheric
structure, and 3-D plate kinematics. Unraveling this complex set of processes
requires truly interdisciplinary studies. In order to foster such
interdisciplinary research and develop plans for future collaborative projects,
we are holding a research workshop focusing on the geodynamics and active
tectonics of the Fiordland plate boundary region. The workshop will occur in
January 2002 (the New Zealand summer). The 'meeting' segment of the workshop is
at the University of Otago in Dunedin, while the 'field' segment of the workshop
(involving a subset of the meeting attendees) is based out of Te Anau, a small
town on the eastern margin of Fiordland. The university setting provides
suitable facilities for scientific presentations (both oral and poster) and
discussions, while Te Anau is an excellent base for sorties into Fiordland. In
order to encourage focused discussions of our current understanding of the
tectonics of the region, poster presentations and substantial discussion time
are the main component of the meeting part of the workshop. To provide an
overview of the interdisciplinary issues, there is one 'background' presentation
for each half-day session of the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;
