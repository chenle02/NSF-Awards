This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program Announcement
NSF 88-28, Research Experience for Undergraduates. This award renews for three
years, a successful REU Site program. Under this award Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute will provide ten undergraduate students with training and support
while they participate in ongoing research projects in the University's Computer
Science Department. The award recognizes the importance of hands-on experience
in active research for training undergraduates for careers in mathematics,
science and engineering, and that too few such experiences are now available.
The University recruited some of the students from other institutions, in order
to broaden the base for attracting students to scientific careers.
