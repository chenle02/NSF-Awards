9319927 Satterlie Behavioral arousal in animals and humans occurs when there is
a change in several independent behaviors so that the overall behavioral output
is more focussed or efficient. Behavioral arousal is an important issue that is
not well-understood at the cellular level. In the marine mollusc Clione when
prey is nearby, a feeding arousal response occurs in which there is a decreased
threshold for starting the feeding behavior, an increase in swimming speed for
more efficient prey capture, an increase in heart rate and an inhibition of the
withdrawal response. This work will investigate the cellular mechanisms in the
nervous system that give rise to this change in behavioral state and examine the
role of the brain chemical serotonin in this behavior. Clione is an excellent
animal in which to study behavioral arousal because the neural circuits that
underlie the component behaviors (feeding, swimming, and withdrawal) have
already been worked out and the level of individual nerve cells by the PI and
others. The PI has also shown that injection of serotonin into the animal
results in feeding arousal behavior and that there are cells in the Clione
nervous system that contain serotonin. ***
