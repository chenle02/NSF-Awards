The aim of this project is to explore theoretical ideas in mathematics and
computer science that are related to quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a
physical theory that, notably, requires a new model of probability theory that
can be called quantum probability, and this in turn leads to the theory of
quantum computing and the possibility of building quantum computers. The project
will investigate quantum algorithms (algorithms that could be run on quantum
computers) for problems in topology, for example determining whether two knots
are equivalent or different. The project will also investigate quantum error
correction (a new kind of error correction that would be needed by quantum
computers) in the setting of a new kind of geometry, "quantum metric spaces", in
which distances are defined in the language of quantum probability. Finally the
project will explore quantum algebra, which is a kind of modern algebra with
non-commuting variables also inspired by quantum mechanics and which has
relations to quantum computing.

This project will have at least two and potentially three broader impacts.
First, all work will be disseminated on the arXiv, a widely used preprint server
that includes most work in quantum computing, and the principal investigator
will help support the arXiv. Second, the project will include development of
lecture notes, which could be made into a future graduate textbook, on quantum
probability, quantum computing, and quantum mechanics. Third, if quantum
computers are ever build, they will have an extremely broad impact, and the
ideas in this project will play a role.
