Moduli spaces reveal how objects of a particular type behave in families.
Results about individual mathematical objects that are unreachable by other
means can often be proved by considering them as members of a family of similar
objects, that is, as points in a moduli space. Important examples are given by
moduli spaces of curves, which give insight into the study of smooth curves and
their degenerations, and are a prototype for researchers studying moduli spaces
of higher dimensional varieties. Moreover, as curves arise in so many contexts,
moduli spaces of curves are a common meeting ground, connected in a fundamental
way with many disparate fields of mathematics and mathematical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to study sheaves on moduli
spaces of pointed curves defined using representations of vertex operator
algebras. These sheaves provide a natural generalization of Verlinde bundles,
also known as vector bundles of conformal blocks, which have played an important
role in understanding the birational geometry of moduli spaces of curves,
particularly in the case of curves of genus zero, where they are known to be
globally generated. Specifically, this research will enlarge the class of vector
bundles with good combinatorial properties defined on moduli spaces of curves,
find geometric interpretations for basepoint free classes on these moduli spaces
in terms of vector bundles, and use the resulting information to characterize
morphisms to these moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
