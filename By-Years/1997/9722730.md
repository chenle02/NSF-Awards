This one-year award will support participation of US students and young
scientists to attend the Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB)
Conference to be held in Greece , 21-24 June 1997. This is the fifth in this
newly established conference in the subfield of computational biology,
application of intelligent systems to problems in molecular biology. The 1997
conference is the second of these conferences held at an international site. Its
goals include convening a critical mass of researchers applying advanced
computational techniques to problems in molecular biology, creating cross-
disciplinary educational opportunities, and fostering the involvement of women
and minorities. This award will support the participation in the conference of
up to 20 graduate students or postdoctoral fellows, who are co-authors of papers
submitted to the conference. The European site of the meeting will provide
international opportunities for US researchers at an early stage in their
careers.
