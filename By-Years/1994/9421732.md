CTS-9421732 Ihab H. Farag University of New Hampshire ABSTRACT The project is a
regional pollution prevention conference involving students and faculty from
many institutions of higher education in New England. The conference is the
first of its kind in New England, and is being sponsored by the Pollution
Prevention Consortium of New England Universities. It expects to attract and
involve juniors, seniors and graduate students and faculty from a variety of
disciplines. Students already participating in pollution prevention research
will be invited to present their results at the conference and share their
experiences. The conference will provide a forum for the exchange and
demonstration of pollution prevention activities among students, and for the
discussion and dissemination of pollution prevention education programs among
faculty and educators. Speakers from industry, academia, and state and federal
agencies will participate. Partial support has also been obtained from the US
EPA and the US DOE.
