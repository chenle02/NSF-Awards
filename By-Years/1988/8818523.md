This award supports the continuation of marine geological research on the
Antarctic continental margin. This research focuses on four areas: 1) Mapping
the distribution and paleodrainage of marine ice sheets and ice shelves on the
Antarctic continental shelf during the last glacial maximum, through
sedimentologic analysis of cored deposits and high resolution seismic
investigations. Radiocarbon dating will be used to constrain the timing of
glacial events. 2) Increasing our understanding of glacial marine sedimentation
by conducting detailed lithofacies studies in areas that are considered
representative of Antarctic glacial marine environments. 3) Examining the deep
sea hemipelagic and turbidite record to determine how glacial changes are
manifested in these deep sea deposits. 4) Conducting high resolution seismic
stratigraphic studies of the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea continental
shelves with emphasis on the Neogene tectonic and glacial evolution of these
regions. Results from the last ten years, and from work to be completed in the
next two years, will be compiled in the form of a folio series on the Antarctic
continental margin.
