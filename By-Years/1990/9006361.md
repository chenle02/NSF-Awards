During the past decade advances in molecular biology, particularly recombinant
DNA and molecular cloning technologies, have had dramatic and wide-reaching
effects on many fields of biological research. Several members of the faculty at
CSULA have been using these powerful methods to gain important new insights into
biological structures and regulation of biological processes. Active research
programs exploring the regulation of neuroactive peptide production and release,
the expression of actin genes during development, the regulation of membrane
development during the sporulation cycle of Bacillus subtilis, the structural
definition of viral protein genes in mutant Sendai viruses in order to establish
the molecular basis of their biological properties, defining the molecular
signals for directing the orientation of viral budding in eukaryotic cells,
studies of sub-cellular organization in higher plants, mechanisms of uniparental
inheritance of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA in Chlamydomonas, and studies
of mechanisms regulating the expression of phosphate starvation-induction of
gene expression in higher plants all depend heavily on the availability of the
fundamental infrastructure of a well- equipped recombinant DNA research facility
at CSULA. The current facility, largely funded by our currently awarded RIMI
grant, located at this urban university with its large and diverse minority
enrollment, is providing a center of research excellence that promotes training
for minority students and will be a focus for related work at the many
neighboring State University Campuses. This application requests continued
support for this multi-user research facility, particularly for expanding our
capacity to carry out diverse types of tissue culture, and for the individual
research programs described above.
