The American Association of Physics Teachers will conduct a national conference
to define critical issues facing two-year college physics and astronomy faculty
today and in the decades to come. Judgments will be formed as to how these
issues should be faced and treated, resources available and those to be needed
will be assessed, and a set of recommendations will be published. A second
conference objective is related to information collection. Conferees will be
selected in such a way as to ensure broad representation from each type of two-
year college, as well as from many parts of the United States. In this way, it
is anticipated that information on current practice, student outcomes, and
future trends can be obtained. As a result of the conference, regional task
forces will be formed. They will prioritize and prepare conference
reocmmendations for publication. They also will be charged with the
responsibility of following through on these recommendations at the local level.
Participants, the grantee, and other organizations will contribute an amount
equal to about 32% of the award toward the operation of the project.
