The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
project is to provide a therapeutic solution for coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been implicated in several outbreaks, including prior SARS
and MERS. The proposed therapeutic will inhibit the virusâ€™s ability to replicate
and elicit the body's immune system to kill the virus. In addition, this
research can be applied to solutions for other viruses including RSV, hepatitis
B and HIV/AIDS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will advance a method
integrating vaccines, small molecule inhibitors, and antibodies. This project
will identify a small molecule that targets and binds to the virus, then link it
to a small payload that signals the body's immune system. This project will
identify and develop a targeting molecule that can bind effectively to multiple
strains of the coronavirus and a payload that promotes an appropriate immune
response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
