Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will extend the
understanding of the particles produced at present and planned accelerators,
including the photon, W and Z particles, the electron, > and . and their
neutrinos, and quarks and gluons. It will concentrate on the physics responsible
for the masses of many of these particles. This is the principal unsolved
mystery in the standard model of the basic forces. The research will also deepen
our understanding of quantum field theory, which provides the most useful
mathematical language for the study of this physics. This language is important
in other fields (condensed matter physics, for example) as well as in particle
physics. This project also will focus on aspects of string theory. Specific
areas of inquiry in string theory will include quantum gravity, aspects of
strings propagating in a space (in particular, the study of strings in the
context of cosmology and black holes), and topological field theories. String
theory has been perhaps the most active area of research in high energy physics
in the past seven years. Research in string theory is very important since
string theory is the only known fundamental theory which reconciles quantum
theory with Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will play an important
role in the advancement of this subject by studying, classifying and unifying
various solutions to string theory. Finally, the project will investigate the
relations of elementary particles to objects and processes that cannot be
directly studied at accelerators, such as the dark matter in the universe, black
holes produced by gravitational collapse, grand unified theories and baryon
number production in the early history of the universe.
