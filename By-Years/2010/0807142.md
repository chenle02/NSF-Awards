Through its S-STEM program focused on fostering student success in mathematics,
computer science, and physics, the Evergreen State College is: (a) increasing
enrollment, retention, and degree completion in STEM fields, (b) increasing the
number of graduates who continue studies in STEM, (c) strengthening
undergraduate opportunities for internships and employment in these fields, (d)
integrating academic and student advising support, and (e) demonstrating models
of collaboration between faculty and student support staff.

The S-STEM project awards twenty annual scholarships to financially needy
undergraduates with academic promise. Thorough, flexible recruitment and
selection plans ensure broad participation from underrepresented groups (low-
income, first generation, minorities, women, persons with disabilities) within
the scholarship recipient cohorts. In particular, targeted faculty-to-faculty
recruitment at specific community colleges and high schools with high numbers of
underrepresented students is part of a strategy to attract more of these
students to Evergreen's programs.

Based on retention research indicating that a sense of belonging and attachment
to a college is critical for student success and persistence, the S-STEM project
has a central retention strategy of establishing a learning community for
scholarship recipients. Activities of the learning community include a 3-day
pre-fall institute; biweekly seminars during the academic year; study groups;
shared identity through enrollment in interdisciplinary mathematics, computer
science, and physics programs; strong faculty, staff and peer support; and
social opportunities. Presentations on STEM careers, research and industrial
applications as well as partnerships with industry are additional strategies to
place students in graduate schools and industry, furthering Evergreen's response
to Washington State's call for more bachelor's degree holders in technology and
science
