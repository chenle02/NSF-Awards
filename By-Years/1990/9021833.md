This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Columbia University for the
renovation and repair of the William S. Black Research Building of the College
of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, which after the modernization, will house
structural studies, a multi-disciplinary research and research training program
in molecular biophysics. This building was constructed in 1965 and has not
previously been renovated. The ARFMP grant of $700,000 and $903,000 provided by
the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and
research training facilities. It will make possible new research capabilities
and collaborative interaction not possible under current conditions. This
project will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by
conversion of research and research training space so as to permit consolidation
of related work in structural biology and by upgrading the heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC) so that it is suitable to meet the demands of x-ray
diffraction and of the computer facilities. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct
of research and for the training of quality undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral students and for fostering academic-industrial ties. Students
trained in these laboratories will be able to serve as models for the
feasibility of the training of computer-literate molecular biologists.
