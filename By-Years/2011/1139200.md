The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium
(http://www.math.uga.edu/~dkrashen/gags/)is a yearly gathering in which we will
bring together local algebraic geometers with outside experts to focus on
emerging developments. Half of the talks will be longer, with the first part
dedicated to graduate students. Speakers will include postdocs and finishing
graduate students, and at least half of those funded will be early career
mathematicians. Each conference will feature an open problem session and all
talks will be filmed and made available online. The first conference will take
place May 25-27, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is one of the
most established and active areas of mathematics and has deep connections with
many other subjects. The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium will strengthen
the local community of researchers by publicizing recent advances and
perspectives and promoting collaboration. This funding will enable junior
algebraic geometers to present their work, and interact with the broader
community. Talks aimed at graduate students will make concepts more accessible.
This focus on early career algebraic geometers will enable their training,
enculturation, and future employment.
