Graduate student Donna Ford, working under the supervision of Dr. Peter Raven,
will conduct a taxonomic study of 20 or so species of annual plants of the genus
Calandrinia of the purslane family Portulacaceae in Chile. Data will be obtained
from new field collections made in Chile and from herbarium collections, with
additional greenhouse and laboratory study of morphology, anatomy, chromosome
numbers, pollen, and flavonoids. The distribution of character variation within
and among populations of these plants will be examined, considering the roles of
biogeography, ecology, and reproductive biology. Computer programs for deriving
evolutionary patterns will be used to determine species relationships and to
test hypotheses about modes of speciation and routes of migration. This project
will provide valuable knowledge about the systematics and population biology of
semi-arid zone plants and contribute information useful for the biotic inventory
of South American plant resources.
