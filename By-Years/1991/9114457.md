The construction and operation of new large telescopes both on the ground and in
space requires the measurement of the brightness and colors for a sequence of
faint stars distributed across the sky. In this two-year study the author will
continue previous work extending a list of faint "photometric standards" in both
hemispheres to the magnitude range 10-21. It is expected that this and companion
work will address many needs of astronomy requiring observations of faint stars
and galaxies. In addition, this project will contribute to a database in which
standard photometry conducted with a photomultiplier will be compared with
photometry obtained with "CCDs" (Charge Coupled Devices).
