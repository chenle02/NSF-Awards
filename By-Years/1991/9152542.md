A gradient High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system with a multiple
wavelength detector and a fraction collector will improve the undergraduate
curriculum in chemistry. Instruction of chemistry, biology, and natural science
majors will stress fundamentals of chromatography and the uses of HPLC for
qualitative and quantitative analysis of thermally labile compounds, and for
separation and purification. HPLC methods will be taught in Biochemistry,
Instrumental Analysis, Organic Chemistry, Independent Study (undergraduate
research), and Honors Thesis projects. The grantee will match the NSF award from
non-Federal sources.
