Control of reproductive development in mammals is quite complex. The primary
regulatory level is the hypothalamus in the brain, containing neurons (nerve
cells) that synthesize and release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH
is released in a pulsatile manner to the pituitary gland to activate the
reproductive axis. Before puberty, GnRH release is low, but during puberty and
maturation, increases in pulsatile GnRH release occur, and are much more
dramatic during the night than the day. This project uses a physiological
approach to deliver timed GnRH doses, to determine whether the nocturnal high
release is obligatory for pubertal development, how the brain controls the
timing of the pulsatile release, and the role of age in the pubertal increase in
nocturnal GnRH release. Results will be important in understanding regulation of
the onset of puberty and important for vertebrate reproduction beyond mammals.
The project also has a substantial component of student training in a lab with
an excellent record of mentoring.
