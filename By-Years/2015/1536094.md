The main goal of this one-year project is to enable the participation of eight
students and early-career scientists from the US at the VIIth Coronal Loops
Workshop, which will be held in Cambridge, UK, during July 21-23, 2015. This
workshop is aimed at cultivating a forum for focused discussions on coronal
heating, in general, and the dynamics and heating of coronal loops, in
particular. One very important aspect of this international workshop is to
ensure a significant participation by students and early-career scientists.
Therefore, this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in
discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
