This proposal addresses the synthesis and study of cholic acid-dendrimer
conjugates designed to generate through-membrane pores of tunable dimensions in
phospholipid bilayers. The effect of increasing the number of choloyl units on
sodium and lithium transport and on pore sizes will be studied. Introduction of
proton-ionizable groups is expected to favor formation of pores in negatively
charged liposomes relative to ones bearing a zwitterionic surface. In studies to
be carried out by undergraduate students "en masse," immobilization of a
conjugate formed from cholic acid, a persulfated form of cholic acid, and
putrescine on an ion exchange resin will lead to a "hydrophobic sponge" with
improved molecular absorption properties. With the support of the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Steven L. Regen, of the Department
of Chemistry at Lehigh University, is studying the synthesis and properties of
molecules designed to create perforations in cellular membranes. Formation of
such pores in living cells can be lethal, and biological molecules which cause
pore formation, such as amphotericin, represent effective antibiotics. Professor
Regen's studies of design strategies for effecting pore formation represent
foundational research that will provide the platform for future developments of
new cytotoxic agents. Portions of the research will be carried out by large
teams of undergraduate researchers.
