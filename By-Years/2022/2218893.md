The Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC) provides a locus within the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) for activities
related to atmospheric and climate science and related policy issues. The BASC
provides guidance to federal agencies on a variety of topics, offers a venue for
advancing science and policy related to these topics, oversees development and
oversight of ad hoc NASEM studies on relevant subjects, and conducts outreach,
education, and international engagement activities. The Board provides oversight
to the NASEM Committee to Advise the U.S. Global Change Research Program
(USGCRP) and, more generally, strives to help atmospheric science remain vibrant
and have a broader impact on society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
support for the core functions of the Board for a three-year period. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) provide additional funds toward
BASC's core operations and activities. This base level support is essential for
enabling the BASC to quickly respond to emerging needs from the sponsor
community, draw attention to new issues identified by the scientific community,
and engage broadly in the national and international discourse related to
atmospheric and climate science. In addition it will enable the Board to hold
two "summer study" workshops on topics of emerging interest. The award also
supports the Christine Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Graduate
Fellowship, a 10-12 week educational and training opportunity for early career
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
