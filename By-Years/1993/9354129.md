9354129 Barba City College will undertake a planning process involving a
comprehensive assessment of its institutional needs in science and engineering
education and the needs of the minority students enrolled as majors in these
programs of study. The results of this assessment, along with the examination of
exemplary programs at other institutions, will lead to the development of a
broad- based, long-term plan to guide the College as it builds its capability to
recruit, educate and graduate significantly more minority students in science
and engineering fields. Important partners in the planning process will be
representatives from business and industry, professional organizations,
community colleges and the New York City public schools. Although the
experiences and needs of all minority students will be considered in the
planning process, particular attention will be focused on Hispanic students.
