In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, Hayden and Wells address
basic mathematical and computational problems inherent in determining the
structure of macromolecules from various experimental data, especially nuclear
magnietc resonance spectroscopy. Presently this category of nonlinear
optimization problems is completely solvable only for small molecules. A new
characterization of Euclidean distance matrices has provided new insight into
these problems and provides the foundation for the development of an algorithm
for the embedding problem of computational chemistry. This algorithm, based on
von Neumann's idea of alternating projections, promises a dramatic reduction in
computational time for certain phases of the overall structure determination. In
numerous test cases the time reduction is from exponential order to polynomial
growth of order four.
