GER-9554527 Islam An interdisciplinary research traineeship program is proposed
to educate a new generation of hydrologists. The proposed traineeship program
includes substantial institutional matching and develops a balanced
instructional and research environment to emphasize the interdisciplinary nature
of contemporary hydrologic education. Principal goals of this program are: * To
design an interdisciplinary PhD program that creates a self-sustaining
infrastructure in hydrology education, and continues beyond the duration of the
GRT award. * To create an individualized student curriculum that provides a
formal training in interdisciplinary areas of relevance to the hydrologic
sciences; * To guide students through a significant exploratory research
experience in the hydrologic sciences, emphasizing independent and group study
on emerging hydrologic issues; * To provide opportunities for supervised
teaching experiences that encompass skill development, student contact,
classroom evaluations and interdisciplinary hydrology curriculum development.
Our proposed traineeship program is distinguished by several structural and
academic innovations. Notable among these are: the use of GRT funds to support
an initial 20 month residency period to allow broad academic training and
exploratory research; participation in an integrated teaching experience; the
formation of an interdisciplinary hydrologic sciences program committee
structure that encourages and fosters interactions among diverse groups of
students and faculty; development of an interdisciplinary hydrology curriculum
with a common set of degree requirements; proactive strategies to attract and
retain underrepresented students including formal linkages with two
undergraduate feeder institutions; and use of cost-of-education allowances and
University matching to support mini-sabbatical leaves to national labs, a
hydrologic distinguished lecture series, and participation at national
professional conferences. The impact of this trainee ship will extend far beyond
preparing a new generation of hydrologists over the next five years. Existing
academic linkages will be strengthened and new ones will be formed by the
creation of a self-sustaining graduate program that mirrors the
interdisciplinary nature of contemporary hydrologic issues.
