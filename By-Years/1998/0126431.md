Engineering - Aeronautical/Astronautical (51)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
adapts effective pedogogies for an aerospace structures laboratory previously
developed at several universities. The laboratory consists of a material and
structure testing machine and provides experimental experiences in at least four
courses. It also allows senior capstone design teams to verify the structural
performance of their unmanned aerial vehicles. The Mathematics, Engineering,
Science Achievement (MESA) program at the PI's institution, which focuses on
increasing the number of underrepresented populations in engineering and science
through programs for grades 6-12, plans to use the laboratory in MESA classes
and summer programs. The investigators plan to assess and evaluate the project
results through a variety of measures in conjunction with the University's
Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching. Results will be disseminated
through out reach programs, over the Internet, and at conferences.
