The proposal is directed toward the investigation of a novel and highly
selective membrane for the continuous recovery and purification of valuable
proteins such as beta interferon from complex and dilute mixtures. Use of such a
membrane would represent a substantial improvement in the downstream processing
of proteins produced using cell-culture or fermentation processes.
