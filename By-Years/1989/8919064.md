The overall goal of this research is to understand the structure and function
of plant salt glands. These studies will use transmission electron microscopy,
freeze-fracture electron microscopy, X-ray microprobe studies, and morphometric
procedures, as correlated with physiological experiments to assess the
mechanisms involved in secretion and the structural and organizational features
of the glands apparently requisite for glandular function. Assuming that
membrane transport is the fundamental physiological process underlying salt
secretion, the goal is to characterize, as well as is presently possible, the
pertinent membranes of salt gland cells, particularly as to flux capacities,
selective transport properties, effects of selective inhibitors, and their
macromolecular organization as related to secretion. Since comparative
ultrastructural studies of the different gland types have continued to advance
our insight into the structural and functional relationships basic to the
secretory processes in different types of plant glands, these comparative
studies will be continued. Further, studies will be expanded to examine the
organization of cells, organelles, cell compartments, and membranes in regard to
absorptive processes. The proposed research is designed to clarify the
structural and functional relationships in plant glands relative to the
processes of secretion and absorption and to determine the macromolecular
organization of the cell membranes of plant secretory cells. Salt glands occur
in the leaves of a wide variety of higher plants and are believed to be
important in the regulation of the ionic balance of leaves. The results of this
research will contribute to our understanding of the structure and function of
these important plant organs.
