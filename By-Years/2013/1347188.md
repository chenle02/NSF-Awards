CBET - 1347188 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Bejan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER proposal is
an exploratory approach to applying principles of the Constructal Law to
problems in heat transfer and energy. Using heat network distribution analysis
the proposal will seek to define the allocation of one heat/energy flow system
to another within the same confined space. How power/energy is distributed in an
evolving system is an important question that will be addressed. The PI plans to
develop designs of distributed energy systems to achieve the outlined objectives
of the proposal by demonstrating the proper allocation of the nodes of energy
consumption and area elements on the landscape through consideration of the
heating needs of a population. Such analyses could lead to fundamental answers
of heat/power distribution networks such as when central heating becomes more
competitive than individual heating. Additionally, the merits of other tree-
shaped architectures will be examined. The thermal network analysis will be
first examined in detailed by performing analyses in the steady state.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holistic view of flow architecture based on the
thermal network simulation experiments to be performed in this work for high-
density living is essential for expediting the fuel-efficient design of urban
areas going forward. Importantly, this work will help discover methods in
sustainable design such that the minimal amount of fuel is consumed to meet the
needs of sustaining life and progress of society. Finally, the methods proposed
shall also investigate the construction of a physics framework in which design
of energy flow and water flow are of one design, to meet the challenge of
conserving water resources that are heavily consumed in the energy production
process. Like the energy networks, the work will be a combination of theoretical
guidelines and numerous numerical simulations of competing flow architectures to
look for optimal solutions.
