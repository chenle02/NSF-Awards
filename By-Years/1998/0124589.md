The Mathematical Education of Teachers (MET), published in book form in August,
2001, (and currently available on the CBMS web site www.maa.org/cbms), is the
mathematics community's agenda for improving the mathematical preparation of
future teachers. The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), which
guided the development of this document, is launching MET with a Press
Conference in September, 2001, (funded by the ExxonMobil Foundation) and a
National Summit on the Mathematical Education of Teachers in November, 2001,
both to be held in Washington DC. The Press Conference involves high profile
leaders of the business community, the mathematics community, policy making
organizations, and funding agencies, and focuses upon the policy implications of
this report, positioning it as the mathematics community's plan to improve
teacher education in mathematics. The National Summit engages 250 college and
university mathematics faculty in the hard work of beginning to implement the
vision of the mathematical education of teachers presented in MET. Participants
are being invited in teams from about 75 diverse institutions across the
country. Plenary sessions frame the issues and problems and set them in broader
context. Small group working sessions engage the participants in thinking about
how to address specific challenges in carrying out the recommendations MET
locally.
