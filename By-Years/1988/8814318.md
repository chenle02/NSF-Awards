A two day symposium on Stochastic Structural Dynamics will take place on October
30th to November 1st, 1988, in Urbana, Illinois, where a number of random
phenomena topics will be discussed. Some of the themes to be covered are:
effects of earthquakes, wind gusts and other natural forces (and the elastic,
viscoelastic and plastic responses) on structures such as high-rise buildings,
suspension bridges, power lines, etc.; dynamic structural problems of ocean
constructions such as sea-walls and off-shore platforms; structural responses of
jet and rocket engines to aerodynamic turbulence and noise; response to unsteady
random air and fluid flow in ducks and pipes; and non-linear structural modeling
and damage analysis among others. The results from using a probabilistic
approach to these stochastic processes are very important for understanding the
behavior of complex structure systems subjected to strong natural and manmade
forces.
