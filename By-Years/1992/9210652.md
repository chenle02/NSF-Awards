The research suggests measuring the pressure drop across a oscillating bubble
which is attached to a needle, and which is submerged in an aqueous surfactant
solution. As the surface area of the bubble expands and contracts, surfactant
exchanges with the surface, and this exchange can be measured from the pressure
drop data trace. A theory is outlined to described the oscillating exchange, and
from the measurements the surfactant rate constants can be quantified. Once
obtained, the kinetic parameters can be applied to interpret the effects of
surfactants on many interfacial flows.
