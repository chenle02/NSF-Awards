This award partially supports acquisition of instruments for measuring surface
charge of colloidal particles and electrophontic mobility of colloidal
particles. The instruments will be used in studies of the dielectric properties
of colloidal dispersions, kinetics of floc formation and breakage, and rheology
of concentrated dispersions. Better control and characterization of particles
should lead to improved processing capabilities of fluids having complex
microstructure.
