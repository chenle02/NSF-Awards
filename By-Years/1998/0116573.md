EIA-0116573&lt;br/&gt;Alexander A. Sawchuk&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Acquisition of Equipment for Remote
Multichannel Media Immersion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for
equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to
support research and student training in immersive technology. Immersive
technology is the creation of the aural and visual ambience of a virtual space
in which individuals can experience remote events or communicate naturally with
others located remotely. &lt;br/&gt;
