The central theme of this mathematical science research project group is
approximation theory. Problems will be selected from areas such as differential
equations, interpolation of operators, orthogonal polynomials and special
functions. General areas of research include potential theoretic methods in
approximation theory which has already provided the necessary tools for the
resolution of two major conjectures in approximation theory. A second project
concerns multivariate special functions including the evaluation of multivariate
beta and q-beta type integrals and finding constant terms in Macdonald type
identities. Asymptotic expansions, integral representations and generating
functions of multivariate analogs of the classical orthogonal polynomials will
be studied. Other work will focus on the behavior of best and near best
approximants on compact plane sets. Specifically, efforts will be made to
understand the sets where nearest point polynomials actually achieve the minimal
distance (in the uniform norm.) Orthogonal polynomials play a key role in the
spectral theory of second order difference and differential equations. This
research will investigate the general fourth order equations. Explicit solutions
and the computation of the spectral measure will be primary goals. A related
line of investigation will consider the nature of roots of polynomials
orthogonal with respect to absolutely continuous measures in cases where
Markov's theorem does not apply.
