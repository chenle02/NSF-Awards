This GOALI proposal has the purpose of establishing a technical exchange between
the Aerospace Engineering department at Iowa State University (ISU) and General
Electric-Global Research Center (GRC) in Niskayana, NY. Engineers at GRC will
visit ISU to give lectures to undergraduates and to establish research
collaborations. GRC participants will provide first hand insights into
engineering in a major aerospace company to undergraduates. Several applications
of concern to GRC demand improvements in their ability to predict turbulent
transport and in their ability to predict transition between laminar and
turbulent states of fluid flow. ISU faculty have expertise in these areas. The
practical applications will stimulate basic research at ISU and be the avenue to
transfer basic research into industrial practice.

Intellectual Merit:

The last decade has seem significant progress in the theory of boundary layer
transition induced by incident disturbances wakes or free-stream turbulence.
Direct numerical simulations have produced substantial insight into mechanisms,
and has created data that would be difficult to produce in a laboratory.
However, practical modeling is at an early stage. The time is ripe for an
industry/academia collaboration to bring basic developments to bear on practice.
By contrast, closure modeling for turbulent transport is well established. Its
limitations are well known; but it remains the primary tool for practical flow
prediction in the foreseeable future. Advanced propulsion concepts and energy
technologies that involve fluid flow are increasingly explored by computer
simulations that require analytical closure models. The PIs in this program have
mutual interest in improving models and adapting them to these needs. This GOALI
proposal promises to tackle these challenges through academics and R & D
engineers joining forces.

Broader impacts:

It is inherent in the formulation of this program that it will have an impact on
education and will foster collaboration that would not otherwise take place. The
Aero department at Iowa State strongly encourages undergraduate participation in
research. Each year there is a Spring forum at which students present talks on
their work. This GOALI program will provide students with extended access to GE
engineers. Students will be encouraged to pursue careers in engineering; GE may
recruit top ISU students.Engineers from GE-GRC will visit ISU to foster
collaboration that can continue beyond the framework of GOALI. This long term
relation will have a lasting. All research that occurs specifically under the
aegis of NSF will be disseminated by archival publication, conference
presentations, etc. It is inherent in a university industry collaboration that
proprietary information will be protected against disclosure. However, the
primary work done under this project will be free of proprietary restrictions.
