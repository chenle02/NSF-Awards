This case study seeks to understand how teachers are themselves changed as they
take on the role of researcher in their secondary mathematics classrooms. Using
collaborative instructional strategies, technology, and journal writing, these
teachers initiate changes in classroom practice for their students consistent
with the goals of the Standards. By researching student learning within their
classrooms, these teacher/researchers create environments for their own learning
as well. This interactive process, framed by the immediate experience of
classrooms, changes teacher beliefs and therefore teacher goals about the
teaching and learning of mathematics. This process leads to a reflective
orientation that sustains continued professional growth and change.
