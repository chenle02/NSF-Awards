The Cornell Topology Festival is held each May at Cornell University in Ithaca,
New York. This grant will support participants in the 54th, 55th, and 56th such
festivals. The 54th will be held May 11-13, 2018. This conference gives an
opportunity for researchers in topology to find out about the latest
developments in the field and connect with potential collaborators. It is the
only topology conference of its length and breadth held regularly in the
Northeastern United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is an extremely broad
field, and so a key aspect of the Festival is the annual choice of an "area of
emphasis": some narrower subdiscipline or application of topology. Around one
third of the speakers are chosen to represent the area of emphasis and among
these two are chosen to give introductory talks about the area, in order that
regular attendees might learn about the area in greater depth than they might
only from research presentations. Recent areas of emphasis were "Groups Acting
on Hyperbolic Spaces" (2015), "Topological Combinatorics" (2016), and "Topology
and Physics" (2017). The area of emphasis for the 54th Cornell Topology Festival
is "Representation Theory and Topology". More details about the upcoming and
previous festivals can be found at the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
