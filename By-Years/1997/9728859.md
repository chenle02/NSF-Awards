9728859 Scott The general topic of this symposium, defects in crystals, is
comprised of the subtopics: dislocations and grain boundaries, evaporation and
condensation in solids, and the kinetics of phase transformations in the solid
state. These emphasis areas are particularly timely and consistent with the many
contributions of Professor John Hirth, who is honored in this symposium. The
symposium is designed as a forum for the discussion of new developments in
theory and applications involving defects in crystalline solids, and the
exchange of ideas and a discussion of new directions for research on this topic.
The support is for travel grants to student co-authors and assists in travel
costs for foreign speakers. %%% The properties of materials depend in part on
the type and distribution of defects that have been incorporated into structure
during processing. This symposium explores this subject with an emphasis on
theory and modeling. ***
