The project will develop a climatology of reactive nitrogen compounds in the
lower free troposphere at the Pico Observatory in the Azores. The study is
designed to address the need for measurement-based constraints on levels of
nitrogen oxides in the remote free troposphere by providing approximately two
years of nearly continuous measurements at 2200 m altitude over the North
Atlantic Ocean. The data will be used to improve understanding of reactive
nitrogen chemistry over the ocean environment, for comparison with models, and
to look at the transport of continental emissions over the Atlantic Ocean.
