9632273 The Far West Lab for Education Research and Development, a non-profit
organization located in California, will complete and pilot an assessment
instrument that is appropriate for use in standards-based instruction in
science. The project will involve a minimum of 5 educational systemic
initiatives (SI) in 7 states. The project will accomplish 5 tasks: 1. Identify
and convene teams of teachers to develop appropriate items for standards-based
science assessment instruments for Grades 5, 8, and 10. The items will include
enhanced, open-ended, and justified multiple-choice items, and performance
tasks; they will be evaluated for cultural and gender bias, and offered in
English and Spanish. 2. Pilot-test, field-test, and administer the instrument.
3. Score and report the results of the assessment on SI and non-SI students.
Data will be disaggregated by ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status.
Reporting will include comparisons such as: SI vs. non-SI; intra-program (USI
vs. USI); and cross-program (USI vs. SSI). 4. Guide professional development for
the teachers who will be administering the assessment instrument. 5. Disseminate
the items to other SIs in other states, cities, and regions. ***
