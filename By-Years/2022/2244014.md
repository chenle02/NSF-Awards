This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Virginia Tech
University, located in Blacksburg, VA, supports the training of 10 students for
10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2025. In this program, funded by the
Division of Chemistry, participants pursue collaborative research projects with
an emphasis on energy and the environment but also participate in integrated
educational programming in scientific communication, leadership, and cultural
competence. Administered by the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Tech, the
summer REU site, Students Transforming Energy and Environmental Research
(STEER), brings selected undergraduate students together with faculty and
graduate student mentors to specifically engage in research projects that
address the societal challenges and objectives associated with global warming
and climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will conduct research with
diverse investigators who are at the forefront of their fields, which include
batteries, solar fuels, water purification, mineral sequestration, catalysis,
and sustainability. They will learn and perform chemical synthesis techniques to
prepare novel materials of particular value in those fields, along with the
means of characterizing the materials and evaluating their suitability for the
intended application. We will leverage University partners and experts in
scientific communication, leadership, DEIR (diversity, equity, inclusion, and
respect), career development training, grantsmanship, and community outreach for
the REU studentsâ€™ development as chemical science professionals. STEER's primary
objective is to produce community-minded scientists to lead innovation through
strong disciplinary knowledge while demonstrating respect for the diverse lived
experiences within our society and a commitment to educational outreach to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
