PIs will reconstruct the history of changes in the intensity of equatorward
winds over NE Pacific since the last climatic optimum 9 K.y. ago. These data
will serve to test the general circulation models of the past climate that
suggests that upwelling-favorable winds have weakened since the last climatic
optimum due to decline in the summer insolation over northern Hemisphere.
Dissolved cadmium concentrations in foraminiferal shells will be used as proxy
for upwelling in core from estuaries in Humboldt and Coos Bays, NW United
States.
