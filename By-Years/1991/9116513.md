The field of uncertainty modeling and analysis is currently in the definitive
state of intense research activity in almost all disciplines of engineering.
Probabilistic methods, Bayesian approached, theory of evidence, statistical
techniques as well as fuzzy logic and reasoning are currently being used by
researchers to deal with uncertainty. Some of these methods are used by almost
all sectors of the U.S. research community, whereas other new methods continue
to be mostly used by U.S. researchers in academic institutions. On the other
hand, in other countries, especially Japan, researchers and engineers are
currently using all these methods more effectively in many engineering
applications. The International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis
will provide the opportunity and need stimuulus for U.S. researchers and
engineers to interact with researchers and engineers from other countries.
