9311388 Schwaber This is a proposal to study the role of nucleus tractus
solitarii (NTS) neurons in the transformation and integration of baroreceptor
input as part of the system that controls blood pressure. The project is very
important because it provides a first step towards understanding the neural
basis of blood pressure control. The work is motivated by the striking
observation that single baroreceptive NTS neurons do not reproduce their
baroreceptor input pattern, and appear to have nonlinear responses to changes in
arterial pressure. These findings suggest that NTS neuron responses are produced
by active membrane responses to baroreceptor inputs. The plan of work follows a
logical progression: in vivo recording of synaptic inputs and postsynaptic
responses of NTS neurons, followed by construction of neuronal and network
models of NTS neurons to test whether the experimental data can account for the
neurons' responses. These computational models will be implemented on a parallel
computing platform.***
