The project will conduct research in the field of polymer processing,
composites and rheology, specifically modeling and simulating processes such as
injection, compression and resin transfer molding. The outcome of this research
will aid the designer in controlling material properties and part quality
through innovative modeling, analysis and process simulation. Research will be
done on the thermomechanical behavior of composites. A major problem that arises
when designing plastic parts, especially those made of fiber reinforced
composites, is the change of the part's shape and dimensions due to shrinkage
and warpage. A thermomechanical simulation of the molding process of fiber
reinforced composites will result from this research. Another study will
determine the inertial effects during flow of low viscosity polymers. This is
especially interesting for the reaction injection molding (RIM) process where
cycle times of only fractions of a second are sought. It is not possible to
predict flow patterns and orientations for this mold filling process using
current simulations, since they are all based on the assumption of negligible
inertia terms. The project will also develop a simulation of the thermoforming
process of sheet materials, specifically, fiber matt preforms used in the resin
transfer molding process and wood flour filled polypropylene sheets used for
interior body panels. It is important to know the filler orientation after
forming and to detect the formation of folds or rips in the sheet which would
make it unacceptable for use. Understanding the thermomechanical behavior of
plastics and being able to predict filling patterns, filler orientation,
shrinkage, warpage and surface waviness before a part is actually molded leads
to higher part quality and eliminates some of the expensive and time consuming
tasks done in the early stages of part and mold design.
