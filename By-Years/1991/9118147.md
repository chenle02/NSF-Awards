The principal investigator will investigate the interaction of grain boundary
fluids and fluid inclusions during the progressive deformation of quartz-
dominated rocks and veins from the Simplon fault zone of Switzerland and Italy.
The goal of the study is to determine to what degree deformation affects the
chemical composi- tions of fluid inclusions. These data are critical for
meaningful interpretations of fluid inclusion data from deformed rocks.
