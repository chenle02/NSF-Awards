This award will support a combined airborne radar and aeromagnetic survey of two
220 x 330 km regions between the Transantarctica Mountains and Marie Byrd Land
during the 1990-91 and 1991-92 field seasons. These efforts will address
significant problems identified in the Ross Transect Zone (RTZ) by the National
Academy of Sciences (1986) report "Antarctic Solid Earth Sciences Research," and
by the report to NSF "A Plan for a United States Program to Study the Structure
and Evolution of the Antarctic Lithosphere (SEAL)." The surveys will be flown
using the NSF/TUD radar and an areomagnetics system mounted in a light aircraft.
The grid spacing will be 5 km and navigation will be by radiopositioning. In
addition to maps of subglacial topography and magnetic intensity, attempts will
be made to reconstruct the position of subglacial diffractors in three
dimensions. This reconstruction should give new information about the
distribution of escarpments and therefore the tectonic relationships within the
region, especially when combined with the magnetic results. These experiments
will be conducted by the Byrd Polar Research Center of the Ohio State University
and the Water Resources and Geological Divisions of the U.S. Geological Survey.
