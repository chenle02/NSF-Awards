&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed project is to extend the science and reading
comprehension intervention known as Science IDEAS to larger scales. The
intervention combines science inquiry with reading comprehension and writing
activities in two-hour daily time blocks in grades 3 through 8. The proposed
project would expand the program to almost 40,000 students and would study the
implementation and its effects. To help to insure its effectiveness, the project
also provides the necessary infrastructure of leadership training, mentorship,
and coaching. The proposal thereby addresses capacity issues in schools as
mitigating the success of interventions and perpetuating deficiencies in
students' science and reading achievement. A twofold research design is
proposed, involving a school-level randomized experiment and a multiple baseline
study of intervention efficacy in terms of maintaining previously attained
student performance outcomes of the intervention during its scale up.
Investigators anticipate advancing the process of educational reform through
this research by validating and disseminating a multi-phase design for scale up.
