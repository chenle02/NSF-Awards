The Anchorage Museum Association, in collaboration and partnership with the
Yup'ik Calista Elders Council, will work in one year to plan exhibits,
educational programs and a web site for a traveling exhibition of 19th century
Yup'ik technology. The exhibit will combine masterworks from the Berlin
Ethnographic Museum with Yup'ik technology from the Smithsonian Institution and
present them in ways that will allow Native and non-Native visitors to gain new
under-standings of Yup'ik technology from the Yup'ik point of view. The planning
process will bring together with Yup'ik elders, scientists and museum
professionals for a series of planning meetings, demonstrations of Yup'ik
technology and workshops on raw materials and traditional manufacturing
techniques, culminating in a exhibit development workshop integrating front-end
evaluation, learning goals and design parameters, and formative evaluation
planning.
