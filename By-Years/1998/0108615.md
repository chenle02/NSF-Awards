DEB-0108615 Plante Bacteria serve dual roles in sedimentary systems: as
decomposers of organic detritus and as food for higher organisms. Key ecological
parameters such as abundance, production, and community composition each
contribute to the character of these roles. The primary objectives of the
research proposed here are to determine the mechanisms by which bacterial
assemblages recover from ingestion by sediment-feeding invertebrates (deposit
feeders), and to assess the importance of this biological disturbance to the
structure of sedimentary bacterial communities. We will determine the
significance of nonequilibrium factors in creating spatio-temporal heterogeneity
and maintaining diversity in microbial communities exposed to deposit feeding in
particular, and disturbances in general. We hope to reveal those important
variables required to construct and test patch dynamics models, thereby
providing a basis for predictions regarding the community structure and
metabolic activities of indigenous and introduced bacteria in sediments.
