This research addresses the problem of retargeting tools used to translate,
analyze, instrument, improve, and migrate programs. Such tools include not only
compilers, but also assemblers, linkers, debuggers, binary-code modifiers, and
binary translators. The primary retargeting technique being applied is the
generation of machine-dependent components from compact, reusable descriptions
of machine properties. The research objectives are to describe machine
properties clearly and concisely, to represent instruction semantics in a way
that supports retargeting, to reuse specifications to retarget a variety of
tools, and to reuse analyses of specifications to derive components for multiple
machines. Instruction semantics are specified in three layers. Descriptions of
whole instruction sets will be written using the metalanguage layer. These
descriptions will be mechanically transformed into the register-transfer layer,
which defines each instruction's semantics in a form that is easy to analyze.
The interpretation layer will provide semantic interpretations of register
transfers; different interpretations support different analyses and component
generators. The major payoff of this research is in developing new capabilities
in machine specification; it should deepen our understanding of properties of
machines, foster innovation in machine-level tools, and help others save effort,
cost, and time in developing tools of scientific and practical value.
