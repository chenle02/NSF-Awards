9725335 Grand This research is a continuation of efforts to map the three
dimensional shear wave structure of the earth's mantle and produce a better
seismic model for the outer core. Previously, the travel times of S, ScS, SKS,
SKKS and multiple bounce S phases have been measured and inverted to obtain a
3-D model of mantle structure beneath. Long linear fast seismic anomalies
interpreted to be slabs sinking to mid-mantle depths were discovered beneath the
Americas. This work will extend the detailed analysis to Asian subduction zones.
The core-mantle boundary layer D" will also be investigated and mapped relative
to slow velocity features in the lower mantle, which may indicate the upwelling
part of mantle circulation. Better analysis of the D" variations will enable the
improvement of investigations of anisotropy and heterogeneity of the inner core.
