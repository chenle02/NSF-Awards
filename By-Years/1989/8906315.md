This Engineering Research Equipment Grant is for the purchase of a network
analyzer system (Hewlett Packard 8510B) to support current research by the
Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Mississippi on three
specific projects, and it will be used by all the staff to broaden the scope and
quality of their research activities. The requirement for the proposed network
analyzer system, which has already become an industry standard, has been
necessitated by the need to improve measurement accuracy required for
verification through measurements related current research on analytic and
numerical solution of EM boundary-value problems, because existing equipment is
obsolete. The equipment will facilitate research in the specific areas of 1)
cavity method for measurement of material properties - an investigation to
improve accuracy and error estimates in measurements of dielectric constant and
surface conductivity, 2) antennas embedded in lossy media - an experimental
study of wires inclined to an air-lossy media interface to verify a well-known
numerical analysis program, and 3) dielectric radiating elements - an
investigation of non-metallic radiating elements for microwave and millimeter
wave applications. Auxiliary uses for related network analyzer measurements are
in the areas of new antenna feeding techniques, phased arrays, and cavity
measurements using the resonance method for dielectric in rectangular waveguide.
