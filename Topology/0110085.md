DMS-0110085 Gordana Matic

This award provides partial support for participants to attend the 2001 Georgia
International Topology Conference to be held at the University of Georgia, May
21 through June 2, 2001. Since 1961 the University of Georgia has organized and
hosted a major international topology conference every 8 years. The 1961, 1969,
1977, 1985, and 1993 conferences came at times when fundamental new ideas were
surfacing to set the direction of topology for the next few years. The theme of
this year's conference is primarily on geometric topology with special emphasis
on contact and symplectic topology and related geometries. Further information,
including invited speakers, schedule of talks, housing and travel information
and application is available at http://www.math.uga.edu/~topology/.
