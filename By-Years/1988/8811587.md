The goal of this research is to develop a mathematical model which describes
the physical properties occurring in magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) rocket engines.
The validity of the model will be tested by comparing its predictions to
experimental results and its use in predicting new characteristics of MPD
engines. The research is divided into three areas: analysis,
numerical/experiment, and prediction. In the analysis phase, fluid,
dissociation, electromagnetic, and state equations will be used to determine the
behavior of MPD engines. Dimensional analysis permits the determination of
combination of important parameters. The second phase of the research is the
numerical solution of the equations of motion. Experimental test results will be
duplicated by computer to verify the validity of the model. The final phase
involves the prediction of performance of MPD engines under conditions which
have never before been tested. Using the model to predict in advance the
performance of a new MPD engine is efficient and could result in considerable
savings in cost of design.
