Research is conducted on the aging of liquid foam by interbubble gas diffusion.
This spontaneous phenomenon not only changes the bubble sizes and reduces the
available surface, but, with sufficient time, leads to a reduction in the number
of bubbles present and hence to ultimate coalescence of the foam. The
experimental method employs two novel techniques. The first involves the very
slow rotation of the foam about a horizontal axis. The second technique stops
further aging by means of the very rapid hardening of the foam with nongas-
producing polymerization and/or cross linkage. The foam will be generated by
bubbling presaturated nitrogen through an appropriate liquid mixture. After the
resulting foam is aged and hardened, its volumetric gas fraction, and bubble
size and shape distributions will be measured photomicrographically at sampling
planes within the foam that will be cut and polished for the purpose.
