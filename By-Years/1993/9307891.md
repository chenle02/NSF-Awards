The workshop is intended to establish the goals and scope of the new National
Science Foundation-Division of Design and Manufacturing (DDM) initiative in
Integration Engineering. The broad agenda is aimed at supporting the DDM
community in new ways that respond to the new mood in the country. As an
extension of the DDM Advisory Committee work of April 1992, Integration
Engineering will be the vehicle for projects that not only address basic
engineering-science, but also address issues such as: time-to-market, networked
manufacturing, TQM, conservation, socio- technical needs and human resource
development. Participants representing leaders from the engineering and business
fields in academia, industry and government will be invited. The following
highlights will be covered: (1) four keynote papers on the needs for an expanded
DDM program in Integration Engineering that can address major contributions to
national competitiveness; (2) discussion groups on selected topics such as
Design, Planning, and Sensor-Based Manufacturing; (3) group reports on the scope
of new programs in Integration Engineering, with recommendations on the kinds of
projects and initiatives that will make major differences; and (4) a summary
volume, prepared subsequent to the meeting on the way in which existing DDM
projects can be dove-tailed into the new initiative and how DDM can be
responsive to the need for establishing projects that are both scientifically
based and yet have impact on national competitiveness.
