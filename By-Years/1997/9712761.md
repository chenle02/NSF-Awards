9712761 Pantelides This project conducts full-scale lateral load field tests of
reinforced concrete bridge bents to demonstrate the ability of carbon fiber
composite materials to increase structural integrity and improve resistance to
cyclic, lateral loading. The tests target specifically the improvement of the
shear capacity of the cap beam-column joints. The test results will be used to
calibrate analytical models and suggest procedures for design of cap beam-column
joints with carbon fiber composites. ***
