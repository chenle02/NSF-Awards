Number theory studies the properties of prime numbers and has important
applications in physics, computer science, cyber security, and other areas.
There are important classes of numbers extending the usual integers and
corresponding classes of functions known as modular forms. The goal of this
project is to extend known results about classical modular forms over the usual
integers to more general settings. It is expected that different phenomena will
appear in this context, which will yield new and interesting applications to
number theory and beyond.

The project will develop explicit methods and results in relation to the
arithmetic of Bianchi modular forms, elliptic Dedekind sums, and L-functions
over imaginary quadratic fields. Building upon previous work, the PI will
continue the study of this circle of ideas and explore their connections to open
problems and conjectures, namely (1) a generalization of Sczech’s Eisenstein
cocycles over imaginary quadratic fields with applications to p-adic
L-functions, (2) elliptic Dedekind sums attached to discrete subgroups of
SL(2,C) and arithmetic applications such as to conjectures of Sharifi, and (3)
Bianchi period polynomials associated to binary Hermitian forms, with
applications to special values of L-functions. The broader impacts of this
project are through the research training and mentorship of undergraduate
students in a Primarily Undergraduate Institution — many of whom being first-
generation students and members of under-represented minorities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
