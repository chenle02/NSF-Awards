Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving
physicists from Catholic University and Erciyes University in Kayseri, Turkey
will investigate the global properties of a number of equations of state for
binary mixtures. Project funding will enable Dr. Mustafa Keskin of Erciyes
University to spend two months in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Meijer at Catholic
University. Additionally, Dr. Meijer will travel to Kayseri and spend three
weeks in Dr. Keskin's laboratory. This cooperative research project will
elucidate global features of binary fluid critical phase line behavior in
relation to classes of equations of state and parameter ranges. This project is
useful from the standpoint of providing an overall perspective on phase behavior
and strategies for representing or interpreting it in terms of categories of
equations of state. This project in thermophysical properties fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
