9352234 Cunningham Project SummaryThis project will revitalize and improve an
introductory digital laboratory. Specifically the project has three main
purposes: (i) introducing symbolic computation to freshmen, (ii) introducing
field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to sophomores, and (iii) connecting entry
level students using personal computers (PC) to workstations using X-Windows. It
will change the course content in all of our freshman, sophomore, and junior
electrical engineering classes. Teaching freshmen Maple (symbolic computation)
and MATLAB (high level numerical computation) will make them more effective in
all of their mathematics, science, and engineering classes. Using FPGAs with the
proper software will allow sophomore digital electronics students to solve real
world problems within the time constraints of a weekly laboratory session.
Running X- Windows with Microsoft Windows on PCs will give beginning students
access to a variety of easy-to-use graphics based tools on the PCs, the
Electrical Engineering Department SUNs, and the Tech Computer Center
workstations. This will provide workstation tools to a wide audience, in a
friendly atmosphere, at a low cost per user. ***
