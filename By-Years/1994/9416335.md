9416335 Toro This research is to produce local site earthquake response maps in
the Los Angeles metropolitan area for use in microzonation, by combining
geological and geotechnical information with local strong-motion data from the
Northridge, Whittier and other earthquakes. Two different formulations of the
empirical Bayes updating will be developed, tested, and applied. The empirical
formulation estimates a site term at each recording site by comparing observed
and predicted peak amplitudes; this formulation is applied separately to each
frequency or frequency band. The physical formulation uses the comparison
between observed and predicted peak amplitudes to extract information about the
likely values of physical site characteristics, i.e. velocity profile, modulus
and damping-degradation curves; this operation is applied simultaneously at
several frequencies or frequency bands. Updated estimates of site amplification
are then generated. This project is a contribution to the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency
Appropriation. ***
