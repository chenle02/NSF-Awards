ABSTRACT Washington University CTS-9411556 P. I.: John Kardos This Equipment
Grant will support the acquisition of a mechanical spectrometer which is to be
used for taking data critical to a number of research projects. Typical of the
materials to be investigated are: materials exhibiting complex reheolgical
behavior, including polyimide- and epoxy-based composites, highly entangled
polymers that exhibit processing instabilities, coacervates and slurries
containing needle and platelet particles. The use of the spectrometer will also
be integrated into advanced polymer and composite processing and rheology
courses.
