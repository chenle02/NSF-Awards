The main objectives of the project are to undertake additional extensions and
refinements of the semi-nonparametric (SNP) approach to modeling multiple time
series. The SNP approach is based on a Hermite series expansion of the
conditional density of a strictly stationary multivariate process. The leading
term is either a linear vector autoregressive model or an autoregressive
conditional heteroskedastic model, with the choice depending upon the
application. Higher order terms accommodate deviations from the leading term,
including, for example, non-normalities or nonlinearities. The work is in two
parts: a methodological section and an empirical section. The methodological
work entails developing new ways to use the SNP approach for nonparametric
structural estimation and to ascertain the dynamics embodied in an SNP estimate
of the conditional density. The empirical work involves applications of SNP
methods to issues in asset pricing and financial volatility. The main research
tools for the empirical work are nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation and
Monte Carlo simulation. The work will have an impact in several areas:
documenting interesting regularities in financial time series data, forecasting
turning points in economic data, and allowing estimation of what would
previously be considered intractable models. Dissemination of the computer code
developed by the project will be an important addition to the econometrics
infrastructure.
