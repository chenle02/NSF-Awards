Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9803606 Principal Investigator: Georgios Daskalopoulos

The principal investigator's main topic of interest is the application of
analytic methods to topological and geometric problems. More precisely, in the
first part of the proposal the principal investigator, motivated by the
existence of representations of fundamental groups of knot complements, suggests
a connection between Yang-Mills theory on Riemann surfaces and Teichmueller
theory. In the second part, the principal investigator proposes to study certain
compactifications of character varieties of fundamental groups of surfaces and
three dimensional manifolds. The investigator relates this to actions of groups
on trees and incompressible surfaces on three dimensional manifolds. In the rest
of the proposal, the principal investigator suggests certain questions about the
metric of the monopole moduli space which appear in physics.

The main motivation of this work is to understand questions about the topology
of three dimensional manifolds by studying representations of their fundamental
groups. The results in this project will advance our knowledge in questions
relating gauge theory on Riemann surfaces, harmonic maps, Teichmueller theory
and three dimensional manifold topology. In addition, work in this subject will
facilitate further connections between certain aspects of mathematics and
physics.
