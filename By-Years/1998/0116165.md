Abstract. NSF 0116165

Acquisition of a Core Automated DNA Sequencing Facility

A grant has been awarded to Dr. Peter F. Straub, Dr. Brian J. Rogerson and Dr.
Karen P. York of the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey to setup a DNA
Sequencing Facility. The new Core Genetic Analysis Facility, once established,
will enable automated DNA sequencing, DNA fragment analysis and integrated
computer analysis of genetic data. This facility will be used to support student
undergraduate research, faculty research and to enhance teaching in the
Molecular and Genetic Biosciences at Stockton College. The main instrument
acquired by the grant is an automated DNA Sequencer. Other instruments useful in
running the sequencing reactions, specialized software packages, and supplies
have been funded to add more research capabilities to the facility. To involve
large numbers of students and faculty, two collaborative demonstration projects
will be supported during the first three years of the grant. The first project
will use sequencing and DNA fragment analysis to fingerprint and identify
bacteria in subsurface aquifers. The results will provide information helpful to
the study of large-scale geothermal energy use (such as at Stockton College).
The second project will generate short DNA sequences from libraries of winter
flounder genes in support of fisheries research. Both of these projects invite
multi-user large-scale collaboration among students and faculty and will produce
knowledge that is immediately useful to the scientific community. This project
has the potential to transform the way that teaching and research are performed
at a primarily undergraduate college like Richard Stockton College of NJ. The
grant supports a facility that focuses on collaborative student-faculty research
in Genetics. These opportunities are important for training undergraduate
research students since Medicine, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology have been
among the most important sectors of the economy whose growth has been directly
influence by the revolutionary advancement in biological technologies (like DNA
sequencing) over the past twenty years.
