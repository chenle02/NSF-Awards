Geometric spaces arise in computer science through a number of avenues. The most
obvious of these occurs when the input data for a problem possesses an inherent
metric structure, like the hop-distance between nodes in a network, or the
similarity distance between pairs of genomic sequences. But there are other,
more subtle examples, like the geometry of sparse vectors, which arises
prominently in coding theory, signal recovery, and quantum information, or the
effective resistance distance between nodes in an electrical network, which has
proven to be a powerful algorithmic tool in attacking both algebraic and
combinatorial problems.

Perhaps most strikingly, in the setting of combinatorial optimization, high-
dimensional geometry often presents itself in an unexpected and profound manner.
A basic example is the use of convex optimization in the solution---exact or
approximate---to a variety of combinatorial problems. In many cases, a problem
with an a priori purely combinatorial structure is shown to involve rich
geometric phenomenon. Furthermore, we now realize that often this structure is
inherent and fundamental, in the sense that any solution to the problem must
confront its geometric core.

The PI will seek to understand these connections and develop new algorithmic
techniques to exploit them. This work will employ techniques from high-
dimensional geometry and probability, functional analysis, spectral geometry,
and combinatorics to attack problems at the forefront of computer science. This
includes addressing fundamental gaps in our understanding of theoretical issues,
as well as developing solutions to practical problems that arise from the need
to analyze and manipulate massive data sets. To achieve these goals, the
investigator intends to address central, important open problems in the fields
of approximation algorithms, high-dimensional information theory, and discrete
asymptotic convex geometry.
