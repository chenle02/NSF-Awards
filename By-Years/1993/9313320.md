Whittaker 9313320 The award is for establishing a comprehensive research program
in chemical analysis and chemical modeling of plasma etching reactors for
semiconductor circuit manufacturing. The chemical analysis and modeling will be
performed using chemically selective diagnostic data obtained by a very
sensitive implementation of an infra-red diode laser absorption spectroscopy.
The modeling will have the goal of establishing a new and predictive level of
understanding of the plasma etch chemistry. The work is expected to have a
direct impact on semiconductor electronics and manufacturing technology. The
availability of the diagnostic data will help in the formulation of predictive
models needed for improved etch process design and control, especially in the
processing of submicron features.
