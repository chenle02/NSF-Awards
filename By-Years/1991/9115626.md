This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Paul F. Lurquin of
Washington State University and Drs. Filippone and Penza of the University of
Naples, Italy. The objective of the project is to optimize gene transfer
frequencies in a variety of leguminous plants and to explore techniques for the
production of stably and homogeneously transformed plants from chimeric ones.
Leguminous plants are notoriously refractory to genetic engineering. Failure to
produce transgenic legumes is generally attributed to the fact that fertile
plants cannot be regenerated from transformed callus cells growing in vitro. The
investigators have developed a transformation procedure that does not require a
tissue culture step and allows recovery of large proportions of plantlets
chimeric for a transgene. This procedure hinges on the cocultivation of isolated
mature embryos with Agrobacterium tumefaciens followed by plantlet development
on nonselective medium. Specific staining indicated that large number of such
plantlets contain a variety of tissues expressing the transgene. The two
laboratories are essentially complementary, the Italian laboratory having a
strong plant tissue culture and cytogenetic component, while the US laboratory
is well versed in molecular and microbial techniques. Three graduate students
are currently working on the project at Washington State University. The results
of this collaboration will eventually improve the quality of pea, lentil, and
chickpea plants grown in the US; the technology will be transferred to
developing countries where cowpea and chickpea are grown on a large scale (the
Middle East and Africa), thanks to the close links that exist between the
Italian laboratory and IITA and ICARDA. //
