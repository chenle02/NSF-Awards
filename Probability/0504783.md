Fractional Brownian motion is neither Markov process nor semimartingale. Thus it
can be and has recently been applied to describe phenomena that cannot be
described by these two major stochastic processes. To enlarge the scope of
application one needs to study the nonlinear functionals of fractional Brownian
motion. An important and natural class of such functionals are those given by
stochastic differential equations. In addition to studying self-intersection
local time, the principal investigator proposes to study general stochastic
differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion. The difficulty in
such study is caused by the fact that the powerful Picard's iteration approach
fails to work. The principal investigator proposes to combine fractional
calculus, anticipative stochastic calculus, and the characteristic theory to
investigate such equations.

To describe natural or social phenomena mathematically, people usually use
Markov property (the future depends only on today although the whole history
until today is known). This is a reasonable simplification, particularly if one
considers the sophistication needed to deal with the entire past. However, it
becomes more and more demanding to assimilate all the information available to
better predict the future. Fractional Brownian motion is among the simplest
statistical model that captures this long memory character. It has found many
applications. To more adequately fit mathematical models to the phenomena under
consideration, one should use fractional Brownian motion as building blocks to
obtain more sophisticated random quantities. The principal investigator has
focused on this statistical model for a number of years and has achieved
significant success. This research will considerably further this progress and
is expected to have impact on many other fields. Immediate applications are to
be found in finance and bio-informatics.
