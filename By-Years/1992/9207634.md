Professor Caldwell will continue her studies of atomic structure and dynamics
of ionization using synchrotron radiation as the optical source. She will study
two new aspects of the dynamics of energy flow inside atoms: inner-shell
ionization of open-shell atoms, and electron-electron correlations by means of
photoionization coincidence methods. The correlation work is important in
answering one of the most important questions in atomic structure: how does the
motion of three charged particles correlate as they recede from each other after
absorption of ionizing radiation?
