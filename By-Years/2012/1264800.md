The map coloring problem is considered one of the major catalysts of the
tremendous development of graph theory in its almost 300-year history. It is,
thus, not surprising that graph coloring and its related problems have always
been in the main line of graph theory research. It was observed by Tutte that
the problem of the face-coloring of an embedded (planar) graph can be formulated
in terms of integer flows of the graph. Since then the topic of integer flows
has been one of the most attractive in graph theory. Grotzsch proved that every
triangle free, loopless planar graph is 3-vertex-colorable. By flow/coloring
duality, this is equivalent to the statement that every 4-edge-connected planar
graph has a nowhere-zero 3-flow. The 3-flow Conjecture (by Tutte) asserts that
this is still true without the assumption of planarity. Collaborating with his
colleagues, the PI successfully proved that every 6-edge-connected graph admits
nowhere-zero 3-flow. According to a result by Kochol that it suffices to prove
3-flow Conjecture for 5-edge-connected graphs. Thus our result is now only "one
step away" from the final solution of this famous open problem. The PI will
continue his research work in this direction. He proposes to extend those newly
developed techniques for further studies in the theory of integer flows.
Proposed projects will include not only the 3-flow Conjecture, but also 5-flow
Conjecture, Tutte orientations, contractible configurations (group
connectivity), flows for odd-edge-connected graph, circular flows and Circular
Flow Conjecture, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work belongs to the area
of graph theory and is closely related to computer science and operational
research. A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks,
such as communication systems, transportation networks or the Internet. Various
graph coloring problems have been considered as effective models for radio
channel assignment/distribution, and flow problems originally arise in
optimizing traffic or network. This proposal is concerned with problems of
structural nature. Why do some networks possess certain specific desirable
properties, and others do not? Especially, when the reliability (connectivity)
of a network decreases, certain flow patterns may disappear. A better
understanding of such graphic properties will lead to designs of efficient
algorithms, to practical computations.
