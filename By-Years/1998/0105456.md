This laboratory study of subduction is motivated by recent seismic and
geochemical advances on understanding of subduction and mantle flow attending
subduction. The PI proposes laboratory experiments similar to those he has done
for ridges and plumes, to investigate subduction processes. There will be four
types of analog lab experiments: 1) studies aimed at understanding longitudinal
subduction vs. rollback (slab sinking), 2) experiments to study the role of
rollback-style subduction on back arc basin spreading and plate motion, 3)
experiments to look at the effects of oscillating longitudinal and rollback
subduction on the thermal structure of the slab and wedge, and 4) the effects of
this oscillation on generation of mantle diapirs in the wedge region. All these
experiments have relevance to the processes being studied in the MARGINS
program. Part of the work will be done at Australian National University (ANU)
with Ross Griffiths, where Kincaid will spend a one-year sabbatical. This will
take advantage of the excellent lab facilities available at
ANU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
