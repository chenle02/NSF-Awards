Elena Rybak-Akimova of Tufts University is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to conduct research on
kinetics and mechanisms of oxygen and peroxide activation by non-heme iron
complexes. She has not previously been PI of NSF research grants. A main aim of
the proposal is to elucidate the difference between iron-mediated biological
oxidations that involve free radicals and those that proceed through 'radical-
free' pathways. Kinetic and mechanistic studies of high-valent iron oxo species
supported by tris-picolyamine (TPA) ligands will be carried out at low
temperatures, using cryogenic stopped-flow techniques (single and double mixing)
with spectrophotometric and EPR registration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research
under this project will clarify obscure aspects of important biochemical
processes and provide insights that potentially will lead to development of
environmentally benign processes using oxygen and/or hydrogen peroxide in
chemical synthesis and oxidative detoxification of wastes. Sophisticated
stopped-flow kinetic studies, such as those proposed here, are necessary to
demonstrate the relationship of synthetic models of enzyme active sites to
actual biological function. Few laboratories now have the capability to carry
out such studies. This program will provide especially valuable training for
students and postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
