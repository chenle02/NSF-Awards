9353071 Jones The research team proposes to examine the primary factors
affecting the participation of African Americans in science, mathematics, and
engineering programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
Case studies of two groups of HBCUs will be performed: A group of HBCUs that
have had increasing numbers of SEM graduates in recent years will be contrasted
with a group that have bee experiencing decreasing degree completions. The
research team will use existing data, interviews, and focus groups to identify
the primary factors responsible for success and failure of these HBCUs. The
research will place emphasis on the effect increased levels of Federal
assistance has had on HBCU undergraduate programs. ***
