Whitman College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection enables
the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the
international scientific and educational community to access network resources
such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award funds part of the
costs for two years.
