Plate tectonics provides a conceptual framework for placing a number of
structural features in rather specific tectonic settings, however the effects of
second-order variations are not well constrained. This project will examine the
possible effects of aseismic ridge subduction on an active system of faults in
Panama. Presently, two hypotheses are viable- the deformation is due to "escape
tectonics" resulting in Cocos Ridge penetration or the deformation is due simply
to the west end of the Panama microplate, unrelated to the Cocos Ridge. These
models will be tested by measuring displacements of Quaternary terraces and
volcanic flows, structural studies of faults, and analysis of focal plane
earthquake mechanisms. Each model predicts different spatial distributions of
faults, different timing and styles of deformation. Results will help understand
microplate boundaries and interactions in the western Caribbean/Central America
area and are expected to apply to microplate tectonics in other areas.
