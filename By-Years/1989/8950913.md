This project provides a laboratory-scale PRISM Gas Separation System. The system
consists of four bundles of hollow-fiber semipermeable membranes designed to
separate air into a nitrogen stream and an enriched oxygen stream. It includes
the necessary instrumentation and instructional materials. The PRISM Gas
Separator is an example of newly developed technology which is safe to operate,
easy to maintain, and allows the opportunity for open-ended experimentation.
Acquisition of this system greatly enhances the laboratory experience of the
chemical engineering students by providing hands on experience with advanced
technology comparable to industry. The institution is matching the NSF grant
with an equal amount of funds.
