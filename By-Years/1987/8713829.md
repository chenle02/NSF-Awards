A three and a half year research program will continue the investigation of the
interaction of plasmas with moving magnetic and electron fields. The resulting
nonlinear plasma dynamics is of general interest in basic plasma physics and has
many relevant applications in fusion and space research. Experiments will be
performed in large laboratory plasmas which have extensive diagnostics and data
processing capabilities. For example, volume measurements of magnetic fields,
space charge fields, particle distribution functions, and wave phenomena have
been performed. The proposed investigations include (i) Formation of new
magnetic whistler shocks when the relative motion between plasmas and fields
exceeds the whistler wave speed. Such processes arise when the ions remain
effectively unmagnetized and shocks form at super-"whistleric" rather than
super--"Alfvenic" speeds. (ii) The generation of magnetic fields due to plasma
motion will be investigated (dynamo process). (iii) The mechanism of current and
space charge neutralization of particle beams injected into plasmas will be
studied. (iv) The stability of various current configurations with respect to
tearing, coalescence, tilting, kinking, pinching and disruptions will be
explored.
