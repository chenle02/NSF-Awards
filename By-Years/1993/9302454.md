James H. Gilchrist has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Gilchrist's doctoral degree was from Cornell University under the
supervision of Professor David Collum. Dr. Gilchrist will continue research at
the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor John
Bercaw. Dr. Gilchrist's postdoctoral training will provide him with skills in
the synthetic and physical chemistry of transition metal compounds.
Specifically, he will study platinum-mediated alkane activation processes.
Longer term he plans to investigate the transition metal catalyzed coupling of
carbonyl compounds to alkenes. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
