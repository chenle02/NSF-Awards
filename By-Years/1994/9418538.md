9418538 Tucker Although the Mesozoic and Cenozoic breakup of Gondwana is well
understood, the late precambrian assembly of the supercontinent is not well
developed. This project involves extensive age determination on the crystalline
bedrock of Madagascar which will help constrain the configuration and age of the
apparent cratonic blocks within gondwana and the timing of fusion between east
and west gondwana. The work will be done in conjunction with an ongoing project
within several South African Universities. Results should impact the temporal
evolution of this part of the Mozambique orogenic belt and improve the
understanding of Madagascar's geologic setting within the larger framework of
the gondwana supercontinent.
