The formation of stars may produce bodies of a wide range of masses, including
stellar companions similar to that or slightly more massive than Jupiter to
bodies that are roughly 1/3 as massive as the sun. The former kinds of objects
are called brown dwarfs and do not possess their own nuclear energy source. The
latter kinds of bodies are stars called M-dwarfs and lie at the lower end of the
main sequence. The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to investigate the
formation, structure, evolution, and radiative signatures of brown dwarfs and
M-dwarfs. In particular, the PIs will construct synthetic spectra in the visible
to infrared range, compare the equation of state derived under previous NSF
spport with other newer equations of state developed by other researchers, model
the formation and evolution of objects of about 1 to 10 Jovian masses, and
assess the feasibility of detecting such objects.
