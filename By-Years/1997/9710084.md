Local linear regression is a useful tool for estimating an unknown regression
function under a random design model. An important problem in the fitting of a
local linear regression is the choice of the smoothing parameter. As the
smoothing parameter becomes large, the estimator tends to a straight line, which
is the least squares fit in the ordinary linear regression setting. Such a
property may be used to assess the adequacy of a linear model. The idea is that
in the nonlinear case a large bandwidth is required to yield a linear estimate,
while if the true model is linear, less smoothing is needed to give a linear
regression estimate. Thus a suitable test statistic is the value of the
smoothing parameter at the point where the estimate changes from nonlinear to
linear. For a set of given data, this critical bandwidth can be found, to
certain accuracy, by a binary search. The ``wild bootstrap'' procedure can be
used to replicate the data to assess the significance of the test. The
development of the proposed project will involve some theoretical proofs that
the test has the required asymptotic properties and simulation studies to
evaluate the performance of the test on examples arising in applications.
Research problems related to the proposed project are nonparametric tests of the
difference between two regression curves and detecting heteroscedasticity in
regression problems, based on the local linear regression. These may be topics
for the future research proposals.
