This award provides funds to Northern Arizona University to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the areas of neural and behavioral
sciences. The research internship is complemented by an integrated educational
program that provides training in research design statistics, reading complex
scientific literature, introduction to advanced technologies in research design
and implementation, seminars in the history and philosophy of science, and an
integrated lecture-discussion series that covers the range of research topics in
neural and behavioral sciences. Scientists from the Department of Biology and
the Department of Psychology will sponsor 12 internships for Native American
undergraduate students. The Department of Occupational and Technological
Education and the Department of Engineering will provide training in advanced
technologies, including basic computer training and training in the application
of computer assisted design systems for production of research software and
instrumentation. The Science and Mathematics Learning Center will also provide
training in the basics of experimental design, statistics, reading scientific
literature, scientific and technical writing, and collaborative learning.
Scientists from all participating departments will contribute lecture-discussion
series on neural and behavioral research.
