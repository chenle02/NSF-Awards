This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry. During the tenure of this two-year
continuing grant, Professor Osteryoung and her students will apply pulse
voltammetric techniques to the quantification of benzodiazepines, to the study
of the interactions of ions with cyclodextrins, and to the electrolytic
formation of thin films. Specific experimental systems to be investigated
include complexation of ferrocenecarboxylic acid and heme entities by
cyclodextrins, development of methods for benzodiazepine analysis in nonaqueous
media, novel applications of monodisperse spheres to the study of mass transport
in electrochemical systems, and electrocrystallization of Ba-Cu-O
superconductors. %%% This research will expand the knowledge base and broaden
practical utilization of fundamental electrochemistry. Related areas that will
benefit from this work include pharmacoanalysis, enzyme modeling, and high
temperature superconducting materials.
