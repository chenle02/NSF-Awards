This project will investigate the fundamental physical mechanisms guiding onset
of turbulence in charged media, a plasma composed of electrons, ions, and dust
particles, by numerically modeling the motion of dust particles in the plasma
environment. Understanding the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in
charged media is one of the very important scientific challenges as it affects
complex processes such as nuclear fusion, dispersion of chemicals in the
atmosphere, formation of atmospheric storms, and aircraft stability. For
example, flight turbulence is common, yet the origin of such phenomenon can be
affected by a variety of factors, including wind flows, pressure or temperature
gradients, and self-induced electricity, including lightning, in dusty
atmospheres. In plasma conditions, the dust particles become charged and can
form dusty plasma liquids, where various waves and instabilities can be
observed. This makes dusty plasmas an ideal model system for the study of the
laminar-to-turbulent transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of dusty
plasmas is guided by the dust-dust interaction and the dust interaction with the
plasma, both of which can lead to anomalous dust diffusion. In this project, the
research team will investigate the connection between anomalous diffusion and
the onset of a global instability, such as turbulence. The research team will
develop an in-house analysis code, employing novel mathematical techniques from
spectral theory and fractional calculus to model anomalous particle diffusion in
disordered media with non-local interactions. For a given diffusion behavior,
the analysis code will determine the corresponding time-evolved dynamical state
of the system based on the evolution of its energy spectrum. To verify this
novel technique, the predictions from the spectral analysis will be compared
against the results from molecular dynamics simulations as well as experiments
employing dusty plasma liquids exhibiting turbulent
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
