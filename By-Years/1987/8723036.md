This is a project to continue analyses of rocks dredged from the Manus Basin,
the fastest spreading back-arc basin known. The original proposal emphasized
defining the tectonic structure (SeaMARC II), and sample collection together
with preliminary analyses. The field program was successful, and the preliminary
petrological analyses indicate that the Manus Basin lavas form two groups--a
MORB type and a calc-alkaline type (CA). Support is provided to do a number of
standard geochemical analyses (glass, minerals, whole-rock XRF, a variety of
isotopes, volatiles), along with petrologic modeling. The various analyses will
all be done on the same samples. Hope is to address a number of questions
concerning fractionation controls, range of sources, origin of transitional
lavas, relation of erupted lavas to tectonic setting, etc. Many of the
individual analyses are to be done by others at no cost to project. The PI is to
act as overall coordinator. This project is important because it will provide
new information on the origin of chemical variability of rocks from a small
geographic area.
