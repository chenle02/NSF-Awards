PROJECT SUMMARY Rutledge/97-26464 This research is an investigation of both
middle latitude and tropical convection. A particular strength of this research
is its inclusion of cloud dynamics, microphysics, associated electrification,
and lightning in an integrated approach to the problems. Specific objectives
include: an investigation of deep, tropical convection studied with
multiparameter radar during the Maritime Continent Thunderstorm Experiment,
similar studies of deep, middle latitude convection sampled in the STERAO-A
project, a detailed investigation of severe hailstorms and why some produce
large numbers of positive cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, further refinement
of polarimetric radar techniques for remotely-inferring precipitation processes
in clouds, and participation in new field efforts to study tropical continental
convection in Brazil and oceanic convection over the Marshall Islands. The
research will lay foundations for improved representation of lightning in
physical models and in global models to assess effects of NOx produced by
lightning on chemical processes in the atmosphere. One potential practical
benefit is the possible use of real-time lightning observations to improve
predictions of the behavior of severe storms. All of the objectives of this
research depend on use of existing techniques and development of new techniques
for application of multiparameter polarimetric radar data. NSF FORM 1358(7~5)
