This project will produce and test at least six new laboratory experiences for
students in general chemistry courses. The experiments will use computer-
interfaced technology (IBM-PSL) in an environment in which students can truly
experiment. Research Fellows on sabbatical leave will collaborate with the
Principal Investigators to develop new experiments using the distance, light,
pH, and temperature probes of the PSL system. The computerized data collection
and analysis speed up the process of experimentation sufficiently that students
are able to carry out more measurements, collect significantly more data, and
solve more meaningful laboratory problems. This work, combined with previous
work, will create a critical mass of laboratory experiences using the computer.
