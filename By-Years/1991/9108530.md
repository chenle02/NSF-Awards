This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Curtis Monnig's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at the
University of California at Riverside. The main thrust of Dr. Monnig's research
is the the development of analytical techniques and instrumentation for
quantitative analysis of bioactive molecules in small quantities, e.g., in
individual cells. Capillary electrophoresis and microcapillary liquid
chromatography will be coupled with high sensitivity detectors (laser-induced
fluorescence, mass spectrometry) to obtain qualitative and quantitative
information about the chemical constituents of these samples. This
instrumentation will be used to identify and map chemical changes in developing
cell populations. The resulting cytochemical maps will be used to catalog the
steps of chemical differentiation at the earliest stages of cell development and
to identify suspected morphogenic substances.
