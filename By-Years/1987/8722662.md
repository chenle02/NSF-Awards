Ancient societies have left visible evidence of their social systems in
material remains. One of the most important types of evidence of social
differences can be found in mortuary remains. This research project is designed
to test theories dealing with the extent of social differentiation and the
development of social complexity in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom as evidenced
in mortuary cults. Specifically, the student will analyze the problem of the
rise of the middle class. To do this, she will conduct an intensive survey and
excavate a sample of graves in the cemetary at Abydos, southern Egypt. Status
differentiation and the rise of complex societies are classic problems in
archaeology. Ancient Egyptian societies are unusual in the degree to which the
mortuary cult permeated every facet of social and political organization.
Unfortunately, in the past, much work has focused on the spectacular, ignoring
important questions of variability. This timely project will help to remedy this
situation and provide new information for understanding the development of
hierarchical social organizations.
