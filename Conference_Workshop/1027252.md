The Thirty-second Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University October 14-16, 2010. The theme of this year's meeting is Random
Matrices, for which the centerpiece is the two lectures by Kurt Johansson. In
addition to supporting the speakers, we will fund the travel and lodging
expenses for graduate students, younger researchers and members of unrepresented
minority groups.
