A PC computer-based system for receiving real-time weather data, including
weather maps, alphanumeric weather information, and images from weather
satellites will be acquired. The system is necessary for upgrading the existing
program and for receiving new data being managed and distributed under the
UNIDATA Program by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. The data
will be used as the basic resource for teaching a wide range of courses in
meteorology such as introductory classes for science and non-science majors,
weather analysis and forecasting, satellite meteorology, and mesoscale
meteorology. The system provides the capability for looping and zooming a
sequence of satellite images so the current weather can be studied in motion.
These loops may be saved on videotape and library of case studies developed. The
college will provide 50% matching funds.
