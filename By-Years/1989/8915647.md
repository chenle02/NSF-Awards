This dissertation research project will allow a graduate student in cultural
anthropology to study a religious cult community in Northern California. Using
ethnographic methods of participant observation and structured interviewing, the
student investigator will study how the religious community survives and adapts
to its social environment through analysis of the tension between the social
structure of the group and the expressive, affective relationships between
individuals in the community. This research is important because so-called "new
religions" are a significant part of modern American society. Increased
understanding of how such religious communities survive and adapt to their
socio-cultural environment can help the social groups they deal with and policy-
makers interact with them more successfully.
