In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Stwalley will study the electronic spectroscopy of diatomic
alkali molecules in "long range states" in which internuclear distances are
larger than about 10 Angstroms. Knowledge of the energy levels in this region
gives information about the long-range potential energy curves, which is
important for understanding photodissociation and associative ionization
processes. Optical-optical double resonance (OODR) and All-Optical Triple
Resonance (AOTR) will be used to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of these
processes state selectively. In the experiments being conducted in this project,
lasers are used to determine various properties of diatomic molecules as well as
to study light-induced processes in these two-atom molecules. Among the
information to be gathered are data regarding photodissociation (bond-breaking
induced by light) and associative ionization (bond-forming with attendant loss
of an electron). Fundamental information such as this has impact on our
understanding of a variety of areas, including atmospheric processes and
materials processing using lasers or plasmas.
