This award to Oregon State University's Department of Geology is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire petrographic equipment consisting of
microscopes and a cathodoluminescence attachment. The University is committed to
matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The equipment will be used in
a series of laboratory courses in optical mineralogy, lithology, igneous
petrology, sedimentary petrology, metamorphic petrology and structural geology.
