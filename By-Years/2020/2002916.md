The IEEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent
Systems and Applications (IEEE 2019), held in Los Angeles, CA, Dec 12-14, 2019,
focuses on the issues related to trust, privacy and security and their interplay
with artificial intelligence in the context of smart and intelligent systems. It
provides an opportunity for researchers to discuss research results at the
intersection of artificial intelligence and machine learning with cognitive
science and behavioral science and putting human in the loop. Through peer-
reviewed technical research papers, invited keynote talks and panel discussions,
the conference brings together leaders from interdisciplinary communities to
understand the broader set of challenges of and explore holistic solutions for
the highly interconnected, AI enhanced digital world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports approximately 15 students to participate in the conference. To
facilitate increased level of participation, partial support may be provided to
students who have some other means of covering part of their expenses. Selection
criteria include evidence of interest in the field as demonstrated by statement
of research interests, CV showing research output, coursework and/or project
experience, etc., recommendation letter, and a statement on how participation in
the conference would benefit the studentâ€™s research and education. Preference is
given to students from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
