The goals of this project are (1) to make possible the implementation of a new
student-designed human physiology laboratory model which integrates scientific
inquiry ilto several courses requiring a physiology laboratory and (2) to
formally assess curricular goals that utilize student-designed laboratories as
pedagogy. This laboratory model enables students to design their own laboratory
exercises, collect data, and analyze their data with the use of microcomputer
technology. The project addresses a number of recommendations from national
educational associations as its goals. A pilot study was conducted with the
limited equipment available at the university. While the students learned a
great deal about methodology, controls, and financial constraints as they
attempted to create experiments on their own, they were limited by the lack of
variable gathering instrumentation and more sophisticated data analysis
capabilities. The new equipment for this project includes six microcomputers
with software and transducers to assess cardiac function, brain function by wave
analysis, muscle function, exercise/fitness-related data, respiratory function,
skin temperature, and galvonic skin response. In addition, new microcomputer-
assisted software enables students to take a more active role in experimental
design. Taking a more active role in designing laboratories enables the student
to become more acquainted with the scientific process as it actually is, i.e.,
creating the ideas behind the experiments and not simply performing a cookbook-
type laboratory exercise.
