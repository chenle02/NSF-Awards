This project is directed at the re-structuring of an undergraduate course
sequence in electronics. The objective of this work is to integrate modern
computer-based data acquisition and analysis techniques into both laboratory and
lecture components. The audience for this three quarter sequence is drawn from
physics majors, students majoring in other sciences or mathematics, as well as
students preparing to teach physical sciences at the high school level. The goal
is to introduce into the laboratory portion of the course current generation
computers, data acquisition hardware, and integrated software to acquaint
students with modern techniques of data collection, analysis and display. This
will employ personal-computer- based workstations and software with extensive
acquisition and analysis features. The lecture portion of the course will
undergo modifications to reflect the increased presence of computer-based data
analysis in laboratory environments. As a result, it is expected that the
students will be better prepared to pursue their objectives after graduation,
whether in industrial employment, graduate school or teaching. The college will
match the award with an equal amount of funds.
