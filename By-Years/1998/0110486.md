This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will further
develop a revolutionary approach to nanostructure fabrication. This Near-Field
Scanning Optical Nanolithographic approach, which we have already shown to be
capable of writing 100nm width lines, utilizes a direct, optical write
technology in conjunction with optical photoresists. The direct optical writing
is performed with a customized Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM)
tool. The major goal of the proposed work is to design and construct a
commercially viable NSOM lithography tool and demonstrate processes for flexible
pattern generation on 4" wafers. Phase I work demonstrated the preliminary
design of the NSOM lithography tool and photoresist processes using a novel
inorganic hydrogenated amorphous silicon resist, as well as conventional polymer
resists. Best line widths of approximately 100nm, comparable to the probe
diameter, were obtained.

The commercial benefits from this project will be the construction and
demonstration of the NSOM lithography tool for rapid prototyping of
nanostructures in university and corporate research labs.
