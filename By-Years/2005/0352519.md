The "Instructional Modules in Educational Measurement and Statistics for School
Personnel" project will be produced in dynamic video cases and DVD for use in
updating school administrators', counselors' and teachers' knowledge about
tests, measurement, score reports and interpretation. This new knowledge will
enable schools to inform curriculum and instructional decision-making, improve
classroom practices and better respond to the strengths and needs of individual
students. These materials will help bridge an existing gap in assessment
literacy by helping teachers, administrators and parents to interpret test score
results and to understand the underlying measurement principles essential to
making meaning of these results. Extensive survey data and text analysis will be
used to identify widely held misconceptions about testing and measurement
concepts. Pilot and field-testing will be targeted to gain feedback on how well
the new materials communicate and translate the core concepts of score
distributions, individual and average test scores and interpretation of widely
used score reports to teachers. This unique and timely project will produce high
quality materials on assessment that will have immediate applicability and that
will be of broad interest.
