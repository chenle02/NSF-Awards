A coupled binuclear non-heme iron active site exists in a variety of proteins
which perform different biological functions. hemerythrin (Hr) binds O2, methane
monooxygenase activates it for hydroxylation, reducted ribonucleotide reductase
reacts with O2 to generate a catalytically active tyrosyl radical, and reduced
purple acid phosphatase is oxidatively inactivated in the presence of phosphate.
These protein sites (and analogous model complexes) can be obtained in three
oxidation states. Dr. Solomon's spectral studies on these sites and their
substrate and small molecule bound forms emphasize bsorption, circular
dichrosims, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) to probe the excited states,
and variable- temperature, variable-field MCD to probe ground state sublevel
splittings. This data enables a determination of the geometry of each iron, and
the exchange coupling which is associated with bridging ligation. The goal of
this research is to define active site geometric and electronic structural
diffeences which correlate with variation in biological reactivity.
