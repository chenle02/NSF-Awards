This award to an interdisciplinary group of scientists will develop both the
theory and the tools both for integrating heterogeneous databases and for
querying them. The immediate application of this work will be on data generated
by the genome community. However, the need for such a tool is broader than that
community. In particular the investigators will provide two tools. The first
will be a view mechanism, which allows one to define a view (in yet another data
model) encompassing parts of several related databases, and the second is a
query language which can be used on this view. This work is being jointly
supported by the Database Activity in the Biological Sciences and the Database
and Expert Systems Program.
