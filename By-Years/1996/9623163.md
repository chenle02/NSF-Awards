The effort proposed here is to examine the particle and wave entry processes
involved in the transfer of mass, energy and momentum across the magnetopause to
the magnetospheric boundary layer. The proposal is explicit in defining problems
to be examined and in ways to distinguish among different processes thought to
be responsible for boundary layer structure and wave energy entry. Data
investigated will be from the ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft and from the IGS and AFGL
ground magnetometer arrays, as well as from solar wind monitors.
