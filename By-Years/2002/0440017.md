The proposed work will develop and use models of mantle flow and
&lt;br/&gt;convection to understand the state and evolution of the solid earth.
&lt;br/&gt;The work will include studies of mantle plumes and hotspots; plumes
&lt;br/&gt;provide an indicator of mantle flow throughout the depth of the
&lt;br/&gt;mantle, and recent seismic observations of plumes will allow a direct
&lt;br/&gt;comparison of models of mantle flow with observation of plumes that
&lt;br/&gt;are moved and distorted by mantle flow. These results will also be
&lt;br/&gt;important for understanding hotspot tracks and plate motions, as well
&lt;br/&gt;as flow in the mantle. The work will also address the motions of
&lt;br/&gt;subducted material and other heterogeneities in the mantle, and will
&lt;br/&gt;relate them to geochemical signatures of heterogeneity in the mantle.
&lt;br/&gt;This will build upon recently developed statistical models of the
&lt;br/&gt;development and evolution of mantle heterogeneity, and will provide a
&lt;br/&gt;means of relating observed geochemical evidence of heterogeneity with
&lt;br/&gt;dynamical processes in the mantle. Further development of flow and
&lt;br/&gt;convection models will be done to deal more realistically with
&lt;br/&gt;thermal convection and mantle rheology. Recent developments for
&lt;br/&gt;inversion of models will be applied in order to better constrain our
&lt;br/&gt;conclusions. Since the models predict a range of geophysical
&lt;br/&gt;phenomena (including the geoid, plate motions, polar wander) the
&lt;br/&gt;results of the model studies will be systematically applied to these
&lt;br/&gt;other phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will relate the
dynamic processes of flow and convection to &lt;br/&gt;the emerging
seismological pictures of mantle structure, as well as &lt;br/&gt;to the
geochemical evolution of the Earth. This will allow a more &lt;br/&gt;unified
view of the workings of the Earth's interior on both short &lt;br/&gt;and long
time scales. The work will involve the training of graduate &lt;br/&gt;students,
and will also develop numerical models that will be &lt;br/&gt;available to
other researchers. The results of the work will have &lt;br/&gt;broad
implications for understanding the dynamics and evolution of &lt;br/&gt;the
Earth, and will relate dynamical, tectonic and geochemical views &lt;br/&gt;of
the evolution and working of the Earth system, which represents an
&lt;br/&gt;extremely active area of earth science research.&lt;br/&gt;
