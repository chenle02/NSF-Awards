A continuing research program designed to investigate new approaches to
nucleophilic conjugate addition is proposed. Conceptually it will be tested
whether or not charge-directed 1,4-addition reactions are facilitated by
carbonyl-deactivation in unsaturated systems using deactivators such as:
silylated carboxylates, enolates, sulfenylated enolates and transition
metallates. New approaches to sterically directed conjugate addition, with and
without Lewis acid catalysts, will be examined. Complex ring construction
through lithium-halogen exchange-initiated cyclization reactions will also be
explored. The facilities available to Professor Cooke are suitable for the
research to be conducted, and the prior results of the Principal Investigator
demonstrate his ability to make use of the equipment and facilities.
