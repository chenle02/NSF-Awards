This proposal will support a workshop of researchers in medical informatics,
database systems,&lt;br/&gt;health care issues, and clinical information systems
to discuss the use of clinical records in medical and computer science research.
It will address issues in system interoperability, user needs,
privacy,&lt;br/&gt;security, economic issues, and most importantly national
needs and opportunities with respect to the very rich medical information base
in clinical records.
