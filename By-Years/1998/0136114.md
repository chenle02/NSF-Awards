0136114&lt;br/&gt;Holton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alaska and Northwestern Canada are
home to more than half of the Athabascan languages, and in these areas
Athabascan communities have shown increasing interest in language
revitalization. At the same time, the Athabascan languages present unique
challenges to linguists seeking to develop lexical databases. The 2002
Athabascan Languages Conference, with an accompanying workshop on lexicography,
will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, in an effort to unite linguists, Native
speakers, educators, and language learners in a rich information exchange. The
sessions will be focused on linguistic research, language revitalization, and
language policy. Stipends will be available for students and Native speakers
from the Alaskan interior and Northwestern Canada.
