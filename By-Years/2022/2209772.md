This project focuses on atmospheric processes that can lead to the formation of
urban ultrafine particles in the urban atmosphere. Understanding the formation
of ultrafine particles is important because they have higher penetration and
deposition efficiencies in the lung and have higher toxicity than larger
particles. They can also enhance the production of cloud condensation nuclei.
This research is relevant for better understanding climate and air quality
issues, particularly in urban areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two 6-week field
campaigns are planned for measuring chemical precursors such as highly
oxygenated molecules, and particle sizes and chemical composition with a suite
of state-of-the-art aerosol and chemical instrumentation. The field work will be
conducted in the metropolitan Houston area due to the variety of emissions for
aerosol and gas-phase precursors from oil refineries, power plants, ship
channels, urban and marine emissions in the region. The main scientific
questions to be addressed are: (1) What is the relative contribution of traffic
emissions vs. new particle formation to the urban ultrafine particles in
Houston? (2) What is the molecular composition of urban HOMs (highly oxygenated
organic molecules) under different temperatures and NOx (NO+N02) conditions? (3)
How is urban new particle formation facilitated by different chemical
precursors, such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, amines, and HOMs in Houston?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will support two female faculty members and
several graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
