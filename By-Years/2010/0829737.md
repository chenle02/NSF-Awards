The reionization of hydrogen and helium are landmark events in the history of
the Universe, constituting important phase transitions for the intergalactic
medium (IGM) and impacting later structure formation everywhere. Although
hydrogen reionization has received the most attention, exciting new data on
helium are coming from far-ultraviolet spectra of moderate redshift quasars.
This project aims to build a physically motivated, comprehensive model for
helium reionization, including source clustering, inhomogeneities, and the
correlations between sources and absorbers. The analytic model will be compared
to numerical simulations and then tested against existing and future
observations. The end result will reveal a lot about the intrinsic properties of
the sources and their relation to the IGM.

There is a tightly integrated educational component, including a graduate
student's thesis work, and undergraduate research through existing programs at
Yale University; the project is modular and lends itself well to short-term but
meaningful research. This work should have wide repercussions within the
astrophysical community, with implications for quasar evolution, the IGM, and
structure formation.
