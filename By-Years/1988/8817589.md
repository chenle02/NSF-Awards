The specific aims of this NMR study of the DNA recognition by EcoRI endonuclease
are to obtain an overall conformational characterization of the DNA substrates
of EcoRI endonuclease and to elucidate the effects of single-site structural
changes at the protein-DNA interface upon the conformation of the DNA-EcoRI
endonuclease complex. The EcoRI restriction endonuclease represents one of the
most valuable model systems to investigate the molecular basis of the
recognition of DNA sequences by genome regulatory proteins. The enzyme
recognizes with high specificity the double stranded DNA sequence d(GAATTC)
which it cleaves at the GpA bonds. The catalytic activity of EcoRI endonuclease
requires magnesium ions as a cofactor. In the absence of magnesium, the enzyme
still recognizes the sequence. Due to this property, specific complexes between
the protein and synthetic oligonucleoties containing the EcoRI recognition site
can be prepared and studied.***
