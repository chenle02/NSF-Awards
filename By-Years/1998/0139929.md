This project continues first principles studies of
quantum&lt;br/&gt;chromodynamics (the theory of the strong interactions) through
the use&lt;br/&gt;of high performance computer simulations. Emphasis is to be
placed on&lt;br/&gt;using improved algorithms to extract the most precise values
to date&lt;br/&gt;of key numbers in the Standard Model of the fundamental
interactions&lt;br/&gt;in Nature. Results to be obtained are essential for
analyzing&lt;br/&gt;experimental measurements at national accelerator
laboratories and to&lt;br/&gt;test the internal consistency of the Model. They
may lead to clues&lt;br/&gt;about more fundamental interactions. They will also
be used to&lt;br/&gt;continue studies of the high temperature phase transition
between&lt;br/&gt;confined matter and the quark-gluon plasma and of the strange
quark&lt;br/&gt;content of the plasma. Such a phase transition occurred in
the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of the early Universe and is thought to be achievable in
the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory in collisions of heavy ions at the RHIC accelerator,
which&lt;br/&gt;recently began operation at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are important for extending our
understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;most fundamental basis of our physical world and
of the origins of our&lt;br/&gt;Universe. Algorithmic ideas are likely to have
applications in other&lt;br/&gt;computational fields.&lt;br/&gt;
