Martin/Taussig 9307563 This project will employ ethnographic methods to
investigate the impact of human genome research on shaping identity and related
conceptualizations of body, community, and nation-state boundaries in the
Netherlands. The objectives of the project are: (1) To investigate how changes
in scientific and other forms of knowledge of the human genome affect the way
people perceive biological and social identity; (2) To examine how this
knowledge affects conceptualizations of the body; (3) To elucidate the tension
between what is made possible by advances in genetics and socially valued
conceptualizations of the self and the body; and (4) To examine how scientific
knowledge is produced in genetics laboratories and how the general population
learns about and makes sense of this knowledge. These objectives are designed to
develop a foundation of knowledge about what a wide range of people think about
the human genome and to understand how on-going human genome research affects
articulations of identity and conceptualizations of the body. *** er time and
