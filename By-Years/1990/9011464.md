The ovarian steroid hormone, estradiol, regulates physiology and behavior by
actions in the brain. Estradiol binds to intracellular protein receptors found
in target neurons within the specific neural brain regions. These steroid-
receptor complexes then bind to acceptor sites in the nucleus to alter gene
expression (i.e. induction of RNA and protein synthesis). It is the believed
that the increase and decrease of proteins resulting from this steroid-receptor
interaction is the primary mechanism of action of the hormone. While many of the
physiological, morphological and behavioral effects induced by estradiol can be
accounted for by this mechanism, recent immunocytochemical studies have
identified steroid hormone receptors in the extranuclear regions of the target
neurons. This strongly suggests that the hormone also acts through a nongenomic
process. Dr. Blaustein will identify other possible sites within neurons at
which estradiol acts. Since at the light microscopic level distinct cellular
localization can not be readily identified, he will develop an electron
microscopic, ultrastructural immunocytochemical technique. Using this technique,
Dr. Blaustein will determine the extranuclear organelles with which the steroid
receptors are associated. These anatomical studies will significantly enhance
our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of action of this hormone. A number
of studies have linked estradiol with the occurrence of various types of
cancers. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action could eventually
lead to improved treatments and possible cures for these life threatening
estrogen-related diseases.
