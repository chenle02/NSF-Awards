Evacuation is a critical component in a community's disaster preparedness plan.
The challenge is that lives can be lost during evacuations too. Such loss of
life is especially likely in a hurricane with a late-changing track striking a
major urban area because household evacuation preparation often places many
evacuees on the road at the same time. Despite the best transportation planning
models, major traffic jams commonly occur in the surge zone. This research will
improve our understanding of the time it takes for households to receive
warnings, prepare to evacuate, and choose their evacuation routes and
destinations. It will also expand our knowledge of the role of demographic and
experiential characteristics of these households to predict warning reception,
evacuation preparation, and route/destination choice.

This project will advance the scientific understanding of household hurricane
evacuations by conducting a survey of 800 randomly selected households in Corpus
Christi Texas. This survey has six specific objectives: 1) collect data on
hurricane warning dissemination times, 2) collect data on household evacuation
preparation times, 3) collect data on household evacuation logistics (e.g.,
route choices, destination choices, evacuation durations, and evacuation costs),
4) assess the ability of demographic, experiential, and risk perception data to
predict evacuation departure times and evacuation logistics, 5) collect data on
risk area occupants' observations of graphic displays of hurricane tracks,
hurricane impacts, and evacuation guidance, and 6) assess the ability of
demographic, experiential, and graphic displays to predict risk perception,
evacuation decisions, and evacuation departure times. Understanding how long it
takes for individuals to decide to evacuate and to actually evacuate is a
critical and poorly understood part of evacuation models.
