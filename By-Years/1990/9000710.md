This award provides support for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site
at the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, MI. Ten
undergraduate students interested in research in field biology will be selected
to participate in the program. Students will both learn and live at the station
during the 9-week summer session. The research experience will be the sole focus
of their academic activities during that period. The selected students will each
work with a faculty mentor, attend special evening workshops, attend weekly
discussion meetings, attend general seminars at the station, and develop their
own research project (from conception of the ideas through data gathering to
verbal and written presentations of the study). Students will be selected on the
basis of academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and evidence of
interest in research. After participation in the program, each student will help
in the evaluation of his/her experiences in the program.
