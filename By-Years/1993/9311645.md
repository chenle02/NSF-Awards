This Joint U.S.-Poland Workshop on Quantum Optics will focus on topics in which
both Polish and US scientists are prominently active and have made key
contributions. The workshop will provide many Polish scientists with new and
valuable contacts with U.S. researchers, leading to the possibility of new
collaborative joint projects. Specifically, they will discuss: (1) atoms in
strong electromagnetic fields (atomic ionization and stabilization; high-order
harmonics; multielectron systems); (2) quantum optical approaches to fundamental
questions in physics (cavity QED; phase operators; micromasers; and Schrodinger
cats); and (3) chaos and nonlinear optics (local field and other dense matter
effects in nonlinear optics; and conical emission instabilities). This workshop
in theoretical physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by
enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
