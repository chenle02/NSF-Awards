This project will explore three different topics important for the compilation
of scientific computations for high-performance computers: Fine-grained compiler
analysis and transformations: The PIs will continue their work on fine-grained
synchronization removal and program splicing, and explore other analyses and
transformations that could benefit from being made fine-grained. Algorithms for
Presburger arithmetic and beyond: Performing fine-grained analyses and
transformations requires the use of fine-grained tools for representing things
such as the dependencies in a program, or arithmetic constraints. The PIs will
investigate new algorithms and approaches to obtain significant performance
improvements. Efficient sparse matrix code from high-level specifications: The
PIs will investigate techniques that allow sparse matrix algorithms to be
written in a clean high-level form. Information about special data structures
and other complications will be specified in a way similar to HPF data
distributions.
