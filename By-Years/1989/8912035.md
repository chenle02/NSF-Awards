This project by J. Kurz of Washington University is supported by the Organic
Dynamics Program, and is aimed at a better understanding of the role of solvent
molecules in certain substitution reactions. This problem will be investigated
by the observed changes in the rate of the reactions upon isotopic substitution.
Investigations will continue into the origins of the recently observed anomalous
isotope effects on the rates of chemical reactions. These anomalous isotope
effects are for methyl transfer reactions in polar solvents; they seem to imply
that during methyl transfer to an uncharged oxygen nucleophile, changes in
bonding and solvation are highly asynchronous. In order to accommodate these
data, some revision will be required: either of current physical organic theory,
or of current approaches to the interpretation of kinetic isotope effects. The
origin of these anomalous effects will be elucidated by (a) measurements of
complete sets of isotope effects on the rates of reactions that are known to
present anomalies, and on the rates and equilibria of model reactions, (b) the
theoretical estimations of observable consequences of the implied
bonding/solvation asynchronies, and (c) the computer modeling of transition
state force fields that is required for the quantitative interpretation of those
sets of isotope effects.
