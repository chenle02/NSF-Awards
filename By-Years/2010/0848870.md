This project will continue work to develop new organometallic methodology to
prepare C-C bonds in a stereoselective fashion, and applications of this
methodology. In particular, the preparation of
(2-alkenyl-3-pentene-1,5-diyl)iron complexes and their transformation into
vinylcyclopropanes and divinylcyclopropanes will be targeted. The
divinylcyclopropanes are likely to undergo rearrangement to cycloheptadienes.
These reactions will be applied to the synthesis of beta-
aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acids and frondosin A, an inhibitor of the binding
of interleukin-8 to its receptor.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor William A. Donaldson of the Department of Chemistry at
Marquette University. Professor Donaldson's research efforts revolve around the
development of organometallic methodology for the formation of cyclopropanes and
cycloheptadienes, structural motifs present in a variety of biologically
relevant molecules. Successful development of the methodology will have an
impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
