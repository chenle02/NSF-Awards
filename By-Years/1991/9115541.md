This research program explores the combined effects of composition and strain
on atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and mechanisms of
crystallization in amorphous alloys. Unique approaches include the atomic
modeling of small crystallites imbedded in an amorphous matrix and computer
simulations of atomic resolution microscopy images. The computer simulations are
extended to include planar and volume defects. Quantitative analysis is directed
towards the study of the dependence of image contrast on strain. In addition
image contrasts in crystalline/amorphous phase results are explored.
