With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Luther College will acquire a gel permeation
chromatograph (GPC) and ReactIR instrument for polymer characterization. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the development
of a) novel plant-based polyesters derived from naturally-occurring terpenes; b)
plant-based poly(ester amides) derived from morpholine-2,5-diones; c) novel
lactone polymerization catalysts based upon titatnium (IV) alkoxides; d) novel
plant-based polyolefins derived from naturally-occurring fatty acids; and e)
novel optically active, late transition metal olefin polymerization catalysts.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is an extremely powerful technique used for
the separation and analysis of complex mixtures, in which components are
separated based on their size. It is the standard method in both academia and
industry to accurately determine the molecular weight and polydispersity index
of a polymer sample. The ReactIR is an in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrophotometer that allows real-time monitoring of chemical reactions. These
instruments will substantially strengthen scientific research at this primarily
undergraduate institution and will allow for the incorporation of polymer and
material sciences into the research and teaching programs.
