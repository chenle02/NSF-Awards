9561604 Kendall This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
involved with the direct electrosynthesis of two types of commercially
important, high value-added carbohydrate intermediates. The first transformation
to be studied is the oxidative decarboxylation of a sugar acid, as exemplified
by conversion of D-gluconic acid (or salts thereof) to D-arabinose. The second
transformation is the cleavage of a 1,2-diol to a dicarbonyl compound, as
exemplified by the conversion of mannitol diacetonide to 2,3-isopropylidene-D-
glyceraldehyde; this reaction is customarily accomplished using sodium
periodate, but a direct synthesis would be preferable from both cost and
environmental standpoints. Both D-arabinose and isopropylidene glyceraldehyde
are important and useful intermediates in their own right, but in order to
demonstrate the generality of the processes studied, each process will be
extended to another substrate. For each of the specified processes, a number of
anode materials will be evaluated in Phase I; in addition, the effects of
solvent and pH will be examined. Some small-scale optimization studies will also
be carried out on a selected process. Upon successful completion of the Phase I
work, Phase II studies would include further optimization and evaluation of the
processes in flow cells, as well as extension to other substrates. The
availability of clean, efficient methods for the synthesis of aldopentoses and
for the cleavage of 1,2-diols will allow for the cost-effective manufacture of a
wide range of valuable chemical intermediates. This will provide benefits to the
US chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
