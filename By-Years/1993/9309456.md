This project focuses on algorithms that work on-line or with limited
information. The project addresses three topics, each motivated by an
application in on-line, distributed or parallel computation: (1) metrical task
systems where the set of tasks (inputs to the system) are restricted. The
restriction on the input is part of the description of the system. A general,
simple algorithm is developed which uses the system specification to approximate
the best on-line algorithm for each particular system; (2) distributed
computation where a group of agents must collectively solve a problem. Each
agent receives part of the input, and a graph is used to represent knowledge
that is shared between the agents. How to use shared information between the
agents to solve a distributed job scheduling problem and to determine the value
of sharing information are determined; (3) the problem of partitioning elements
of a partial order into disjoint chains on-line, and its applications to
parallel computation are discussed.
