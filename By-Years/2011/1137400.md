The Division of Chemistry supports Rachel Morrish of the Colorado School of
Mines as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Morrish will
synthesize and study the behavior of photoanodes made from nanomaterials created
from earth-abundant materials (Fe/O/S). She will collaborate with scientists at
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to characterize these materials and
incorporate photoanodes into tandem cells. For her plan for broadening
participation, the PI will develop a hands-on solar energy demonstration for use
in outreach activities and public school teacher-training. These activities will
reach a large number of underrepresented students in the Colorado area.

Research like that of Dr. Morrish is aimed at developing new kinds of materials
for the generation of fuel from solar energy. These materials may help in
developing solutions for sustainable energy production. The particular materials
that Dr. Morrish is developing are "green" in that they use earth-abundant
elements that have low toxicity. The efforts at broadening participation being
pursued by Dr. Morrish are aimed at giving underrepresented students in the
mountain states hands-on activities in important areas of science related to
sustainability.
