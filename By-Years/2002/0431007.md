The P.I. proposed to provide middle school science teachers in the Pittsburgh
region a professional development program that would focus on the effective us
of technology to creatively support the standard curriculum in science and
mathematics. It would contain elements of outreach and awareness intended to
promote the participation of underserved populations in science and engineering.
The program would last five days and be an intensive hands-on workshop designed
to increase teachers' knowledge of technology tools such as CBLs and CBRs
(sensors and probes for automatic data collection with graphing calculators) and
encourage more effective use of these tools. It was expected the program would
raise teacher's awareness of their role in shaping and encouraging the next
generation of scientists to achieve full participation in science and technology
programs. Follow on activities would be held during the school year that would
give teachers an opportunity to share gender equity issues and technology
knowledge with colleagues who were not participants in the summer session.
Follow up activities were planned for the remainder of the award year.
