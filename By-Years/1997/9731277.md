Patterns of larval movement and the spatial scale of dispersal are expected to
be major forces in regulating the dynamics of populations and communities in
marine systems. The life history of most marine species includes a larval stage
that is capable of dispersal over broad geographic areas and efforts to
understand the population dynamics of these species have been stymied by the
magnitude of larval dispersal inherent in planktotrophic development. The scale
of larval dispersal is a key parameter in understanding the recruitment dynamics
of marine species. We will exploit the genetic mosaics formed in a hybrid zone
between two species of mussels to assess the geographic scale of larval
dispersal. In this system, large numbers of larvae are produced at specific
locations with distinct genetic signatures and released into the plankton. By
monitoring the settlement of these `marked` larvae we will assess the geographic
scale and dynamics of larval dispersal. In this study we will capitalize on
molecular genetic markers, that we have developed with previous support from
Biological Oceanography, that allow the population genetics of mussel larvae or
spat to be determined. By exploiting both the molecular genetic markers we have
developed, and the presence of genetic mosaics formed by hybridization between
mussel species it will be possible to monitor the movement of larvae between
geographic areas. Using this system we will determine the geographic scale of
larval dispersal, spatial and temporal variation in dispersal capacity and test
the hypothesis that patterns of larval movement are predominantly controlled by
local circulation dynamics.
