This ADVANCE Fellows award supports an anthropologist who is researching how
patients' access to medical knowledge on the internet is reshaping doctor-
patient relationships. The PI will compile 100 illness case studies consisting
of interviews, questionnaires, and recordings of doctor-patient interactions
over the course of each patient's treatment. With carefully structured
comparisons, the research will discuss the internet's impact on people's medical
lives and relationships, comment on any correlation between access to medical
knowledge and social inequities in health, and test models of anthropological
theory on the relationships between anxiety and the pursuit of knowledge on the
one hand, authority and the distribution of knowledge on the other, and the
overarching relationship between the two, that is between person and society.
The PI will also engage in a number of educational and outreach activities
including giving talks on doctor-patient relationships and cultural sensitivity.
This award is supported through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of
the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific
and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement
of women in academic science and engineering careers.
