This research is directed towards the fundamental bioengineering problem of
utilization of ultrasound to differentiate between normal and abnormal tissue.
The Principle Investigator will compose a new algorithm for interpretation of
the signals received by ultrasound transducers. The basic concept is to employ a
pattern recognition algorithm which can use a more extensive diagnosis of the
ultrasound signal including the time and frequency domains. Success of such an
analysis could preclude the necessity of biopsy examination for classification
of tissue abnormality.
