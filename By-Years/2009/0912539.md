This SBIR Phase I research proposed is to develop a new technique for detecting
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) without contact with the patient. The proposal
will explore the use of Doppler radar technology to provide respiratory
movement, heart rate, and activity level that could be used in a Type III Home
Sleep Devise (HST) device. With the use of a commercially available wireless
pulse oximeter and a wireless airflow sensor, there is potential to build a
fully non-intrusive, portable, Type III HST device that could be easily deployed
at home and in the field. This research effort involves developing and testing
of a robust Doppler radar system for sleep monitoring. The two main objectives
of the project are to develop 5.8 GHz Doppler radar hardware that will provide
an accurate measure of physiological motion and to develop new methods for
detecting OSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sleep is widely understood to play a key
role in physical and mental health. Yet research indicates that 40 million
Americans suffer from insomnia and chronic sleep disorders, with over 12 million
Americans suffering from OSA. Serious consequences including increased mortality
can result from untreated sleep disorders. The scarcity of sleep clinics and the
expense associated with standard PolySomonoGraphy (PSG) techniques allows
treatments of only small numbers of OSA cases. Thus the vast majority of OSA
cases remain undiagnosed and untreated, despite the fact that this serious
disorder can have significant consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
