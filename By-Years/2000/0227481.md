This project will utilize data obtained from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO)
satellites, in particular the DMSP satellites, as well as electric field data
obtained from the SuperDARN radars to infer a number of features of the
magnetosphere. The goal is to create hemispheric views of plasma regimes, the
location of convection reversals and field aligned current structures. By
utilizing data obtained simultaneously from satellites and SuperDARN it will be
possible to study these features in a boundary-oriented fashion that will
clarify their interrelationship. Quantitative values of the average energy and
precipitating energy flux will be given for each region for both electrons and
ions. Quantitative maps will be generated for the regions and the new maps will
separately catalog the open and closed portions of the Low Latitude Boundary
Layer (LLBL). The maps will include the plasma boundaries, the nature of the
precipitating fluxes, the field aligned currents and the convection reversal
boundaries.
