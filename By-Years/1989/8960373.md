This is an SBIR Phase I award to explore the feasibility of designing and
constructing a multilayer mirror based monochromator to produce monochromatic
sources of hard x-rays for dual-energy digital subtraction augiography. The
research will culminate in the construction of a broad bandwidth hard x- ray
monochromator for dual-energy synchrotron radiation angiography. This technique
currently offers the most promising means for low risk non invasive screening
for coronary artery disease. The proposed concept has therefore a high potential
for commercial applications.
