9629976 Manga This grant provides $39,960 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring computational equipment for use in departmental research including
geophysical fluid dynamics, high pressure mineral physics and hydrology at the
University of Oregon. Specifically, the equipment will include a dual- processor
Silicon Graphics server with 256 Mb of RAM and a 2 Gb hard disk, two Indigo2
workstations each with 64 Mb RAM and 2 Gb hard disks and additional mass storage
equipment and peripherals. Specific research topics that will utilize the
capabilities of the computational equipment will include studies of two-phase
flow of immiscible fluids in porous and fractured rocks, hydrological models of
snowmelt/discharge relationships at high elevation, models of mantle convection,
modeling the thermophysical properties of geological materials in laser-heated
diamond anvil cells and rheological models of gas bubbles in magma chambers and
erupted lavas. ***
