This is a US-Polish collaborative research project that will support the
participation of Polish researchers in the PP2PP experiment at RHIC. The
principal investigator is Dr. Michael Rijssenbeek from SUNY at Stony Brook. His
Polish collaborators are Professor Andrzej Sandacz from the Institute for
Nuclear Studies in Warsaw and Drs. Janusz Chwastowski and Bogdan Pawlik from the
Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SUNY Stony
Brook group has been responsible for PP2PP simulations. This activity will now
be taken over by the Polish group. In order for this to happen this project will
provide support for the necessary consulting and transfer of software
responsibilities. This project will also facilitate and integrate collaborative
research in preparation of the data run, during data-taking, and in the data
analysis phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in nuclear physics research
fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S.
and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
