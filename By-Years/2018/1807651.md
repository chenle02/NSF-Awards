With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry
Division is funding Dr. Jessica R. Kramer from The University of Utah to develop
chemical tools to study the carbohydrates on cell surfaces, collectively termed
the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx influences diverse biological events, but remains
challenging to study due to a lack of tools to analyze and manipulate the
carbohydrates. This award funds development of new chemical methods to make the
components of the glycocalyx and display them on live cells. These methods have
broad implications for investigating interactions at the cell-surface from
cellular communication to nutrient absorption, fertilization, and immunity. This
pursuit allows undergraduate and graduate students to acquire specialized
training in carbohydrate chemistry, polymer science, and cell biology. This
project also integrates into several outreach programs that support high school
education and female undergraduate and graduate students in the pursuit of STEM
careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project undertakes development of a
method to engineer the glycocalyx by fusing natural and synthesized protein
domains on live cells. The glycocalyx is involved in nearly all aspects of
biology, yet remains challenging to study due to a lack of tools to analyze and
manipulate protein glycoforms. Mucin 1 is a major protein component of the
glycocalyx. Mucin 1 mimic polypeptides with precise glycosylation patterns are
chemically synthesized by polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides. The
polypeptides are biorthogonally conjugated to an engineered truncated mucin 1
protein expressed on live cell surfaces, which allows the study of biological
effects of specific glycoforms. This study provides new chemical tools and
methods to interrogate the glycocalyx and probe glycan-dependent
signaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
