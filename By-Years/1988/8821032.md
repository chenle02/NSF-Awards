Professor Chupka's research, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program, uses multiple laser techniques to excite, probe, and ionize isolated
gas phase molecules. Information is obtained on the electronic spectroscopy,
excited-state dynamics, and ionization mechanisms for diatomic and simple
polyatomic molecules. The basic information obtained is useful for understanding
and predicting the dynamics and the interactions of many important systems from
discharges and laser media to the atmosphere. Particular attention will be given
to the study of resonant multiphoton ionization, with emphasis on the ionization
step as a new and versatile way of studying shape and core-excited resonances
within an ionization continuum. Other studies will include high resolution
optical spectroscopy of small molecules, photoelectron spectroscopy of excited
and transient molecular species, electronic and vibrational autoionization
phenomena, dynamics of dissociation and predissociation, and the interaction of
competing ionization and dissociation channels in excited molecules.
