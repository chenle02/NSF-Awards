The proposed research involves several projects. The first is to study QCD at
nonzero temperature and chemical potential. This will be done by a combination
of numerical and analytical approaches. Our methods will be used to test the
Random Matrix Model used in three-color QCD. If the tests succeed, then the
Random Matrix Model will be used to study QCD in the arena relevant to both
neutron stars as well as in RHIC experiments. The proposal also addresses how to
reformulate QCD in a way that will allow low mass pions and small quark masses.
The approach will be to add irrelevant operator four fermi terms to make the
chiral limit nonsingular. We propose to study the fluctuating loop picture of
high-T superconductors by simulations of QED3. We propose also to investigate
the possibility of developing algorithms for a quantum computer that will allow
a better simulation of a quantum field theory.
