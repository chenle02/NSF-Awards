MRI: Acquisition of a Parallel Computing Facility for Computational Engineering

This is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training across a
range of computational engineering activities including computational mechanics,
computational heat transfer, computational materials science, computational
bioengineering, computational environmental engineering, computational
mathematics, and computer science, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary
projects. For example, work on shared memory in a network of processors has led
to techniques which can be tested in a production environment in applications in
large-scale turbulence control analyses and in molecular simulations of
nanostructures.
