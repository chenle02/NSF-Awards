*** 9760219 Jue This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
addresses novel pressure sensors for deep sea applications. State-of-the-art
pressure sensors are either (1) piezoresistive, (2) capacitive, or (3)
piezoelectric. The first two classes require an energy source for signal
generation, and piezo-type sensors require temperature compensation. Further,
the signal usually is linear over only a narrow range. The new pressure sensor
does not require an energy source, the signal is linear over a large pressure
range, and it is temperature independent. Although deep sea application is
targeted here, a slight modification of the sensor can extend the operating
temperature range up to 700(C. These pressure sensors will be fabricated with
and without an amplifier. The sensor response will be characterized over a wide
pressure and temperature range. Feasibility of microfabrication and integration
using photomicrolithography will be explored. Direct mount pressure sensors for
monitoring marine life is an objective of this research. Potential commercial
applications of the novel pressure sensors include pressure sensors for : (1)
monitoring life in deep sea, (2) oil well logging, (3) aerospace industry, (4)
automotive manufacture, (5) pressure vessels, (6) chemical industry, and (7)
general industrial use. ***
