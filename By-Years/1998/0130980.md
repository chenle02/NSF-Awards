With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
Irvine will acquire a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph-Electrospray
Ionization Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas including a) the separation and analysis of diastereomeric
polysiliconates and the evaluation of affinity supports for the separation of
oligonucleotides and small peptides (Shea); b) the synthesis of beta-sheet
mimics for protein recognition and function research (Nowick); c) novel
strategies and mechanistic studies for natural product synthesis (Overman); d)
the synthesis of highly oxygenated macrolide natural products with potential
cytotoxic and anti-fungal applications (Rychnovsky); and e) the synthesis of
dityrosine and ditryptophan crosslinked peptides as protein structure probes
(Van Vranken). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass
spectrometric detection (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
separation and analysis of complex mixtures. The research that this instrument
will enable will have a significant impact in the areas of biochemistry and
pharmaceutical chemistry, among others.
