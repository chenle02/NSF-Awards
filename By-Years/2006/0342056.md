The Colleges of Engineering and Education at North Dakota State University,
together with four North Dakota Tribal Colleges, partner to design a program
that bridges the pathways to engineering careers for American Indian students in
the Tribal Colleges and in high schools. Five workshops for the partner faculty
include presentations by nationally known figures and discussion on authentic
assessment, science and engineering pedagogy, cultural integration in education,
best evaluation practices, and proposal development. At a summer camp, faculty
engage in free exchange of ideas while designing items for evaluation. The items
are experiential activities for middle and high school students to work on
during four Sunday Academies. They include lesson materials, assessment
strategies, demonstrations and opportunities for additional studies. The long-
term goal is to develop proposals to continue the collaboration to provide
opportunities to attract and retain American Indian students in STEM
disciplines.
