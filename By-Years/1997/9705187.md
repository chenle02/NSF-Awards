9705187 Golden This project aims to improve understanding of fundamental
properties of CVD-grown diamond films on refractory metal microtips, including
the mechanism for negative electron affinity and the effects of surface
passivation. The approach is to study the photoelectric threshold of CVD diamond
films with and without adsorbates such as Cs and Ti, Mo and other refractory
metal microtips, and refractory metal microtips that have been carburized and
had thin diamond coatings applied. Techniques to be used in the study include
atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,. ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning
electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. %%% The project
addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having
technological relevance to electronics and photonics. The research will
contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to provide a
basis for incorporating diamond films into devices such as large area displays.
An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
through the training of students in a research area with strong technological
relevance. ***
