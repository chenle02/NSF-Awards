This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Missouri at St. Louis to acquire a high
resolution mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas that include the following: (1) studies on organometallic species used
as polymerization catalysts, (2) synthesis and reactions of metallaborane
complexes, (3) organic synthesis and development of synthetic methods, (4)
natural product isolation and reactions, (5) the analysis of unstable organic
oxidation products in simulated environments, and study of self-assembled
monolayers derived from modified cyclodextrins. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS
to proteins and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique.
The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides
the latest techniques available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one
of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of compounds. The
acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the
prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
