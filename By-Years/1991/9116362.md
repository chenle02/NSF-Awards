Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of atomistic
processes and structure in semiconductors and their surfaces will be conducted.
The atomistics of dislocation motion in semiconductors will be studied using
real-time atomic resolution transmission electron microscope video recordings of
dislocation kink motion. The research aims to understand the correlation between
kink motions on different moving partial dislocations, the nature of obstacles
to kink motion, and their density and waiting times. Also, the early stages of
the growth of SiGe alloys on silicon will be studied by ultrahigh vacuum
transmission electron diffraction. The research seeks to determine the atomic
coordinates for low coverage Ge on Si(111) surface structures, and in comparing
the results with scanning tunneling microscope(STM) work. %%% This research is
expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of atomic interactions and
their relationship to defects, defect motion, and early stages of epitaxial
crystal growth. From an application point of view, understanding these
properties is helpful to semiconductor device design and fabrication. The
results will be of importance in a general way to the technology of large scale,
high speed integrated electronic circuits.
