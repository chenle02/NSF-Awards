CTS - 9617405 Sohail Murad University of Illinois Chicago ABSTRACT The project
is an exploratory investigation of electro-osmosis in non-ionic and ionic
solutions using computer simulation. The primary objective of the research is to
use molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations to study electro-osmosis at
the molecular level. Recently developed atomistic models will be employed in the
simulation to describe a wide range of membrane pore size distribution. The
project may lead to an understanding of the factors that control electro-
osmosis. It will resolve the question of whether electro-osmosis occurs in non-
ionic solutions. The results will be relevant to improving the separation
efficiency of membrane-based processes.
