ABSTRACT

The problems that are to be addressed in this project involve, on one hand,
dynamics of flows on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups, and, on the other hand,
the multi-dimensional theory of Diophantine approximations. Various connections
between these two fields have been found in the last two decades, which
significantly stimulated progress in both fields. During recent years, the
proposer's research has been centered on developing new links between
homogeneous dynamics and number theory, which has resulted in solving many
important problems, as well as in creating new directions for further research.
The investigator is to continue his work on bounded trajectories, growth rate of
orbits, Diophantine approximation with weights and Khintchine-type theorems on
manifolds.

This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their applications to
number theory. Many problems concerning simultaneous approximation of real
numbers by rational numbers can be cast in terms of the behavior of certain
orbits. Dynamical systems in the present context deal with how points in a
system move over time, given a set of differential equations (or laws of nature)
governing the system. It turns out that various numerical approximations used in
the theory of integer equations can be better calculated once they are phrased
in dynamical systems language.
