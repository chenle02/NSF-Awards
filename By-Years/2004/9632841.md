9632841 CONVERSI This project is part of the U.S. GLOBEC Nortwest Atlantic Field
Studies, Phase 2 program. The project focuses on intercomparisons of interannual
patterns in zooplankton and phytoplankton species, in relation to climatic
changes. The specific objectives of this project are: 1) to study the decadal
changes in the abundance of the dominant, pan-Atlantic copepod species (Calanus
finmarchicus, Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages typicus, Centropages hamatus,
Metridia lucens, Acartia clausi and Temora longicornis) in the northeastern U.S.
shelf (including Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank); 2) to compare zooplankton
variability in the western and eastern Atlantic (area around the British Isles,
including the North Sea); and 3) to relate the information from across-Atlantic
comparisons to decadal changes in climate variables. ***
