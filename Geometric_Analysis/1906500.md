A Ricci flow is a geometric process that may be used to improve a given geometry
towards a more homogeneous one. Ricci flows have become the subject of intensive
study, as they have been used to prove various long-standing conjectures, such
as the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures in dimension 3. The general
expectation is that a Ricci flow produces a geometry in the limit that is in
some sense inherent to the topology, i.e. the loose makeup, of the underlying
space. However, usually a Ricci flow develops complicated singularities in
finite time. In dimension 3 these singularities can be removed manually by so
called surgeries and the flow can be continued beyond them. Recently, a new
class of "singular Ricci flows" was introduced in dimension 3. These flows flow
"automatically through singularities at an infinitesimal scale", thereby
eliminating the somewhat unnatural surgery process. The goal of this project is
to understand these flows further and to use this understanding to study the
topology of certain spaces of metrics and diffeomorphism groups. In addition,
the PI will work on Ricci flows in higher dimensions, aimed at understanding
their singularity formation, which may result in a similar surgery or singular
flow construction.

The research project is split into two projects. The first project is a
continuation of the PI's work (in collaboration with Bruce Kleiner) on the
uniqueness and continuity of singular Ricci flows through singularities. The
general goal of this project is to understand the geometric, topological and
analytic applications of this work. Among other things, the PI has a strategy to
resolve the Generalized Smale Conjecture, which would extend a previous partial
resolution by the PI and Kleiner. Further potential applications concern the
topology and geometry of the space of positive scalar curvature metrics, as well
as the study of generic Ricci flows in dimension 3. The second project is a
continuation of the PI's work on the study of Ricci flows with bounded scalar
curvature. The PI will investigate several conjectures that have been verified
under the assumption of bounded scalar curvature. These conjectures are likely
to remain true if this assumption is removed.
