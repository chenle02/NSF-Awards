Nelson

DMS: 0404763

PI: Eric Carlen)

Inst: Georgia Tech



A conference on the above theme will take place June 17-20 at the Pacific
Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Alberta). The first two days will have
several goals, with the latter two days devoted to workshop-like opportunities
for further interaction among the participants. The funding from NSF will
support travel grants for about 5 younger speakers, and travel support for a
similar number of postdoctoral students and graduate students. A proceedings
will be published, to further disseminate information.
