EAR-0345710&lt;br/&gt;Carlson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports
continued operation of the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray Computed
Tomography Facility (UTCT). UTCT provides geoscience investigators with
tomographic imaging and analysis services - the industrial equivalent of medical
CAT scanning, but using higher-energy X-rays, higher-resolution detectors, and
longer dosage times. Three-dimensional tomographic imagery of the interiors and
exteriors of rocks, fossils, meteorites and other materials allows both
qualitative and quantitative characterization of these objects, producing unique
opportunities for their visualization and measurement. These results will
continue to drive scientific advances across the full spectrum of the earth
sciences, including petrology, paleontology, structural geology, hydrology,
geophysics, meteoritics, and economic and petroleum geology. Applications in
biology, anthropology, and engineering are also actively supported by UTCT. Each
year the facility will support the research efforts of scores of investigators
from across the nation, including both students and established scientists from
academic, industrial, and governmental institutions. At the same time, UTCT will
maintain state-of-the-art capabilities and continue developing new means and
methods to optimize and exploit CT imagery for scientific research. It will
carry on in its role as a research crossroads, where interaction, collaboration,
and intellectual cross-fertilization are fostered among investigators working on
diverse problems that share mutual solutions. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
