The proposed study is intended to examine the planetary- scale aspects of the
solar-QBO (quasi-biannual oscillation) effects, continuing the more general work
reported earlier. Specifically, this study will attempt to provide evidence for
a driver mechanism, in which planetary scale waves act as a "carrier" or
"amplifier" of the QBO signal. Suitable indices of planetary wave activity will
be used to explore the relationships between solar, tropospheric, and QBO
variations. It is expected that if planetary waves are the prime agents of a
sun-weather mechanism, they may provide a better diagnostic of the mechanism
than the use of a composite solar flux-QBO index, which has provided much of the
information up to date.***//
