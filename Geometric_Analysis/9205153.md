The principal investigator will study several weak formulations of the motion
of a singular surface by its mean curvature. Such motion arises in the theory of
phase transitions. The work is part of an ongoing project to reconcile the
various mathematical models for the motion of phase boundaries. The principal
investigator will study the existence of unit density flows, the convergence of
systems of phase-field equations, and the existence and properties of self-
similar solutions. This award will support research in the general area of
differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of
the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined
on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
