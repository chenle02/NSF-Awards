This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a theodolite, electronic
distance measurer and ancillary equipment to be used in detailed and very
accurate local mapping of faults and other near-surface manifestations of active
tectonic movement. The field equipment is to be used by the neotectonics
research group in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of
Oregon. The University of Oregon is committed to providing the remaining funds
needed. Reconstruction of fault movements and other crustal deformation over the
recent geological past is an important component of research leading to
earthquake prediction.
