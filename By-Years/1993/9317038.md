9317038 Tullis The PIs will perform experiments to determine the physical
processes responsible for the frictional behavior observed in the laboratory.
The experiments will measure frictional behavior with and without the presence
of fault gouge and develop process-based constitutive laws. Such laws are
required for extrapolation from the laboratory to the Earth because of the large
differences in time and length scales. ****
