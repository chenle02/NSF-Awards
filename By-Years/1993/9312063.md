9312063 Tripathy A focussed program of scientific research into the molecular
-level engineering of a novel class of nonlinear optical polymers will be
carried out. The major new direction of this research is into multicomponent
interpenetrating polymer networks as a new approach to thermostable second-
order nonlinear optical polymers. In addition to addressing fundamental question
about solid-state reactions in electric- field-induced ordered reactant media
and stability of the poled order in crosslinked interpenetrating networks,
technologically relevant materials synthesis, processing, and fabrication will
be carried out in this important area. ***
