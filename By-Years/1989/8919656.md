This proposal is for a conference in the area of general relativity. The
organizers view this as a chance to bring researchers in classical relativity,
astrophysics and quantum gravity together to discuss common problems. In recent
years there has been a bridging of the gap between these disciplines and cross
discussion is clearly warranted. For the first time results from mathematical
relativity are being used in other more familiar branches of physics. These
include pulsars, nuclear matter, and gravitational radiation. In the micro
domain, the interface between general relativity and high energy physics is an
active area of research. Cosmology, quantum gravity, "worm hole" physics etc.
have benefitted from ideas originating in mathematical relativity. Similarly,
relativity has benefitted from activities in QCD. These developments clearly
show the unity of many areas of physics and the need for conferences encouraging
cross fertilization. Finally, the organizers wish to use the occasion of the
conference to honor Professor E. T. Newman of the University of Pittsburgh, the
current President of the 60th International Society for General Relativity, on
his birthday.
