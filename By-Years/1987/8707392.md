An accurate and efficient method for the three-dimensional analysis of cracks
in elastic solids is applied to the study of quasi-statically advancing slip
zones in the earth's crust. Calculations are done to determine stresses and
surface deformations due to the advance of shear faults into and around locked,
or more resistant, portions of the shallow crust. Of particular interest are
conditions for which non-uniformities in the advancing front are unstable, in
the sense that they give rise to rapid spontaneous propagation of slip, and
conditions that may distinguish small from large earthquakes. These calculations
also make it possible to relate measurements of surface deformation to increases
in seismicity that may be triggered by the elevation of stresses that
accompanies slip zone advance. Other effects considered are the possibility of
breakout at the free surface and the coupling of normal and shear stress due to
the presence of the free surface. Initial studies will be for strike-slip
geometries for possible application to the Parkfield region of southern
California, but the versatility of the method allows study of thrust-faults, as
well.
