The proposed research will focus on the theory and application of singular
potentials and their relationship to quantum field theory. Particular emphasis
will be given to those systems exhibiting asymptotic ultraviolet conformal
invariance. The conformal anomaly will be analyzed in quantum mechanics problems
that have applications in molecular physics such as the anisotropic inverse
square potential. Path integral methods will be used to study this problem as
well as a whole family of conformally invariant interactions. A second project
will be to compare two methods of analyzing conformally invariant problems, one
being a renormalization group analysis and the other being the method of self-
adjoint extensions. The third project is to understand whether black hole
thermodynamics can be understood in terms of the near-horizon conformal symmetry
of a scalar field. The fourth project is to understand the role of singular
potentials in dimensional reduction schemes where the low energy physics is
confined to a brane but gravity propagates in one extra dimension.
