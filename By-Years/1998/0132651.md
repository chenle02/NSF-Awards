The foci of this research are three-fold. First , a novel [4+2]-cycloaddition
-rearrangement sequence will be used to set the ABCE cyclic core of the
aspidosperma alkaloid skeleton. Second, a tandem thionium/N-acyliminium ion
cyclization strategy will be used to afford the pyrrolo[2,3-d]carbazole ring
framework found in deethylibophyllidene. Third, the transition metal mediated
cyclization of acetylenic diazoketoamides will be studied as a route to the
synthesis of a number of alkaloids including
strychnine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr.
Albert Padwa of the Department of Chemistry at Emory University. Professor Padwa
will focus his work on the development of tandem, or cascade, methods for the
formation of several carbon-carbon bonds and/or rings systems in a single
operation. Using combinations of cationic, anionic, radical, carbenoid or
pericyclic processes will lead to the preparation of structurally diverse
synthetic targets possessing interesting biological properties. The research has
broader impact for the training of graduate students and for the development of
methodology pertinent to the pharmaceutical industry.
