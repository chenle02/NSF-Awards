The Unidata Program Center is conducting a four day workshop entitled "Data-
driven Geoscience: Applications, Opportunities, Trends, and Challenges." The
workshop will convene on June 22-25, 2015. The workshop will raise awareness of
technological advances in the geoscience academic community, atmospheric and
related sciences, by giving participants opportunities to share hands-on
activities, course materials, and ideas for improving research and education.
This will be done through a series of presentations, hands-on lab sessions,
poster sessions and panel discussions led by geoscientists and experts in
geoscience cybersinfrastructure.
