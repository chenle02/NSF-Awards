Abstract 9316756 We propose to build upon the progress we have made in this
system towards understanding how the circadian clock effects changes in the
transcription of the Arabidopsis cab2 gene. In particular, we wish to further
characterize a 78bp DNA fragment that we have shown to be able to confer
circadian regulation upon heterologous promoters. We wish to dissect at the
nucleotide level the precise genomic targets for the signal transduction
pathways that emanate from the circadian clock and phytochrome. These studies
will be greatly enhanced by using a cab2-luciferase gene fusion that provides a
bioluminescent marker for monitoring cab2 transcription in living transgenic
seedlings. Furthermore, we have identified three specific DNA binding activities
that recognize conserved targets within the cab2 5'upstream region. We propose a
detailed characterization of these proteins that will define their contribution
to regulated transcription and will ultimately result in cloning the genes that
encode these factors. This will provide a first step from the genomic targets
towards the signal transduction components that regulate cab2 transcription. %%%
This proposal describes experiments that address a central question in biology:
What is the mechanism of action of the circadian clock? Given the ubiquitous
presence of circadian-regulated processes, advances in one particular system
should have broad impact. We have chosen higher plants as our model system, and
we will focus our studies in Arabidopsis thaliana. ***
