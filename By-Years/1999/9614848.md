9614848 Kenkre Ongoing developments in xerography and in electroluminiscent
display devices require a detailed understanding of charge transport in
molecularly doped solids. This grant, part of a collaboration between two groups
at the University of New Mexico and at the University of Missouri-Rolla is to
support research on this subject. The primary issues, to be addressed are the
effects of disorder and high electric fields on carrier motion in polymeric
films. The specific projects include, inter alia, the identification of the
charge carriers, study of the field induced traps, determination of the time and
length scales for the equilibration of carriers following photoexcitation and
several other issues necessary to clarify the physical mechanism behind the
phenomena. %%% Xerography and electroluminescent display devices use doped
molecular solids (for example polymer films). The basic physical phenomena
involving photoconduction, i. e. charging and currents following absorption of
light, contains several unanswered questions. This grant is to support
theoretical work to elucidate the fundamental processes which account for the
phenomena, and possibly to help design materials which are better
photoconductors. The grant is being awarded to two groups, one at the University
of New Mexico and another at the University of Missouri- Rolla for a
collaborative enterprise.
