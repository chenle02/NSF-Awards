The aim of the research is to address the nature of sub-Tg relaxations in some
high-temperature glassy polymers. The relaxation behaviors of polycarbonates and
other rigid aromatic backbone glassy polymers will be investigated. The low-
temperature relaxation of bisphenol-A polycarbonate has an extensive in-chain
cooperative character. This cooperative motion is thought to be the key to
polycarbonate's superior mechanical properties. The origin of this in-chain
cooperativity and the relaxation behavior of other kinds of glassy polymers can
be better understood by using tailored molecular architectures together with
dynamic mechanical measurements. Once the origin of cooperative motion is
understood, an important question will be answered: How does the scale of this
cooperative motion affect intermolecular interactions? Dynamic bulk relaxation
experiments will be used to address this question. Another question to be
answered in the proposed research deals with how the scale of cooperative motion
affects the mechanical properties of the polymer in terms of ductility and
brittleness. Through this research, the relationships between molecular
structure, relaxation and mechanical properties will be further clarified and
the results can be used as guidelines to design and synthesize new high-
temperature ductile polymers with desirable properties.
