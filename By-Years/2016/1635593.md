The Natural Hazards Center (NHC) at the University of Colorado Boulder is a
national and increasingly global clearinghouse that collects and disseminates
research findings and other information on the societal dimensions of hazards,
disasters, and risk. Through this project, the NHC will both facilitate and
directly contribute to the transfer and development of knowledge on hazards and
disasters. It will train a variety of students, including those who are under-
represented in disciplines that address hazard mitigation. It will work with
hazard risk reduction professionals and agencies to foster opportunities for
collaboration and cooperation within and across academia, government and other
sectors. Additionally, it will continue to collaborate with and to contribute to
the missions of a variety of professional associations, agencies, and other
entities to further contribute to the development of the multi- and inter-
disciplinary hazards research and practice community and to identify evidence-
based strategies for enhancing societal resilience in the face of
disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute in a variety of
ways to discipline-based and interdisciplinary knowledge on multidisciplinary
aspects of hazards and disasters. There is an ongoing need for research and
information exchange on topics such as disaster vulnerability and resilience,
risk perception and judgments concerning acceptable risk, and sustainable
strategies for mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
extreme events of all types. This project will disseminate information on
extreme events and their management to diverse groups, including researchers and
students in hazard-related disciplines, both in the U. S. and around the world,
including hazard risk reduction practitioners; policy makers and agency
personnel; private-sector organizations concerned with reducing losses from
extreme events; and other audiences. Those activities will include producing two
newsletters (the Natural Hazards Observer, published six times a year, and DR,
published every two weeks); hosting DisasterGrads, a listserv for graduate
students and other users; maintaining the NHC Web site, a key information
portal; communicating through social media; co-editing the American Society of
Civil Engineers journal, the Natural Hazards Review; organizing and hosting
three annual workshops that engage researchers, students, practitioners, and
decision makers; providing library and information services; sponsoring quick
response research; and communicating with the media and the general public to
increase public understanding of the science base for disaster risk reduction.
