The objective of this project is the pursuit of a mathematically rigorous
understanding of emerging nonlinear phenomena in physical and technological
applications, ranging from the analysis of instabilities in materials science to
image analysis in computer vision. The project will provide research training
opportunities to the next generation of leaders in applied analysis cognizant of
contemporary mathematical areas that underscore interdisciplinary challenges at
the interface of mathematical sciences with computer science, engineering, and
physical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two main themes of this project are
Variational Problems for Materials and Variational Problems for Imaging. What
unifies these topics is that underlying energies involve higher order
derivatives in spaces with discontinuous admissible fields, multiple scales
interact, bulk and surface energies compete, and degeneracy of usually expected
properties prevail. These prevent the use of well understood mathematical
theories and require the introduction of innovative mathematical tools. The
project will provide a mathematical foundation for the understanding of aspects
of materials, including materials defects (dislocations), epitaxy, micromagnetic
and magnetoelastic materials, and composite materials (homogenization).
Analytical tools combined with contemporary multilevel learning schemes (machine
learning) will be used in imaging to address denoising of images and edge
detection, recolorization, image segmentation and
registration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
