The path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue to
ensure content, devices, and intellectual property being used by authorized
users for legitimate purposes, and to be able to forensically prove with high
confidence when otherwise. When information goes through various devices and
processing, there are inherent traces left from each processing step. These
traces serve as intrinsic fingerprints and are essential for forensic analysis.
This research involves developing a joint forensic and anti-forensic framework
to leverage the universal intrinsic fingerprints to gather traces of evidence to
answer who has done what, when, where, and how. The main thrusts of this
research include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Investigation of the strategy space
and adversarial dynamics on a broad range of forensic problems associated with
content, device and emerging sensing paradigm;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2)
Development of a theoretical foundation to understand the fundamental
performance limit and establish formal notions of forensicability in an
information processing chain; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Development of an
Information Forensic and Anti-Forensic Engine along with a benchmark set and an
online portal for integrated research, education, and
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research establishes a comprehensive
foundation for the field of trustworthy information forensics, with a broad
range of important applications tackled from a new angle of thinking. The
research program seamlessly integrates with the education and outreach program
through the establishment of the Forensic Engine and the collaboration with law
and policy professionals. Through establishing trust and provenance in digital
domain, closely involving and training students, collaboration in the research
community, and partnership with law professionals and industry, this research
contributes to law enforcement and national security as well as promotes the
emerging science of trustworthy forensics to a broad audience.
