Highly-correlated f-electron metals, especially those that show heavy Fermion
behavior, will form the main thrust of this project. Emphasis will be on how the
coupling of the f-electron atom to its environment affects optical properties
and light scattering. When Raman-active modes are found whose intensity, as with
URu2Si2, increases upon the gradual onset of the heavy- Fermion state, a
magnetic field will be used to suppress the onset and the effect in the spectra
will be observed. Waves in magnetically-ordered states and magnetic excitations
will be studied. The strong electronic Gruneisen effect will be exploited by
measuring Raman spectra under pressure. The Raman results will be correlated
with known elastic constant results and new ones to be obtained using Brillouin
scattering. Raman and optical-property measurements will be made on the new high
Tc superconductors. Emphasis will be placed on the effects of surface treatment,
especially control of oxygen content on the spectra. The role of structural
distortions will be elucidated by Raman Brillouin scattering measurements.
Correlations will be made with superconducting and structural measurements made
by collaborators.
