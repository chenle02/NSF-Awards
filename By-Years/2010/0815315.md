Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing declines and mass
mortalities at an unprecedented rate. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a
primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species
occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how
individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and
laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this
emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and
demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal
focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality
is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian
populations worldwide.

This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape
adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute
to the response to novel disease threats. This research will quantify the
molecular effects of this disease in ?real-time?, in addition to the genetic
determinants of survivorship, resulting in useful epidemiological predictions
for other populations or species that have yet to be exposed to the disease.
