9352693 Simmons This project will support an emerging interdisciplinary Center
for Scientific Visualization (CSV) currently being built upon existing expertise
and resources of the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science,
Manufacturing Engineering and Art. The Scientific Visualization Laboratory will
also serve the Undergraduate programs in Water Resources Management, Physics,
Chemistry, Biology, and eventually, the social sciences. An advisory council
with members from organizations such as IBM, MIT and Carnegie Mellon University
has been assembled to provide guidance for the development. The primary
objectives of the CSV Laboratory are as follows: 1) support undergraduate
courses requiring advanced computer graphics, image processing and visualization
techniques; 2) provide an environment for multiple disciplines to work together
as science teams; 3) conduct undergraduate and faculty research projects
requiring advanced visualization techniques; 4) serve as a testbed to develop
new visualization mechanisms to aid in teaching difficult mathematical,
scientific and engineering concepts. ***
