Determining how detailed risk analysis models should be is an important
question in analyzing the risks of complex technological systems such as nuclear
power plants, liquid natural gas storage facilities, hazardous material
transport, and the space shuttle. Both overly detailed and overly simplistic
models can lead to erroneous risk estimates. However, this issue has gone
virtually unstudied despite the widespread growth of risk analysis in the last
15 years. Past work by one of the investigators on this project has identified
three potential sources of error in risk analyses: modeling error; parameter
error; and aggregation error. Different types of errors are minimized by simple
versus detailed models. In particular, in the case of aggregation error, the use
of overly simple models can neglect information that may be available at more
detailed levels. For example, at the time of the Challenger disaster, an
aggregate analysis based only on 0 accidents in 23 flights would have indicated
increasing reliability with each flight. However, a disaggregate analysis
including the evidence of O-ring erosion on 6 of the 23 flights would have
concluded that a substantial level of risk remained. The principal investigators
for this project have identified necessary and sufficient conditions for
aggregation error to vanish in simple risk analysis models. However, these
conditions are unlikely to be achieved in practice. Therefore, there is a need
to understand the determinants of aggregation error when perfect aggregation is
not achieved. The proposed work will provide guidance on the circumstances under
which aggregation error will be severe, so that large errors can be avoided
through the use of more detailed models in such cases.
