9400755 Andraka Technical abstract: This Condensed Matter Physics Project
investigates the physical properties of metallic materials known loosely as
heavy-Fermion systems. The major thrust deals with cerium and uranium compounds
and alloys which exhibit non-Fermi- liquid-like behavior at low temperatures.
These materials exhibit transport or thermodynamic properties that differ from
ordinary Fermi-liquid like metals such as copper. Other areas of research
include the cross-over from magnetic to nonmagnetic ground states, materials
with low carrier concentrations, effects of the crystal structure and crystal
disorder on the formation of heavy-Fermion states. A special emphasis is placed
on those physical systems which are derivatives of heavy-Fermion
superconductors. The experimental probes include heat capacity measurements at
zero and large magnetic fields, magnetic susceptibility and magnetization,
electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance as well as collaborative
experiments like neutron diffraction, NMR, Hall effect and thermopower. Non-
technical abstract: This Condensed Matter Physics Project investigates the
physical properties of metallic materials known loosely as heavy-Fermion
systems. In these materials the electrons act differently from those in
ordinary, or "Fermi-liquid-like" metals such as copper. Materials being studied
include cerium and uranium. Some of these materials and their alloys have
compositions which exhibit superconductivity which in some ways is reminiscent
of the high-temperature superconductors. The heat capacities, electrical
transport, response to magnetic fields of the materials will be determined. The
study is of fundamental interest, as well as technological interest in the
context of high- temperature superconductors. ***
