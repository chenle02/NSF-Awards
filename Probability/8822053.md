The investigator will study diffusion on fractals and diffusion in Euclidean
spaces. Problems in the area of diffusions on fractals include constructing
Brownian motions on fractals imbedded in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces,
estimating spectral dimension, estimating transition densities, and proving
uniqueness in law. Problems in the area of diffusions on Euclidean spaces
include proving uniqueness in law for diffusions with piecewise continuous
coefficients and investigating the corresponding Dirichlet problems. The
investigator is working on problems at the interface between probability,
mathematical physics (i.e. the physics of disordered material), and geometry. He
will construct Brownian motions (a probabilistic model for the displacement of a
particle) on fractals. One result from this construction will be the estimation
of the spectral dimension of the fractal, which the study of fractals has shown
often to be the important dimension in physics.
