The three-year project tackles the important problem of the difficulty of
conducting hands-on activities for 8th and 9th grade Earth Science classrooms.
The PIs take the approach of using tabletop models as analogs for the phenomena
the curriculum is trying to elucidate. The project investigates how students
apply insights gained from working with dynamic tabletop modules to
understanding and reasoning about processes of the full scale Earth system.

Working with 300 students and four teachers in New York City schools, the
researchers test three instructional strategies in terms of the usefulness and
pitfalls of each. The PIs develop written assessments using evidence-centered
design principles that examine students' understanding of model attributes,
model/Earth attribute correspondences, model relationships, model/Earth
relationship correspondences, and geoscience data/evidence.

The PIs collect student demographic data using t-tests and multiple regression
analysis. They also collect student demographic data and qualitative measures to
describe how the instructional strategies were enacted across classrooms and to
understnd the ways in which teachers should be supported to utilize these
strategies effectively.
