Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ubiquity of wireless connectivity and its
constant growth in application and scale necessitate extremely efficient usage
of spectrum as the main commodity in wireless industry. Highly regulated
spectrum access policies and growing demands for spectrum access have promoted
the notion of accommodating the needs of unlicensed services when the license-
holding ones under-utilize the spectrum. The goal of this proposed project is to
characterize the fundamental limits of spectrum sensing while recognizing the
system-level and physical-level limitations imposed by costs of information
acquisition, data traffic demands, and model uncertainties with sound guarantees
on agility, responsiveness, and adaptability to the geo-temporal spectral
occupancy variations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies at the crossroad of
wireless communication, sequential statistics, and stochastic optimization. It
aims to find the fundamental limits of spectrum sensing and delineates the
interplay among the performance guarantees on the decisions about spectral
activities, cost of sensing, communication delay tolerance, and the uncertainty
level about model dynamics. This leads to novel spectrum sensing procedures in
which an optimal balance among can be struck among different aspects based on
the operational needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has multiple technological and
societal impacts. It furnishes a baseline for assessing the competency of
different available spectrum sensing procedures within the same framework, and
also provides novel sensing procedures that yield performance levels that match
the theoretical fundamental limits. The theoretical models and concepts that are
developed in this project have the potential to impact adjacent research
domains, especially those involving experimental design and hypothesis testing
for high-dimensional data.
