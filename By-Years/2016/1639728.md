This proposal requests funding to assist 10 US-based graduate (Masters and early
Ph.D.) students for attending the 34-th edition of the IEEE VLSI Test Symposium
with the intention of exposing them to the discipline and to encourage them to
pursue careers in microelectronics. Participation in this symposium is
considered an important part of the graduate school experience of students in
the field of VLSI design, providing the opportunity to interact with senior
researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. The support
will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would
otherwise not have the experience. This student travel support will also
facilitate the development of promising graduate students, and will thus
indirectly also help train the workforce of the future in the important area of
microelectronics. Women and underrepresented groups will be given due
consideration for receiving support through this
grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) for
the past 33 years has been the premier academic forum where emerging trends and
novel concepts in testing, debug and repair of microelectronic circuits and
systems are explored. The 34-th edition of this symposium will be held in Las
Vegas, NV, and will addresses key trends and challenges in the semiconductor
design and manufacturing industries through a program that includes Keynote and
Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Embedded Tutorials, Panels, Hot Topic
Sessions, Half-day Tutorials, and the Innovative Practices Track. The conference
committee has set up an adequate evaluation criteria to select the qualified
students from a pool of applicants formed via open advertisement. The committee
also plans to consider a small number of undergraduate applicants in order to
better reach a diverse population of potential researchers in this field.
