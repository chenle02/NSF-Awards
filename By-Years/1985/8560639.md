The improved membranes developed recently for reverse osmosis are nitrogen-
containing polymers of the polyamide and polyurea class. Unfortunately these
kinds of polymers are damaged by the presence of halogens and systems now in use
require pretreatment removal steps adding to system complexity and cost. The
proposed research will attempt to establish the precise nature of the polymer
degradation by chlorine. Main reactions and side reactions will be identified by
determining stability of polymer functional groups toward various chlorine
species. This should lead directly to the development of halogen-resistant
polymers. It is also expected to learn more about optimizing the operating
conditions for the reverse-osmosis process.
