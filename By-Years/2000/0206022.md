The Louisville Science Center in collaboration with The Lincoln Foundation plans
to: (1) establish WYSci's continuance as part of the Whitney M. Young Scholars
Program, (2) extend the program to include 35 additional hours of instruction in
a week-long summer program, (3) expand opportunities to involve parents and
other caregivers, and (4) provide significant evaluation data. The evaluation
component would be used to determine the program's effect on participating
students and parents and to inform others as to what factors are important for
melding informal and formal science education. The program is designed to
positively affect the learning of young people in the seventh grade who are
academically talented, but socio-economically disadvantaged. Over the three-year
period, 150 students will receive over 50 hours of instruction by the staff.
