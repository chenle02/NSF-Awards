The proposal investigates, through development of an upper layer framework, the
feasibility of a high-level user environment for accessing grid services
resulting in a general tool for managing overall results. The system is called
the Grid Resource Interface manager (GRIM). The work's application area is in
distributed simulation. An initial framework will be designed and prototyped
with a GUI linking to underlying pre-existing grid services. The work will
produce an XML schema definition for data and configuration, a Java library
enabling data conversion in a GRIM environment, a client enabling database
queries, an admin GUI, a core framework for task submission, monitoring, data
parsing, and reporting, and a data storage abstraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
