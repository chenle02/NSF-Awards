This research is at the interface between probability and statistics. The
principal investigator will study the limit behavior of quadratic forms under
long-range dependence. She will also consider trimmed sums in the case of long-
range independence. The assumptions made in performing a statistical analysis
typically include the independence or weak dependence of the observations. This
is not always realistic. This research is concerned with the study of data
exhibiting long-range dependence.
