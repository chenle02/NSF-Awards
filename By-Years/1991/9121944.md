There is a clear need for the development of a dating technique that can
provide reliable chronologic control for sediments deposited in polar marine and
lacustrine environments during the late and middle Quaternary. This award
supports a series of fundamental investigations to ascertain the utility of the
emerging photoluminescence (PL) technique to date waterlain sediments. The
energy selective analysis of PL potentially could supply a widely applicable and
accurate geochronometer. Specifically, these experiments will test the accuracy
and precision of the PL technique to date lacustrine and near-shore marine
sediments from Spitsbergen, Svalbard. The sediments chosen for study are either
modern or radiocarbon dated sediments from exposures or cores that were
deposited during the last ca. 12 thousand years. These sediments are from a
variety of aqueous sedimentary environments and the proposed research should
provide coherent results to evaluate the promises and limitations of the PL
technique. This project represents one element of the PALE (Paleoclimates form
Arctic Lakes and Estuaries) activity.
