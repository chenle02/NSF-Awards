The practice of requiring students to carry out academic tasks during nonschool
hours is as old as formal schooling. Assessments of the value of homework,
however, have fluctuated over time with strong positive opinions prevailing at
the turn of this century and the early 1960's and negative opinions holding sway
in the 1930's and 1970's. Recently, in response to calls for higher standards of
excellence in American education, schools have begun to place increased emphasis
on homework as a means for improving student performance. Opinions of homework
and its utility have never been greatly influenced by empirical data on the
subject. This is due partly to a general lack of public information on what
research says about homework and partly to the seemingly contradictory findings
of studies. The purpose of this project is to locate, describe, summarize, and
integrate the empirical research concerning the effects of homework on numerous
student outcome variables. Outcomes will include all the dependent measures
employed in previous research, with special attention paid to academic
achievement, attitudes toward school, and study habits. The review will go
beyond previous reviews by (1) including the most recent research; (2) paying
the greatest attention to schooling, homework, and research method
characteristics that might mediate the effects of homework; (3) focusing on
homework effects on different subject matters, with special attention paid to
science and mathematics; and (4) employing quantitative synthesis techniques to
estimate the impact of homework and uncover any subtle homework effects.
