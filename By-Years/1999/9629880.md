The Julia Robinson Celebration of Women in Mathematics Project Abstract The 25th
anniversary of the Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM) will be celebrated
in 1996, culminating in a conference entitled the Julia Robinson Celebration of
Women in Mathematics. The goals of the celebration are: - to showcase the recent
achievements of women in mathematics; - to facilitate networking among women in
various fields of mathematics; - to provide role models and offer mentoring for
beginning women mathematicians; - outreach to area teachers and students. The
Celebration will be a 2 1/2 day conference to be held July 1-3, 1996, at the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California. The
goals will be accomplished by the following events: - 10-12 lectures by women in
pure and applied mathematics who are in various stages of their careers; -
workshops focussed on career issues for beginning mathematicians in both
academia and industry; - a Conversation on the topic of Women and Mathematics to
be held with area high school and junior high school teachers and students.
