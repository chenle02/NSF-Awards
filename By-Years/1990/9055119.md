The University of California, Berkeley, will renew a six-week, commuter Young
Scholars (EAI) project in Engineering as applied to Mathematics and Physics for
120 students entering grades 7-9. Students will be introduced to math, science
and engineering concepts in ways that will demonstrate to them how academic
coursework relates to the world around them, and how the practice of science in
accomplished. The summer program includes morning mathematics and English
courses, seminars in culture and ethics, afternoon pre-engineering projects, and
a "shadowing" program whereby students will meet with mentor scientists and
engineers. The academic-year program will include follow-up activities for
students in schools through MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement)
programs as well as a Saturday Academy at UC-Berkeley. The program will also
involve parents by helping them become informed and actively involved in the
education of their children.
