Exact steady solutions of the inviscid incompressible flow equations can be
constructed by superposing helical waves. Such flows have the Beltrami property
that the vorticity vector is everywhere parallel to the velocity vector.
Beltrami flows may have very complicated three-dimensional structures; in
particular, fluid particle trajectories may be chaotic and space- filling.
Chaotic particle motion is important in determining the effective eddy
diffusivity of a flow, and its small-scale mixing properties. Chaos is also
likely to influence concentration and coagulation in suspensions of particles
whose densities are different from the fluid. The amplification of magnetic
fields in electrically conducting fluids is yet another effect in which chaotic
flow play a major role. The PIs will study the chaos in a number of Beltrami
flows and explore its implications for these physical problems, how the chaotic
properties depend on the complexity of the flow. The numerical work will be
performed on a hypercube multiprocessor, which can follow the motion of a large
number of particles simultaneously.
