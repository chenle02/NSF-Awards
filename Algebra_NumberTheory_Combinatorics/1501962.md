The project's central focus is on several interrelated problems on the borders
of combinatorics and probability. The questions raised spill over into other
areas, such as classical asymptotic enumeration, algebraic topology, and
probability proper. One major theme of the project is the effort to understand
the "threshold" intensities at which various properties of interest appear in
(large) discrete random systems. This is a classical area (going back to the
beginnings, roughly 60 years ago, of studies of random graphs on the
combinatorial side and percolation on the probabilistic); but it is also an area
that has seen major progress in recent years, and one that enjoys close ties
with several other disciplines, including statistical physics and the theory of
computation. Though the questions under study are purely mathematical, work in
this subject area has sometimes had quite unforeseen consequences, both in and
beyond mathematics. This research project centers on simple and seemingly basic
questions with "pedigrees," that is, substantial histories of resisting
solution. Attacking such questions is a way of forcing oneself to go beyond
existing methods, which often leads to finding and exploiting new connections
with other parts of mathematics and related areas.

Several of the main problems under study are concerned with understanding the
extent to which various classical facts and theorems remain true in a random
setting; for example: (a) When (i.e., for what p = p(n)) is the "clique complex"
(whose simplices are the vertex sets of the cliques) of the random graph G(n,p)
likely to have vanishing k-dimensional homology (e.g., over the integers or the
integers mod 2)? (b) When does a random collection F of k-subets of an n-set X
have the ("Erdos-Ko-Rado") property that a largest subcollection not containing
two disjoint sets consists of the members of F containing some fixed element of
X? In these and other cases, further progress appears to depend on better
understanding underlying issues of independent interest. The proposal also
suggests some very general possibilities, for example, one on behavior of
independent events as a guide to more complicated situations, and another (due
to Kalai and the PI) which would in principle determine (up to an unavoidable
logarithmic error factor) the threshold for a completely arbitrary increasing
property (of subsets of some finite universe; the "threshold" being, roughly
speaking, where the property goes from unlikely to likely). Though most of the
headline problems are of probabilistic-combinatorial origin, there are
substantial connections with other areas --- some combinatorial, others,
particularly when it comes to methodology, more distant; for instance: (a) the
proof of an old conjecture on presence of certain trees in a random graph
eventually depended (very much inter alia) on developing precise estimates for a
sampling-without-replacement version of classical renewal theory; (b) the
currently most promising line of attack on the general threshold conjecture
mentioned above is more Fourier-analytic than combinatorial and originates
(though much has happened since) in work of the PI and coauthors nearly thirty
years ago on a problem from theoretical computer science.
