A multidisciplinary approach is used to document the effects of variations in
salinity on the structure and function of a chemosensory system in the blue
crab, a species that ranges from seawater to freshwater. Experiments focus upon
the olfactory sensory cells of the crab, using animals acclimated to a range of
different external salt concentrations. Using electron microscopy, the
structural details of the sensory cells will be examined to discover the
features that may be transformed in altered salinity conditions. The composition
of the fluid, which bathes the input processes of sensory neurons, is also
monitored in relation to salinity and its relationship to the hemolymph
("blood") and the external environment of the crab. Neurophysiological
techniques are used to define how the responses of chemically sensitive neurons
are affected by altered salinity, as well. By integrating these approaches, we
expect that this study will contribute to our understanding of structural and
functional adaptations that can maintain chemosensory function under conditions
of osmotic and ionic stress to the animal.
