The proposed project seeks financial support for student participation in the
Lester Eastman Conference on High-Performance Devices, which will be held in
Lehigh University, Pennsylvania from August 2 to August 4, 2016. Support will be
provided for attracting student participation and allowing their interaction
with experts in the field of high-performance devices. This will permit to
discuss recent research or education findings, and to expose them to new
research and education techniques in the field. The conference will actively
recruit and support speakers and other attendees from under-represented groups
in science and engineering. The research results presented at the conference
will be summarized in abstracts that will be distributed to participants and
will be made available through proceedings to the wider public.
