Texas A&amp;M University proposes to operate the research vessel (R/V) GYRE for
a total of 280 days in 1987. However, the anticipated demand for shiptime aboard
GYRE did not materialize and the total use of GYRE in support of NSF projects is
not expected to exceed 57 days in 1987. All of the proposed legs are in support
of NSF projects funded through the Division of Ocean Sciences. Principal
investigators using this ship are all from Texas A&amp;M University. The primary
use of the ship will be for physical oceanography. R/V GYRE is an appropriate
vessel for the proposed operations, and the marine operations staff at Texas
A&amp;M University, including a new marine superintendent, are fully capable of
carrying out the work that has been proposed Due to the variable nature of ship
operations and associated costs, program has found that single year grants to
not provide maximum efficiency of management. Three-year continuing grants allow
for better long-range planning and adjustments to major changes in operating
schedules due to breakdowns, cancellations, and other factors impacting on
subsequent years. Therefore program recommends that this FY 1987 award be
processed as the first year of a three-year continuing grant.
