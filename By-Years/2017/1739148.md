This travel grant would support US participation in the Gender Summit, a
conference focused on discussing and highlighting the importance of women in
science with representatives from academic, governments and industry. The
conference is designed to advance the research agenda in the following areas :
(1) national, regional and global communities as agents of change; (2) evidence-
based consensus on the actions needed and the ways of implementing them in
specific national or regional contexts; (3) positive effects of gender balance
and gender diversity in research and innovation process; and (4) integrating
gender dimensions in research and innovation content to improve the quality of
results and outcomes for society?s benefit. The dissemination of research in
this venue will contribute to the increased visibility of broaden participation
efforts in STEM that will support economic, food and community security.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The participation of US experts in women in STEM in this
conference will contribute to the successful promotion of solutions to societal
problems, e.g. urban quality; human adaptation; food security; transport and
mobility to increase the rigor and reproducibility of science and engineering.
By ensuring US participation it will ensure engagement in creating regional and
global multi-stakeholder communities committed to enhancing scientific
excellence; removing gender bias from science knowledge making; advancing gender
equality in science structures and practices; and applying understanding of
gender issues to advance more sustainable and effective research and innovation.
