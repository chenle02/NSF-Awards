9733764 Longo The research portion of this career program is aimed at aiding in
the design of bilayer systems including: biosensors, pore-forming systems, drug
delivery, and antibiotics. The ultimate goal is an understanding of how to
control the aggregation of membrane soluble molecules, control disruption of
bilayer systems, and influence the function of membrane soluble molecules. The
teaching plans incorporate two innovations: (1) a High School Chemistry Links
Program; and (2) the development of a new course in Biochemical Manufacturing
Plant Design. ***
