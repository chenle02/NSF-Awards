DMS-9500615 Kath The goal this project is to analyze the effect various types
of perturbations have upon the stability and dynamics of soliton solutions of
the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. These perturbations include: periodic
parametric forcing, stochastic noise, and higher-order linear and nonlinear
derivatives. The intent is to develop and use approximate methods which allow
both a simple qualitative understanding of the resulting pulse dynamics and an
accurate quantitative description that is as concise as possible. The nonlinear
Schroedinger equation models pulse propagation in nonlinear optical fibers, and
in particular, optical solitons. As a result, an additional goal of the project
is to investigate mathematically whether it is possible to use new optical fiber
technologies to significantly increase the transmission speed of optical
communication systems, or to improve upon the performance of these systems. One
application that is being examined along these lines is the use of novel optical
amplifier devices to control solitons, such as the use of phase-sensitive
parametric amplifiers.
