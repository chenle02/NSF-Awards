This project extends and evaluates a stochastic model for the development of
status structures in face-to-face discussion groups. The model, grounded in
expectation states theory, proposes solutions to several problems in face-to-
face group interaction that involve patterns of inequality and differences in
participation. The will involve groups with six members, which allows
investigation of new patterns of interaction between the group leader and other
members and which should elicit `bystander effects,` or expectations in members
that arise from their observations of others. Data from this study will be
recorded on video tape, coded, and archived in a manner that allows further
analysis by these and other investigators. The project will be conducted in
collaboration with Webster and Whitmeyer at the University of North Carolina in
Charlotte, who have been funded under grant SBR9729979.
