This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI) project. This project will
investigate both the techniques for combining optimizations in compilation and
the potential benefit of applying combined optimizations. A determination of
when optimizations can be combined has not been discovered. Likewise, a tool to
automatically generate an optimizer for these more powerful combined
optimizations has not been developed. The objectives of this ongoing project
are: investigate the properties of optimizations that permit their combination,
describe when two optimizations may be combined, and propose a tool which
generates an optimizer for the newly combined optimizations. A generalization of
the description to combine chains of optimizations will also be investigated.
This project will be used as a vehicle to introduce undergraduate students to
the research process and actively involve students in the theoretical
investigation, the implementation, the experimentation, and the dissemination of
the results. Students will be encouraged to involve themselves in all aspects of
this project. ***
