To enhance learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM),
we need to better understand how students acquire and use STEM knowledge, and
how instructors can facilitate learning in STEM. Biology education researchers
contribute to this understanding by applying their expertise in biology to the
study of undergraduate teaching and learning in the discipline. Biology
education research (BER) is a relatively young field, emerging after physics and
chemistry education research. Thus there are many research questions to answer
in BER, and this work will require more biology education researchers. The
Undergraduate Biology Education Research Version 2 (UBERV2) Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) program at University of Georgia will address this need
by contributing to the BER talent pool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UBERV2 REU
program will select and train 24 diverse undergraduate students in biology
education research over the next three years. UBERV2 fellows will develop their
BER understanding and skills while adding to theory and knowledge about biology
teaching and learning. UBERV2 fellows will collaborate with faculty mentors on
individual research projects. They will also engage in program offerings
organized around three areas: a research strand, a career strand, and a
professionalism strand. After participating in UBERV2 students will be able to
1) use appropriate methods to analyze data associated with biology teaching and
learning, 2) evaluate peer-reviewed papers in BER and science education
research, 3) identify sound educational research questions and appropriate
research designs, 4) communicate their research findings in scientific formats,
and 5) outline career pathways in or related to education research. This
experience will prepare UBERV2 fellows to pursue graduate work in BER. Overall,
the project will contribute enhanced understandings of biology teaching and
learning, and build the biology education research talent pool, which is
expected to lead to improvements in undergraduate STEM education.
