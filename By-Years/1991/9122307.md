This award provides travel support to U.S. authors of papers accepted for
presentation at the Sixth International Conference on Permafrost to be held in
Beijing, China, on July 5-9, 1993. This international conference is held once
every five years and brings together scientists and engineers from throughout
the world who are interested in cold regions research. The international concern
for global climate and environmental change has created increased world interest
in permafrost and seasonally frozen soils. The International Conference on
Permafrost is one of the most important international meetings devoted to this
timely subject. Travel awards will be made on a competitive basis with final
decisions begin made by the Principal Investigators in cooperation with the U.S.
Committee for the International Permafrost Association (USC/IPA) of the National
Research Council.
