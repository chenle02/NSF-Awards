This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the interfacial chemistry of polycrystalline and single-
crystal palladium electrodes. Professor Soriaga and his students at Texas A
&amp; M University will use electrochemical methods combined with scanning
tunneling microscopy and surface spectroscopy to study the coordination
chemistry, adsorbate-activated sites for electron transfer reactions of solution
redox couples, and electrocatalytic reactions of small molecules that occur at
these palladium electrode surfaces. Applications involving fuel cells,
electrocatalysis, corrosion/passivation, and sensors need new electrode
technologies. The economics of many of these applications often prohibit their
acceptance in real settings. Palladium electrodes exhibit unusual phenomena that
are poorly understood at present but which have the potential to generate
significant scientific and technological impact on these areas. A number of
methods will be used to study the properties of palladium electrode surfaces
under many conditions suitable for their use in the areas listed above in order
to better understand and control these unusual phenomena.
