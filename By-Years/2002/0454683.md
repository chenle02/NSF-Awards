Michael Heinekey, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for
explorations of metal-dihydrogen and metal-alkane interactions. Specifically,
the project will target: (1) The structure and dynamics of elongated dihydrogen
complexes using NMR spectroscopy and H/D/T labels; (2) Exchange coupling in
symmetrical cis dihydrides using magnetic inequivalence to measure couplings;
(3) Coordination of sigma bonds such as C-H and Si-H bonds to electrophilic
metal centers generated by photoextrusion of CO or by chloride abstraction using
silyl cation reagents; (3) Low barrier dynamics, including the measurement of
kinetic isotope effects, of cis H2 /H systems using very low temperature NMR
spectroscopy and isotope substitution; (3) Intramolecular activation of the
strong C-H bonds in pyrazolyl rings by intermolecular activation and possible
functionalization of hydrocarbon C-H bonds using neutral and/or cationic Ir(I)
complexes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important current goal of research in
homogeneous catalysis is to understand the metal binding and activation of
substrates such as dihydrogen, alkanes and silanes which present only sigma
bonds for interaction with the metal center Information about these species has
previously been available only through indirect measures, but in this study they
will be directly observed. In addition, the education and training of future
scientists and the development of new NMR methods are major impacts of this
work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
