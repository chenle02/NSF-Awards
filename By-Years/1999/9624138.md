Dr. Tara Meyer of the University of Pittsburgh will study ring opening
metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of imines with support from a Faculty Early
Career Development award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program. Strained-cyclic imines will be polymerized to synthesize
polymers suitable for use as metal chelation agents and drug carriers. High-
valent, early tranisiton metal catalysts will be reacted with imine monomers to
produce the polymers. The education component of this project focuses on the
development of courses which encompass a combination of complex thinking,
decision making, and problem solving skills that relate to real world technology
issues such as risk assessment. This project addresses the synthesis of new,
polymeric materials utilizing a known polymerization approach in a novel way.
The fundamental chemistry of the metal compounds and organic monomers will be
explored, and it is likely to provide new avenues to new polymeric materials.
The polymers have potential for applications in drug delivery and metal removal
from aqueous solution.
