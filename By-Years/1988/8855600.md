Building upon a currently funded NSF project, this three-year project seeks to
address the underrepresentation of deaf persons in mathematics and science by
improving the mathematical knowledge and pedagogical skills of pre-college
teachers of deaf students. Each summer, fifty teachers from grades K-12 will
participate in a six-week summer session that will improve their understanding
of mathematics content, enhance their pedagogical knowledge and practice
(especially as applied to deaf students), and familiarize them with the use of
microcomputers. Participants will be teachers in residential and day schools for
the deaf or in self-contained classrooms for the deaf throughout the nation.
Follow-up activities include regional conferences and visits to the
participants' schools by project staff. Evaluation will include questionnaires
and pre- and post-tests of participants' skills and knowledge. Gallaudet
University is contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to 7% of the NSF
award.
