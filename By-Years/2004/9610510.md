9610510 Corona The progressive degradation and collapse of metal structural
members when subjected to the cyclic loading into the plastic range of the
material are to be investigated. It will concentrate in two important problems:
buckling of columns under cyclic axial loading and buckling of I and W beams
under cyclic bending. The first case represents the most fundamental loading
case in structural stability while the second case represents some of the most
widely used shapes in construction. The investigation of both problems will be
carried out using combined experimental and analytical methods. The results of
the investigation should yield accurate knowledge of the degradation mechanisms
which lead to buckling under cyclic loading.
