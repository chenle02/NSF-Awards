Title: Analysis of Cycles of Retributive Violence&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;Punishing those who break the law and providing justice to victims is
a fundamental duty of states. When citizens doubt the legitimacy of the state's
punishments, the ability to govern breaks down, which can lead to public support
for vigilante justice and further erosion of support for the rule of law. This
project will analyze the factors related to support for vigilante violence. This
project will study the role that information and misconceptions of state justice
institutions as well as the role of emotion influence citizen support for
extrajudicial punishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engaging in theories from
criminal justice, psychology, and political science, this study will develop,
test, and implement various interventions thought to shape citizen support for
extrajudicial punishments as opposed to the rule of law in Mexico. Employing a
field experimental design, these interventions are designed to test different
underlying reasons that citizens might support vigilante violence. A goal of
this project is to identify policy interventions that reduce support for
vigilantism and increase support for due process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
