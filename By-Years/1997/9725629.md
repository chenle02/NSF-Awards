9725629 Gurnis The PI will develop a new generation of dynamic models with the
finite element method and test such models against observations at both
intermediate (10-100 km) and large scales (100 -10,000 km). The principle
objectives are to place bounds on (1) the effective viscosity of converging
plate boundaries, (2) the lateral strength of slabs, (3) radial variations in
mantle viscosity, and (4) the mass flux of slabs into the lower mantle. Bounds
on the effective viscosity of converging margins are essential ingredients in
generating plate tectonics from theoretical models of mantle convection.
Constraining mass flux into the lower mantle is a fundamental constraint on
geochemical and thermal models of the mantle. The main components of the
proposed work will be (1) synthesis of a suite of geophysical observations, (2)
formulation of regional flow models with actual slab and fault geometries, (3)
comprehensive investigation of the dynamics of these 3-D models, and (4) testing
with data independent of that used to construct slab geometry and buoyancy. ***
