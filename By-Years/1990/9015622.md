This grant will fund a 10 day conference on the Arithmetic of Function Fields,
held at Ohio State University on August 17- 26, 1991. The purposes of the
conference are 1) to introduce mathematicians (particularly graduate students
and recent Ph.D.'s ) to the area, and 2) to serve as a forum for discussionof
current progress and problems. The first week of the conference will be devoted
to lectures outlining in detail the general theory. The morning talks will be of
a foundational nature, while the afternoon talks will be more advanced. The last
three days of the conference will be devoted to research talks on the subjects
covered in the first week. Participants of the conference will also be invited
to lecture. Finally, a list of open problems will be compiled and distributed to
all participants. Emphasis will be given to applications of the area.
