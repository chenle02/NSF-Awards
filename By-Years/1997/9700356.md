9700356 Boyd The basic work towards the development of new micro-fluidic MEMS
devices that convert the latent heat of liquid/vapor transformation into the
work of the shape memory alloy martenistic transformation with no need for
complicated kinematic linkages is being conducted. These devices have industrial
applications such as arterial clamps, medical catheters, stenosis blocks, drives
for micropumps, etc. The thermomechanics of coupled solid/solid liquid/vapor
phase transformations is being studies. Both analytical studies and their
experimental verification are being conducted. Nickel- titanium (NITINOL)
materials are being studies in this work. ***
