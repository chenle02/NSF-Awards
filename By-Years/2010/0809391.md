In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor W. Carl Lineberger of the University of
Colorado, together with his postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student
researchers, will study the time-resolved photoelectron spectra of a number of
anions/radicals in solvent cages, as well as anions whose photoionization result
in radicals with multiple radical centers. Some of the interesting molecular
anions to be studied include HOOO- and 1,3,5 dehydrobenzene
anion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular molecular systems chosen for study
are of broad interest to the scientific community. The research of the
Lineberger group will have impact in the fields as diverse as polymer science
and atmospheric chemistry. A number of the molecular targets will provide useful
data with which to challenge computational chemists. In addition to training
advanced research students, Prof. Lineberger will continue in his leadership of
the Science Education Initiative on his campus. This program brings
undergraduate students in selected courses into research laboratories for short
periods of time during the academic year. &lt;br/&gt;
