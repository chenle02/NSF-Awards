Nuvuk, the northernmost archaeological site in the United States, is located at
the tip of Point Barrow, Alaska. It is endangered by rapid coastal erosion. This
summer, the final field season of the NSF-funded Nuvuk Archaeology project
encountered additional Ipiutak material in the current erosion face, including
part of a box hearth and adjacent living surface, the first such feature north
of Point Hope. Artifacts included an Ipiutak point, a jet and ivory composite
labret, decorated ivory fragments, and a wide variety of lithics. Faunal
material included large amounts of fishbone, which is quite rare at Ipiutak.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field considerations did not permit excavation of the
entire feature, and it will be eroded away by the first fall storm. This small
RAPID award will provide the resources needed to conduct an excavation as soon
as possible to record the structure and recover the archaeological data it
contains prior to the arrival of the fall storm season and its potential loss.
