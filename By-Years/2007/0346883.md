New challenges for computational scientists have emerged in the past several
years as the size of data generated from simulations has experienced an
exponential growth. One major factor that is contributing to the growth of data
size is the increasingly widespread ability to perform very large-scale time-
varying simulations. This project aims to design efficient data processing and
effective feature extraction techniques to facilitate large-scale time-varying
data analysis.

The specific goal of this research is to study the following fundamental
problems in time-varying visualization algorithms: (1) Design spatio-temporal
data encoding and management schemes to facilitate run-time browsing and
analysis of data at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales, (2) Develop
accelerated visualization algorithms to utilize spatial and temporal data
coherence. Topics of interest include the design of space-efficient time-varying
isosurface extraction algorithms, automatic level of detail algorithms for multi
resolution time-varying volume rendering, and load balanced parallel data
distribution and visualization schemes, (3) Design novel time-varying feature
enhancement and tracking techniques. Specifically, focus is on the development
of novel high dimensional volume projection techniques to highlight the
progression and evolution of time-dependent features, and high dimensional
geometric algorithms to track time varying is contours and interval volumes.
Focus is also on the design of effective transfer functions used in volume
rendering to extract salient time-dependent features
