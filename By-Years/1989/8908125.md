This research project in mathematical physics is concerned with several
problems about the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of multi-particle
Hamiltonians, particularly those associated with atomic and molecular systems.
One topic is the instability of highly charged molecular ions. Another area of
interest concerns problems related to the estimation of physically significant
energy differences, such as binding energies and ionization potentials. Some of
the problems in this category are closely related to the behavior of
eigenfunctions, particularly comparisons of eigenfunctions for different energy
levels. Therefore it is also proposed to investigate the relationship between
expectation values in states of different energies for such quantities as the
interelectronic distance. Finally, a new approach to solving a long-standing
problem in density functional theory is presented. The general idea here is the
use of sophisticated mathematics to model the often counterintuitive behavior of
microscopic physical systems. At this level, one needs to represent physical
quantities not by numbers, which would be the commonsense approach, but rather
by functions and by operators on spaces of functions. At the heart of such a
representation is an operator called the Hamiltonian, which has to do with
energy. There is a quite simple abstract relationship between the Hamiltonian
and the time evolution of the system. To exploit this relationship is not so
simple in practice, however; the hard part is the calculation of eigenvalues
(possible energy levels) and eigenfunctions (corresponding states) for whatever
Hamiltonian one is working with. A distinctive feature of Professor Ruskai's
project is its focus on Hamiltonians that come from systems in which a not
uncontrollably large number of particles interact with one another.
