0233988&lt;br/&gt;Psaltis&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Demetri Psaltis and two
students from the California Institute of Technology in a collaboration with
Karsten Buse of the Department of Physics at the University of Bonn, Germany.
The project will focus on the study of volume holographic recording in
photorefractive crystals. The major problem up to now has been that the
holographic data gets erased during read out, making it unsuitable for storage
devices. A solution to the problem lies in the use of doubly doped crystals, and
this collaboration will optimize the materials, which could be used to make
rewritable storage devices. Together the two groups will model the physical
mechanisms responsible for the success of the method, improve the performance of
the method by testing other dopants and crystals, and demonstrate a persistent
holographic memory system incorporating doubly doped
crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also has an educational objective.
The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing
research in another country. They will develop a heightened appreciation of the
world around them while also learning important new technical skills.&lt;br/&gt;
