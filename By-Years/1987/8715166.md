This project is a Symposium on "Some Mathematical Questions in Biology" to be
sponsored by the American Mathematical Society, the Society of Industrial and
Applied Mathematics, and the Society for Mathematical Biology. The symposium
represents the twenty-second in a series and will be held in conjunction with
the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology in May 1988. The annual meeting is supported by the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Steel Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and
the Institute for Defense Analyses. This symposium will focus on research
questions related to the dynamics of excitable cells. The topics will deal with
an analysis of the transitions that lead to bursting, cardiac pacemaking and
wave propagation in cardiac tissue, wave propagation in the aggregation phase of
certain cell systems, and collective phenomena in the brain. The overall goal is
to expose biologists and physiologists to some of the more theoretical work
being done by mathematicians, and to expose mathematicians to some of the
concrete modeling work being done on particular systems.
