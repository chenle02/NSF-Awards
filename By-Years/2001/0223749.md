The PI is organizing an interdisciplinary workshop to provide a forum for
discussion of the latest advances in nanomaterials to be held in Romania during
the week of Sept. 30, 2002. The challenges and issues with the science and
application of nanotechnology will be identified and discussed along with
identification of emerging areas requiring research and analysis. The specific
intersection between areas is to be covered, such as quantum mechanics and
biology, nanoparticles in polymers, electronics and biology, and their
interactions.
