A National Research Council ad hoc committee will assess the present status of
research&lt;br/&gt;at the interface between medicine and earth science, and will
advise on the high priority&lt;br/&gt;research activities that should be
undertaken for optimum societal benefit. The&lt;br/&gt;committee will report on
the most profitable areas for communication and collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between
the earth science and medical communities, recognizing both the
infectious&lt;br/&gt;disease and environmental components.&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed activity will span the earth science and public health fields, seeking
to&lt;br/&gt;provide much broader awareness and understanding of research
endeavors at the interface&lt;br/&gt;of these fields as well as raising
awareness of environmental contributions to diseases and&lt;br/&gt;human health.
The study will provide a focus for this emerging scientific discipline
to&lt;br/&gt;identify the most promising and important research
priorities.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will:&lt;br/&gt;Enhance the
infrastructure for research and education, by recommending&lt;br/&gt;strategies
for enhanced collaboration and cooperation between the earth
science&lt;br/&gt;and medical/public health communities;&lt;br/&gt;Enhance
scientific and technological understanding, by preparing a report
for&lt;br/&gt;broad dissemination that will describe the connections between
earth science and&lt;br/&gt;public health, addressing both positive and negative
societal impacts over the full&lt;br/&gt;range from large-scale interactions to
micro-scale biogeochemical processes;&lt;br/&gt;Provide benefits to society, by
identifying basic research needs in bioscience and&lt;br/&gt;geoscience required
to support medical geology research, and by suggesting how&lt;br/&gt;future
efforts should be directed to anticipate and respond to public health
needs&lt;br/&gt;and threats.
