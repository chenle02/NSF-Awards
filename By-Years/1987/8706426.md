The entomological collections of the Bishop Museum are a unique national
resource for purposes of research, documentation and identification of insects.
They are the third largest entomological collections in the U.S., containing
more than 13 million specimens and nearly 13,000 primary types. The regional
emphasis is on the Pacific Basin, and the collections are unequalled for this
area. Prior NSF support to the collections provided significant expansion of
storage equipment (cabinets, drawers) and technical assistance and allowed
exceptional progress in collections management, organization, curation and
processing of the backlogged materials. This project will provide partial
support for rehousing of the collections in compactorized storage and modern,
air- conditioned quarters. This will result in radical improvements in space
utilization, organization and management of the collections, as well as in staff
efficiency. Separate facilities will be provided for the general pinned
collections, alcohol- preserved material, specimens mounted on slides, and type
specimens.
