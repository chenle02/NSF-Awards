Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRS 2012 Spring Meeting Symposium SS:
Structure-Property Relationships in Biological and Biomimetic
Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Nature often produces
materials that are superior or more cost-effective than man-made equivalents.
Understanding the nano- and microstructural properties of biomaterials is
therefore potentially of very high interest to applied material physics and is
key for the fabrication of novel materials with improved properties. The goal of
this symposium is to present, through a series of invited lectures from world
leading experts in the field, an overview of the state-of-the art in the
microstructural characterization of biological hierarchic materials and the
potential for future research in the field. An excellent team of presenters has
been assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The symposium also
provides an attractive educational opportunity for participating students
through a satellite tutorial on microstructural characterization techniques of
biological materials, as well as ample opportunities for multidisciplinary
interactions between veteran researchers and young investigators in the
framework on the MRS meeting.
