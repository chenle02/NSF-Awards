This research focuses on the efficient evaluation of multidimensional integrals
that arise in Bayesian analysis. The basic approach is first to select a
problem-specific transformation to precondition the integrands, and then to use
an adaptive integration method. The primary objective now is to investigate how
best to choose transformations which will allow adaptive numerical integration
algorithms to be used effectively. So far, transformations based on a modal
approximation transformation have been shown to reduce computation time
significantly for some problems. These approximations need to be refined and
tested on practical statistical problems and made to interface with standard
statistical software packages. Integrals play a very important role in a wide
variety of practical statistical calculations; but often these integrals are
defined over regions in multiple dimension and do not have values that can be
obtained from formulas or tables. In this case, the integrals must be estimated
numerically, often with time intensive computation. New methods and refinements
to be developed here will take account of special features of these statistical
problems to give efficient adaptive integration algorithms.
