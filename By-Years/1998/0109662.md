This proposal for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research outlines a
collaborative project for in-depth scholarly research on the issues raised for
science and technology studies (S&TS), as well as for related political and
legal analysis, by the extraordinary year 2000 US presidential election. The
project will seek to identify the most salient epistemological and
sociotechnical dimensions of these issues and will develop a special archival
collection to support ongoing interdisciplinary research on the 36-day post-
election developments. The proposal has three key elements: (1) an initial
planning workshop to be held in Cambridge, MA, at Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government; (2) a systematic effort to gather materials, many
ephemeral, to be housed in a special collection in the Cornell University
library system; and (3) a follow-up workshop to discuss and refine a group of
papers emanating from the first two phases of the project. The collaboration
between the Department of Science & Technology Studies at Cornell University and
the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University will facilitate the
involvement of a broad range of scholars in creating the collection and
contribute to productive interactions between science and technology studies and
more traditional perspectives on government and public policy.
