This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Brown University acquire computer systems to upgrade
the existing computer network. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas including the following: (1) interfacial dynamics of hydrogen in metals
(2) quantum simulations of adsorbed hydrogen on metal clusters (3) trial wave
functions and invariants, and (4) vibrational relaxation of polyatomic molecules
in liquids. A network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer network`
also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization facilities, and
supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
