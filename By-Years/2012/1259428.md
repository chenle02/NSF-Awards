RPR (An Approach for Recruitment, Persistence, and Retention of CS/ITS Students)
provides full four-year scholarships to a cohort of 13 academically-talented and
financially-disadvantaged majors in Computer Science and Information Technology
&amp; Systems majors. Recruitment initiatives focus on program features that
have broad appeal to a diverse population of students, including women. RPR's
intellectual merit is grounded in its coordination of initiatives found to be
effective in recruiting and retaining students. The program features a cohort
approach to learning, including a common freshman year experience where students
participate in a two-semester active learning CS sequence, a self-management
course that aids in student persistence and retention, and a discrete
mathematics course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, students have
opportunities to engage in applied research and internships and to be paired
with industry mentors. Program evaluation focuses on the effectiveness of
recruitment strategies in attracting a diverse cohort and on core program
features in aiding student achievement, persistence and retention. The broader
impact of RPR is to promote growth and diversity in the CS/ITS field and to
disseminate evaluation findings through peer-reviewed publications such as the
Proceedings of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education
(SIGCSE) and the Journal of Computer Sciences in Colleges.
