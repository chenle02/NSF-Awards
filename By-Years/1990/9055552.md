The California Academy of Sciences produces a science news radio feature
"EARTHNEWS" which has aired daily on twelve radio stations in California for
nine years. "EARTHNEWS" is a background to regular news and provides in-depth
interpretation of science and environmental events to assist the public in
understanding what they hear or read. In response to a very large volume of mail
from listeners, a quarterly newsletter was created four years ago to announce
program schedules, enhance the information presented on the radio, and offer
scientists and teachers a written forum for sharing ideas. Positive response
from the listening audience suggests that this feature has tremendous potential
for reaching a broad national audience. The Columbia Broadcasting System has
agreed to air three 60-second "EARTHNEWS" features each week and to distribute
these features nationwide via satellite. A total of 156 features will be
produced annually, each reaching an estimated national audience of twelve to
fifteen million people. The California Academy of Sciences is requesting funding
for program research and production to develop this national radio program and
to continue production of the newsletter.
