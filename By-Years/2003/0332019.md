0332019 Karanfil The primary objectives of this proposed research are: a) to
gain a fundamental understanding of how activated carbon pore structure and
surface chemistry as well as DOM physicochemical characteristics influence
adsorption of DOM from water, b) to determine optimum conditions that will
maximize the removal of DOM by activated carbons, and c) to develop guidelines
or strategies for producing novel, inexpensive, and selective activated carbons
that are optimized for DOM removal.
