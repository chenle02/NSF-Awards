This project will study: i) the mechanisms of activation of neural tissue by
magnetic stimulation; ii) calculate induced fields in various volume conductors;
iii) simulate on the computer the effects of these fields using models of axons
and neurons; and iv) design a coil capable of focussing the induced fields. This
project also intends to test directly the efficacy of this coil in both the
peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system (CNS). This combination
of a theoretical with an experimental approach should generate useful and
important information about the mechanisms of magnetic stimulation and the
efficacy of focussing magnetic fields for the excitation of the nervous system.
This non-invasive method of stimulation should provide clinicians with a
powerful tool to study and map normal brain function as well as diagnose certain
types of neural diseases provided that the mechanisms of the interactions
between magnetic fields and neural tissue can be understood.
