Voice/data integrated multiplexers employed in multimedia environments and
random access networks using the Carrier Sensing Multiple Access protocols
continue to be widely used in modern communications. Therefore, it is important
that they be understood as completely as possible. One of the most important
problems is to study their time dependent, or transient performance. This
project's objectives are: 1) to obtain a theoretical and computational framework
to evaluate the transient behavior of stochastic models for these networks,
whose parameters may also be stationary or time dependent. 2) To evaluate the
transient performance of voice/data integrated networks and multiaccess
networks, which cannot be found using steady state analysis. Models to be
analyzed are the voice/data integrated switches with movable boundary
assignments, network models with more realistic descriptions of packet length
arrival processes, multi-packet or multi-active-user arrivals, and the network
stability analysis. 3) The design of some dynamic routing and control schemes in
voice/data switches based on their time/dependent behaviors. 4) To generalize
the approach to the study of more fundamental queueing problems.
