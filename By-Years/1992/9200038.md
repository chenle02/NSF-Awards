This award provides fund to continue a successful REU SITE at the Department of
Pharmacology, University of South Alabama. The focus of the undergraduate
research program is cellular signaling, e.g., how hormones, calcium, cyclic
nucleotides, protein phosphorylation, and induction of specific intracellular
proteins may influence cell function. Participating faculty have extramural
research support and ongoing, active research programs. Compensation and access
to student facilities (e.g. library and athletic facilities, housing and meal
services) will be available for all program participants. Students will be
provided a research experience in a laboratory selected by them on the basis of
summary descriptions and discussion with the investigators. In addition,
students will receive a formal review of the general area of cellular signalling
via an organized weekly course. At the end of the summer, students will present
their findings on Student Research Day. Students will be recruited from regional
undergraduate institutions that do not themselves provide formal research
experiences for undergraduates. Recruiting will be accomplished through science
counselors, mail brochures and campus visits. This particular match of student
and research experience will encourage talented students with little knowledge
of the opportunities available in science to apply to Ph.D. programs and embark
on careers in science and technology.
