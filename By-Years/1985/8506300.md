This project utilizes a workstation with a high-speed graphic engine for dynamic
analysis and design optimization of mechanical systems. The workstation can be
linked to an existing super-minicomputer and other computational facilities to
provide a user-oriented software/hardware package. The state-of-the-art
algorithms for analysis and design of multi-body mechanical systems will be
utilized by taking advantage of all of the capabilities of the workstation. A
high-speed graphic processor makes visualization of the dynamic response of the
mechanical system possible in real time. The integration of software/hardware
systems can be a valuable tool to researchers, design engineers, and analysis of
mechanical systems.
