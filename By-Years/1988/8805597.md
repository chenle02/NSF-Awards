Studies in three principal areas will be done: (1) Viscous liquids, plastic
crystals, and glasses, under which umbrella they propose to refine the knowledge
and understanding of fragility in liquids, and to invoke the comparable
phenomenology of plastic crystals, specifically seeking plastic crystals with
"fragile" behavior. A particular note is made of the challenge of systems with
slow structural degrees of freedom which couple only weakly to the viscoelastic
modes. Finally, they identify the area of octapolar glasses as one worthy of
attention: (2) Liquids at negative pressure, in which area they wish to
investigate physicochemical properties of liquids when in a state of tension;
they also propose molecular dynamics studies invoking negative pressure
rupturing of initially normal liquid structures to produce and then study
fractal structures and dynamics: Finally (3) they outline several problems in
geochemical liquid and glass research. They propose both experimental and
computer simulation studies in this area.
