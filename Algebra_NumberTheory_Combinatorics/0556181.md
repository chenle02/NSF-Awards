This award supports a program for advancement in the representation theory of
commutative Noetherian local rings. The study of maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules
over such rings has grown out of the theory of representations of Artin
algebras, which has developed sophisticated theoretical techniques for
classifying and characterizing module theories of non-commutative Artinian
rings. Classical problems from the non-commutative theory can often be stated
directly in the commutative higher-dimensional framework, and this framework
comes equipped with its own unique problems, specialized machinery, and deep,
powerful connections with algebraic geometry. The interplay between the two
areas has been exceptionally productive for both. However, many of the most
powerful tools of the Artinian arsenal are essentially noncommutative, in that
they produce noncommutative rings even from commutative input, restricting their
use in commutative algebra. Recent theoretical advances in non-commutative
algebraic geometry have begun to provide methods, including the notion of a non-
commutative resolution of singularities, similar to those provided by classical
algebraic geometry. Describing these non-commutative resolutions in terms of
tools from the Artinian theory will allow the powerful tools of that area to be
brought to bear on fundamental conjectures about the maximal Cohen--Macaulay
modules over Cohen--Macaulay local rings.

This project lies at the intersection of the areas of commutative and non-
commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The classical aim of
commutative algebra is to describe the solution sets of systems of polynomial
equations by associating to them algebraic gadgets known as rings. Non-
commutative algebra, on the other hand, has developed theory for associating
rings to directed graphs, also called quivers. The synergy among these topics
has enriched all four subjects, and has led to applications in such varied
fields as robotics, statistics, cryptography, and particularly theoretical
physics.
