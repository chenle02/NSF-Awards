A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as an
annual satellite workshop in each edition of the 2022--2024 ACM SIGPLAN
Conferences on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for
Humanity (SPLASH). SPLASH is a premier forum that brings together researchers
working on foundations and applications of programming languages and software
engineering. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented
groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the
mentoring workshops in addition to the several conferences held under the SPLASH
umbrella. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in
computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from
leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and
knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and programming systems
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
