This study concerns a novel application of immunochemistry to oceanography. The
surface layers of the ocean are inhabited by vast numbers of organisms, most of
which are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Characterizing the organisms
present therefore, requires time consuming microscopic work on sea water
samples. This work will develop a method borrowed from biotechnology to enable
oceanographers to rapidly screen samples for the presence of plant cells called
dinoflagellates that are common in coastal U.S. waters. The technique involves
the production of antibodies that react only with a specific type of chemical,
in this case, chemicals that are characteristic of certain marine plant cells. A
rapid and reliable technique to identify dinoflagellates may be a valuable
propholactic against the toxic effects of these plant cells to coastal shell
fisheries.
