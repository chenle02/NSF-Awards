The mechanisms involved in macromolecular recognition are central to the
understanding of gene regulation. This project will examine the nature and
relative importance of functional group interactions between proteins (and other
selected ligands) and nucleic acids that are responsible for the formation of
high- affinity, sequence-specific complexes. The laboratory will prepare a
series of modified oligodeoxynucleotides as possible recognition sites for
restriction and modification enzymes, a repressor protein (the tryptophan
repressor) as well as selected minor groove binding ligands. The modifications
have been chosen in order to minimize structural changes in the B-DNA helix, and
involve primarily the "deletion" of selected functional groups. These DNA
fragments will be prepared by chemical syntheses employing a variety of modified
nucleoside derivatives, including those obtained during the initial and ongoing
periods of this project. Parallel studies will be directed toward the effects of
modified bases upon DNA structure and the implications of such structure
modulation upon recognition processes. Specifically, we will continue to use
modified base residues to study DNA curvature phenomena. Additionally, with the
minor groove modifications proposed for the present project period, one can
examine B-form structure as a function of the ability to form the putative minor
groove spine of hydration. By studying recognition phenomena, using site-
specifically modified macromolecules, this project should contribute to the
understanding of cellular recognition processes and provide access to a variety
of useful biochemical tools. %%% There are many examples in nature that involve
the selective production of specialized proteins by cells, tissues, and organs
which result from the expression of particular genes. This project will examine
the nature of functional group interactions between proteins and nucleic acid
polymers that are responsible for the formation of high-affinity, sequence-
specific complexes involved in gene expression. A series of modified nucleic
acid polymers will be prepared to test with proteins which bind to, cut, or
chemically modify the related natural polymer. The DNA fragments will be
prepared by chemical syntheses employing a variety of modified nucleoside
derivatives. Parallel studies will be directed toward the effects of modified
bases upon DNA structure and the implications of such structure modulation upon
recognition processes. Thus, by studying recognition phenomena, using site-
specifically modified macromolecules, this project should contribute to the
understanding of cellular recognition processes and provide access to a variety
of useful biochemical tools.
