The objective of this research is the experimental and theoretical
investigation of vortices produced in a laboratory chamber. The field of motion
will be measured by a laser doppler velocimeter; the results, and the
suitability of future experiments, will be guided by an existing three
dimensional numerical model. The experimental vortices are designed to have a
useful similarity with those of broad geophysical interest.
