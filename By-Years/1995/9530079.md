9530079 Fryer Fluid venting from sediments is a critical component of the
overall mass geochemical balance along convergent continental margins where
oceanic crust and sediments are underthrust. To date, little attention has been
paid to this process at non-accretionary margins where underthrusting removes
essentially all of the oceanic sediment. The present project will provide
important new information on fluid venting in such regions by synthesizing
available data on sediment chemistry and tectonics from the Mariana arc region
where fluid venting is known to occur. The results of this study should provide
a useful guide with which to examine the distribution and magnitude of venting
through analysis of sediment chemistry and metamorphism, without the need for
costly geological and geophysical surveys. ***
