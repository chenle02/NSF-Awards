0421579&lt;br/&gt;Seibel&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are planning to build a new
research instruments for a true 3D display to view high resolution 3D data with
all depth cues in agreement. Current imaging systems suffer from the
accommodation-vergence mismatch limitation. The proposed system will provide
variable ocular accommodation cues that match vergence and stereoscopic retinal
disparity demands for objects at different distances in a 3D scene. The proposed
instrument promises to reduce eye fatigue and improve the quality of the 3-D
images.
