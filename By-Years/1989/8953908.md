The calculus curriculum is being restructured by integrating into the syllabus
student use of a personal computer as a working tool. A substantial body of new
courseware is being created that will enable the students to use a personal
computer as a regular part of their homework to explore, analyze, or verify the
central concepts of the calculus. Students are expected to write some of their
own software and/or to modify existing software as an integral part of the
course. The course materials are being substantially restructured in order to
incorporate the advantages which the presence of the computer affords. The
ultimate goal is to produce a new computer-based calculus text.
