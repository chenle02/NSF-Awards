The focus of this research is to develop a systematic study of radical
heterolysis reactions. The research will include kinetic and mechanistic studies
of radical cations, focusing on radical cations believed to be involved in the
rearrangement of methylmalonyl/coenzyme-A to succinate in vivo. Strained
3-membered ring "reporter groups" will be synthesized and opened photolytically
to measure the rate of radical formation by UV spectroscopy. This approach is
well suited for the study of alpha- and beta-carboxylate functionalized radicals
believed to be involved in the chemistry of B12 dependent enzymes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr.
Martin E. Newcomb of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois,
Chicago. Professor Newcomb will focus his research on the use of lasers to break
critical bonds related to the function of vitamin B12 in the human body. This
work will have impact on the design of new methods for catalysis in the
pharmaceutical industry, as well as important impacts on the understanding of
enzyme function. The educational activity of the award revolves around the
training of graduate students in the study of short-lived chemical
intermediates. &lt;br/&gt;
