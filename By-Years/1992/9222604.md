The Pliocene site of Hadar, central Afar, Ethiopia, has been one of the most
productive hominid fossil-bearing sites in the world, yielding up such fossils
as the Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy and First Family) finds. The aims of
this new phase of the excavations are 1) to refine the geochronologic framework
of the Hadar Formation, with special emphasis on the younger sediments; 2) to
recover hominid fossils especially from these more recent levels; and 3) to
document the paleoenvironments through detailed stratigraphic and sedimentologic
study. There is every expectation that it will be a successful and productive
expedition.
