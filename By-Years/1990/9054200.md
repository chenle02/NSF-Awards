The project is providing fifteen undergraduate faculty in Life Sciences with the
biological background and logistical information necessary to organize and offer
field trip/courses in ecology, invertebrate zoology, marine biology, animal
behavior or phycology. Participants are spending one week at a biological field
station on the northern Gulf of California in an intensive course in
invertebrate zoology, phycology, ecology and ecological field techniques. During
their training, they are gaining new knowledge about ecological interactions and
developing and testing a set of field ecology projects that they can have
students do in the future. Natural field study experiences are the most
effective way for students and teachers to gain an appreciation for the
complexity and beauty of nature. After organizing and running a field trip of
their own, the participants evaluate the effectiveness and relevance of the
training course as an aid to their teaching methods.//
