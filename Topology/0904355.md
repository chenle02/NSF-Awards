The main goal of this proposal is to transfer into higher dimensions some of the
techniques and intuition gained from recent spectacular progress in low
dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Current powerful tools include Perelman's work
on the Ricci flow, and over thirty years of insight gained from developing
Thurston's theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. While these techniques usually do
not transfer literally into higher dimensions, the PI thinks it is an opportune
moment to study the geometry and topology of higher-dimensional hyperbolic
manifolds, and benefit from lower-dimensional intuition and insights. This work
will build on an existing collaboration with Steven Kerckhoff.

With the natural motivation of understanding the 3 (or 4) dimensional world
around us, most research in geometry focuses on "low dimensions", usually
meaning less than 5. Nonetheless, in the modern world, higher dimensional
geometric objects are abundant: contemporary computer science employs abstract
"simplicial complexes" of very high dimension to model concrete systems,
studying financial markets often requires estimating integrals over high
dimensional spaces, and internet search engines rely on efficient linear algebra
algorithms for very large vector spaces. This proposal will focus on studying a
specific type of geometry in high dimensions, namely hyperbolic geometry.
Traditionally, approaching this subject was difficult without a powerful
computer. This is no longer a major obstacle, and it is possible to understand
concrete, yet complex, examples. The goal is to build on our low dimensional
intuition to better understand high dimensional objects.
