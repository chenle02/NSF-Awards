It had been recognized from the beginning that the existence and the pattern of
heavy flavors represent one of the central mysteries in Nature's Grand Design in
general and in the Standard Model (SM) in particular. Very considerable
experimental as well as theoretical attention has therefore been focused on
their study. These efforts have been intensified by the experiments at two B
factories, a tau-charm factory, at hadronic colliders and a comprehensive
program to study neutrino oscillations. They led to the first observation of CP
violation outside neutral kaons decays and clear evidence for neutrino
oscillations. The next step which is the core of this proposal is to have a
precise analysis methodology that will allow one to extract of the numerical
values of the fundamental parameters that drive CP violation in various systems,
rare decays and neutrino oscillations, namely quark masses, quark and lepton
mixing parameters. The theoretical framework for this analysis is the Heavy
Quark Expansion, where transition rates are described by an expansion in inverse
powers of the heavy quark mass. This is now at the stage of development where it
is possible to attempt to determine SM quark parameters from data with a
theoretical uncertainty not exceeding the very few percent level. To achieve
such a goal one has to subject a judiciously chosen host of data to a careful
quantitative theoretical analysis with a high degree of internal redundancy. One
actually hopes to find inconsistencies with the predictions from the SM, which
would constitute manifestations of New Physics beyond the SM.
