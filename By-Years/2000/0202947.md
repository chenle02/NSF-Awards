This multi-year collaborative project is developing, pilot testing,
institutionalizing, and disseminating a comprehensive program to recruit,
prepare, and retain future K-12 mathematics teachers with deep content
knowledge, effective pedagogical skills, and technological capabilities
necessary to enable all K-12 students to attain high standards of mathematical
achievement. Project partners include the Kansas State University (KSU) Center
for Science Education, KSU's College of Education and College of Arts and
Sciences, and three school districts: Geary County Unified School District,
Kansas City, Kansas Unified School District, and Manhattan-Ogden Unified School
District. The project team features mathematicians, mathematics educators, and
K-12 mathematics teachers, to ensure that teacher preparation is part of the
continuum of teacher education that extends through the induction years and
beyond. Five key components are: (1) innovative recruitment initiatives to
increase the number of traditional and nontraditional students entering K-12
mathematics teacher education (including minority and bilingual students, STEM
majors, community college students, and professionals); (2) a strong foundation
in challenging mathematics content and technological knowledge based on state
and national mathematics content standards linked to effective pedagogical
strategies; (3) effective research-based methods of teaching focused on national
and state mathematics teaching standards, current research, and best practice;
(4) extensive clinical field experiences teaching diverse learners in a variety
of Professional Development Schools under the guidance of mentor teachers; and
(5) continuous support and assistance for graduates during their initial three
years of teaching to facilitate their transition from teacher preparation to
practice. The project builds on established collaborations with mathematics
faculty from two-year feeder colleges to strengthen the mathematics courses
future teachers take at these colleges.
