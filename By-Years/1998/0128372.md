&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop software tools allowing educators, interpreters, and linguists
skilled in American Sign Language (ASL), but not skilled in computer 3-D
animation, to create fully grammatical synthesized ASL to provide access for
Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals to Internet web pages and CD-ROM based
interactive media; and to create interactive courses for learning ASL. While
this project will build upon Vcom3D's commercial SigningAvatar(TM) product, a
signficant advance is proposed. The current SigningAvatar(TM)technology allows
users to generate unique sentences in Signed English thus providing partial
access to digital media. However, the absence of many elements of ASL grammar
limits the use of SigningAvatar(TM) by the larger segment of the Deaf and Hard
of Hearing population who require grammatical ASL for comprehension and for ASL
courses.&lt;br/&gt; This project addresses the numerous requests to provide
fully grammatical ASL that Vcom3D has had from the Deaf community. The resulting
ASL products will significantly reduce federal costs of public school education
for Deaf children and will move toward improving universal access and equity of
service goals, as mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act; Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act; and Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act.
