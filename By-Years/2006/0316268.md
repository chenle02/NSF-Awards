David Anderson of the University of Wyoming is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program for research to verify experimentally to what extent
chemistry can be halted in cryogenic crystals of molecular hydrogen. Chemical
impurities added to hydrogen crystals at low concentrations will be
photochemically transformed in situ into reactive species such as radicals. Once
the reactive species are shown to be trapped in solid hydrogen by infrared
spectroscopy, laser excitation will be used to initiate chemical reactions under
highly controlled conditions in order to explore low temperature condensed phase
reaction dynamics at a molecular level of detail. Two important radical target
species are the imidogen radical (NH) and the hydroxyl radical (OH), whose
reactions with molecular hydrogen in the cryogenic hydrogen matrix will be
studied. Other possible radicals for hydrogen matrix study include NO, methyl
radical, and CN. Project outcomes are expected to provide chemical and
photophysical information useful for predicting outcomes of laser initiated
chemical reactions in novel low temperature condensed hydrogen from first
principles.

Frozen molecular hydrogen is an unusual condensed material, since at the low
temperatures at which it solidifies, the hydrogen crystal properties are
dominated by quantum mechanical behavior. Anderson's studies of reactions in
solid hydrogen will test the fundamental concepts involved in low temperature
condensed phase chemistry, provide insights into chemistry (or lack of it)
occurring in and on the surface of planets such as Jupiter, and potentially
allow for new ways of controlling chemical reaction pathways.
