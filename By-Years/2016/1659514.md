This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will support a diverse
group of computing majors in a mentored research experience in computational
robotics, including components emphasizing professional and academic skills
development and community building. The primary population of target students
will be sophomores and juniors from undergraduate-serving institutions in the
southeast. The project will encourage these students toward graduate study and
research-oriented industry positions, and provide essential preparation for
these career paths. It will be an excellent opportunity for ten undergraduates
to participate in research projects each year. The emphasis on applications of
computing in robotics is supportive of the growing social need for such
expertise. The selection process for these students will promote the inclusion
of underrepresented groups through targeted publicity and outreach
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research conducted by the students will lead to
more effective approaches to robot perception, control, and interaction. The
research also includes projects rooted in areas such as software engineering,
security, and automated reasoning that are often overlooked by the contemporary
robotics community, but crucially important for the deployment of reliable,
trustworthy robotic systems. The research projects will be organized around the
observation that "Robots Change Everything." That is, every aspect of a computer
system, from the design and engineering of its software, to its interactions
with humans, to its core functions of perception and movement, is deeply
impacted by the way robots must interact with the physical world.
