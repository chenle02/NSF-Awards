The strength and deformation of the ocean crust depends primarily on the
strength of the lower crust (oceanic layer 3) which is composed of gabbros. The
strength of these rocks have not been investigated in detail and this project is
designed to determine how the crust deforms when it is under pressure and when
it is partially molten. These results may explain why some mid-ocean ridges have
large axial valleys while others do not. The presence of melt also affects the
velocity of seismic waves and the viscosity of gabbro depends on the amount of
melt present and how it is distributed in the rock. This study is designed to
make these measurements so that we can model the deformation of the ocean crust
and the velocity of seismic waves.
