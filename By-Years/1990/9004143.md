This project consists of testing a model; the model includes results and
techniques from rock mechanics, chemistry and numerical analysis and constitutes
a new direction in theoretical geochemistry. It deals with alternating bedding
features in argillaceous carbonate rocks that have either formed from unbedded
argillaceous limestones or have had initial layering very strongly enhanced by
deformation. Excellent observational data are available on natural rocks for
comparison with the results of the model. A succesful model would greatly
improve our ability to understand what textural changes a rock may undergo due
to deformation.
