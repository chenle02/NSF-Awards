This project convenes a US-Japan Workshop on Earthquake Protective Systems in
Tsukuba, Japan in December 1992. This Workshop will involve researchers and
designers from both countries to discuss progress in the development and
application of earthquake protective systems to bridges. Topics to be covered
include: (1) innovative protective systems; (2) design methods for base isolated
bridges; (3) design of utilities carried by isolated bridges so as to
accommodate movement; and (4) full-scale verification of performance. A
comparison of US and Japanese isolation designs for the same bridge will also be
made. Designs will be completed before the 1992 Workshop, so that the results
are available for presentation and discussion. The program also includes site
visits to several base-isolated bridges as well as several major bridges
currently under construction in Japan. The Workshop is expected to produce
recommendations about cooperative research projects which are of benefit of both
countries.
