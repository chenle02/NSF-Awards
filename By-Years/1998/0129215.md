0129215&lt;br/&gt;Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award supports
US-France collaboration in economics between Simon Anderson of the University of
Virginia and Regis Renault of the University of Caen. The objective of their
research is to develop an economic theory of the content of advertising and
explore incentives used by firms regarding the amount and nature of information
they provide in advertisements. They will construct a model to demonstrate the
relationship between the amount of information revealed by a firm about its
products and corresponding market performance. The US and French researchers
have complementary expertise in economics. They collaborated previously on
research on firm pricing in the context of consumer search for prices and
product matches. This collaboration extends this initial research into new
areas. The research will advance understanding about economic and social impact
of advertising on firms, purchasing, product pricing and on the public
respectively.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of
parallel proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
investigator. The CNRS will support visits by the French researcher to the
United States. &lt;br/&gt;
