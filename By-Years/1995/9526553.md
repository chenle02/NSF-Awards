Coe 9526553 The paleomagnetic record of a geomagnetic field reversal from Steens
Mountain basalt flows has provided valuable insights into the behavior of the
reversing geodynamo. However, the PI's controversial discovery of large,
systematic variation of remanence direction as a function of demagnetization
temperature and vertical position within individual flows is explained quite
well by a hypothesis that invokes brief episodes of astonishingly rapid field
change during the reversal. If true, however, it has significant implications
for the geodynamo, the core, and mantle--rates of change of field at the earth's
surface three orders of magnitude larger than currently observed, fluid
velocities at the top of the core much larger than currently modeled, and very
low and/or laterally inhomogeneous electrical conductivity of the lower mantle.
The implications of these findings are central to the field of paleomagnetics.
The PI proposes to undertake further stringent tests of his hypothesis, and, if
it is not supplanted by a better alternative, to provide a more complete and
accurate description of the changes in direction and magnitude of the
geomagnetic field during cooling of the individual flows. He also plans to fill
in and greatly extend the Steens Mountain record below the transition zone in
order to check for precursory signals and to better establish the character of
the pre-transitional field.
