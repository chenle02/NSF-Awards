Seismic structure of the Earth's crust is important for the understanding of the
formation and evolution of continents and ocean basins. The resolution of
current global crustal models are limited by highly inhomogeneous data coverage
as refraction and reflection experiments and receiver function analysis are
sparse in oceanic regions and remote continent interiors. Seismic surface waves
can be potentially used to better constrain crustal structure at a global scale
as they propagate in the outer shell of the earth and provide best spatial
coverage compared with other seismic data sets. However, understanding the
lateral and vertical resolution of surface waves in global crustal tomography
remains a challenge. This research will integrate development of finite-
frequency theory for Moho discontinuity imaging and wave propagation simulations
using the Spectral Element Method to investigate resolution limits of ray theory
and finite-frequency theory in surface-wave tomography of global crustal
structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will develop finite-frequency
theory based on travelling-wave mode coupling for imaging the Moho discontinuity
topography in anisotropic media and investigate resolution limits in non-linear
global crustal tomography based on phase-velocity sensitivity kernels. The team
will quantify the scale-dependence of diffractional effects in global crustal
models as well as resolution limits associated with approximations in
tomographic theory and imperfect global data coverage. The tradeoff between
wavespeed and Moho topography will be analyzed in joint inversions of
discontinuity topography and wavespeed structure.
