The objective of this research program is to theoretically investigate the role
of transverse effects in semiconductor laser systems. It is well known, for
example, the broad area lasers such as semiconductor lasers are able to support
many transverse modes which can result in mode hopping as well as spatial and
temporal instabilities unless such techniques as optical and carrier confinement
are employed to minimize these difficulties. The study of semiconductor lasers
requires models different from the traditional two-level atom formulation to
describe complicated band structure, injected carrier densities, background
dispersive effects, and the small geometries of the laser devices. Nevertheless,
the semiconductor laser dynamics show remarkable similarities to the predictions
of the simpler models. Because of this and of the existing numbers of
semiconductor lasers and new systems on the horizon, an appropriate first step
is to ask how an existing model can serve as a description. Second, how can the
theoretical requirements of semiconductor laser devices be combined with the
existing structure of the Maxwell-Bloch configuration to determine an
appropriate set to equations for coupling the field and active medium? Third,
design an experiment to demonstrate theoretical results in the spirit that
theory guides, experiment decides. The third objective will be done in a joint
collaboration.
