This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ricard A. Godoy, Brandeis
University, will continue for four more years (2010-2013) an innovative and
successful summer training program in field methods for anthropology doctoral
students. The field school, which focuses on teaching methods to collect
socioeconomic and bio-cultural data, is conducted in communities of the native
Tsimane people in lowland Amazonia Boliva. The intensive program is run seven
days a week for five weeks each summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students must be
fluent in Spanish and show commitment to research and potential for scientific
careers. They are trained in techniques of ethnographic probing, surveys, focus
groups, scans, pile sorts, triads, experiments, anthropometric measures, and
bio-markers. Hallmarks of the approach include: (a) moving students through most
stages of research, from design, to hypotheses formulation, to pilot-testing
methods, to data collection, cleaning, analysis, ending with presentation of
results; (b) close, personal mentoring by faculty; (c) learning to work in
groups as they pursue answers to questions of common interest; and (d) learning
about the daily management of fieldwork. The core faculty comprise three
cultural and two biological anthropologists, most of whom who have worked
together with the Tsimane since 1999. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strengthening
methods training for advanced anthropology graduate students is important to
assuring new generations of competitive social scientists. Because
anthropologists routinely conduct field research, training that is actually
conducted in realistic field settings is essential, but difficult to do in
university-based graduate programs. Thus this program fills a critical need. It
also has a strong record of starting students on successful careers and of
recruiting women and members of underrepresented groups.
