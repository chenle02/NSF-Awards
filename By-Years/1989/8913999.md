Low-energy collective excitations in quenched disordered solids, the motion of
vacancies in quantum crystals, and transport in highly polarized Fermi liquids
will be studied. NMR and thermal transport measurements will be used to study
low temperature relaxation in orientational glass states of N2/Alkali metal
solid mixtures and NaCN/KCN mixed crystals. The existence of universality
classes for the growth kinetics of correlated clusters in quenched disordered
systems will be tested. Quantum tunneling of vacancies in isotopic helium solid
solutions close to the melting curve will be studied with pulsed NMR. The
effects of the onset of degeneracy on spin diffusion and transport properties of
small, highly polarized helium-three droplets phase separated from solid
solutions will be studied.
