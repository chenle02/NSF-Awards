The effect of aerosols on clouds (aerosol indirect effect) has critically
important relevance to radiative transfer and climate forcing. The aerosol
indirect effect is still poorly understood, this aggravated by a severe paucity
of high quality experimental field data required to produce accurate
parameterizations and properly constrain analytical models. This project
involves a series of field experiments on the Office of Naval Research Center
for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (ONR/CIRPAS) Twin Otter
research aircraft (with extramural funding from ONR confirmed) as part of the
Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation (ITCT) project during
summer 2004 over the Northeastern United States. The California Institute of
Technology (CalTech) group will collect a variety of meteorological, aerosol
microphysical and chemical data from the Twin Otter and follow with detailed
analyses and three-dimensional radiative transfer modeling. The ultimate goal of
this project is a robust closure study comparing measured terms in the radiation
budget to predictions of those terms from aerosol and cloud properties. Taking
into account more advanced aerosol-cloud interaction parameterizations involving
low-altitude clouds will lead to more representative modeling of aerosol-cloud-
radiation processes on a variety of scales under a general circulation model
framework. Results from this study will provide new data and improved insight to
our understanding of clouds and climate, reducing present large uncertainties
related to quantifying current and predicting future climate change. Broader
educational impacts include support for one postdoctoral scholar and two
graduate students at CalTech. Through a subcontract to Georgia Institute of
Technology to incorporate field data into a general circulation model aerosol-
cloud interaction module an additional graduate student will be supported.
