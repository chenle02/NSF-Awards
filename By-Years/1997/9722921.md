The solution to many questions in evolutionary biology and agricultural science
depend on the accurate estimation of the level of genetic variation and
covariation present in the populations being studied. In this project, the
investigator is developing software for estimating quantitative genetic
parameters using statistical resampling methods, as well as theoretically
verifying the applicability of these methods. In addition, novel techniques for
comparing the pattern of genetic and phenotypic variation and covariation
between two or more populations are also being developed and the software for
conducting these tests provided. Tremendous advances in high performance
computing over the last decade have made it possible to address many difficult
statistical problems by repeatedly recalculating the statistical estimate after
randomly resampling from the population or sample under study. Estimates of
genetic variation within populations, which are essential for understanding how
natural and artificial selection operate, have complex statistical properties,
making them especially suitable for resampling approaches. The software
developed in this project helps biologists in a variety of fields analyze their
experiments in more powerful and innovative ways. This work is supported by the
Computational Biology Activity and the Program in Population Biology (both BIO
programs).
