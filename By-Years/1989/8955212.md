Clemson University will conduct a four-year program based on implementing
recommendations in the NCTM Standards for middle school and secondary schools.
Target subject matter areas are pre-algebra, geometry, introductory algebra, and
intermediate algebra, which together constitute the college preparatory track in
the target district. Expected outcomes include integration of graphic
calculators and computer software throughout the Pickens County School District.
The model includes a cooperative effort among Clemson University, the Pickens
County School District, and local industry, each strongly committed to success
of the effort. The program features summer workshops for content and pedagogy
enhancement and for adapting existing materials to be used by teachers and
students in the implementation. The Pickens County School District and Clemson
University, with the cooperation of Texas Instruments and National Cash
Register, have contributed an amount equal to 33% of the NSF request.
