David Coker of Boston University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program to study excited state dynamics in condensed
phase systems. Using the iterative linear approach to coherent propagation of
reduced density matrices, the PI and his research group are 1) modeling exciton
dynamics in multi-chromophore light harvesting systems, 2) exploring vibrational
dephasing and relaxation of molecules in driven environments and 3) studying
mixed quantum-classical subsystems embedded in larger multi-scale environments.
In collaboration with experimentalists, they are also studying the efficacy of
excited state proton transfer for activating organic molecules.

This research has the potential for broad impact in several areas of scientific
and societal importance including solar energy technology, quantum information
science and highly selective organic synthesis.
