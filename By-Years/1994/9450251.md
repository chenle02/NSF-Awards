9450251 Geary This geoscience project proposes to develop and disseminate an
integrated, interactive multimedia, computer-based curriulum for middle school
earth science students (grades 5-8). The program would enable students to
explore real data for developing and testing hypotheses. Problems are posed by
the curriculum and lesson sequences center on solving a specific earth science
problem with designed software tools. A constructivists learning model is used.
Students prepare their own workbooks in this project and evaluate their
progress. The GET-IT lessonware would serve both as instruction software and as
a research tool.
