Four experiments on liquid helium 3 and helium 4 at temperatures below 0.1K are
proposed: 1) Solubility and diffusion- coefficient measurements to test some
recent predictions of Fermi Liquid theory. 2) Measurement of the Kapitza thermal
conductance and of the transmission of transverse spin waves across the
interface between superfluid A and B phases of helium 3, and 3) a related
experiment involving helium 3/helium 4 mixtures, these two experiments being
designed to determine the transmission probabilities of helium 3 quasiparticles
across the interfaces. 4) A test of recent theory by measuring the reflection
probability of rotons at the free surface of liquid helium 4. The liquid state
of helium (and hydrogen), which can only be produced at extremely low
temperatures, close to absolute zero, furnishes an example of a "quantum fluid"
where Nature shows us an example of quantum mechanics operating on a "bulk" (or
"macroscopic") scale. Such a fluid evidences very unusual properties and offers
a fertile ground for research into the fundamental properties of matter. The
present experiments are designed to examine some of those properties in depth
and thus deepen our understanding of this strange realm of the physical world.
