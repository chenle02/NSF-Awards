The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary workshop on relaxation in random
systems is to bring physists from the two countries together in Hungary during
January 11-15, 1988 to discuss the latest experimental developments in
disordered systems which fundamentally infuence properties of various materials
such as structural glasses and spin glasses. The U.S. organizer will be Dr.
George Mozurkewich of the University of Illinois, with Dr. Laszlo Mihaly of the
Central Research Institute of Physics serving as organizer for the Hungarian
side. Emphasis will be on the cross-correlation of experimental results in
related fields with the intent of improving the theoretical framework for
understanding common aspects of the relaxation phenomena observed in solid state
physics. This activity fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge in physics by enabling leading experts from the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents, pool resources and share
research experience in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
