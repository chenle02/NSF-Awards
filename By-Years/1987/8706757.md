As neurobiological data accumulate and better methods are devised for extracting
anatomical and physiological information about nervous systems, a profoundly
difficult problem remains: how can we use what we know to explain higher
functions in terms of neuronal networks? What are the dynamical principles which
yield complex effects from the behavior of individual neurons? Theoretical
approaches are underway in various places, and one striking and important
development in this context is the connectionist strategy. Combined with serious
neurobiological constraints, this has engendered a new enterprise--computational
neuroscience. Dr. Churchland in collaboration with Dr. Terrence J. Sejnowski, is
seeking to provide a panoramic view of the theoretical task and give a unique
integration of material from neurobiology, psychophysics and computer science.
They will explore the computational strategies used by human and other nervous
systems, presenting detailed examples of promising computational results, of the
limits of the models, and of problems remaining. The project is on interest both
for the neurosciences and philosophy of science. Philosophically, the principal
interest concerns the role and character of representations and computations in
neural network theories, and in the emergence of reductive explanations.
