This research will investigate the residential and occupational integration of
European immigrants and migrant Southern blacks in New York and Chicago between
1880 and 1920. Previous research has analyzed these questions using samples from
individual Census data in 1900 and 1920. The availability of a 100% sample of
the 1880 Census makes possible linkages back to an era when immigration from
West Europe was at its height and immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe
was just beginning. The 1880 data will enable answers to such questions as
whether the greater integration in 1900 of the first immigrant groups (e.g.,
Germans and Irish) over more recent immigrants (e.g., Italians and Russians) was
because of their longer history of assimilation or because they were never as
segregated in the first place. Matching 1920 individuals and families back to
1880 greatly enhances the ability to study inter-generational mobility and to
distinguish 3rd and 4+ generation Americans who have been previously classified
together as "native whites".
