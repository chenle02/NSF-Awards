This project will support attendance by early-career scientists at the Keystone
Symposia on RNA Silencing in Plants to be held in Keystone, CO on February
17-22, 2015. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters,
which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.
There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for
exploring collaborative possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of RNA
silencing is fast-moving and many new developments have arisen since the last
conference on this topic was held in 2010. This conference will present the
latest research in this area through sessions that include: small RNA biogenesis
and stability, RNA silencing and germ cell fate, RNA-dependent chromatin
modification, transcriptional epigenetic inheritance, chromosomal RNA silencing,
RNA signaling, DNA methylation and demethylation, and novel biological functions
of noncoding RNA. The conference will be forward-looking with many potential
applications in plant breeding and biotechnology.
