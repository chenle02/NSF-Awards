EEC-9700753 Harmon ABSTRACT The award provides funding to the University of
California-Los Angeles, under the direction of Dr. Thomas Harmon, for the
support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Virtual
Reality in the Environmental Engineering Curriculum." This project's goals are
to incorporate recent developments in environmental restoration research to the
civil and environmental engineering curriculum; to do so using recent
breakthroughs in virtual reality programming language (VRML) and to evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach as a teaching tool and its potential to
infuse the engineering curriculum with currently developing techniques. This
project will link the recent research results in Civil and Environmental
Engineering with those of an investigator in the field of visualization and
virtual simulations in UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Design. The
tangible product of the proposed research will be an interactive site
investigation software (ISIS) package. The design project for the course will be
based on a virtual reality/real time simulator of a hazardous waste site. The
students will visualize the site at the computer terminal, and travel throughout
the site using a mouse-controlled cursor.
