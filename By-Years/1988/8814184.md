This program will use facilities and expertise developed with past NSF support
to embark on a combined experimental and theoretical effort of fundamental and
applied research. The fundamental research will be a study of anomalous current
penetration. It is well known from classical eletromagnetic theory and also from
experience in many practical situations, that high frequency AC currents do not
penetrate uniformly through conductors as do DC currents but rather are confined
to a narrow suface region called the skin layer. It is widely presumed that this
classical skin effect is an unavoidable law of nature; this presumption is
incorrect because the skin effect is based on Ohm's law which is not
fundamental. In fact, the classical skin effect occurs only when the elementary
form of Ohm's law together with a symmetry assumption apply; this situation
corresponds to current penetration by laminar diffusion. In the more complicated
situations to be studied here, asymmetric geometry is incorporated and the
elementary Ohm's law is replaced by a more complex form; these changes allow
stochastic or convective diffusion to occur with the consequence of much greater
current penetration than provided by laminar diffusion. The applied research
will consist of a serious attempt to use magnetohyrodynamic plasma stabilization
techniques to eliminate instabilities endemic and injurious to the arcs in
electric furnaces used by the steel industry. Paranthetically, these electric
furnaces provide approximately one third of the total steel manufactured in the
U.S.
