A recently acquired, versatile, state-of-the-art gas chromatograph/mass
selective detector (GC/MSD) is now being used in the undergraduate chemistry
program at Carleton College. Direct student access to this sophisticated
microcomputer-controlled instrument provides powerful motivation for students to
follow careers in science. The system is used in both upper-level and
introductory-level courses, including the junior-year integrated laboratory
sequence, undergraduate research projects, organic chemistry, and the
introductory chemistry laboratory. A significant fraction of the chemistry
majors at Carleton are women.
