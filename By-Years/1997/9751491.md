This project provides global positioning system (GPS) field survey stations and
a geographical information systems- (GIS) capable computer laboratory that
allows the Biology Department to integrate new instrumentation and a
contemporary analytical method into the introductory laboratory series.
Development of a GPS/GIS-based curriculum in landscape and spatial ecology and
incorporating GPS and GIS is a high priority of the Biology Department and the
college. Demonstrated student interest in GPS/GIS-based ecological research now
exceeds the ability to deliver instruction through the summer research program.
Professional interest in GIS and GPS is also very strong locally as well as in
the larger context of the ecological community of scholars, where use of GPS and
GIS in field ecological study is pervasive. Undergraduate biology departments
that expect to provide qualified graduates to job candidate pools and graduate
programs must furnish access to these tools. There are significant reasons why
this education should occur in a liberal arts context rather than more technical
or discipline-based academic settings. The strength of the liberal arts
perspective stems from use of a critical and self-critical framework for
developing knowledge. A liberal arts approach to science emphasizes the utility
of hypothesis testing performed by a skilled but skeptical practitioner and
evaluated by an experienced but self-critical theoretician. This liberal arts
approach is at the base of the Inclusive Science Research Experience. Students
learn to use quantitative information to evaluate the quality of data. The
investigative activities that use GPS field stations from this project and GIS
analyses performed in the new laboratory can adopt this approach. GPS data
contains within it indications of quality that can be used to develop data
quality standards for any project. Geostatistical procedures exist that can
evaluate the quality of GIS maps and provide confidence intervals for analyses
performed across themes. This project's two-step program produces students who
know how to assess GPS and GIS data quality and can provide research designs
that achieve high-quality results. *
