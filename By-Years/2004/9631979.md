9631979 Briles This laboratory has been studying the immune system of chickens
and other birds, and has identified their erythrocyte and MHC alloantigen
systems. During the last grant period they genetically mapped and examined MHC
associated fitness effects in chickens, and identified and mapped some of their
leukocyte specific alloantigens. In this proposal they will identify alloantigen
systems in other captive species, including the pheasant and quail, as well as
continue the genetic identification of the loci for the leukocytes specific
alloantigens in the chicken. The alloantigens will also be characterized
biochemically. They will examine the interaction between segregating alleles of
these alloantigen systems and another locus that have identified, in the
resistance or susceptibility to disease. They also propose to look at these
systems in other species, and this work will be done in collaboration with other
investigators. These studies are important for understanding comparative
immunology, evolutionary development, and environmental adaptation of species.
