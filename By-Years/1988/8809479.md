Concurrent systems with dynamic interprocess topology present a new control
problem in computer programming. Currently programmers are forced to describe
topologies at a level analogous to that of the pointer or the goto statement.
The investigator proposes the use of a technology based on graph grammars to
control interconnections in a high-level, abstract manner. The computational
agents in our system communicate through sets of ports. Each port is connected
to a set of other agents. A graph grammar is used to specify the class of legal
topologies, which may be altered by rewriting using a production in the grammar.
This may change the connectivity of agents. A high-level selection mechanism is
employed to enable an agent to select subsets of agents connected to particular
ports for communication. Agents consist of a set of methods; when a message is
received the appropriate method for processing that message is invoked. The
research under this grant involves the investigation of language features and
programming environment support necessary for a graph- grammar based approach to
concurrent programming, the implementation of the system both on shared-memory
and message-passing architectures, and the investigation of algorithms for the
mapping of logical graph topologies onto physical processor topologies.
