This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop Damage
Models applicable to composite and metallic structures. These models will be
implemented in a finite element based software package. The types of damage
considered include single and multiple akin cracks, delaminationa and
penetration holes. Particular emphasis is placed on developing damage models
applicable to stitched dry preform/resin film infusion (S/RFI) composites. If
the research is successful, widespread application could result among industries
which must design and maintain damage tolerant structures made of metallic and
composite materials such as aerospace companies and engine manufacturers.
