The Math and Science, Technology, Engineering Reinforcement (MASTER) Scholar
Program is providing twenty scholarships per year to students with strong
academic ability and financial need to study a variety of STEM disciplines
including Agroecology, Biology, Chemistry, Drafting Technology, Engineering,
Mathematics, Natural Resource Biology, and Physics. The project's intellectual
merit rests on an experienced faculty and staff with access to institutional and
community resources that are dedicated to increasing student engagement and
supporting student transition into four-year programs and/or the workforce.
Specific project activities include faculty mentoring; a special one-credit
course for all scholars on professional skills, time and stress management,
career orientation, and introduction to internship opportunities; and career
placement and transfer services. The project's broader impacts are being felt
through its provision of opportunity to students in a rural region in the Rocky
Mountain West. The project also sees importance in the peer influence of its
scholars on other prospective STEM students and the potential for the overall
project to serve as a model for similar small rural institutions.
