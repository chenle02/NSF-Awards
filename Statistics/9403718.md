Tran Density and regression under dependence have recently received increasing
attention. This research covers two broad but related areas, nonparametric
density estimation and nonparametric regression. The dependence dealt with is of
serial or spatial type. Optimality results on nonparametric functional
estimation for serially dependent random variables have been mostly of the
asymptotic type. The practical question as to what to do in the small sample
case is of great concern and still poses basic challenges. The purpose of this
research is to extend existing theory toward the needs of practitioners. The
objective is the development of a finite sample theory for nonparametric density
and regression estimators. Another major feature of the current proposal is the
extension of certain results on nonparametric density and regression known for
time series to random fields. Different density estimators and both fixed and
random regression designs are to be investigated. In contrast to traditional
statistical theory, nonparametric estimation gives a flexible approach to data
analysis without requiring detailed knowledge or assumptions about the process
under investigation. The goal of the research is to develop nonparametric
statistical theory to better serve practitioners. The applicability of the
investigation will be demonstrated by concrete and real-life examples. The long-
range goal is to develop nonparametric techniques for digital image processing,
and even for the analysis of data which are both space and time varying, such as
data obtained from a series of digitized photographs taken at different times.
The proposed research also has potential application to the analysis of data
collected irregularly at different space and time points. The resulting
methodology may prove important for processing environmental data and data from
geology, soil science and meteorology. ***
