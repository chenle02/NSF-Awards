This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
methods and software that can be used to evaluate or explore the impact of human
population and land-use changes on species viability. Changes in human
population and land use affect the viability of native species through habitat
loss to agriculture, urban sprawl, and industrial development; habitat
fragmentation; decreased habitat quality; and increased direct harvest of
species. Existing RAMAS software for modeling the effect of changes in the
quality and amount of habitat on the viability of species will be modified to
allow the incorporation of the human element into this methodology. It will lead
to software that will be used to forecast the changes in the human population,
and the effect of these changes on the land-use and resource-use patterns. These
results will be used to predict the changes in the habitat of native species,
and to assess species viability and persistence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial application of this project will be a specialized software product,
the market for which would include federal, state and local planning agencies,
international development organizations, academic institutions and non-profit
research organizations.
