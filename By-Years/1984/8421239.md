Travel assistance is provided for attendance at the Fifth Danube Symposium on
Chromatography, Yalta, USSR, November 11-16, 1985. The principal investigator is
invited by the organizing committee of the Symposium to present one of the main
lectures on ion exchange. Attending the symposium gives participants the
opportunity to exchange information with many other workers in ion exchange and
chromatography, potentially important processes for the recovery of specialty
chemical products.
