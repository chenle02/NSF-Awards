The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), or TeraGrid, involves nine resource
providers operating high-performance computing, information, and visualization
facilities, interconnected by a dedicated optical network and integrated with a
set of common software that presents the user community with a cohesive set of
resources and services. On October 1, 2004, the ETF will conclude a three-year
construction effort to create this distributed environment and will transition
into an operational state. This proposal outlines a set of services to be
provided at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center as part of the TeraGrid system.
PSC will enable leading-edge scientific inquiry by providing and operating an
integrated resources environment to TeraGrid users. It comprises capability-
computing platforms supported by tightly coupled, high-performance storage,
visualization, and networking systems. PSC personnel will work directly with
selected users to improve the performance of their applications on the TG
systems, emphasizing scaling to large processor counts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under a separate proposal, PSC will acquire, install,
bring up, integrate, stabilize, assess and test on a representative set of
initial applications, an early model (prototype) supercomputing system. Based on
the Red Storm system now under construction by Cray, Inc. for the Sandia
National Laboratory (SNL), it is designed to be a highly scalable capability
system for very demanding, high-end computational scientific and engineering
research applications. It will be interfaced to, and served by, the PSC file and
network systems and will be a component of the TeraGrid. This proposal includes
efforts required to integrate the significant new resource into the PSC and TG
environment. The system will be sufficiently large to support a broad range of
testing to establish its viability, at a larger scale, as a leadership-class
resource for the open U.S. research community. &lt;br/&gt;
