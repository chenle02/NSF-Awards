The Behavioral Sciences Computer Laboratory is designed to provide students in
the undergraduate behavioral science course sequence at Union College with the
computer hardware and software necessary to develop statistical analysis and
research methodological skills. The project will establish a facility with a
networked cluster of fifteen computer workstations. In addition to formal
laboratory exercises, the facility will also support student-selected
independent research projects. This project provides students with access to
modern computer equipment and greatly enhances their educational and career
opportunities.
