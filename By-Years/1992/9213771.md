A fundamental, unresolved problem in olfactory research is the identification
of multicellular pathways involved in coding odors and how ensembles of neurons
are activated by specific odors at different levels of the olfactory system.
Using a new, novel technique from molecular cell biology, the c-fos gene
expression technique is being used as a marker in spiney lobster olfactory
system in conjunction with intracellular identification. The question of how
pattern discriminations are formed is being addressed at both the receptor cell
level and in the central olfactory system as well. These studies expand the
current research technical expertise of this minority neuroscientist, via
collaborative efforts, into new and novel methodologies in molecular
neurobiology.
