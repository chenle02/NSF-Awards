9308931 Peters The electronics industry is characterized by wide product
variety, rapid product changes, and short product life cycle. Flexible assembly
systems have been cited as a production system able to cope with the challenges
of this type of environment. However, little research has been done to
investigate what constitutes a flexible assembly system or how to design them.
This research will investigate the design and planning of flexible assembly
systems from a strategic perspective. The objective of the research are
threefold: (1) to characterize flexibility and to determine the causes of
flexibility, (2) to develop analysis tools for determining an initial system
design under time varying production requirements, where the system design
consists of the number of facilities, the configuration of each facility, the
capacity of each facility, and the assignment of products to facilities; and (3)
to develop analysis tools and solution methodologies for determining and
evaluating strategies for system changeovers over time, including product
reassignments and capacity and configuration changes. Currently, practitioners
are ill equipped to address flexibility issues and to make strategic planning
decisions in rapidly changing environments. This research will provide tools to
aid decision makers in designing and planning flexible assembly systems.
