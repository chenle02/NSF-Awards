The majority of stars occur in binary, tertiary, and still higher order systems.
Some of the stars in binary systems are in such close proximity of each other
that they strongly effect each other's structures and evolution. In such
"interacting" binaries, one frequently observes mass transfer from one star to
the other, an accretion disk around the mass receiving star, and heating and
structural distortions of the stars' atmospheres and the disk. The Principal
Investigator proposes to study these phenomena in the case of a selected group
of interacting binaries, employing simultaneous photometry and spectroscopy. The
instrument to be used will be the one-meter Illinois reflector that is now
located at the Mount Laguna Observatory 50 miles east of San Diego and
maintained by the Astronomy Department of the San Diego State University. The
work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Paul B. Etzel of the San
Diego State University.
