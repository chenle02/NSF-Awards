The synthesis of diamond at low pressure by the plasma assisted vapor
deposition process has opened up the prospect for the realization of diamond
based electronic devices with superior performance and high temperature and
radiation tolerance capabilities. Such applications require the diamond film to
be in single crystal form. The realization of epitaxial grown single crystal
diamond in any significant size, however, remains as an illusive goal mainly due
to present lack of understanding and ability to control the nucleation process.
An alternate strategy for low pressure homo-epitaxial growth of single crystal
diamond films which preserves the substrate by employing cyclic growth, lift-off
and regrowth is proposed. The strategy is based on sub-level amorphization by
ion-implantation techniques that have been demonstrated in other contexts. The
Phase I effort is to determine if these techniques can be combined sequentially
and remain effective, leading to the realization of an effective technique for
the preparation of single crystal diamond films.
