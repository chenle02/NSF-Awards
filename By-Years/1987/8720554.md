This is a project to conduct a detailed rock magnetic and finite strain study
to determine whether rock strain during folding is typically of the correct
magnitude and geometry to rotate a prefolding magnetization into a synfolding
configuration. The effects of layer parallel simple shear strain on remanence-
carrying grains will be investigated through field investigations and laboratory
modeling experiments. In the field component of this project, the PI will study
the finite strain and remanence in several mid-Paleozoic Appalachian clastic
rocks from the Valley and Ridge Province which are known to carry stable signals
(eg. Bloomsburg Formation, Juniata Formation, Rose Hill Formation). The finite
strain of some of these rocks has been studied (eg. green reduction spots in the
Bloomsburg Formation). The results of these studies will be extended by the
investigation of progressive, noncoaxial deformation recorded by syntectonic
pressure fibers around rigid grains and/or in syntectonic extension veins.
Sampling schemes will be designed to compare the remanence in strained and
unstrained rocks to detect rotation of remanence. In the laboratory component of
this study, the PI will deform a synthetic magnetic sediment by simple shear
strain to determine the effects of a well- controlled, constant volume,
noncoaxial deformation on remanence- carrying grains.
