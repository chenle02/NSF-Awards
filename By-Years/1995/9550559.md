This project will substantially increase the enrollment, achievement and
preparation of African American students in the Omaha Public Schools for
university studies in mathematics and science. Teachers will learn to use
appropriate adaptive instruction to meet the needs and interests of their
students. High standards of achievement consistent with state and national
frameworks will be used to judge student success on standardized and performance
based assessments. The project has been planned and will be implemented with the
guidance of a representative Advisory Council. School staff will use a Total
Quality Management approach to analyze the documented results of their work,
revise strategies, and implement them. Staff will participate in a professional
development curriculum designed to change instruction and enrollment in advanced
science and mathematics. Articulation among schools will be improved by
increasing personalized information about the success and needs of African
American students. Support for student interest and motivation will be addressed
by enrichment and community support activities. Students will have a number of
enrichment opportunities including summer camps that will demonstrate use of
science and mathematics in ecology, agriculture, health services, finance,
engineering and others. Students will master science and mathematics curriculum
with school and community based tutoring when necessary. The project will serve
as a collaboration point for a number of existing programs in the community and
school system, clarifying objectives and coordinating services. The project will
be carefully evaluated and judged and will be implemented to assure continuation
after NSF funding is ended. Records and materials will be organized so the
project can be described for replication. ***
