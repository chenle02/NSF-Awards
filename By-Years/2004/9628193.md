This project takes a broad information-theoretic approach to the exchange of
information over a network of many users in the presence of interference and
noise. The problems considered include: distributed transmission and reception
of information; distributed computation; distributed data-compression; the
cooperative use of distributed data; the role of feedback in communication
networks; the theoretical contrast of CDMA, TDMA and FDMA in mobile
communication environments; and the investigation of distortion-free rate
distortion theory. Also considered are certain information-theoretic questions
concerning: speech processing; speech recognition; data compression; investment;
energy bounds for computation; and thermodynamics. It may also be possible to
show the formal identity of rate-distortion theory and investment theory and
ultimately to demonstrate that the work in universal data compression can apply
directly to universal investment algorithms. The research seeks a unified view
of distributed communication and data processing. Steps toward such a theory
should have good practical applications, as recent advances in CDMA and
universal data compression attest.
