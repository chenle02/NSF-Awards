Over time in a location, common species tend to remain common while rare
species remain rare. Biologists have long been interested in determining what
factors or processes regulate or control population size. Recently, the effect
of human activities in decreasing the abundance of some species has become more
apparent. With increasing interest in protecting biological diversity has come
an attempt to identify the factors affecting the survival of rare and endangered
species. This research investigates the effects of population size on the
performance of individual plants within those populations. Two species of
thistle occurring in the mountains of New Mexico will be studied: one a rare
species (protected as a federally Threatened species) and the other a more
common thistle of similar environments. Populations of different sizes (ranging
from 10 to over 3000 individuals) will be selected from known populations of the
rare species; individual plants within these populations will be monitored.
Similar observation will be carried out on artificial populations of the common
species, which will be established with plants transplanted by the investigator.
Estimates of the rates of survival, seed production, and so on in these
populations will be used in computer models to assess the viability (the chances
for continued persistence) of extremely small populations of the threatened
species. This research will shed light on the processes that regulate population
size in plants, both common and rare. The research will also test methods for
assessing the viability of small populations. Such techniques are essential for
land managers and government agencies making decisions about which species or
populations are worthy candidates for conservation efforts.
