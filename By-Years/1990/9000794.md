Undergraduate students who have completed their second year in agricultural
and/or biological engineering education will engage in research experiences with
ongoing research projects. One-on-one faculty guidance will provide up to six
different research project opportunities in a 10-week summer program. Projects
primarily related to engineering of biological systems include instrumentation
for estrus detection, anaerobic composting and digestion, mechanical properties
of frozen bio-materials, and water quality control for aquaculture. Agricultural
engineering related projects include robotic machines in grape pruning,
torsional analysis of rigid diaphragms, and greenhouse environmental control.
One-half of the summer program students will be recruited from other
institutions and a concentrated effort will be made to recruit minorities from
the 1890 Institutions. Minority and women alumni of the previous program will be
encouraged to recommend fellow students for this program. The program will
provide students with guidance of independent sub- project activity with
increasing responsibility as the student gains experience. Written and oral
reports of their research experience are required. A Presentations Day will be
scheduled at the end of each study period (summer, fall and spring) for all
student participants. The program is planned to generate additional student
project proposals by the faculty and to provide a long-term model for a
continuing program.
