The goal of this research is to investigate novel nonequilibrium alloying
technique for developing lightweight materials with enhanced strength and
corrosion resistance. Specifically, magnesium and aluminum alloyed with
additional transitional elements such as Cr, Mo, Ta, and W will be considered.
Layered vapor deposits, or graded structures, will be produced using these
materials as a means of producing bulk alloys with enhanced properties. The
research will build upon early work on passive film structure and the role of
non-crystallinity, chemistry and defect structure on passivity and mechanisms
responsible for enhancement in mechanical properties at high temperatures.
