Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Academic Involvement For Professional
Success (AIPS) Program targets needy students, many of whom are first-generation
college students, at Adams State College (ASC), a small rural public institution
in the San Luis Valley of Southern Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship
money helps qualified students become role models for the other students in the
pre-engineering, mathematics, and computer science areas. Fifteen (15)
scholarships are awarded in year one, increasing to 20 for years 2 through 4 of
this project. These selected scholars are encouraged to participate in
departmental and campus-wide activities that not only expose them to
opportunities designed to heighten their academic experience, but that increase
their chances and desire to succeed as professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
involvement of the AIPS students in these programs also provides a critical mass
of students, giving non-scholarship students within the mathematics, Computer
Science and Physics Department at ASC the same opportunities for development and
encouragement.&lt;br/&gt;
