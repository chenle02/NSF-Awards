9731244 Goldenberg The Education Developoment Center (EDC) is developing, field-
testing, and disseminating professional development materials for mathematics
teachers in grades 6-12. These materials highlight connections between important
mathematics, effective teaching practices, and the implementation of innovative
instructional materials for students. Designed to be used in Local Systemic
Change in Mathematics projects, the materials are also suitable for use in
university courses for preservice and inservice teachers, summer institutes,
curriculum implementation centers, Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI)
workshops, and school-based professional development programs. The materials
emphasize and integrate mathematical thinking, effective teaching practice, and
explicit connections to exemplary curriculum materials (all the NSF-supported,
comprehensive middle and high school instructional materials and others),
providing teachers with immersion experiences in three areas of mathematics:
algebra, geometry, and probability/statistics.
