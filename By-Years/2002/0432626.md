This funded activity enables graduate students to attend and present their
research at the 48th International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam
Technology and Nanofabrication, 2004, to be held in San Diego, California, from
June 1st - June 4th, 2004. In the fields of nanofabrication, microfabrication,
electron and ion lithographies, x-ray lithography, particle-beam optics, and
forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent. The
requested travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high-
level international scientific community. They will observe how scientists and
engineers exchange ideas and information at conferences, and they will hear
first hand presentations of up-to-date research results in nanotechnology. They
will make personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. In a special
student breakfast, conference organizers will describe to the attendees how a
conference program is put together.
