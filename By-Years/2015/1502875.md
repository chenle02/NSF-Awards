Image sensors have benefited immensely from the steady advances in semiconductor
fabrication, resulting in an order of magnitude resolution increase every decade
for the last three decades. Moore?s law has had a similar impact on both
computing and image sensor technology. In addition to the sensor, however,
cameras and other imaging devices require lenses whose manufacturing processes
has not benefited from Moore?s law. As a result the ultimate scaling and cost of
imaging devices is limited by physical optics. This research project involves
the development of Lens-Free Cameras (LFCs), a novel imaging architecture for
visible, short-wave infrared (SWIR), mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and thermal
wavelengths that exploits amplitude multiplexing masks and computational
demultiplexing algorithms to replace lenses in traditional cameras. Such
lensless imaging technology will produce thin cameras that can be directly
fabricated using contemporary semiconductor fabrication processes, thereby
benefitting from the scaling laws of semiconductor
fabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An LFC consists of an image sensor and a thin
amplitude modulation mask fabricated at a few hundreds of microns above the
image sensor surface. The amplitude modulation mask creates a linear mapping
between the scene and the sensor measurements. The linear system describing the
LFC contains millions of variables and millions of measurements. Solving this
large linear system of equations will allow for the reconstruction of high
resolution images from the sensor measurements. This project will focus on the
fabrication of a thin lensfree camera. The result of this fabrication process
will be the world?s first camera less than a millimeter thick. The advance in
lensfree cameras will be more widely applicable to several challenging
applications such as microscopy, endoscopy and other space constrained imaging
scenarios.
