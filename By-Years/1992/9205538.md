The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Kansas
will purchase network display stations and printers which will be dedicated to
the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used
for several research projects in both computer science and mathematics,
including in particular: 1. Numerical Methods for Smooth Factorization and
Condition Estimation 2. Random Walks on Infinite Graphs 3. Parallel Methods in
Multibody Dynamics 4. Planar Curves Associated with Reinhard Domains
