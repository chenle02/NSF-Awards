The central theme of this proposal is graph structure theory and its
applications to coloring, flows and algorithms. More specifically, the principal
investigator studies the structure of graphs pertaining to the graph minor
inclusion and its relatives, such as the directed minor and matching minor
relations, and uses those results to attack flow and coloring problems, as well
as the problem of characterizing ``Pfaffian graphs". Pfaffian graphs are of
interest because they allow efficient computation of perfect matchings, and
their rich theory is related to other areas. This research requires the
development of new tools in graph structure theory. In particular, the PI
proposes an in-depth study of the notion of ``society", originally introduced by
Robertson and Seymour. Applications of the theory range from theoretical (the
flow conjectures, the double cycle conjecture) to more algorithmic (coloring
graphs on surfaces and graphs belonging to a proper minor-closed family).

An important method employed in the proof of the Four-Color Theorem is the
technique of ``reducibility". While it is essential for the proof, there is
almost no associated theory. The PI attempts to develop such a theory for the
Four-Color Theorem, for the 5-Flow Conjecture and for the Cycle Double Cover
Conjecture. A successful theory of reducibility (if it exists) will hopefully
lead to a computer-free proof of the Four-Color Theorem and to proofs of the
5-Flow and Cycle Double Cover Conjectures.

This work falls within the area of graph theory, and is closely related to
theoretical computer science and mathematical programming (operations research).
A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks, such as
telephone networks, transportation networks or the Internet. Various problems
arise in the study of such networks, and this proposal is concerned with
problems of structural nature. Why do some networks possess certain specific
desirable properties, and others do not? A satisfactory answer can have many
applications, ranging from better understanding of the undelying structure, to
the design of efficient algorithms, to practical computations. For instance, one
such question answered earlier by the PI settles a question of Georgia Polya
from 1913, it also solves a different problem that baffled theoretical computer
scientists for quarter of a century, and has applications in economics.
