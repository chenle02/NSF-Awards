Kopriva The investigator develops and implements a flexible multidomain spectral
collocation method for the solution of time dependent compressible flows. Two
particular areas are emphasized. The first is the study of time accurate
interface conditions for the Euler gas-dynamics equations and the advective
terms of the Navier-Stokes equations. The second is the development of a non-
conforming interface condition for the Navier-Stokes equations that allows
flexible local refinement of the subdomains in viscous flows. The result of this
work is a means to solve accurately problems such as the interaction of free-
stream turbulence and bodies in a supersonic flow, with or without viscous
effects. This project is part of an effort to develop high accuracy numerical
methods, suitable for use on high performance computers, to solve high speed
fluid flow problems. Efficient, high accuracy numerical methods are needed to
compute detailed solutions of complex fluid flows at a reasonable cost.
Increasingly, detailed solutions, and the understanding of the flow physics that
follows from them, are required by industry for engineering design applications.
