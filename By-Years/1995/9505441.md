MCB 9505441 Terri Grodzicker The purpose of this award is to sponsor a
conference on programmed cell death. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a
genetically controlled cellular process wherein a cell will commit suicide or
will be murdered by another cell in response to specific physiological signals.
Interest in this field has exploded in the last two years in large part because
gene products controlling apoptosis have been identified. Investigators can now
begin to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms involved in the cell death
process. The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers
working on diverse aspects of apoptosis, and to create a meeting environment
suitable for the exchange of information and ideas which will foster advancement
in the field. %%% This meeting will provide exchange of information and new
insights with regard to the field of programmed cell death by bringing together
a group of scientists with diverse backgrounds and approaches for the study of
cell death. It is anticipated that the frontiers of science will be
significantly advanced by support of this project. ***
