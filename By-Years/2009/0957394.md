IntelliDrive(SM) is a major U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S.
DOT)&lt;br/&gt;initiative of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), aimed at
building a&lt;br/&gt;fully connected surface transportation environment via
advanced communication&lt;br/&gt;and information technologies. The grand vision
is "to provide transformational&lt;br/&gt;safety, mobility, and environmental
improvements in surface transportation".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IntelliDrive
initiative envisions a networked environment among&lt;br/&gt;vehicles (V2V),
between vehicles and infrastructure components (V2I) &lt;br/&gt;or among
vehicles, infrastructure, and wireless hand-held Devices &lt;br/&gt;(e.g., cell
phones and PDAs) (V2D) that enables numerous safety &lt;br/&gt;and mobility
improvement applications. For example,&lt;br/&gt;in a V2V environment, if the
vehicle in front has a malfunctioning&lt;br/&gt;brake light, the following
drivers or travelers will be notified &lt;br/&gt;in real-time and take
precautionary actions (e.g., slow down or &lt;br/&gt;change lanes); or if
roadside sensors detect a patch of ice on the road&lt;br/&gt;at milepost 305,
drivers will be notified immediately through V2I or&lt;br/&gt;V2D about the
situation in terms what, where, and the degree of &lt;br/&gt;severity, etc.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to improving mobility,&lt;br/&gt;IntelliDrive
provides real-time traveler information concerning&lt;br/&gt;traffic conditions,
accidents, transit vehicle on-time performance, &lt;br/&gt;parking availability,
ride share opportunities, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Thus travelers will be able to make
informed decisions about their&lt;br/&gt;travel so to improve the individual and
consequently the overall &lt;br/&gt;system efficiency and
mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this proposal is to develop
the framework of a&lt;br/&gt;Database Management System (DBMS) in support of
IntelliDrive applications. &lt;br/&gt;This means, among others, a set of
services that will answer the questions:&lt;br/&gt;What data is relevant to
answer the query? In what nodes does this &lt;br/&gt;data reside? How to access
the data on these nodes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information please see
