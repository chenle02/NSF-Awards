This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a prototype 3-D imaging sensor for high temperature furnaces used in the glass
industry. These furnaces are also used in many other industries, including
cement, coke, iron &amp; steel, and pulp &amp; paper industries. This 3-D
imaging sensor creates an interior image of the furnace wall so that maintenance
personnel can identify wall erosion, and any molten material leaking through the
wall joints. The objective in Phase II is to develop a prototype sensor system
that can form 3-D images of the interface between the furnace wall and molten
glass. To achieve this, a high performance sensor hardware and corresponding
imaging software will be developed. The entire prototyped system will be tested
on high temperature furnace walls using in-house kilns followed by tests at an
operational glass furnace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project is that it will enable maintenance programs based upon
real furnace conditions. This will allow longer life span of high temperature
furnaces and the ability to make informed local maintenance without a major
interruption in production. This translates to significant financial savings for
the glass manufacturing industry and improved safety, as several catastrophic
accidents have occurred due to molten glass leaking from the furnaces. The
sensor technology also offers a platform on which many other applications can be
built, including microwave medical imaging, archaeology explorations, and defect
detection inside refractories during manufacturing.
