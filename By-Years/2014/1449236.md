Application stores use sophisticated user interfaces to help users understand
the permissions sought by applications. Unfortunately, these interfaces are
complex and may fail to address their goal of helping users give informed
consent. As a result, users may inadvertently surrender private information or
open themselves up to security attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
tackles the problem of improving the nature of information provided by these
interfaces. It focuses both on new interface designs that will better represent
this information, and on techniques to bootstrap the provision of that
information. On the user interface side, it designs new interfaces that help
untrained users recognize the security and privacy consequences of the sought
permissions. To populate this information, it posits the use of crowdsourcing to
obtain information at scale about the suitability of permissions. The goal is to
eventually populate an application store with this information to encourage
adoption and additional feedback from users. The project will study how
effectively and accurately crowdsourcing can be used to gather this information.
