EIA-0219627 Craig Douglas University of Kentucky Collaborative Research: ITR/AP-
Predictive Contaminant Tracking Using Dynamic Data Driven Application Simulation
\(DDDAS\) Techniques&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to a leap-ahead
technology in simulation capabilities. Research in the development of new
methods and algorithms for the specific application areas is needed. The dynamic
application requirements will dictate computing systems' support that includes
systems' software technologies, such as active middleware services for real
time, dynamic reconfiguration capabilities, resource discovery, load balancing,
security, fault tolerance, quality of service, and dynamic interfaces with field
measurement systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An encoded web stream set of
contaminations from actual situations (both above ground and underground) will
allow researchers besides us to tap into our virtual reality DDDAS environment.
Visualization systems will allow us to work with a variety of real networks,
sensors, and environments.&lt;br/&gt;
