A Study of Mesospheric Radar Scattering In this one year program of research, an
explanation will be sought for the disagreement between motions inferred from
the analysis of incoherent scatter and partial reflection radar data as measured
during the Arecibo Initiative on the Dynamics of the Atmosphere, March through
May, 1989 (AIDA '89). The principal data sources to be utilized come from the
Arecibo observatory UHF incoherent scatter radar (ISR) observations, from the
Utah State University imaging doppler interferometry (IDI) MF radar and from the
Geospace Research meteor wind radar (MWR). The investigation will concentrate on
the scattering mechanisms involved, which, at least in the case of the IDI, are
as yet not fully understood. The IDI scattering points may originate from
turbulent eddies in the mean flow, or they may be specular reflection from
individual gravity wave fronts. To address this problem the investigators will
rely heavily on the considerable body of knowledge available on the propagation
of waves in turbulent media, and on an existing archive of "snapshots" of small
scale motions at mesospheric - lower thermospheric altitudes as revealed by high
resolution photography of rocket released chemical trails.
