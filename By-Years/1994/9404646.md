9404646 Wand Because compilers are trusted components of almost every computer
system, it is important to have trustworthy proofs of their correctness. This
project would continue research on the development and verification of compilers
based on formal specifications of programming languages. A major area of
activity would extend semantics and compiler correctness proofs to languages for
parallel computation. Some effort would also be directed toward the study of
fundamental theories for object- oriented programming. Cross-fertilization with
related research is expected. Techniques for optimization and concretization
would be applied in the parallel setting, and the parallel setting would raise
new problems for studies of optimization. Similarly, existing activity in type
theory is concerned primarily with complexity of type inference algorithms. It
is expected that some of these results to be applied in the object-oriented
setting, and that studies of OOP would raise new theoretical questions in type
theory. ***
