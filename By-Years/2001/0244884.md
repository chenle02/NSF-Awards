1. The purpose of this project is to enhance our understanding of fundamental
problems in&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics and probability theory through the
use of mathematical methods&lt;br/&gt;involving supersymmetry and the
renormalization group. Of particular interest are&lt;br/&gt;statistical models
with a geometrical flavor, such as branched polymers and self-
avoiding&lt;br/&gt;walks. Basic questions for these models involve, for example,
determining the rate at&lt;br/&gt;which the size of a sample grows with the
number of monomers or steps. Such divergences&lt;br/&gt;are governed by critical
exponents. The values of the exponents may be determined in one&lt;br/&gt;of two
ways, either through dimensional reduction (which relates exponents to
known&lt;br/&gt;exponents in related systems in fewer dimensions), or through
the renormalization group&lt;br/&gt;(which calculates the flow of couplings with
the length scale as the microscopic&lt;br/&gt;structures of the problem are
averaged out). Supersymmetry plays an important role in&lt;br/&gt;both
methods.&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals are: (a) to continue to develop a mathematical
theory of dimensional&lt;br/&gt;reduction and apply it to new models, such as
directed branched polymers; and (b) to&lt;br/&gt;construct an exact
renormalization group flows for such systems.&lt;br/&gt;2. Research activities
in this proposal will involve collaborations and exchanges of&lt;br/&gt;ideas
with mathematicians and physicists in a wide range of fields, including
probability,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, statistical mechanics, and quantum field
theory. Graduate student support, and&lt;br/&gt;graduate student participation
in scientific meetings, will integrate research and&lt;br/&gt;education and help
train a new generation of mathematicians in the methods of
field&lt;br/&gt;theory, supersymmetry, and the renormalization group. These
activities will in the long&lt;br/&gt;run lead to enhanced interaction between
mathematics and physics and to new ideas in both&lt;br/&gt;fields.
