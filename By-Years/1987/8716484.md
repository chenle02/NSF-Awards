The primary objective of this research project is to reconstruct the Campanian
to Eocene floral history of the James Ross Island Basin, Antarctica, based
mainly on palynomorphs. Palynomorphs occur throughout and are abundant in the
nearshore marine to coastal/deltaic stratigraphic section of Seymour Island and
parts of adjacent islands in the James Ross Island Basin. They include
dinoflagellate cysts and acritarchs (marine microphytoplankton), other marine
and freshwater algae, pollen and spores from land- plants and fungal remains.
This project is part of a continuing study on Seymour Island palynology, and is
integrated with studies on other aspects of antarctic Cretaceous-Tertiary
geologic history.
