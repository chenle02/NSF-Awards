This is a request for continued funding for investigations of kinematics and
rigidity of the Indian Ocean plate and the zone of distributed deformation
between the Indian and Australian plates. Aeromagnetic data were collected in
the area during the first part of this study and the PI proposes here to extend
the study to finite plate reconstructions. The goals are to estimate finite
rotations and confidence limits on the motion between India, Africa, and
Australia.
