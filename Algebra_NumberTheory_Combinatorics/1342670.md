The 2013 Maine/Québec Number Theory Conference will take place on October 5 & 6
at the University of Maine in Orono. This conference is held annually, at
Université Laval in Québec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd
years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Québec, and
beyond to present and discuss their research, the conference promotes
interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American number theorists.
The small scale of the meeting (with around 60 attendees) makes this a good
opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with
leading researchers.
