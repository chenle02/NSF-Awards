The investigator proposes to help fill in the gaps in our knowledge by
conducting a survey of Mexican American political organizations, their goals,
tactics, and methods by which they attract and retain their members. A major
empirical question to be explored is how a reward schedule offered by leaders is
structured and adjusted in order to assure continued member participation. The
PI will identify four basic types of groups in the Mexican American Political
Culture. He hypothesizes that 1) Lower income organizations will depend almost
exclusively on expressive rewards while downplaying the social and recreational
aspects of their incentive package and 2) Upper class organizations will focus
more on material rewards for group membership while offering a wider range of
solidarity benefits. He also hypothesizes that the relationship between staff
and the rank and file varies according to the socioeconomic status of the
membership. Groups chosen for the survey will be politically active groups in
the two largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area for California, Texas,
New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois and active groups in Washington D.C.
These groups will be selected from three major national Hispanic Directories. To
augument the list,interviews with local politicians, activists, scholars and
journalists will be conducted.
