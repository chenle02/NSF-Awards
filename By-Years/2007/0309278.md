Title: The Evolutionary Puzzle of Warning Coloration&lt;br/&gt;Name: Jeffrey R.
Lucas and Adam Robert Boyko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt; Many toxic
animals advertise their distastefulness with bright warning &lt;br/&gt;patterns.
These patterns help predators learn to avoid them, but how the
&lt;br/&gt;patterns evolve is poorly understood. When a warning pattern first
&lt;br/&gt;arises, predators are unfamiliar with it and attack the pattern
&lt;br/&gt;disproportionately. Only after many individuals share the new pattern
do &lt;br/&gt;predators learn to avoid them. It is difficult to explain how new
warning &lt;br/&gt;patterns overcome their initial disadvantage, yet warning
patterns have &lt;br/&gt;not only evolved in numerous species, but they have
diversified &lt;br/&gt;extensively in many of them.&lt;br/&gt; In the Heliconius
genus of tropical butterflies, new warning &lt;br/&gt;patterns have evolved
dozens of times in some species but only once in &lt;br/&gt;others. Evolutionary
theory predicts that differences in population &lt;br/&gt;structure between
these species are responsible for their different &lt;br/&gt;diversification
rates, but this theory is unproven. In this study, the &lt;br/&gt;structure of
natural populations of Heliconius inhabiting isolated &lt;br/&gt;treefall gaps
will be measured. This research will be combined with &lt;br/&gt;computational
simulations of warning pattern evolution in Heliconius to &lt;br/&gt;see if
evolutionary theory correctly predicts the observed rates of &lt;br/&gt;warning
pattern diversification in this genus. Alternatively, differences &lt;br/&gt;in
sexual selection between Heliconius species may account for the
&lt;br/&gt;different diversification rates by promoting or constraining color
pattern &lt;br/&gt;evolution. To examine this possibility, mate choice and mate
competition &lt;br/&gt;will be studied in greenhouse colonies of these species.
