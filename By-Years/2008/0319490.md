This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to evaluate
the applicability of a novel surface modification of metallic implant materials,
by coating them with polymeric film consisting of active biomolecules as the
repeat units so as to biomimetically induce deposition of biological apatite and
other osteogenic activities. The polymerizable monomer biomolecules will be
synthesized, characterized and tested for apatite deposition from incubation in
simulated body fluid, and for their effects on osteoblast differentiation,
metabolism and growth.

The commercial application of this project will be in bone implants and
prosthetic devices where metal to tissue interfaces must be integrated.
