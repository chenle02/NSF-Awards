9315854 Miles This award will fund a project focused on understanding the
directional characteristics of an invertebrate's ear which, because of its size
and placement, must use novel mechanisms to localize sounds. The study will
investigate both the mechanics and the neurophysiology of the system to
determine if novel phase delay mechanisms are responsible for the unique
capability. This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and Control
Initiative which encouraged the submission of proposals that through the study
of neurophysiological systems could advance engineering science and advance the
knowledge of biological systems through the use of engineering analysis
techniques. The research being funded by this award has the potential to lead to
advances in sensory system processes and, in addition, should enable engineers
to discover new methods to detect acoustic signals for use in other engineering
applications. ***
