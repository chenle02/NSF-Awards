The research program for undergraduates at Florida International University is
designed to stimulate and promote interest, curiosity, creative and critical
thinking of undergraduate students in environmental science and engineering
during their early years in undergraduate program. This work involves students
in a comprehensive research program relative to movement of oil spills and
treatment of contaminated media to minimize potential damage to the environment.
The program engages students with different areas of research relative to
movement and treatment of oil spills. The areas of research are in the following
areas: environmental biology, environmental physics, environmental chemistry,
environmental modeling, and process design. The research goals follow: formulate
a detailed mathematical model to study the movement of oil spills and develop
innovative treatment processes to minimize the potential impacts of the oil
spills in the environment; conduct experiments to evaluate the significance of
physical, chemical, and biological parameters in containment and treatment of
oil spills; evaluate the relative significance of time and length scales for
analyzing dynamics of oil migration and study effectiveness of containment
options and treatment processes.
