This EAGER proposal deals with fluorescent nanoparticles of unusually high
brightness. Being a substantially new and radically different approach to making
fluorescent nanoparticles, this research is considered to be high risk. At the
same time, it is a high potential payoff due to the importance of such particles
for a broad range of photonic applications involving tagging, tracing, labeling,
and particularly in biological imaging and sensing. High brightness of labeling
particles is desirable to attain higher signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently,
to increase sensitivity and/or speed of sensing, contrast of imaging, to
decrease the limit of detection, etc. The merits of the proposed research are in
the study of silica nanoparticles, which have unusually strong fluorescent
emission; understanding the nature of this phenomenon; and investigating the
limits of this approach for bio-imaging applications.
