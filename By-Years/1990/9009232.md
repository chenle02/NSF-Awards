ABSTRACT This project continues research begun under NSF grant BNS 88-12552
from September 1988 through August 1990. Both the earlier research and the
present project explore the role of urbanization in language change. During the
new funding period, the investigation will focus on how changes diffuse and how
vernaculars evolve. Of special interest will be changes that reflect internal
developments rather than external influence. For the ensuing funding period, new
data collection will be minimal, consisting primarily of one additional
telephone poll. Primary efforts will be devoted to analyzing data already
collected, in examination of the major research questions of interest.
