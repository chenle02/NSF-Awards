This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University to acquire an Raman spectrometer
and an Ar+ pumped mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) monomolecular films
at the air/water interface, (2) the ultrafast kinetic investigation of excited
states and reactive species, (3) synthetic proteins as models, and (4) enzyme
mechanisms. A laser can provide important information about chemical reactivity.
Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of
reactivity and non-reactivity of molecules..
