Doctoral Dissertation Research: Analytical Perspectives of Stakeholders in Air
Quality and Transportation Planning Different individuals or groups of
individuals confronted with a variety of environmental policy options may
disagree over the most desirably one because the options impact them differently
or because the individuals or groups evaluate the options using different mental
models of the physical and social systems affected by the policies. In this
doctoral dissertation proposal, the researcher plans to compare the perspectives
of different stakeholders involved with the issue of controlling motor vehicle
related pollution in an attempt to ascertain how much of the different in
opinion among stakeholders is a consequence of differences in their mental
models of the situation.
