9451116 Bieber The major goals of the project are to develop and perfect a
number of NMR and molecular modeling experiments that are suitable for
integration into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. An NMR and molecular
modeling software will be purchased. Several excellent NMR experiments have been
designed and tested by faculty for the biophysical, inorganic, organic and
physical chemistry laboratories. and more than a dozen undergraduate students
are engaged in research projects that use NMR. Funding the proposed project will
allow faculty to develop additional NMR experiments for undergraduate courses,
will expose all majors and many non- majors to NMR, and will permit students to
apply powerful molecular modelling tools to chemical problems. The project will
make it feasible for other institutions which lack NMR instrumentation to carry
out NMR data analyses and molecular modelling studies at modest cost, because
NMR data, processing macros and documentation will be available from Arizona
State University through electronic communication or in tape formats. By using
electronic networks, the impact of the project will extend well beyond
undergraduate instruction at Arizona State University.
