Brandeis University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support 10 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost
half will be recruited from institutions. Research activities will include the
following: o Oscillating Chemical Reactions o Molecular Processes in Solids o
New Synthetic Methods o Natural Product Synthesis o Ligand Exchange Reactions
