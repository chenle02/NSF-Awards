Randolph-Macon College has obtained instrumentation that supports laboratory
instruction and student research in a new undergraduate interdisciplinary
program in environmental studies, and also in a well-established and well-
respected undergraduate program in chemistry. Specifically, we have obtained a
capillary gas chromatograph equipped with a mass-spectrometric detector. The
goals of this project include: putting the laboratory component of the new
environmental studies major on a firm foundation, providing an interesting and
scientifically rigorous laboratory experience for general-education non science
majors, and enriching the laboratory curriculum for chemistry majors and minors.
Another goal is to establish a connection with regional secondary-school
teachers. A specific objective is the incorporation of project-oriented
environmental chemistry experiments in the introductory environmental studies
laboratory course and in the organic chemistry course, as well as in the
advanced chemistry laboratory course sequence. Inclusion of project-oriented
experiments has been shown to enhance student interest in laboratory curricula,
and to prepare students better for the environmental and/or chemical workplace
or graduate program. A further objective is to provide well-motivated senior
environmental studies or chemistry majors an opportunity to carry out original
research on a senior project in water pollution and air pollution. A third
objective is to introduce sophisticated analytical instru- mentation to non
science majors interested in environmental or forensic science. We are not aware
of the use of GC/MS with lower-level science or non science majors (below the
organic chemistry course); our target audience includes not only environmental
studies and chemistry majors and minors, but also non science students who take
these lab courses as a terminal experience.
