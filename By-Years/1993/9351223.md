Morgan State University will establish a local area computer network to serve as
the basis for a laboratory for mathematics courses. With the help of a
laboratory, conceptual understanding will be stressed and meaningful problem-
solving skills will be developed. Laboratory assignments will become an
intrinsic part of the courses taught. In particular, the Calculus sequence
through Introductory Differential Equations, as well as the mathematics course
for prospective elementary teachers and a methods courses for prospective
secondary school teachers will be affected. The goal of the project is to
attract more minority students and women to the sciences, engineering and
mathematics, and to provide a better preparation for prospective teachers by
providing a different approach to the teaching of mathematics. The computer lab
will enable faculty to engage students in actively doing mathematics instead of
just lecturing to students.
