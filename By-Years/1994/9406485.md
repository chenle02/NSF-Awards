9406485 Lamphere This project involves the dissertation research of a student
of cultural anthropology from the University of New Mexico. The student will
conduct an ethnographic study of Salvadoran immigrants to the US, living in Los
Angeles. The question is to understand how migrants use new concepts of
ethnicity -- as Latinos in an Anglo-Saxon country, and as Salvadorans -- when
their political identity is local in their home country -- to construct their
political identities and mobilize support, often transnational, to sustain
productive and meaningful lives. The techniques used consist of ethnographic
participant observation, and formal interviews of immigrants to understand these
transplanted individuals relations to and understandings of the national state.
This research is important because transnationalism is a dominant fact of our
world. Increased understanding of how people change their identities, and
construct new political identities to establish lives in new places and maintain
connections with their home places can help us design programs to ameliorate
problems and facilitate positive adjustment. The basic question is important --
understanding how Salvadorans living in the US adopt Salvadoran nationalism
(missing to a large extent at home) and Latino ethnicity as coping mechanisms to
help develop successful lives in the US will be valuable.
