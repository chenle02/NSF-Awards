DMS-0204707&lt;br/&gt;William H. Jaco&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves
the development and use of efficient&lt;br/&gt;triangulations in the study and
understanding of 3--manifolds. A&lt;br/&gt;triangulation of a 3-manifold
determines a class of surfaces in the&lt;br/&gt;3--manifold called normal
surfaces. A fundamental observation is that &lt;br/&gt;in most cases when a 3--
manifold contains an interesting surface, then for&lt;br/&gt;any triangulation
of the 3--manifold the same interesting feature is&lt;br/&gt;exhibited by a
normal surface in the triangulation. This has provided a&lt;br/&gt;powerful
method for studying 3-manifolds and solving certain decision&lt;br/&gt;problems.
Normal surface theory has, for example, lead to the
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;resolution of determining when two 3--manifolds, which
contain injective&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, are homeomorphic, to the classification of
these same manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;and to the determination of whether a knot in
the three-sphere is the&lt;br/&gt;unknot. However, even with the presence of
interesting normal surfaces, a&lt;br/&gt;given triangulation may have numerous
uninteresting normal surfaces, which&lt;br/&gt;make theoretical arguments quite
tedious and computational attempts nearly&lt;br/&gt;impossible. The guiding
principle of efficient triangulations is reducing&lt;br/&gt;unnecessary normal
surfaces and improving the efficiency of computations&lt;br/&gt;for
triangulation based algorithms. They have exhibited remarkable&lt;br/&gt;success
in doing this. However, more surprisingly, efficient&lt;br/&gt;triangulations
have exposed interesting relations between one-vertex and&lt;br/&gt;ideal
triangulations of three-manifolds and new combinatorial
structures,&lt;br/&gt;which seem to be intimately related to the topology of the
three-manifold.&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore efficient triangulations
with particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis of their application to the Homeomorphism
Problem/Classification&lt;br/&gt;Problem for three-manifolds and issues of
computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low-dimensional topology brings
together many areas of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;research and provides a common
ground for interaction and advance across&lt;br/&gt;all of mathematics. It
provides a natural geometric model of most physical&lt;br/&gt;phenomena.
Research in this area is making significant contribution
to&lt;br/&gt;computational geometry and topology and complexity theory. It
has&lt;br/&gt;consequences in physics, computer visualization and medical and
biological&lt;br/&gt;modeling.&lt;br/&gt;
