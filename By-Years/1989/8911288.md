The bacterium cytophaga johnsonae moves by gliding motility, which means that
the cells possess no flagella and are incapable of swimming but can translocate
over surfaces with which they come in contact. The molecular machinery
underlying gliding motility has not been identified, nor have the mechanisms
that regulate the movements of gliding bacteria. The proposed research is based
on previous work with wild-type cells and nonmotile mutants of C. johnsonae
showing characteristic movements of cell surface components and identifying
membrane proteins involved in cell movements. These proteins will be purified
and characterized, with particular attention to their glyconjugates. The long-
term objective is to explain the mechanisms and regulation of gliding in
Cytophaga johnsonae. The Cytophaga - Flexibacter group is an important and
ubiquitous group of bacteria, present in soil and water, and important in
turnover of macromolecules of all kinds, including chitin, cellulose, agar, and
carageenan. Some members of the group are pathogens of fish or shellfish, or
plant pathogens involved in soft-rot of vegetables. The have also been
implicated as agents of tooth decay in humans, and responsible for a lung
disease seen in textile mill workers.
