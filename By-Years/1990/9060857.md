Marine sponges have been one of the richest sources of bio- active compounds.
However, the supply of these sponges must come from ocean collections. And with
natural collections as the basis for drug development, the purity and impurity
of the final product is difficult to control. Also, Pharmaceutical, or
agrichemical companies will not continue to develop a promising new natural
product lead without a secure, reliable supply, or an indication of a probable
synthesis or analog being developed. A controlled environment aquaculture system
is proposed for the culture of two tropical marine sponges, for the
investigation and development of novel techniques for harvesting the high- value
secondary metabolites produced by these sponges, the diterpene antibiotics, the
Kalihinols, from Acanthella carvenosa, and the antiparasitic and antibiotic,
amino acid- derived Bengamides from Jaspis sp.. The objective is to develop a
reliable source that can deliver production quantities of chemically consistent
natural products to researchers.
