9628178 Yin Although Late Cenozoic intracontinental deformation over a broad
region of Asia has been attributed to the indentation of India into Asia, the
relationship between the northward movement of India and the corresponding
strain partitioning within Asia remains controversial. Two ideas are current-
that crustal thickening accommodates the convergence while the other employs
lateral escape tectonics. This project will address this classic problem by
examining a correlary of the extrusion model, which predicts that large-scale,
conjugate sets of strike-slip faults must operate simultaneously to facilitate
eastward extrusion of Tibet. This project will study several candidate faults
and produce ages for their inception and duration and offsets. Results should
help in resolving this long-standing problem.
