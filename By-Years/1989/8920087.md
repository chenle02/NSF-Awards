ABSTRACT The conference will promote the close examination of focus phenomena
in creole languages. This topic was selected both because of the quite complex
and variable preclausal morphology found in constituent focus in many creoles
and because of the diverse methods of focus/emphasis that these languages
utilize. The question of whether or not these different strategies represent a
creole-wide phenomenon or are language-specific is a related concern. The
conference will be the first of its kind to narrow its concerns to a single
aspect of creole grammar. It will unite scholars to join in an extensive and
detailed discussion of the topic from diverse theoretical perspectives. In view
of these considerations, the principal aims of the conference can be summarized
as follows: a) to explore the main aspects of focus constructions in a cross-
section of creoles from a variety of theoretical viewpoints b) to uncover new
facts about creole focus patterns and their implications for linguistic theory,
and c) to encourage future conferences on other specifically determined topics
in creole grammar.
