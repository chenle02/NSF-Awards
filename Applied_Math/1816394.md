Just as a ball rolls downhill and comes to rest at the lowest point of potential
energy, many physical and biological systems approach equilibrium at an energy-
minimizing state. Sand is an example of such a system: being poured in a
container it comes to rest in a randomly arranged state, but can transition to
an even lower energy state through the addition of energy in the form of tapping
the container. This research project seeks to predict how such granular
materials respond to applied forces from the viewpoint of their underlying
energy landscape, which like a mountain range is a vast expanse of valleys and
peaks. Of particular interest is the effect of microgravity environments on
granular systems, such as rubble-pile asteroids composed of loosely held-
together dust and fractured rock. Like the sand sitting in a container, the weak
gravitational force loosely holds the asteroid together in its shape. How the
asteroid responds to the forces of probing or digging is important for
developing mining techniques for such near-earth asteroids.

The project aims at developing new techniques for quantifying the relationship
between high-dimensional complex energy-landscapes and the dynamics of the
system. This relies on a new computational method for extracting the dominate
features of the energy landscape by forming a low-dimensional bipartite graph
representation; a network with two types of nodes, energy minimizers and
accessible saddle points, connected by edges weighted by the energy barrier
heights. The graph and dynamics taking place on the graph are then used to
explain the behavior of large stochastic systems of interacting spheres, a model
for granular materials in microgravity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
