9310873 Hu Laser scanning confocal microscopy, with its ability to discriminate
against out-of-focus fluorescence and to yield high in-plane resolution, is a
powerful tool for three dimensional imaging. Compared to many other analytical
tools, such as electron microscopy, it is relatively non-destructive and non-
invasive. Biological systems are inherently three-dimensional. The interior of a
specimen, ranging from a single cell of a few micrometer thickness to tissues of
hundreds of micrometers in depth, can be discerned with a confocal microscope.
This Award will provide a confocal microscope to facilitate the following
projects: (1) Development of a bioartificial liver; (2) Studies of invasive
behavior and cytoskeleton distribution in metastatic cells; (3) Fabrication of a
designer path for cell migration in three dimensional gels; (4) Cytoskeletal
reorganization during rabbit corneal epithelial cell adhesion; (5) Development
of dynamic nutrient feeding strategy for high density mammalian cell
bioreactors; and (6) Determination of the partitioning function in cell
division.
