This planning grant seeks to expand a National Science Foundation Teacher
Enhancement Program, Idaho SOARS (Science Objective Assessment and Resuructuring
System), to provide for the identification of K-12 leadership teams throughout
Idaho school districts with special emohasis on urban and suburban schools. The
project will utilize and evaluate a school science improvement system. The
Planning Grant will allow the SOARS II team to do the following: (a) Revise the
rural SOARS assessment instrument to better model urban and suburban schools;
(b) Provide state-wide meetings to identify schools interested in and willing to
fully engage in the SOARS II process for site based changes in science
education; (c) Identify and refine teacher-as-leader materials for use in SOARS
II; and (d) Establish a broad- based network of business and industry support
for the SOARS II process.
