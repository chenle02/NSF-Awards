This grant provides operating funds for the relativistic heavy-ion
&lt;br/&gt;group at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of
&lt;br/&gt;Rochester. During the year covered by this grant we will complete the
&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the data collected in 2001 and 2003 with the PHOBOS
detector &lt;br/&gt;at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven
National &lt;br/&gt;Laboratory (BNL) and consider possible upgrade options for
the PHOBOS &lt;br/&gt;detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PHOBOS is one of the four
experiments looking at the extreme energy &lt;br/&gt;densities that are created
when nuclei collide at RHIC. It is believed &lt;br/&gt;that a new state of
matter, the so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), will &lt;br/&gt;be formed in
these collisions. PHOBOS is looking for this new state of &lt;br/&gt;matter, and
its properties will provide important and new information &lt;br/&gt;about the
state of the very early universe (a few microseconds after the &lt;br/&gt;Big
Bang). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PHOBOS was designed to study as many collisions as
possible, in an &lt;br/&gt;unbiased way, and to search for significant
differences between p+p, p+A, &lt;br/&gt;and A+A collisions. The data collected
sofar inlcudes studies of Au+Au &lt;br/&gt;collisions in 2001, d+Au in 2003, and
p+p in 2001 and 2003. It is &lt;br/&gt;expected that the QGP will only be formed
in the Au+Au collisions, and the &lt;br/&gt;studies of d+Au and p+p are used to
subtract the contribution of "normal" &lt;br/&gt;nucleon-nucleon physics from
the data collected in Au+Au collisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The time-of-flight
array, designed and constructed by the Rochester &lt;br/&gt;group, significantly
enhances the physics capabilities of PHOBOS, by &lt;br/&gt;roughly doubling its
particle identification capabilities. For the &lt;br/&gt;2003 run we have
increased the flight path of our arrays, allowing use &lt;br/&gt;to identify
particles up to momenta of around 4 - 5 GeV/c. The analysis &lt;br/&gt;of the
2001 data is almost completed, and the analysis of the 2003 data is
&lt;br/&gt;just getting started. &lt;br/&gt;
