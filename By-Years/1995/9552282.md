This project provides support for a major reorganization of the laboratories for
the second half of the introductory physics sequence for all science majors and
pre-engineers (approximately 80 students per year). This continues the
restructuring of the introductory laboratory sequence for these majors. Four new
laboratory modules, Wave Motion, Electricity and Magnetism, Optics, and Modern
Physics, each require 3 or 4 weeks to complete. This project addresses module 1,
Wave Motion. New and exciting experiments in wave motion have been formalized to
introduce the concepts of simple harmonic motion, superposition, interference,
resonance, and Fourier analysis in a way that encourages creative curiosity and
relies heavily on the use of analytical techniques made possible by computers.
Module 1 was selected for this project in that it will provide for sufficient
time and funding for experiment, software, and manual development. The module
represents a more loosely structured laboratory than the conventional approach
in which everyone does the same experiment at the same time. The involvement of
students in discussions with one another and the enhancement of creative
curiosity should occur more readily in a less structured environment.
