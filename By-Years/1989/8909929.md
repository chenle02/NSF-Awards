Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will focus on studies of the
decays of particles containing heavy quarks such as the beauty quark.
Investigations of these decays are a very promising way to try to learn more
about the weak forces, the interplay between the weak and the strong forces, and
CP nonconservation. The latter phenomenon, which is a violation of basic
symmetries between particles and antiparticles, has so far been seen in only one
place, and is not understood at all. Additional information on this phenomenon
would be very enlightening.
