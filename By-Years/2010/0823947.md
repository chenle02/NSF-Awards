The objective of this research is to develop improved materials and advance
fundamental understanding of properties that are needed for enhanced performance
of organic semiconductors in solar cells and relevant diodes. The approach
combines synthesis of new semiconductor materials with a set of physical
characterization methods that enable detailed probing of the interfaces between
materials that control device performance.

Intellectual merit: In order to realize applications of organic devices,
improved understanding of charge transport through organic materials and across
their junctions is needed. This project includes synthesis and exploration of
new materials combinations, focusing on morphological, interfacial,
photophysical, and charge transport properties. Rigorous characterization
techniques, including nanoscale scanning and photosensitive Kelvin probes,
neutron scattering and depth profiling that have not often been brought to bear
on these devices will be employed. Scanning gate microscopy will be introduced
for pn junction characterization. New insight into the smoothness, voltage
steps, and interfacial conductivities at junctions that are formed below the
surface, or in the bulk, of device films will be gained, and used to enhance
performance parameters of organic devices.

Broader impacts: The increased understanding of material and device properties
that will result from this work will enable the synthesis of new materials with
improved performance in solar cell applications. The project will provide
multidisciplinary research training for graduate students in science and
engineering, including members of underrepresented groups through collaborations
with Howard University. The results of this work will be used to enhance both
undergraduate and high school science education.
