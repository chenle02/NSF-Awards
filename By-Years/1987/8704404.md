The project is concerned with the development of a constructive theory of
orthogonal polynomials and their application to concrete problems in numerical
quadrature and approximation theory. This includes constructive methods for
generating orthogonal polynomials in the complex plane relative to Hermitian as
well as non-Hermitian inner products, the recovery of the measure from the
recurrence relation satisfied by orthogonal polynomials the stability of such
recurrence relations, constructive methods for Gaussian and Gauss-Kronrod
quadratures,including the analysis of errors, and applications of general
orthogonal polynomials to moment-preserving approximation by piecewise
polynomial functions and to constrained polynomial least squares approximation.
