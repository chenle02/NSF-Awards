This research will evaluate a new soft X-ray optic (a Soft X-ray Diffraction
Plate, SXDP) which is analogous to a diffuser in the visible. Because it can
eliminate condenser optics and increase photon flux, it will be a useful optic
wherever optical constants make refractive and reflective optical elements
difficult. The first application, in Phase II, will be to improve imaging soft
X-ray microscopy (ISXM), making such microscopes more robust and commercially
viable instruments. We anticipate further applications will develop in areas
where uniformity of illumination and preservation of flux are crucial. X-ray
spectroscopy of inhomogeneous sources and projection soft X-ray lithography will
be among the first to benefit. The SXDP consists of an opaque film with a
multitude of small holes, whose size is comparable to the wavelength of the
X-rays. This novel X-ray optic may improve flux through ISXMs by an order of
magnitude and provide good numerical aperture matching. This optic will
contribute to the commercial development of a compact ISXM. In Phase I, SXDP
models, using analytical and computer techniques, will decide which
manufacturing method will produce optimum SXDPs and evaluate their performance
by comparing data with theory.
