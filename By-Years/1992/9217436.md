9217436 Zahorian This is the second year funding of a two year continuing
award. This project investigates the use of the binary-pair partitioning (BPP)
method, which partitions an N-way classification task with N*(N-1)/2 pair-
discrimination classifiers, in the problem of speaker and dialect
identification. The complexity of the BPP networks grows with N2 and the method,
which has been examined in a preliminary way for speaker identification, is well
suited for cases where the talker identification task involves a large number of
speakers (N&gt;100). The preliminary studies of speaker identification with the
BPP method involved 100 male speakers belonging to three dialect regions of the
DARPA/TIMIT database. The system performed with 100% accuracy in a text
independent than results reported in the literature for similar tasks. The BPP
approach is also suited for tasks where multiple elemental decisions can be
combined to obtain an overall decision, such as dialect or language
identification. Refinements and extensions to the method will be investigated,
such as (1) enhancement of the input features, (2) the effects of noise and
channel distortion on performance, (3) performance in a speaker verification
mode as well as in an identification mode, (4) performance in sex and dialect
identification, (5) improvements that this method may provide for speech
recognition, and (6) training of BPP networks to minimize the probability of
error rather than the mean square error.
