Dr. Richard J. Hoffmann, of Iowa State Unviersity, will move for 12 months
(beginning in September 1989) to the University of Michigan in order to learn
molecular genetic techniques by characterizing the mitochondrial genome of a
ctenophore. The research will also help resolve the question of whether the
Cnidaria (Coelenterates), which have linear mtDNA (uniquely among multicellular
animals), and the phylum Ctenophora are a monophyletic assemblage or, instead,
merely show evolutionary convergence. In addition, beyond the duration of this
particular project, Dr. Hoffman will be able to apply these techniques to
problems involving determination of genetic structure and gene flow in
populations of sea anemone (Metridium) species off the New England coast.
