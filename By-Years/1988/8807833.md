Dr. James M. Farrar, University of Rochester, is supported by a grant from the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the photodissociation and
fragmentation of gas phase solvated metal cations. The examples to be studied
involve alkaline earth metal ions solvated by either water, ammonia or methanol.
From studies of cluster ions of this type, which are produced under very high
vacuum molecular beam conditions, much fundamental information can be obtained
regarding the nature of ion molecule interactions in condensed phase
environments. In these very elegant experiments, the cluster ions are produced
by injection of low energy metal ions into a supersonic flow of solvent
molecules from a pulsed nozzle source. Following mass selection, the cluster
ions are dissociated by light from a tunable pulsed dye laser, and the daughter
ions are mass analyzed as a function of the laser wavelength. Optical absorption
spectra and product mass spectra are used to elucidate structural and dynamical
properties of the solvated metal cations. Specific issues to be investigated
during the course of this research involve: 1) changes in the absorption
spectrum as a function of cluster size, 2) evaporation of solvent molecules as
an energy dissipation mechanism, and 3) the possibility of intramolecular
electron transfer in large clusters. The experiments will be performed using a
tandem time of flight mass spectrometer which will be constructed during the
term of the grant.
