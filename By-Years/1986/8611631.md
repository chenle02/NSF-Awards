This research will model large and complex turbulent flows such as bays using a
temporal and spatial filtering approach. This involves certain arbitrary ad hoc
assumptions. Their use would in all likelihood be considered unscientific by the
peer review community; the intent, however, is to test an intuitive, only party
verified, expectation that the proposed method is highly insensitive to these
input assumptions, and that calibration of the method from other, much simpler
flows, would therefore validate their application to a much wider range of
conditions for which verification data will be either extremely sparse or even
absent. Such conditions are typical of large, shallow waters whose
characteristics must be modeled ffor a variety of civil/coastal engineering
applications.
