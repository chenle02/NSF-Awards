The principal investigator will study the kinetics and mechanism of aqueous
oxidation of the minerals pyrrhotite and troilite under a variety of geological
conditions. Principal techniques to be employed are Mossbauer spectroscopy and
chemical analysis for dissolved ionic iron and sulfur. A variety of surface-
sensitive spectroscopic techniques also will be utilized to detect transient
species on mineral surfaces and to in turn help determine reaction mechanism.
This research will lead to a better understanding by geologists of the rates of
formation of seafloor iron ochre deposits from marine sulfide-bearing
assemblages and of gossans above ore deposits.
