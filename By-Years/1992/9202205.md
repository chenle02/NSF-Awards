This award is made in the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division and
the Division of Materials Research under the Materials Synthesis and Processing
Initiative. The research involves the synthesis and characterization of new
phosphorous and boron-based polymers including poly(phosphadienes),
poly(carbophosphazenes), poly(phosphanitrides), poly(iminoboranes) and
poly(borazene/phosphazenes). Suitable starting monomers will be prepared. The
incorporation of reactive phosphorous centers either as part of the polymer
backbone or as pendant groups is expected to impart useful chemical, physical
and electrical properties to these materials. A major objective is to prepare
the first examples of tractable, well-characterized polymers based on the B-N,
P=N, and/or B-N-P-N linkages. %%% Polymers with unsaturated B-N and P-N bonds
may exhibit novel electronic properties and should be useful as precursors to
B-N and P-N ceramic compositions.
