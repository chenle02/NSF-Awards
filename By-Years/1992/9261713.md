AstroPower proposes to develop gallium phosphide energy converters optimized
for radio luminescent light based power supplies. A "two-step" or "indirect"
process is used where a phosphor is excited by radioactive decay products to
produce light that is then converted to electricity by a GaP energy converter.
This "indirect" energy conversion of B-radiation to electrical energy can be
realized by applying recent developments in tritium based radio luminescent (RL)
light sources in combination with the high cell operating voltage than can be
achieved under low illumination with gallium phosphide photodiodes. This
proposal addresses the development of semiconductor power converters that are
suitable for low activity radioisotope fuels such as tritium (T2). Tritium has
been neglected in semiconductor conversion due to its low average energy
emission, 5.7 keV, but recent materials advances have advances have made tritium
sources practical sources practical. Tritium has a relatively long half life, a
safe decay product, is easily shielded, and is required in only small amounts
for milliwatt power supplies.
