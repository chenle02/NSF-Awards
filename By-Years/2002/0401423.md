0401423&lt;br/&gt;Vary &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project supports
a cooperative project by the Professor James P. Vary, Department of Physics at
Iowa State University at Ames, Iowa and Dr. Mahmoud Hasan, Department of
Physics, Applied Science University, in Amman, Jordan. They plan to apply
microscopic many-body theory to predict the quantum statistical properties of
medium weight nuclei with a focus on Iron-56. In the past five years progress
has been made in addressing the problems associated with the millions of levels
in medium-mass nuclei. The PIs will investigate these same issues at high
excitation. The research would have implications both for the understanding of
the dynamics of supernova explosions and for the understanding of nuclear
reactions at high energy transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The area of
study is ripe for major theoretical advances. Dr. Vary has an excellent record
of original and creative research, and includes students in his research. Prof.
Hasan has a very strong background in the proposed work. The team is perfect for
the successful completion of the project. The international collaboration
proposed here is appropriate for accomplishing the objectives of the proposed
work, and it will help establish cooperation between two student-centered
institutions. &lt;br/&gt;
