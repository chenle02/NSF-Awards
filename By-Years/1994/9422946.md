Management factors and organizational errors are major contributors to the risk
of failure of large complex systems that often have severe health and
environmental consequences. Environmental policy (both public and private)
relies on risk management to forecast organizational and engineering performance
as well as a means for reducing risks. Modeling in risk management, however,
rarely accounts for robust interactions among human, engineering, and
environmental systems. Social scientists and engineers tend to consider risk
management differently and a bridge is needed between the two fields to take
full advantage of the research of both. This research develops a normative risk
management model (System-Actions- Management: SAM), involving both the technical
parameters included in classical Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) and the
organizational factors that affect them. The research extends earlier work on
the characterization of the linkage between classical PRA and management factors
by emphasizing the long-term dynamics of organizations and facilities. The
resulting model will allow a more realistic and balanced consideration of social
and behavioral factors in risk management decision making and priority setting.
