9634876 Sala The two workshops proposed by this group will foster cooperative
efforts among countries of the Americas in the area of biodiversity and global
change research, building upon the previous work of two programs that addressed
biodiversity within a global change context - DIVERSITAS, and the Scientific
Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) Program on Ecosystem
Functioning of Biodiversity. Because this is a very new area of ecological
interest, there are no generally accepted principles. Many new hypotheses about
the interaction between ecological complexity and function have been advanced,
but no overall coordination exists to test them. Global Change and Terrestrial
Ecosystems (GCTE) a core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Program (IGBP) has selected ecological complexity and function as one of its
areas of focus, as has the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research
(IAI). These workshops will jointly address the GCTE and IAI research agendas
for this topic. The first workshop will develop scenarios of biodiversity change
over the next fifty to one hundred years, based on currently available
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate, atmospheric
composition and land-use change scenarios. These biodiversity scenarios would be
analogous to the IPCC scenarios, and could form the basis for policy decisions
regarding biodiversity impact and mitigation. The second workshop will develop a
cooperative research program, based on an integrated set of experimental,
observational, and theoretical studies to determine the strength and generality
of potential effects of ecological complexity on ecosystem function. %%% This
workshop provides an opportunity for scientists to develop new research in the
Americas that is tightly coordinated with major global and regional research
programs. The workshops will develop a research program to examine the
relationships between the diversity found in an ecosystem and the functions that
the eco system performs. Understanding these relationships will aid decision-
makers in assessing impacts, and designing policies to mitigate the effects of
global change. These workshop are being co-sponsored by the National Center for
Ecosystem Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), and the National Science Foundation
(NSF) on behalf of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research
(IAI). The IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global
change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas. The National
Science Foundation is the lead U.S. Government agency designated by the White
House to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI. ***
