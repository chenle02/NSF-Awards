This action funds Ellison M. Carter of the University of Texas at Austin to
conduct a research project, entitled "Advanced monitoring techniques for indoor
air pollution from solid fuel combustion," during the summer of 2012 at Tsinghua
University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr. Xudong Yang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of air
pollutant monitoring techniques that are robust and rugged for application in
the field and the creation of new metrics to evaluate indoor air pollution
generated from biomass combustion relative to coal combustion, paying particular
attention to compounds with known adverse health impacts that have been seldom
studied in the field. This field-based study would be the first to quantify and
compare previously ignored toxic emissions resulting from household biomass and
coal combustion, providing information that is crucial to the development of
effective remediation and health intervention strategies that target reductions
in toxic emissions. The study promises to fill a knowledge gap by studying
indoor air pollutants that have been previously ignored in rural populations and
are suspected or known to have significant health impacts.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
