Research in multivariate statistical analysis will focus on problems related to
the eigenstructure of random and parameter matrices. Inference problems in
principal components, factor analysis, canonical correlations, multivariate
analysis of variance and discriminant analysis that involve sequential testing
of nested hypotheses will be examined. Ways of improving the testing procedures
will be studied. Another focus of research is the estimation of the
eigenstructures with the emphasis on the development of optimal, accurate and
reliable estimates of eigenvalues in multivariate analysis of variance, multiple
discriminant analysis and canonical correlation analysis. The technique of
shrinking standard estimates towards some central value will be examined.
Another topic of research is concerned with robustness and focuses on the use of
projection pursuit techniques in the area of discriminant analysis.
