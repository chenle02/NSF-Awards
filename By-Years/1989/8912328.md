A quantum cluster dot is a compact structure in the 5 to 20 um size range where
small scale in three dimensions yields discrete electronic states. This research
is an interdisplinary, experimental program for the formation and
characterization of monodisperse gallium arsenide (G A ) quantum cluster dots.
The clusters will be produced in an aerosol reactor by the vapor phase reaction
of an organometallic gallium contains vapor with arsine. Particle size and
cluster quality will be monitored by in-situ laser induced luminescence spectra.
Clusters from the aerosol reactor will be classified into very narrow size
ranges required for applications by an electrostatic classifier. Captured
particles will be analyzed as to particle morphology, interval defect structure,
and carbon contamination using electron microscopy (TEM and STEM), energy
dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
Exciting new electronic and optical components would result from the
incorporation of large numbers of identical quantum cluster dots into solid
state structures. Possible applications include semiconductor lasers several
orders of magnitude better than conventional diode lasers and new
electroluminescent display technology with convenient adjustment of color.
However, to achieve such results, the clusters must be produced to very strict
size tolerances, typically with size variations not larger than 0.5 um.
Otherwise a device averaging the electronic states of many clusters varying in
size would lose the distinctness of states inherent in any individual quantum
cluster dot.
