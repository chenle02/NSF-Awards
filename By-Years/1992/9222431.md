This project will greatly improve research, educational and public service
activities at the New Mexico State University herbarium, which maintains a
research collection of 60,000 specimens from New Mexico habitats and surrounding
areas. Specific improvements include herbarium cases to relieve crowding,
replace older inadequate cases and accommodate growth for the next 4-5 years.
Other improvements are a microscope for student and visitor use and acid-free
folders to replace ones that are potentially damaging to specimens. %%% This
project will greatly improve research, educational and public service activities
at the New Mexico State University herbarium, which maintains a strong regional
plant collection representing habitats from New Mexico and surrounding areas.
The collection will receive new cases to relieve crowding and accommodate 4-5
years' growth, as well as a microscope for student and visitor use. Apart from
students at the university, the plant collection is a resource for many local,
state and federal agencies involved in land management, ecological studies,
conservation and tourism.
