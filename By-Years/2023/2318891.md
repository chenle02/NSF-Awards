Access control is a crucial security mechanism that ensures appropriate user
authorization within computer systems. To achieve accountability and privacy,
access control methods must associate obligations with privileges. The Next
Generation Access Control (NGAC) standard, developed by the American National
Standards Institute, introduces an innovative approach by extending obligations
as a programming mechanism. This allows for real-time adjustment of privileges
to accommodate evolving operational requirements. However, designing and
implementing an NGAC policy manually can be error prone. Identifying privilege
changes associated with access events, specifying them with obligations, and
verifying the resulting policy for correctness present significant challenges.
Errors in the policy can have severe consequences for the authorization state.
Therefore, it is crucial to explore efficient methodologies for developing
error-free NGAC policies. This project aims to address this gap by leveraging
SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories), a mathematically based method, to verify
operational NGAC systems and uncover potential errors.

The project's main objective is to develop an open-source reachability analyzer
that allows users to interact with, analyze, and understand the behavior of
complex NGAC policies. This analyzer will facilitate correct policy
implementation by utilizing an SMT solver to examine the sequences of
configuration changes triggered by access events that activate obligations. A
significant innovation lies in formalizing the procedural actions of
administrative obligations using the declarative SMT language, which alters the
SMT formulas representing the authorization configurations. To ensure usability
and accessibility within the NGAC community, the tool will provide a user-
friendly interface for end-users and an application programming interface (API)
for developers. By integrating the results with education, the project aims to
utilize the tool and case studies in software security courses. Additionally,
the formal verification of NGAC policies will be introduced in the next edition
of the software engineering textbook authored by one of the investigators,
further promoting knowledge dissemination and adoption of best practices.
