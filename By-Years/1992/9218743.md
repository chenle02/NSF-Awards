This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Site Response and Ground Failure during Earthquakes, to be held June
7-9, 1993 in Northern California. The co-organizers are Professor I.M. Idriss,
University of California, Davis, and Professor Kenji Ishihara, University of
Tokyo. The objective of the seminar is to exchange information on geotechnical
earthquake engineering in such areas as liquefaction in sandy soils and the
consequences of liquefaction and the response of soil sites underlain by layers
of soft soils that can amplify the seismic motions (particularly in the long
period range) and thus pose additional hazards to structures and other
facilities constructed at such sites. Seminar sessions will focus on the latest
advances in ground response and amplification effects, site characterization,
ground failure (case histories such as the Loma Prieta Earthquake), and analysis
of liquefaction-induced flow failures and deformations. The participants include
some young researchers and some scientists who have already formed close
collaborative ties with Japanese scientists. This seminar is a valuable step in
the continuing efforts to understand and to incorporate into design and
practice, measures to mitigate the effects of earthquake strong ground shaking
as manifest through site response and ground failure.
