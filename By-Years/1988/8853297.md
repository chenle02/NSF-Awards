A computing facility has been established to support curricula in mathematics
and the sciences. The computing center's mission is the education of students in
computed aided data analysis and presentation such as that they will encounter
in the workplace and in graduate education. The close coupling of the graphics-
based computing facility and a series of courses integrates in a unique way the
viewpoint and intellectual ecumenism characteristic of small colleges with the
data analysis and presentation rigor found in specialized programs. The grantee
provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
