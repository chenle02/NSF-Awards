Hemoglobin acts as a receptor for a variety of small molecular weight compounds.
Some of these have potential as anti-sickling agents or agents that promote
delivery of oxygen, but so far their practical application has foundered on
their strong affinity for serum albumin. The stereochemistry of binding of these
molecules to the recently solved structure of serum albumin will be explored
with a view to modifying their structure so as to lower their affinity for
albumin without lowering the affinity for hemoglobin. Work on the binding of
potential anti-sickling compounds to hemoglobins has led to the finding that
these compounds seek out niches in the protein that fit their van der Waals
shape, and that within those niches the compounds arrange themselves so as to
maximize the electrostatic interaction between drug and protein. Recent
experience has shown that this rule is far from sufficient to allow us to
predict where these molecules will bind to different sites in the protein. Most
receptors are large membrane proteins of as yet unknown structure. Hemoglobin is
an ideal model receptor for exploring the rules that govern small molecular to
proteins. Human globin can now be made in E.coli. This has opened the way to
directed mutagenesis of hemoglobin, and this will allow an exploration of the
evolution of the hemoglobin structure and of its specialized functions in
different species. One possible strategy towards the prevention of sickling
would be inhibition of the phosphoglyceromutase that converts 1,3- to 2,3-
diphosphoglycerate. Horseradish peroxidase is widely used in diagnostic tests
and could be adapted to more uses by directed mutagenesis, but its structure is
unknown. Efforts are under way to determine the structures of both these
proteins.
