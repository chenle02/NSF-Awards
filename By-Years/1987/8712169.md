The experimental work underway will evaluate the effect of chemical additives on
the generation of soot in flames. In particular, the mechanism of ion production
will be investigated, in connection with its role in nucleation or coagulation.
A variety of important additives are tested on three types of diffusion flames.
The role of soot is critical in fires where it incapacitates and clings its
victims; it is also a factor of spreading because its highly radiative
properties create ignition conditions well ahead of the flames. It is also, of
course, a byproduct of inefficient energy release in combustors. A good
understanding of the ability of some chemicals to control soot would have a far-
reaching practical effect in fuel and material design.
