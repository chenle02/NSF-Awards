Little is know about how hybrid plants and zones affect herbivore distributions
and evolution. Studies of insects on cottonwoods by these investigators
demonstrated that hybrids should no longer be treated as anomalies and that
fundamentally important interactions occur in these zones of unparalleled
genetic variability. The proposed work will continue these studies to address 3
major hypotheses that have far reaching implications for understanding plant-
herbivore interactions. First, are natural plant hybrid zones focal points of
insects biodiversity? If true the loss of these zones may results in the
extinction of many insect species. Because the Endangered Species Act of 1973
does not protect hybrid plants, studies of this issue are important from both
basic and applied perspectives. Second, do natural plant hybrid zones act as
bridges that facilitate insect and pathogen host shifting? Hybrid intermediates
may be used by insects as stepping stones to gradually shift from one plant
species to another. If true, this process would represent a fundamentally new
view of how insects and pathogens host shift. Third, does the presence of
susceptible hybrids affect insect evolution and perhaps even prevent them from
becoming adapted to resistant host plants? Here the investigators will examine
the implications of mixed resistance and susceptibility in plant populations as
it might affect insect evolution. This question has important implications for
understanding insect distributions and could affect insect management practices.
This research will provide an important contribution to the overall
understanding of hybrid zones, potentially extremely important habitats in the
evolution and ecology of plants herbivores insects.
