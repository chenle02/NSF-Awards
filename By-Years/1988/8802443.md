This study will examine the power production of closely related insects over a
wide size range using three different approaches. First the metabolic rate will
be measured for these animals in free flight. Second, using video of the animals
in flight analyzed frame by frame and aerodynamic theory the mechanical power
requirements can be calculated. Third, the muscle of the same species will be
examined directly to measure their maximal force production using standard
physiological techniques. The muscles will be examined under electronmicroscopy
to determine the magnitude of force producing components (myofibrils) and
aerobic energy production (mitochondria). All these components will be
determined over a wide size range of moths to examine the role of size change in
muscle function.
