Nanoscale interfaces are examined in both single phase materials and multiphase
materials. The goal is to obtain a better understanding of the atomic level
structure and chemistry of interfaces in nanostructured materials. An initial
comparison is made between grain boundary structures, energies and hardness in
an iron-based alloy as a function of grain size and preparation technique (gas
atomization and mechanical attrition). Intermetallic alloys and composites are
included in the research for comparison to the single phase alloys. Deformation
and grain refinement are followed as a function of mechanical attrition
variables in multiphase alloys, including composites. Several techniques are
used to characterize the nanostructured state: X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, high resolution electron microscopy for interface
structure, and differential scanning calorimetry to measure the stored enthalpy
of deformation. %%% This research examines the processing, structure, and
chemistry of nanostructured materials. This is a new class of materials that can
possess unique properties because of the extremely fine grain size developed in
the processed structure. The research also examines the mechanical alloying
process used in producing commercial quantities of metal alloys.
