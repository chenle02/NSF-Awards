This action funds Brian Damit of The University of Florida to conduct a research
project, entitled "Determining how airborne bacteria die by high temperatures,"
during the summer of 2012 at Peking University in Beijing, China. The host
scientist is Professor Maosheng Yao.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the first detailed
experimental study to test an existing theory of how high temperature kills
airborne bacteria. Pathogenic airborne microorganisms in bioaerosols pose a risk
of infection. Recently, it has been shown that they can be killed by infrared
radiation that exposes them to high temperatures for a short time. This research
seeks to determine the inactivation mechanism by observing possible cell
structure damage using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)and DNA degradation
using gel electrophoresis. Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacterium, will be
used as the model microorganism in these studies. Broader Impacts of an EAPSI
fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside
the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific
infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society,
culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for
international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers,
and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.
