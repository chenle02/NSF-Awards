Two fundamental mechanisms in the mechanics of granular materials will be
studied. One is the micromechamics of soil liquefaction under cyclic loading.
The other is the dynamics of moving sediment layers. Two primary transport modes
will be examined: sliding and flowing. Stability mechanicsm are suggested as
determing the transition between one and the other. The study will lead to a
better characterization of soil response to earthquakes and also the response of
granular seabed material to cyclic loading from surface waves. In both cases,
liquefaction of the saturated medium has important structural and geophysical
consequences.
