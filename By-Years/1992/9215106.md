This research program is two years in duration and involves the development of
a novel photofragmentation-laser induced fluorescence technique for the study of
hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical kinetics under atmospheric conditions. It builds on a
demonstrated capability to detect hydroxyl (HO) radicals with high sensitivity
in laboratory kinetic studies. A single pulsed laser system will be used to
photodissociate HO2, generating OH photofragments which will then be detected by
laser induced fluorescence. Laser flash photolysis will be used to generate HO2.
Initial work will focus on determining the optimal HO detection scheme to
maximize sensitivity and minimis interferences. Four potential HO2 production
schemes will be used to study the kinetics of the reaction of the hydroperoxyl
radical with nitric oxide.
