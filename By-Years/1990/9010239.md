The objectives of this project are the synthesis of digitally implemented
demodulator architectures which achieve near ideal coherent digital
communication performance in the frequency nonselective slow fading channel.
Coherent digital communication performance provides a 3 dB improvement over the
most commonly utilized fading channel demodulation architecture, differentially
coherent detection. Digitally implemented architectures are the best method of
achieving this coherent performance since they possess many practical and
theoretical advantages. The first stage of this project focuses on the
development of generalized algorithms for carrier estimation and symbol
demodulation. This work is developing phase estimation algorithms optimized for
the fading channel and a carrier with frequency uncertainty. In the second phase
symbol timing estimation and joint phase and symbol timing estimation on the
fading channel is being investigated. The work will help produce modems with
near optimal performance on the fading channel with many practical advantages.
