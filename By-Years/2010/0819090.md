As nations and local communities confront the challenge of controlling the
distribution of drugs and associated crimes (e.g., burglary, fraud, robbery,
murder), policymakers need more and better knowledge of the role of law in
fostering and limiting drug market-related crime, especially violence, across a
broad range of drug types and drug policies. Social scientists have long held
that illicit drug markets are prone to high levels of predation and retaliation
due to the absence of lawful dispute-resolution mechanisms. No single study,
however, has systematically examined this theory in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the relationship between drug
market respectability (i.e., legality), predation, retaliation, and formal
mediation in the diverse drug markets of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Amsterdam
is ideal for a study of drug market behavior because it is characterized by
three distinct drug markets with varying legal respectability: cafés selling
legal (albeit regulated) alcohol (beer, wine, liquor); coffee shops selling
decriminalized cannabis (marijuana and hashish) and buying prohibited cannabis;
and street dealers selling prohibited hard drugs (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine, and
heroin). Theory predicts that because they are less likely to report their
victimization to the police, street dealers should be involved in more
victimization and retaliation than coffee shop employees, who should be involved
in more victimization and retaliation than café employees. This theory will be
examined with quantitative and qualitative data obtained from interviews with
and observations of café employees, coffee shop employees, and street dealers.
By taking advantage of a "natural experiment" in drug market law, findings of
this project will provide scientists and policymakers in the U.S. and other
nations with important theoretical and practical insights into the effects of
drug prohibition on crime.
