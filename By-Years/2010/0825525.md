Programming languages play a critical role in computer science by providing a
flexible and robust interface through which human beings control computer
systems. In the past ten years, programming language design and implementation
has advanced significantly in response to the pervasiveness of computer science
and technology. This award will fund a new workshop that will bring together
programming language experts from research, educational, and industrial
institutions to discuss the role of programming language design, implementation,
and application in modern, undergraduate computer science education. The
participants will critically evaluate the state of programming language
education and identify the transformational changes needed to best prepare
undergraduates in the US educational system to compete in, to contribute to, and
to advance the rapidly changing field of computer science and technology. The
workshop will produce a report to disseminate the resulting ideas to the broader
community to spark continued efforts to have programming language curriculum
keep pace with higher-education curricula Cutting-edge curricula are essential
to prepare a U.S. workforce that is globally competitive, able to generate and
to apply new knowledge, and to take the lead in advancing computer science and
technology.
