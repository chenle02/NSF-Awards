Political institutions in African societies are changing as a result of
decolonization, social pressures, environmental problems, and changes in world-
wide economic systems. Many groups are reviving political structures that were
extant before European colonialization and modifying them to meet contemporary
needs. In this project, the researcher will study the social and cultural
dimensions of the Mpezeni Ngoni's (eastern Zambia) political transformations.
This society is reinstituting a monarchy and its accompanying rituals which had
been suppressed during the colonial era. The researcher will discover how power
and authority are being expressed in this new situation by focusing on the
monarchy's place within the Zambian state system and its effect on
agriculturalists. He will help explain the seemingly contradictory processes of
nationalism and ethnic tribalism that are affecting the political structure of
the country.
