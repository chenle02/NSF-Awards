9420801 An Italy-U.S. Symposium in Social Psychology will be held in Bertinoro,
Italy from May 28 - June 4, 1995. The conference will include 15 Italian and 15
U.S. Social Psychologists drawn from the most active and productive researchers
in the field and covering the majority of research topics currently
investigated. The goal of the conference is to bring together two research
communities that have had little contact despite considerable domains of mutual
interest and to foster cross-fertilization of research ideas in these domains,
which include: the social psychology of culture; social influence; social
development; intra- and intergroup relations; social cognition; communication
and language. This goal will be accomplished through a series of workshops, each
of which will be jointly led by an Italian and a U.S. expert in that field, who
will collaborate in advance to plan the workshop. Other participants in each
workshop will prepare posters summarizing their research in the area in order to
ensure maximal involvement by all participants.
