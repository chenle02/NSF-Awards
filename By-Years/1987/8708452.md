The "Scientific Revolution" of the 17th century stands as a watershed in the
development of world civilization. A major component of the transformation which
took place at that time in the way we look at the world is what Andre Koyre
called the geometrization of nature. In order to understand science and how it
has developed, it is essential that we should understand how and why Western
natural philosophers turned to mathematics as the key to unlock the secrets of
nature. Galileo sounded the battle cry for this revolution, but why was he so
moved to put mathematics in this special place? Dr. Livesey is investigating
this issue and has found a possible source coming from a most unlikely
direction, at least given our current expectations. Despite its supposed
antipathy to science, Dr. Livesey hypothesizes that the source of the
mathematization of nature came from theology| Specifically, he has found in the
commentaries in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries to a theological treatise,
Peter Lombard's "Sentences," discussions of the nature of science which allowed
for the use of mathematics in the study of nature. Aristotle, except in very
limited circumstances, proscribed in his "Posterior Analytics" the use of
mathematics in science. With this grant, Dr. Livesey will seek to determine the
dimensions of the movement stemming from these theological commentaries to
create a mathematical physics. The project will be carried out in two stages.
The first stage will examine an early commentary by John of Reading, a
contemporary of William of Ockham. The second phase of the study will be a more
comprehensive examination of the later developments leading up to Galileo. This
study holds great promise to radically change our view of the processes of
development of modern science and of the relationship of science and religion.
