Abstract 9613847 Ruohoniemi This project will apply the capabilities of the
existing SuperDARN (Dual Auroral Radar Network) high frequency (HF) radar pairs
in the Arctic and Antarctic to the data needs of the National Space Weather
Program (NSWP). These radars are operated in large arrays in both polar regions
by several nations. One of the principal ways in which solar activity influences
the Earth is through the effect of the solar wind on the magnetosphere and the
upper atmosphere. The SuperDARN radars measure the flow velocity of ionospheric
structures in the upper atmosphere from which the driving magnetospheric
electric fields can be deduced, thus in its present form the radars can provide
important data for the research component of the NSWP. Additionally, the project
will implement real-time data links which will provide alerts of sudden
disturbances in the near-Earth space environment. ***
