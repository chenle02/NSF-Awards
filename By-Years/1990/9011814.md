This proposal request funds for the purchase of an x-ray diffractometer and
accessory equipment. This instrument would provide data on the structure of
biological micro-molecules which is essential for an understanding of
relationship between structure and function. Professors Benkowic, Farber,
Matthews Villafranca in the Chemistry Department and Professors Johnson and Tien
in the Molecular and Cell Biology Department at the Pennsylvania State
University are involved in a variety of projects which probe different aspects
of the folding, stability and activity of enzymes. Their efforts have resulted
in a large body of data on the solution phase properties of these proteins which
they would now like to understand in terms of the three-dimensional structure.
In many cases, the genes for these proteins have been cloned into high
expression vectors and can be manipulated by protein engineering. An X-ray
Diffraction Facility would provide a means of obtaining high resolution
structural data on the naturally- occurring proteins and the mutants constructed
to probe the structure/function/folding relationships. The information obtained
would play a crucial role in advancing the knowledge of proteins and greatly
improve the possibility of harnessing these macromolecules to solve pressing
problems in medicine, biochemistry and chemistry.
