The Problem Based Learning (PBL) in Advanced Manufacturing: Transforming 21st
Century Technician Education project builds on several successful projects and
is developing a curriculum and providing professional development to bring
problem based learning to advanced manufacturing training. The work primarily
supports Community Colleges. The industry partnerships in this project will
sustain the work beyond the funding period. Problem based learning is a well
recognized, highly engaging teaching pedagogy and is improving student
achievement in several areas of advanced manufacturing. The project is
developing and disseminating PBL lessons for several interdisciplinary real-
world advanced manufacturing challenges. To facilitate expansion of the program,
the project investigators are also creating PBL design templates that make it
easier for others to create effective PBL lessons. As the project progresses,
investigators continue to study the efficacy of PBL in engineering technician
and STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional development and ongoing
support is provided to community college engineering technician faculty across
New England enabling them to implement PBL in the classroom. Outreach to high
schools is increasing the number of students prepared to enter STEM majors.
