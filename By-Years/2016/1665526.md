The PI will continue his research into spectral theory, especially the spectral
theory of orthogonal polynomials. Spectral theory concerns the relation of
mathematical models to their "spectral characteristics" and includes such areas
as computer tomography, sonar analysis, and scattering of subatomic particles.
Orthogonal polynomials are the simplest paradigm, especially useful because the
inverse problem --often difficult to even show has solutions -- is so explicit.
The PI will study several problems connected with orthogonal polynomials and its
close relative, the Chebyshev polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three main areas
will be studied. The first involves higher sum rules, a subject where the PI was
a pioneer. It is intended to follow up on recent progress using the method of
large deviations, a technique from probability theory. The second concerns
studying Chebyshev polynomials. Recently, the PI settled a 45 year old
conjecture involving polynomials associated to subsets of the real line and will
study the more subtle case of general subsets of the complex plane in the new
grant period. The third area concerns Schrodinger operators on trees with
periodic potential. The paradigm is periodic Schrodinger operators on the real
line but there are new issues connected with the fact that the symmetry group is
now non-abelian.
