The goal of this work is to develop and apply modern free probability theory
(FPT) to advance understanding of applied problems that traditionally are
thought to be too difficult to tackle. The difficulty with quantum many-body
systems (QMBS) research is two-fold: 1. The spectra of the sum of local
interactions is not easily obtained from the spectra of the summands and 2. The
exponential growth with the number of particles of the Hilbert space makes exact
diagonalization feeble for any serious study of matter. The nature of the work
will be both analytical and computational. The techniques are either entirely
unknown to natural scientists or that their potential applicability is obscured
by formal presentations. The purpose of this work is to apply an alternative
methodology in probability to new physical problems.
