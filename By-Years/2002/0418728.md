In this U.S.-Venezuela planning visit supported by the Americas Program of the
Office of International Science and Engineering and the Interfacial, Transport
and Thermodynamic Processing Program of the Division of Chemical and Transport
Systems, Ronald Neuman of Auburn University will travel to two institutions in
Venezuela, the Universidad Simon Bolivar (USB) in Caracas, and the Universidad
de Los Andes (ULA) in Merida. The purpose of these visits is to plan new
research collaborative projects with Professor Erich A. Muller at USB and
Professor Jean-Louis Salager at ULA. The proposed research projects will
investigate interfacial phenomena in complex fluid (liquid/liquid) systems and
reflect the complementary expertise of the collaborators involved. The
collaborative project with USB will employ recent advances in molecular
simulation and parallel computer processing to investigate the liquid/liquid
extraction of metals from aqueous to nonpolar organic phases. The proposed
project with ULA will investigate complex crude oil emulsions stabilized by
solid particles to obtain fundamental knowledge that will be applied to develop
new remediation and pollution cleanup methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research has the potential for the development of an environmentally clean
method to remove oil spills from coastal beaches and obtain a clean oil product
that can be recycled back into petroleum refining operations. The proposed
activities involve the exchange of graduate students and undergraduate students,
who will thus have first-hand experience with international
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
