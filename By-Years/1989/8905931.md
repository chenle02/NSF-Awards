There is a diverse group of cyprinind ostracodes (minute shelled crustaceans)
that produce bioluminescent flashes thought to be unique to each separate
species. Drs. James Morin and Anne Cohen have been collecting and documenting
the morphology, geographic distribution, and underwater bioluminescent displays
of dozens of previously undiscovered species in the Caribbean. They propose to
complete their description of these closely related bioluminescent species, and
then use the morphological data to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships.
Data on their geographic distributions and bioluminescent display behavior will
then be compared to the pattern of their evolutionary relatedness, thereby
testing hypotheses of how display behavior and the shifting geography of the
Caribbean have impacted on their evolutionary history. The proposed research
would document a poorly known and fascinating group of organisms, and would use
the documentation to explore hypotheses of their evolutionary history, Caribbean
biogeography, and behavioral ecology relating to bioluminescense. A wide variety
of evolutionary biologists will find these results of interest.
