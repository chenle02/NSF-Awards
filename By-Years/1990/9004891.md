This award provides 50% of the funding needed to construct five special design
reaction vessels for use at high pressure and temperature. The design,
construction and operation of the pressure vessels will be under the direction
of the Principal Investigator in the Division of Geological &amp; Planetary
Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech will provide the
remaining 50% funding necessary for the project. The proposed apparatus
incorporates a novel feature whereby the sample is magnetically levitated during
an experiment and can be rapidly moved into and out of the hot zone within the
vessel without release of pressure. The vessels will be used in a wide variety
of projects aimed at understanding the behavior of volatile components in
natural and synthetic model igneous systems, including: investigations of the
partitioning of hydrogen isotopes between vapor and silicate melts and its
relation to the speciation of water in magmatic liquids; studies of the
solubility and diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in silicate glasses and
melts; study of the partitioning of carbon isotopes between vapor and silicate
melts.
