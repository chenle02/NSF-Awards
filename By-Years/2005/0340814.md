This ADVANCE Fellows award supports the research of Alison P. WIlliams at
Princeton University. The project will provide experimental measurements of the
preferential interaction parameter, which describes the interactions between
nucleic acid oligomers and other ions in aqueous solution. Several techniques,
including optical melting techniques, equilibrium dialysis, ion analysis and
capillary electrophoresis will be used to determine the preferential interaction
parameters. This work will enhance the effort to understand and model the role
of charge in determining physical properties of nucleic acids. Results can be
applied to current problems in a wide range of fields from nucleic acid
replication and antisense therapy to nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award is supported through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
women in academic science and engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;
