In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Anne Myers Kelley of the University of California -
Merced and her postdoctoral and undergraduate research students will investigate
the resonance raman and resonance hyper-raman spectra of a family of organic
molecules. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop a firmer
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the second-order non-linear optical
responses of conjugated organic molecules - molecules that are important
components of optoelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the
broader impacts of the proposed research, Prof. Kelley's research will be
integrated into the interdisciplinary programs that are to be the hallmark of
the Merced campus of the University of California. In addition, the
undergraduates involved in research are expected to include a number of students
from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
