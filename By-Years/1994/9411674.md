Pennebaker The failure to disclose upsetting thoughts or feelings places people
at higher risk for physical and mental health problems, whereas being induced to
write or talk about these feelings yields improvements in health. This program
of research will investigate the psychological mechanisms mediating these
effects. Specifically, it will evaluate the degree to which verbally labeling
and describing experimentally induced anger and sadness reduces autonomic
nervous system activity, as indexed by skin conductance level. It will also
evaluate the degree to which verbalizing negative emotions promotes a coherent
cognitive organization of upsetting events, as indexed by ratings of the
succinctness, coherence, and emotionality of essays written about prior
emotional events. In addition to investigating the effects of verbalizing
emotions that have been experimentally induced, this research will examine the
effects of describing traumatic events that have occured outside of the
laboratory, such as a recent job loss. Recent research has demonstrated that
when individuals are unable or unwilling to disclose upsetting thoughts or
feelings to others, they are at higher risk for physical and mental health
difficulties. Conversely, when people are induced to write or talk about
upsetting personal experiences, improvements in health are found. This research
will determine the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects by
investigating the cognitive, physiological, and emotional consequences of
translating stressful events into language.
