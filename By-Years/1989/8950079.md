This two-week seminar provides undergraduate faculty in engineering and applied
science a working knowledge of accident and emergency management. Topics
include: regulatory considerations; process fundamentals; plant equipment;
fires, explosions and other accidents; accident prevention; dispersion
principles and calculations; hazard and risk assessment principles and
calculations; and case studies. Part of the seminar experience is the
development of problems for use in teaching the topics to undergraduates. A
three-day follow-up session in the summer of 1990 will provide an opportunity
for review and assessment of the seminar, including the problems. The grantee
provides funds for this project that are approximately 30% of the NSF award.
