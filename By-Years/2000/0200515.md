This grant provides funding for the development of high bandwidth fast actuators
and control for machining applications. The fast tool servos will be used to
machine software programmed deterministic surfaces and compensate for dynamic
errors occurred in the process. The research will first develop an innovative
fast actuator, which combines dual-stage solid state actuators with fluid power
transmission for high bandwidth actuation in a compact package. Multivariable
linear robust performance control design method, which incorporates repetitive
control, previewed feedforward control, and the effect of the cutting force in a
unified feedback control formulation, will be developed for the actuator to
precisely generate dynamic trajectories. To realize the fastest possible
actuator response so that a fine feature may be machined, switching control for
pulse width modulation will also be investigated. Machining experiment will be
conducted to test the actuator and control capabilities. In particular, the fast
tool servos will be used to generate non-circular engine cylinder bore shapes
for compensating cylindrical errors and surface texture to provide improved
cylinder-piston fit and tribology conditions, thereby reducing emission,
increasing fuel economy, and simplifying manufacturing processes.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the
speed, accuracy, and consistency of machining such irregularly shaped parts as
engine piston profiles, piston pin holes, and cylinder bores. Potentially the
proposed work could also be applied to machining deterministic tribology surface
in parts like journal bearings, linear guide ways, and hydraulic
valves/cylinders. The proposed work also contribute in the general motion
control field. The proposed actuator and control design methods may contribute
to extend the motion control performance and find new applications besides
machining.
