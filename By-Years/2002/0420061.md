This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project proposes
to use high pressures for disaggregation and proper refolding of aggregated
proteins in commercial IVIg (immunoglobins for intravenous administration)
formulations.

The commercial application of this project will be in improved quality of
therapeutic proteins for intravenous administration. Increased process yields
will lower patient costs for IVIg therapies, and IVIg formulations with
dramatically diminished aggregate content will lower side effects and reduce the
risk of severe complications.
