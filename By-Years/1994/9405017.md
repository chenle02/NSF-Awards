This proposal requests funds in partial support of a symposium to be held on the
campus of Indiana University, Bloomington, from October 27 - 30, 1994. The
symposium is entitled, "Origins and evolution of animal body plans". The problem
of the origin of animal body plans and their modification in evolution has
become a topic of considerable excitement. Evidence from paleontology on the
pattern and history of the Cambrian radiation provides one new source of data
and insight. Molecular phylogeny is now beginning to make an important impact on
understanding these events as well. Finally, the explosive recent progress in
developmental genetics has revealed both important mechanisms subject to
evolution and genes that play major regulatory roles in development of a wide
diversity of animals. The interface between paleontologists, developmental
biologists, molecular biologists, and evolutionary biologists has become
striking, and has begun to resolve major problems in when and how animal body
plans appeared and how they have been modified in evolutionary time. The meeting
is the eighth in an annual series presented under the auspices of the Indiana
Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology at Indiana University. Previous
topics have included "The genetic and molecular analysis of development",
"Proteins as machines", and "Biological regulation by protein modification". The
objectives of the organizing committee are to bring together an international
group of the leaders in the disciplines that are contributing to major aspects
of the central theme to present the current ideas contributed by their
disciplines. Previous experience has shown that integrative conferences can
produce new syntheses in science. The timing is appropriate to achieve this kind
of interaction on this topic. Although existing meetings deal with some aspects
of these subjects, no one meeting has attempted to fully integrate all of the
approaches. There is no society devoted to the evolution of development, and
equivalent results cannot be met through existing society meetings.
