This dissertation research project will support a student in cultural
anthropology who will travel to a semi-arid region of Tanzania. The student
study the impact of resource conflicts by herders on environmental, mainly
range, degradation. In addition the political and economic factors that have
impelled herders to migrate will be analyzed as they indirectly cause
degradation in the natural environment. The student will use a combination of
intensive ethnographic interviewing and observation and surveys with archival
research on policy and census information. %%% This sort of research is
important because environmental degradation causes deteriorating living
conditions for many people in the world. Increased understanding of the factors
causing such degradation can help policy makers design procedures that minimize
such problems.
