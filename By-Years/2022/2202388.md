Joseph Simon is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry
out a program of research and education at the University of Colorado. Combining
pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements of the gravitational wave (GW) background
with electromagnetic observations of galaxy mergers, Simon will model how black
holes (BH) merge to form supermassive black holes (SMBH). Results from this
project will allow astronomers to better understand how SMBH grow in mass. Simon
will also provide research mentoring to undergraduate students and engage them
in a program of outreach activities to local middle schools and high schools
serving under resourced communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hints of the GW
background emerging in PTA data appear inconsistent with theoretical predictions
neglecting the contributions from BH-BH mergers and imply that SMBHs are more
massive, or merge more frequently than previously thought. In this project,
Simon will incorporate the best available observations of galaxy mergers and the
SMBH mass function alongside a new prescription for the binary evolution
timescale into his modeling framework for the binary SMBH population and the GW
background. He will first use his refined models to extract the binary evolution
timescale from PTA data. He will then combine the electromagnetic observations
of galaxy mergers and the SMBH mass function with PTA observations to conduct
the first multi-messenger measurement of SMBH mass growth due to BH-BH mergers.
This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big
Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
