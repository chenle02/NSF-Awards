Peres The proposer intends to study several problems in Probability theory,
concerning tree-indexed processes, intersections of "small" random sets, and
Hausdorff dimension. The problems involve potential theory for images of "small"
sets under Brownian motion, and the relation between branching processes and
ranges of certain lattice random walks. Intersections of Brownian sample paths
were first studied by Dvoretzky, Erdos and Kakutani more than forty years ago.
Intersections of random walk paths are in some ways harder to analyze; Lawler's
(1991) book presents most of what is known about them. The proposer's approach
to these problems is motivated by his recent work, which shows that certain
sample paths (e.g. of Brownian motion ) are "equivalent" to certain "random
Cantor sets" constructed via a branching process, in the sense that the same
deterministic sets are hit by these two types of random sets with positive
probability. The remaining problems have close ties to ergodic theory; they
involve the Hausdorff dimension of measures on Galton Watson trees and on
invariant sets for expanding maps. It is proposed to study several problems in
probability theory involving intersections of random paths in space. Some of
these problems were studied by mathematicians forty years ago, but in the last
decade there has been renewed interest, as mathematical physicists have shown
the relevance of this topic to questions of physical interest. Classical notions
of "Fractional dimension" play an important role in this study. A recurring
theme is that complicated configurations are best understood by finding the most
uniform way to distribute mass on them. New mathematical tools, developed for
very different purposes, offer an exciting approach to these problems.
