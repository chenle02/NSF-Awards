Stetson University will purchase personal computers, digital plotters, and data
acquisition modules. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in
introductory physics laboratory courses. Students will learn basic techniques of
computer-controlled data acquisition and analysis, and will study basic physical
phenomena that are too fast for measurement by traditional techniques. Stetson
University will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
