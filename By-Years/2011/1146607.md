How does the brain create orderly sequences of behavior? The problem of serial
order in behavior permeates human language, the ability to play a musical
instrument, or any number of other activities where human or animal intent can
only be effectively communicated if several behavioral gestures are chained
together in a specific sequence. How the brain accomplishes this task is
currently unknown. One approach is to use an animal model (a songbird, the zebra
finch) in which the brain region responsible for the serial ordering of song
syllables has been identified (called "HVC", the acronym is the proper name).
This project will investigate the hypothesis that the serial ordering of song
syllables is mapped across several spatially-arranged chains of HVC neurons.
This hypothesis is based on preliminary data indicating that HVC neural activity
is largely confined to a single spatial axis during singing. Experiments will
delineate the spatial organization of connections and electrophysiological
properties of HVC neurons. Computational models based on the properties of HVC
neurons will then be used to discover network configurations that produce
orderly, sequential patterns of neural activity. Models will be validated with
circuit-breaking experiments in behaving birds. Results will provide a first
look at a network architecture used by an animal brain to create order and
sequence in behavior, which in turn will provide a computational platform to
understand how the process of learning new behavioral sequences utilizes or
shapes such architectures. The research plan coordinates the activity of a
faculty research team from three different academic departments (Psychology,
Mathematics and Statistics), providing graduate and undergraduate students with
access to the expertise of faculty researchers outside their home departments.
Computational software tools as well as data from this project will be made
available to the public at http://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/software/birdsong/
