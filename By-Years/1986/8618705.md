This research will investigate the nature and causes of historic crustal
deformation in the Imperial Valley, S. California and the Intermountain Seismic
Zone near Hebgen Lake, Montana. Previous investigations in both of these areas
clearly indicate unusually large crustal deformations which are demonstrably
associated with tectonic activity. Deformation in the Imperial Valley appears to
be related to coseismic and postseismic effects of the 1940, M~7.1 and the 1979,
M~6.6 Imperial Valley earthquakes and ongoing activity (seismic and aseismic)
along the Brawley Seismic Zone. the anomalously large vertical and horizontal
movements in the Hebgen Lake region are most likely due to postseismic
viscoelastic relaxation following the 1959, M~7.5 Hebgen Lake earthquake.
