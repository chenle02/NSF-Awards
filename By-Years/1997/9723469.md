9723469 Bryant The cyanobacterial Photosystem I reaction center is a light-
driven oxidoreductase catalyzing the transfer of electrons from reduced
cytochrome c553 (or plastocyanin) to oxidized ferredoxin (or flavodoxin). The
long-term goal of this research program is to understand the biogenesis of this
complex enzyme, as well as the structural and mechanistic details that allow it
to catalyze the above mentioned reaction with a quantum yield approaching 1.0
and a very high thermodynamic efficiency (~45%). Taking advantage of knowledge
gained during the prior funding period, powerful methods of site-directed
mutagenesis, protein overproduction, biochemical resolution and reconstitution,
chemical rescue and modification, and kinetic optical and EPR spectroscopies
will be used to produce and analyze PS I reaction centers with novel properties.
Photosynthesis in plants, algae and cyanobacteria is the major source of
biological energy and oxygen on the earth. The investigator's work will increase
the knowledge of photosynthesis and will provide information that can
potentially be used for genetic manipulation of photosynthesis in crop plants
