Objective Semiconductor lasers are of great importance to modern communication
because of the enormous bandwidth they provide in transmitting information over
optical fibers. Quantum dot (QD) lasers (based on small clumps of material)
haves significant advantages over the standard technology (which are quantum
wells (QWs) based on thin layers of material), including much greater
temperature-insensitivity and inherently low chip. However, QD-lasers have not
been adopted into commercial laser transmitters largely because no
holographically-fabricated, loss-free, single-mode QD-devices at the
technologically-important wavelength ranges have yet been demonstrated. The
objective is to demonstrate the fabrication of these devices with commercially-
feasible techniques.

Intellectual Merit Because the work will be done in direct collaboration with
Ortel-Emcore (a semiconductor laser company), successful fabrication of the
devices will lead immediately to investigation of their adoption into
telecommunications applications. With loss-free devices, the inherent
performance and fundamental limits of single-mode QD lasers can be finally
evaluated. This proposed mixed-growth method for single mode lasers will be an
enabling technology for the widespread adoption of QD material into the
telecommunications market.

Broader Impacts The many advantages of QD material suggest applications where it
would be superior to quantum well lasers. This technology will drive lower-cost,
high-bandwidth optical communications links. The close industrial-academic
collaboration, including seminars by Ortel scientists given at Binghamton,
seminars by the PI at Ortel and local industries, and on-site work by a graduate
student at Ortel-Emcore, are a valuable component to this project and will be
excellent experience for the students involved.
