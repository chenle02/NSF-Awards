Understanding the behavior of tropical cyclones in order to better predict
their intensities and path is the ultimate goal of this research. One way to
gain insight is to use numerical models to examine various aspects of the
circulation. Two topics will be pursued under this award. The first is a study
of the role of latent heat release from cumulus convection in cyclone
development and how the effects can best be represented in numerical models. An
important part of the investigation will be to compare simulations using two
different cumulus parameterization schemes. The second area involves a study of
the role of the beta-effect, or latitudinal variation of the Coriolis
acceleration, on the motion of tropical storms. The study will be done with a
spectral model which was developed under a previous NSF grant. The research to
be conducted under this award will be for the completion of a graduate student
thesis.
