Maliseet-Passamaquoddy is a native American language spoken today by more than
a thousand individuals in the state of Maine and the province of New Brunswick.
In the summer of 1963 Principal Investigator Karl V. Teeter recorded 42 texts
from the oldest and most distinguished storytellers in each village. The tapes
of these texts and a preliminary transcription of about 130 pages constitute the
raw material for this project In field work beginning in the 1970s, primarily on
Passamaquoddy in Maine, Philip LeSourd arrived at a phonological analysis which
served as the basis for his M.I.T. Ph.D. dissertation. The purpose of this
project is to take advantage of LeSourd's work and his present availability by
having him edit PI's transcriptions to bring them into accord with his own more
functional system. Two significant contributions will be made by the project:
first, it will sharply advance the study of the Maliseet-Passamaquody language.
At the same time it will provide, in its advanced transcription specifically
including accent markings, a model for the work of the many other scholars
studying Algonquian languages.
