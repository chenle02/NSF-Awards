The object of this research is the transfer of solar and thermal radiation
through cirrus clouds, including the scattering of solar radiation by non-
spherical ice particles. To account for the distribution of ice particle sizes
and their effects on radiative transfer, an effective mean size is proposed. The
radiative computations will be compared with available observations.
