The theory of dynamical systems is a modern branch of mathematics which
originated from the study of physical and mechanical problems. It describes how
various abstract and real-life systems evolve over time, and so it has a wide
range of applicability. This project is focused on systems that exhibit
hyperbolic behavior, that is, exponential expansion in some directions and
exponential contraction in other directions. The expansion and contraction
produce a rich and complex behavior of the system, often described as chaotic,
with individual trajectories highly sensitive to small changes in the initial
conditions. Nonetheless, if a system is hyperbolic in a strong sense it is
stable as a whole, that is, qualitatively similar to any small perturbation.
Cocycles are a fundamental tool in the study of dynamical systems. For systems
given by differentiable functions, the derivative and related objects are the
prime examples of cocycles. Another important class of examples is given by
random sequences of matrices or maps. Cocycles are useful in studying when two
dynamical systems are similar and to what extent and, in particular, when a
system is similar to a perturbation or to a standard model.

Cocycles appear naturally in dynamics and, more generally, in group actions. The
principal investigator will study cocycles over hyperbolic, partially
hyperbolic, and non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. The research will be
focused on cocycles with values in non-commutative non-compact groups, such as
the general linear group, groups of linear operators on Hilbert and Banach
spaces, groups of diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds, and groups of isometries
of spaces of non-positive curvature and their generalizations. The principal
investigator will investigate cohomology of cocycles, regularity of a conjugacy
between two cocycles, and existence of conjugacy to simpler cocycles. The
principal investigator will also work on related problems of estimating growth
of a cocycle and its Lyapunov exponents, with a focus on using the periodic
data. These questions are motivated in part by problems in smooth dynamics and
rigidity of systems and actions exhibiting some hyperbolicity. The principal
investigator will use the results on cohomology of cocycles and on non-
stationary normal forms to advance the development of this area. The principal
investigator will focus on topological and smooth rigidity of a single
hyperbolic system and on global rigidity of higher rank hyperbolic abelian
actions on an arbitrary manifold.
