9511750 Zygourakis This project is on research to further develop a model for
migration and proliferation of anchorage-dependent cells that is based on the
concept of cellular automata. The current model takes into account cell motility
and contact inhibition, involves no fitted parameters, and has excellent
agreement with experimental data. The proposed model extension involves: (1)
Cells of different type and shape; (2) Coupling with a receptor/ligand model
which will describe endocytic trafficking and cellular responses; (3) The
ability to handle co-cultures of more than one type; and (4) Cell growth in
multiple layers, i. e. a three dimensional model. In addition, this research
will improve the sensitivity of cell motility assays. ***
