This proposal builds on and extends prior theory and experimental research
related to the problem of sharing benefits and dividing the costs of providing a
common good such as public safety or parks. A related question involves
individual voluntary collective action when volunteering time or making
voluntary contributions to charities. The theoretical foundation of the research
rests on bayesian game theoretic equilibrium models on the basis of which
predictions of the expected behaviors can be derived. The basic experimental
methods involves using human subjects in carefully controlled laboratory
situations involving incomplete information and communications between subjects.
Individual subjects are asked to make decisions about contributing and are
informed exactly how much they will be paid by the experimenter, depending upon
their contribution decisions and the decisions of others. The experiments
explore individual voluntary collective actions under a range of conditions and
will provide insights as to the different types of choice strategies which
individuals utilize in these experiments.
