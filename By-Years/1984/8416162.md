Research is conducted on characterization of the manner by which substances,
which are only slightly soluble in or miscible with water, move through soil and
contaminate groundwater. Sources of these potential contaminants include land
fills, hazardous waste disposal sites, and leaking underground storage tanks for
petroleum products. A theoretical analysis of the ways by which a fluid is
displaced by another from the pore space it occupies is conducted. A
mathematical model describing this process is developed, and laboratory
experimentation is performed to verify the model-predicted behavior of these
fluids.
