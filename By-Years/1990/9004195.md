This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support four projects in the Aerospace
Engineering Department of University of Michigan, Ann Arbor: multidimensional
schemes for the Euler equations, Ken Powell, Phil Roe, and Bram van Leer
participating faculty; fundamentals of vortical flows, Ken Powell participating
faculty; improving the efficiency of explicit Euler codes, Ken Powell and Bram
van Leer participating faculty; adaptive grid refinement methods, Ken Powell and
Phil Roe participating faculty.
