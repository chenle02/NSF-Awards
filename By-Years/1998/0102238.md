0102238 Chen The study of additive functionals is an important part of
probability theory, as it serves as a tool of describing the stochastic
processes in terms of properties like ergodicity and recurrence. This project is
to investigate various limit laws for additive functionals associated to Markov
processes. The recent study shows that the asymptotic magnitudes of additive
functionals of a Harris recurrent Markov process are measured by the partial
Green functions. The progress suggests further questions and establishments in
broader situations. The project lists four areas in which the limit laws of
related additive functionals will be studied under this research. As the first
step toward the general theory, the investigator will look for relations between
weak and strong laws for additive functionals. Specifically, the investigator
will study the limit theorems for additive functionals of diffusion processes
and for the local times embedded in various norm spaces, and the strong laws for
occupation times arising from interacting particle systems. The significance of
this study is also due to its connections to some important problems. The limit
laws for additive functionals have been extensively applied to computer
simulation and control theory. In general, additive functionals describe random
accumulations --- in particular, the capital accumulations of investors in
market environment. The study of additive functionals arising from particle
system will lead to better understanding of population growth and migration of
various species, and of the spreading process of certain diseases. Such models
can be viewed as random system evolving in time and this project is about the
long term behaviors of these systems. This research could achieve: 1) progress
in the general theory of the limit laws for additive functionals; 2)
developments of technologies and tools for study of additive functionals; 3)
solutions to the problems raised from some practically interesting models.
