High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) is a highly surface
sensitive method for determining surface vibrational modes. This method can be
used to identify surface chemistry, and in particular the bonding gemometry and
molecular symmetry of surfaces and adsorbates on surfaces. Unfortunately the
method fails when applied to substrates with a substantial ionic character such
as metal oxides. The project attempts to improve the applicability of HREELS to
substrates with ionic character by use of a data analysis method that draws
heavily on the Maximum Entropy Method from information theory. The approach
promises to be nonsubjective and widely applicable. %%% This award is a Grant
for Exploratory Research to support the research of Dr. Marjorie A. Langell of
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The research, in the general area of
Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on the application of high resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy to metal oxides and other ionic surfaces. The
work promises to enhance the analytical potential of this type of spectroscopy,
and thus make an important contribution to the area of surface analysis.
