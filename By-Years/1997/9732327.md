This project is directed at basic research for the development of data
structures and algorithms for performing computations involving collections of
geometric objects, such as lines, planes, polygons, curves, and spheres. These
topics have applications in computer-aided design, physical modeling, software
engineering, information visualization, and robotics. Specific focus in this
project is given to: 1) algorithms for performing geometric shape analysis and
tolerancing, 2) data structures for efficient geometric data organization, 3)
the combinatorial and algorithmic complexity of graph visualization, 4)
numerical stability and software reliability for geometric computing, 5) object-
oriented design patterns for geometric algorithm implementation. The main
objective of this work is the development of general methodologies for the
design of geometric data structures and algorithms, as well as their
incorporation into object-oriented geometric software libraries. This work has
potential impacts in enabling new capabilities in areas of science and
engineering that model physical objects or that use geometry for information
visualization. In addition, a key component of this work involves the
development of geometric software and Internet technology for use in computer
science education.
