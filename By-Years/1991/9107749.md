This grant supports about 30 graduate students in the earth sciences to
participate in a Symposium on Global Change Studies at the American
Meteorological Society's 1991 annual meeting. The Symposium includes panels on
environmental science and public policy and on environmental sciences and
education. Students have been selected by the Symposium Program Committee. A
written report will be required of each applicant supported. The students will
benefit additionally from participating in other parts of the AMS annual meeting
which has global change as one of its major foci. The stipend would allow for
the full week of activities.
