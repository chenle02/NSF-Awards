This research project aims to develop an integrated network layer capable of
supporting unicast, multicast, and publish-subscribe services on a given topol-
ogy using a single mechanism. Such a service would subsume many of the special-
purpose approaches (e.g. overlays) currently being proposed and used, and would
support novel applications and mobility in a more direct, unified way. The
approach is based on the use of predicates carried in packets to iden-tify
packet destinations. In other words, the network defines a set of predicates
over end systems; each packet carries a predicate from this set, suitably en-
coded, and the job of the network is to deliver the packet (on a best-effort
basis) to all end systems that satisfy its destination predicate (and to as few
others as possible). The major challenge is to design the enrollment, routing,
and for-warding algorithms of the service in such a way that the system can
scale up to support networks much larger than the current Internet. The goal is
to achieve this with overall performance, administrative, and operational
overhead compa-rable to or better than existing approaches. This research
project will explore the fundamental relationships and tradeoffs among topology,
forwarding effi-ciency, and predicate language. It will develop predicate
structures that strike a suitable balance between expressive power and
efficiency. Finally, the project will design, analyze and evaluate efficient
routing and forwarding algorithms and protocols based on those predicate
structures. Results of the research have the potential to enable new networks
capable of supporting a greater variety of application services while avoiding
problems with wide-area routing administra-tion that hamper the current system.
