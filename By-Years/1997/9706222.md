High quality replicas of important fossil specimens are important in
paleoanthropology for making accessible to the research community, teachers, and
students three dimensional representations of rare samples. This small project
is undertaken to create such high quality replicas of several unique fossil
specimens from Australia. These fossil specimens are of considerable interest
because they represent some of the earliest Pleistocene age hominid bones
excavated in Australia. Synthetic silicon molding media and epoxy casting
materials will be employed to create detailed, high quality recreations of these
specimens. The casting efforts of this project will make replicas of these
important fossils available to the American scientific community through the
hominid fossil cast archive at the University of Pennsylvania.
