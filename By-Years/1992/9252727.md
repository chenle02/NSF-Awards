This proposal requests funds to pull together existing data and information on
the impact of from 7 to 9 selected past and current projects funded through
DMDRI in the area of mathematics. This data must be collected through
questionnaires completed and interviews with project p.I.'s, publishers, school
personnel and others. The project P.I.'s are college faculty, publishing
corporation representatives, researchers, directors of informal science
instructional facilities and officers of professional organizations all having
concern for the improvement of mathematics education at the pre-college level.
The results of these impact studies, to be presented in a written report, will
serve DMDRI in setting direction for future funding and in designing more
complete studies in the future
