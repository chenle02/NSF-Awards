Operating systems are both huge -- tens of millions of lines of code -- and
hugely important -- they manage resources and provide services to the
applications that run society. Like all software, operating systems contain
bugs. Unfortunately, bugs in such foundational systems can have catastrophic
consequences, from large-scale data leaks to complete machine takeovers by
malicious agents. The team of researchers develops new tools that can be used to
find and eliminate such bugs before a system is deployed, when the bugs can
compromise performance, reliability, and security. The project's novelties are
foundational techniques, languages, and algorithms that empower software
developers to describe buggy patterns that allow automated tools to scale and
find bugs in many millions of lines of code. The project's impacts will be in
improving the robustness, reliability, and security of real-world operating
systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Existing approaches to bug finding either are
precise or scale to large systems but not both. This project reconciles
scalability and precision with a key insight: that system-specific extensibility
will allow developers to extend core algorithms to check for properties and
patterns that are important to their particular systems in a way that scales to
large code bases. To this end, the researchers develop new symbolic-execution-
based methods that are extensible, precise and scalable, thereby allowing
developers to easily customize extensions to focus on likely error patterns
while allowing them to swiftly ignore many millions of lines of irrelevant code.
The speed, precision and scalability in turn allows developers to directly
integrate the project's tools into their software-development cycle to eliminate
bugs well before deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
