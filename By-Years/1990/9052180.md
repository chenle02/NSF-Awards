This project improves the Electromechanics Laboratory in the Electrical
Engineering Department. This is achieved by the acquisition and construction of
equipment for the study of modern prime movers as found in computer peripherals,
robotics, and percision motion equipment. Experiments characertize step, voice-
coil, and brushless DC motors. This provides the students with an opportunity to
obtain a solid "feel" for the fundamentals governing these motors while
acquainting them with devices highly relevant to their future careers. This
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
