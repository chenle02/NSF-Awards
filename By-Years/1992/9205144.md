Theoretical research will be conducted on the mesoscopic physics of interference
effects in conductors and superconductors. Specific projects will focus on
interference effects in disordered superconductors based on the assumption that
superfluid density has a random sign near the superconductor-insulator
transition; interference effects in hopping conductivity leading to a
quantitative theory for magnetoresistance; interference and interaction effects
in tunnelling density of states exploring the connection between Coulomb
blockade and interaction corrections to the density of states in bulk metals;
and, the interference mechanism for the magnetic-field dependence of the
impurity hopping rate in disordered metals. %%% Theoretical research will be
conducted on the mesoscopic properties of disordered metals, superconductors and
insulators. This area of research in which microscopic quantum phenomena are
manifested in the macroscopic world is of great fundamental importance and, at
the same time, is of great interest to the microelectronics industry.
