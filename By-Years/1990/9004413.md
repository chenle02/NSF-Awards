This research will emphasize integration of isotopic, chemical and fluid
inclusion studies, the relatively new techniques and approaches to include: (1)
Sm-Nd and U-Pb dating of minerals such as fluorite, cassiterite and garnet, (2)
high resolution U-Pb and 40Ar-39Ar geochronological studies of the relationship
between the cooling history of pluton, and the age and temperature of associated
hydrothermal activity, (3) Rb-Sr and 40Ar-39 dating studies of fluid inclusions,
and (4) multi-isotopic (Nd,Sr,Pb,O, H,N,Ar,S,C) and rare earth element studies
of the sources of components in individual minerals and their fluid inclusions.
Two areas of classical hydrothermal mineralization in the United Kingdom. The
Ns-W-As-Cu mineralization of the Cornubian metallogenic province. The second is
the MVT-related fluorite- barite-base metal deposits of the North Pennine
Orefield.
