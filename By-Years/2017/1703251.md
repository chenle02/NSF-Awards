In the conversion of biomass to renewable biofuels, an important intermediate
step is the recovery of dilute organic molecules that will serve as the fuel
from an oil-water mixture. This separation must be done with utmost energy
efficiency, to maximize the net energy recovered from the process. Similarly,
very little of the organics must be left in the water, to maximize the amount of
biofuels produced. Purification of the water would enable the energy sector to
reuse the water. This proposal will use low-energy adsorption on functional
surfaces to efficiently remove organics from oil-water mixtures by developing
fundamental insights into how the chemical composition of functional surfaces
impacts recovery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will couple molecular
simulations and experimental studies to probe the molecular mechanisms for
adsorption of acetic acid and guaiacol from water, two organics which serve as
models for the complex mixture in conversion of biomass to biofuels. These model
compounds were chosen to specifically probe short versus long range molecular
interactions. In addition to standard adsorption and chromatographic methods,
NMR spectroscopy will monitor the dynamics of binding and diffusion. Molecular
simulations will be validated by the experimental measurements, and then used to
examine the roles of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on selective
adsorption. The outcome will be to develop predictive design rules to create
novel hybrid functionalized materials. Outreach efforts will support and expand
the pipeline of K-12 and undergraduate students to pursue careers in the STEM
workforce. Strategies to recover dilute biologically derived organics from water
will impact the energy, agriculture, and environmental sectors, with students
trained to lead scientific solutions to energy-water challenges.
