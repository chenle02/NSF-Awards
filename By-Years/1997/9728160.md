Rohlf 9728160 In recent years, there has been a revolution in the way in which
one is able to capture and analyze the shapes of biological structures. One can
now analyze shape as a whole without having to break it down into sets of ad hoc
variables such as ratios. This project is concerned with the further development
of these morphometric methods - particularly for applications in functional
morphology. Software will also be developed to implement the methods.
Specifically, the PIs will investigate the following topics. 1) extend the
methods to the analysis of articulated structures; 2) develop methods to
identify covarying subsets of landmarks; 3) develop software to express shape
differences as warped (deformed) images; 4) include outline information in the
tps series of software; 5) develop software to analyze asymmetry; and 6) develop
software to fit phylogenetic trees to geometric morphometric data for studies
using the comparative method.
