Tang 9626655 A novel concept, the pseudo-random recurrent artificial neural
networks (ANN) will be used in control applications. The Pseudo-random recurrent
ANN is a novel concept derived from previous work on pseudo-random
interconnection networks. Instead of using a fully connected feedforward or
recurrent network, a pseudo-random ANN is connected with a pseudo-random graph
that can provide almost random connections of lots of neurons with a small
number of links at each neuron. The idea is to use the large number of neurons
to capture the non-linear nature of the control system; and yet the small number
of links makes real-time implementation feasible. The underlying pseudo-random
graph, known as Cayley graphs have been the densest known graphs which means
they have the largest number of nodes for a given degree and diameter. By
exploiting the node-symmetric property of these graphs, simple simultaneous
broadcasting their signals to all other neurons can be developed. The result is
a "brain-like" ANN that have a large number of neurons (hundreds and thousands)
connected in an almost random manner with a relatively small number of
connections. These pseudo-random ANNs will be implemented with reinforcement
control strategies such as the backpropagation of utility and the heuristic
dynamic programming for some existing non-linear control applications. The
investigation of ANNs that do not require complete connections of neurons will
pave the way for a new form of ANN that has more resemblance to its biological
counterpart.
