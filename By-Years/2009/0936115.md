This grant funds in part support for young researchers to attend the 15th
INFORMS Applied Probability Conference. The conference will be held in Ithaca
New York from July 12 - 15th, 2009. The primary topics of the conference relate
to the methods and applications of applied probability as they apply to problems
arising in operations research and management science. However, there are also
talks based on closely related fields such as physics and economics. The primary
goal in supporting young researchers to attend the conference is to help develop
them into future leaders. The conference will provide an opportunity to meet and
learn from existing leaders, and to introduce their ideas to the general applied
probability research community.
