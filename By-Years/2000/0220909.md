Jackie Smith&lt;br/&gt;Fletcher Winston&lt;br/&gt;SUNY at Stony
Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement project
examines the tactics of two environmental social movement organizations-one that
uses moderate tactics, and the other more radical modes of action. The goal is
to understand these different approaches to collective action, and how
relationships with government, businesses, and other nonprofit association might
impact tactical decisions. The study has two components-participant observation
of two environmental groups on Long Island, one using moderate and the other
radical tactics. This will allow the PI to study how processes of interaction
influence tactical choice. The second part of the project includes a mail survey
of a representative sample of environmental groups to gather data on the types
of relationships they hold. Findings from the project could potentially
contribute to our knowledge of how social movement groups come to select tactics
and the effect of relational ties on group mobilization. &lt;br/&gt;
