Many imaging modalities in emerging science and engineering applications involve
super-resolving low-resolution observations of point sources coming from mixed
memberships encoded by different point spread functions. A notable example is
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, whose importance is recognized by the
2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, due to its ability of noninvasive imaging of
complex biological processes at the nanometer scale. The next frontier, which is
three-dimensional super-resolution single-molecule microscopy, allows
reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional images,
using engineered point spread functions to encode the axial information of
different molecules, e.g. by introducing a cylindrical lens. The algorithmic
challenge is therefore to simultaneously separate and resolve as many molecules
as possible from their superposition in order to enhance the time resolution of
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will develop a unified
framework to understand when separation and super-resolution in such mixture
models is simultaneously possible, as well as develop algorithms that are
computationally efficient, provably correct, and robust to noise. Algorithms
will be implemented on real data of three-dimensional super-resolution single-
molecule imaging with collaborators at the Dorothy M. Davis Heart and Lung
Research Institute at OSU. The project provides interdisciplinary opportunities
for students training, where students will develop expertise in mathematical
signal processing, optimization, and biomedical data analysis. The results of
this project will be integrated into graduate-level courses on inverse problems
and high-dimensional data analysis at OSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
