This grant is to provide travel support for four leading US-based
researchers/instructors and forty US-based graduate students to attend the
summer school on Model Predictive Control (MPC). MPC has emerged as both a
leading industrial technology for advanced control, as well as an academic
discipline for graduate level research. On the industrial applications side, the
scope of the technology has increased steadily during the last 30 years from its
roots in process control to encompassing many industrial sectors including:
aerospace, energy systems, automotive, robotic systems, etc. During the same
time period, the scope of MPC research has also widened considerably and
includes both theoretical and computational components.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the summer school is to bring researchers
and practitioners together to provide state-of-the-art overviews and tutorials
on the latest MPC research and applications. Because of its use in real time
applications, the computational aspects of the many forms of MPC formulations
have been the focus of intense research efforts resulting in improvements in
both online and offline versions of MPC algorithms. The topics that will be
covered in the summer school include classical MPC (regulation, estimation, and
disturbance models), robust MPC, stochastic MPC, economic MPC, MPC for sampled-
data systems, online optimization for MPC, and industrial applications of MPC.
The summer school approach to graduate-level education in MPC offers several
significant advantages. The one-week time investment is relatively modest,
making the class available to a much larger numbers of US-based graduate
students. By engaging leading experts in the different MPC topics, the graduate
students will be exposed to more expertise than is available in a single
semester university course offered by a single instructor. By illustrating the
MPC concepts with state-of-the-art and freely available software, the attendees
can take home with them the computational tools required for implementation of
MPC on challenging applications. The ultimate objective is to raise the
technology standard of American manufacturing and operations in a variety of
industries.
