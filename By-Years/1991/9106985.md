UCAR, with support from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), is
sponsoring the creation of a textbook for teaching how an interdisciplinary
climate system model is developed and used for research. This grant supports a
two-week summer workshop for about 40 first-term graduate students at which the
draft textbook would be used to teach climate system modeling. The two-week
session would be taught by selected authors of the textbook and facility of the
University for Wisconsin, Madison, the site of the proposed workshop.
