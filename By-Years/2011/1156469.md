This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site provides a diverse group
of promising students with a summer research experience in order to foster their
intellectual growth as scientists and provide a stepping stone to a rewarding
career at the intersection of social sciences and information technology, with a
focus on incentive-centered design (ICD), an approach to designing systems in a
way that aligns individual incentives with system goals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will participate in research projects in several
areas of ICD, including the design and implementation of trading agents for
complex automated markets, behavioral experiments to understand the factors that
motivate human behavior and test incentive mechanisms, the use of social
motivators to promote healthy behaviors, and the analysis of strategic
properties of all-pay auctions and crowdsourcing contests. REU students are
fully integrated into a research group that matches their intellectual interests
and work as independently as possible with faculty mentors who excel in
supervising undergraduate research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
program aims to attract a diverse group of students to the newly emerging
interdisciplinary field of incentive-centered design, thereby expanding the pool
of students interested in research careers across multiple disciplines. The
research work will be augmented by an extensive array of other educational and
collegial activities that will allow students to view their research experience
in a broader context, build a network of professional contacts, and develop
professional skills in a scientific environment.
