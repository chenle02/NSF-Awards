Undergraduates will have an opportunity to expand their expertise in important
laboratory methodologies in a new course in Molecular and Cellular Techniques.
The course involves a practical hands-on approach. In the eukaryotic cell
culture component of the course, students learn widely-used methods involved in
the propagation, enumeration, screening, and genetic manipulation of plant and
animal cells. New laminar flow hoods, tissue culture phase microscopes,
incubators, and a low temperature freezer will enable class participants to
individually practice and apply a larger number of these methods more
extensively. This enhanced technical training will allow them to prepare more
effectively for research careers and graduate school. The university will
provide 50% matching funds.
