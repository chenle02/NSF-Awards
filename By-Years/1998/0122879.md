This Award is to provide for support of an Annual Grantees Conference of
Metabolic Engineering Projects funded by Agencies participating in the
Interagency Metabolic Engineering Working Group (MEWG). The Conference is
scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on June 28, 2001.
The objective of this Conference is to provide the funding Agencies with an
opportunity to review progress on their Metabolic Engineering Awards. This
Conference will also provide an important service to the research community in
the area of Metabolic Engineering and may identify opportunities for future
research directions. Information generated at this Conference may be useful for
planning purposes for the MEWG and the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering
Programs in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems Division of the NSF
Engineering Directorate. Information presented at the Conference will be
distilled into a report for NSF and the MEWG.
