The overall objective of this project is to examine how reduction of
dimensionality, electrostatic potentials, and other physical factors affect the
production of second messengers. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs
(PLC's), which are found both in the cytoplasm and the membrane hydrolyze
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid found on the cytoplasmic
surface of cell membranes, to produce the second messengers inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylgercerol. The working hypothesis is that PLC's bind
to acidic lipids in biological membranes, producing a loss of dimensionality
that increases the binding of the PLC's to other membrane proteins and to their
substrate, PIP2. Preliminary work has demonstrated that PLC's bind with high
affinity to acidic lipids in phospholipid bilayers. Gel filtration, a novel
centrifugation separation technique, microelectrophoresis, fluorescence
quenching, stopped flow, and surface radioactivity experiments will be used to
measure the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the binding with phospholipid
vesicles and monolayers. The novel theoretical prediction that dimensionality
and electrostatics can produce apparent cooperativity when basic residues on
proteins bind to acidic lipids in membranes will be tested with small basic
peptides and phospholipid vesicles. Dialysis, filtration, mobility, fluorescence
and stopped flow measurements will be used to examine the equilibrium and
kinetic aspects of the binding and to search for lateral phase separation of
acidic lipids.
