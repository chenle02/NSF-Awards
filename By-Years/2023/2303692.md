This project aims to build an open-source ecosystem around Open OnDemand, an
NSF-funded web portal used by nearly 500 research computing centers around the
globe to provide easy access to high performance computing (HPC) resources from
anywhere and from any device. The project’s novelties are a central model to
support and strengthen the open-source online gateway, as well as a development
plan to grow the user community, partnerships and sponsorships. The project’s
impacts are expanding access to research computing resources and bolstering the
pipeline of researchers using HPC for innovation. The project develops a
managing organization that (1) builds a community of Open OnDemand developers,
contributors and clients to facilitates the long-term sustainability of this
critical platform for research computing infrastructure; (2) implements security
and quality assurance processes and infrastructure that are specific to the
needs of Open OnDemand; and (3) conduct market discovery research, in
conjunction with an external consultant, to produce collateral to facilitate
community growth and long term sustainability. Broader impacts of the project
include the increased adoption of research computing resources across science
domains and other research communities, improved collaboration between the
public and private computing sectors and early engagement of students who will
be future research computing clients.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
