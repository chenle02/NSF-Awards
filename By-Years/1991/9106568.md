The objective of this proposal is the development of a full- field measuring
technique for particle velocity and size based on particle image velocimetry
methods. The resolution, accuracy and biases of the technique will be
investigated. The approach will be illustrated for a transient spray. The main
areas of application will be in two-phase turbulent and transient flows. A main
contribution is the automation of particle size measurement, as an alternative
to direct imaging. A key issue which has to be solved is the correlation between
the velocity and particle size. If successful, the proposed technique will be a
significant advancement for a combined full-field particle velocimetry and
particle sizing measurement, with application to particles, droplets or bubbles
of any shape. This is a complimentary method for the point measurements with
phase Doppler velocimetry.
