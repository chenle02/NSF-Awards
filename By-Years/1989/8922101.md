The construction of a nearly identical copy of the successful Las Campanas
Modular Spectrograph, built under the supervision of the Co-Principal
Investigator, is proposed for the Hiltner 2.4 meter Telescope of the MIchigan-
Dartmouth-MIT Observatory on Kitt Peak. The spectrograph will give a factor of
10 more resolution than the present grism spectrograph, and would allow long
slit and multislit work over a 7 arcminute field. Fourteen separate programs,
furthering the efforts of the faculty and staff scientists of the consortium
institutions, will be carried out using the spectrograph. These include programs
on large scale structures in the Universe and their associated velocity fields,
active galactic nuclei, the structure and stellar content of galaxies,
supernovae remnants, protostellar objects, catalclysmic variable stars and white
dwarf.
