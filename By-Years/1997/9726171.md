This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, aims to synthesize and characterize the chemical and electrochemical
behavior of monolayer-protected nanoscopic metal clusters and of novel, mixed
valent solid and semi-solid molecular melt phases. Professor Murray and his
students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will use a wide
range of experimental methods in this work including nuclear magnetic resonance,
Fourier transform infrared red, thermal, fluorescence, and mass spectroscopy
together with electrochemical techniques and conductivity measurements. These
new interfacial materials with nanoscopic dimensions hold technological promise
in electrocatalysis, molecular devices, and electrochromic materials. Novel
thin-film materials incorporating nanoscopic gold clusters and involving
electroactive molecular melts prepared from polyether oligomers that exhibit
polymer-like solid and semi-solid properties will be studied. Professor Murray
and his students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will pursue
studies of these materials using a wide range of experimental techniques while
considering the applicability of these materials in the fields of
electrocatalysis, electrochromic devices, and novel chemical reagents. This work
blends fundamental work in chemistry while keeping clear goals to develop
materials with technological relevance and societal value.
