This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
efficient and flexible device to produce a neutral, linearly-extended, free
radical flux for photovoltaic and semiconductor industry applications. This
source can produce atomic chalcogen species (sulfur, selenium, tellurium) and
other types of free radicals (such as atomic oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen or
chlorine) for formation of various compound thin films by reactive methods. The
project objectives are to increase the chalcogen utilization efficiency, to
reduce equipment maintenance cost and to offer higher deposition rate and lower
substrate temperature without film quality reduction.

The source is flexible, can run over a great range of process parameters, and
can be incorporated into many kinds processes such as metal organic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), evaporation or
sputtering for reactive thin film deposition. Most importantly, this source can
increase the production efficiency of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CdTe thin films,
which are the next generation of solar energy absorbers.
