This grant deals with the problem of what happens when solar UV radiation
interacts with Planetary Atmosphere, especially the atmosphere of the earth.
When solar radiation is incident upon a planet's atmosphere the resulting
interaction depends critically on the wavelength of the solar radiation. While
rayleigh scattering of the visible light causes a blue sky, the more energetic
radiation below 2000 nm can cause dissociation, ionization, and dissociative
ionization of the atmospheric molecules. These modified components of a
planetary atmosphere may react with the ambient species to form a source of new
molecules in the atmosphere, while the results of ionization produces the
ionosphere. It is the purpose of the research proposed herein to investigate
what happens when solar radiation interacts with a planetary atmosphere and to
provide absolute cross sections for each of the specific interaction processes
as a function of wavelength. Some of the processes to be studied are also of
interest in the study of comets and the interstellar medium. The wavelength
range proposed is from 10nm to 140 nm.
