This project aims to develop a sustainable and replicable industry- academic
partnership model for advanced technological education to demonstrate that such
partnerships can improve retention and employment outlook of high risk Hispanic
students in computerized drafting and electronics programs. This partnership
project will: place students and recent graduates in related industries to
provide job experience through internships; include a counseling component based
on TQM concepts applied by industry; provide job- related educational
experiences to additional students through visits to industries including
oral/written visit preparation exercises, visit observation guide, post-visit
reports; provide opportunities in industries for the professional development of
faculty resulting in course content/instructional materials
preparation/modification to integrate classroom learning to industry practices;
and provide teaching experience to alumni who will provide follow-up to
internship participants. Industries provide mentors who assist faculty in their
professional development, give suggestions for instructional materials, provide
group orientations related to industry-specific applications of electronics or
computerized drafting, and serve as mentors to the students. A Board of
Consultants, including industry members, oversees the project implementation.
