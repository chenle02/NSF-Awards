This award is for an investigation that comprises two subprojects in Number
Theory; the common unifying theme is representation of real numbers in non-
integer bases. The first subproject concerns problems in uniform distribution.
The major problem under consideration is higher dimensional normality. The
"bases" become n by n matrices and the "numbers" become points in n-dimensional
space. The problem has been completely resolved by Brown and Moran for commuting
(almost) ergodic matrices. The investigator is, in collaboration with Moran,
attacking the non-commuting case. Another problem in this subproject is Mahler's
question on uniform distribution of the sequence consisting of a real number x
times powers of 3/2. The second subproject concerns approximation spectra. The
investigation is dealing with two problems on this topic. The first is the
conjecture of Barnes and Swinnerton-Dyer on inhomogeneous minima of quadratic
forms. They conjecture that the maximum of the inhomogeneous minima occurs at a
rational point and is isolated. The second problem concerns higher dimensional
approximation spectra. The investigator and J. Lagarias have recently shown that
the Markoff spectrum can be obtained from the Szekeres continuous algorithm in a
natural way. They are attempting to use a similar analysis of the appropriate
continuous algorithm to obtain new information about the two (and higher)
dimensional approximation constant. This research falls into the general
mathematical field of Number Theory. Number theory has its historical roots in
the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with
the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches
of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems. Th e higher dimensional rational approximation techniques
used in this project are of significant interest for intelligence applications.
