NSF actively promotes the inclusion of students and post docs in technical
conferences and in the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the PI
requests that the CCSS and EPMD programs, within the ECCS Division of the
Engineering Directorate at the NSF, sponsor a selected number of students and
post docs to participate in the Gordon Research Conference titled "Lasers in
Micro, Nano &amp; Bio Systems" to be held in Waterville Valley, New Hampshire,
on June 17-22, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first Gordon Research Conference
on "Lasers in Micro, Nano &amp; Bio Systems" will define key strategic
directions for future research in fundamental laser physics, new laser
phenomena, enabling micro/nano engineering technologies, integrated biological
system with laser, and applications, and are expected to broadly impact
interdisciplinary scientific efforts. The NSF support is expected to
significantly promote student and post doc participation in the Meetings and to
provide a unique opportunity for them to learn about emerging fields in
micro/bio photonics research. Participation of graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers, in particular those from underrepresented groups, will be
fostered leveraging NSF funds to partially cover registration fee.
