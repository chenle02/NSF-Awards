This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
olefin/paraffin separations. In the USA, ethylene and propylene are produced in
larger quantities than any other organic chemical. Currently, olefin/paraffin
separation is done by distillation, an extremely energy-intensive process
because of their low relative volatility. Selectivities of polymeric membranes
are inadequate for these separations, but selectivities of facilitated transport
membranes are higher. However, membrane instability, low gas fluxes, and a
required water-saturated feed limit their industrial application. To overcome
these problems a new type of facilitated transport membrane is being developed.
The membrane has high gas fluxes, dramatically improved olefin/paraffin
selectivities over conventional facilitated transport membranes, operates with a
dry feed, and is stable for several weeks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications from this project will be membranes that will significantly lower
cost and energy consumption of industrial olefin/paraffin separations. Other
applications include by product/vent gas streams in polyethylene/polypropylene,
cumene, isopropanol and acrylonitrile plants. Subsequent applications are
propylene recovery from FCCU off-gas and from large processes (propane
dehydrogenation and steam crackers).&lt;br/&gt;
