This conference brings together active U.S. and overseas researchers in an
international forum for discussion and exchange of ideas and data concerning the
current state of research and development of SiC, diamond, SiGe, and other IV-IV
semiconductor materials and devices. The principal objective of this conference
is to foster and promote further research on the fundamental properties of these
materials and their applications, through interactions among the participants
and publications of the conference proceedings. The objective of this proposal
is to request funds to provide stipends or travel awards for authors who are
graduate students or research associates.
