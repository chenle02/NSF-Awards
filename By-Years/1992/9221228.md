This project will develop a strategy to support the use of the Internet by
public libraries in support of national science education and literacy goals.
The workshop will bring together representatives of the library, regional NSFNET
networks, and library network communities to explore the use of the Internet as
a tool by public libraries. Alternative collaborative models will be identified.
Information to guide public libraries will be developed as well recommended
action for all parties concerned. The final report and recommendations will be
widely disseminated to be used by public libraries to plan their individual
strategies for connection to the NSFNET and ultimately take place as major
player in the evolving plan for the National Research and Education Network
(NREN).
