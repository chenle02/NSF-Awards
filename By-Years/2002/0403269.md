PROPOSAL NO: 0403269&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Mich Technological
Univ&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Liu , Jian&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NER:
Semiconductor Quantum Dot-Based Artificial Enzymes Rational Design and
Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work,
funded by NSF/NER program, is to seek new functionalities of water-soluble
semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by mimicking the activities of natural enzyme
within a non-protein environment. Under such scheme, the nano-composite based
photo-catalytic artificial enzymes are designed to mimic the regulation
mechanisms and the selective chemistry of enzymes by imposing light-induced
electronic, energetic, and geometric changes on artificial substrate recognition
sites on QDs. Several key features of enzymes will be mimicked to understand how
can we control the activities of these QD-based, non-protein enzymes in using
light as a source of thermodynamic driving force for benign solar chemical
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
