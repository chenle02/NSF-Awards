This work involves numerical experiments that will characterize the yield
strength of very young oceanic lithosphere by constraining the numerical models
to match existing observations. Data from the Gorda Ridge will be used to
constrain the relative strengths of lithosphere less than 2 Ma old, and 4-7 Ma
old. The models will also test the physical factors controlling ridge-transform
and overlapping spreading center geometry. Finally, the loading imposed by near-
ridge seamounts will be modeled.
