9605024 Dwyer The project touches on several areas in topology. One of its goals
is to express some classical index theorems, especially those involving the
Euler and signature operators, as homotopy theoretic statements, and then to
study the higher-order information provided by this reinterpretation. The
researchers are also investigating geometric questions about surfaces in four-
dimensional manifolds, as well as algebraic issues surrounding the action of
permutation groups on the homology of configuration spaces. Finally, they are
working towards a classification of p-compact groups (i.e. "homotopy Lie
groups") as well as towards a more complete understanding of how topology and
number theory are mixed together by the constructions of algebraic K-theory. The
general theme of the project is the study of some remarkable and exciting
connections between geometry (the science of topological spaces, that is, of
higher-dimensional shapes) and algebra (the science of equations and numbers).
The connections go both ways. For instance, deciding whether or not it is
possible to use the methods of calculus on a particular topological space turns
out to involve solving some fairly subtle equations. On the other hand, the
collection of all solutions to an equation can often be assembled in one way or
another into a topological space. The investigators are looking at some
particular aspects of the interplay between geometry and algebra, and they
expect that taking a dual point of view will lead to major advances in both
areas. ***
