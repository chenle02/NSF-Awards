With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Michael Hendrich from Carnegie-Mellon University will acquire an X-band electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. The award will enhance research
training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) metal
containing proteins, enzymes, and biomimetic complexes, (b) Mossbauer
spectroscopy, EPR and density functional theory calculations of oxygen
activating enzymes and biomimetic complexes, (c) control of metals and spin
state transitions with nucleic acid duplexes and molecular complexes, (d)
probing the electronic structure of quantum-sized metal nanoclusters, (e)
studies of artificial water oxidation catalysts, (f) characterization of
Fe(III)-tetraanionic tetra-amidomacrocyclic-ligands, (g) cobalt complexes as
potential cyanide decorporating agents, (h) molybdenum enzymes and biomimetic
complexes, and (i) study of a rare earth crystalline thermometer for EPR
spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR spectrometer yields detailed
information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid
state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes
of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable
chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth.
These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and
organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds
of biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this
instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the
undergraduate and graduate levels at Carnegie-Mellon University as well as at
the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University and Allegheny College.
