This EAGER proposal, developing a dense deformable object tracking method for
testing and ground-truthing highly dynamic maneuvers of robotic vehicles, offers
to prototype a radically new approach to instrumentation for highly agile
machines of many types. Using heterogeneous fusion of numerous sensing
modalities, the PI proposes to create a high resolution, high bandwidth map of
deformable and articulated bodies such as cars with suspensions, humans, legged
robots, and such for the performance evaluation and algorithm development for
these highly dynamic research artifacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
This work will facilitate a wide variety of research, including studies of agile
robotics in dynamic environments. The impacts to robotic science, especially
agile and fast moving robots, are clear. The system will also have impact on any
other science, such as human motion analysis, ergonomics and medical
rehabilitation, where accurate, dense tracking and mapping of deformable scenes
is required.
