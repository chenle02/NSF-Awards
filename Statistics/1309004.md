The statistical challenges posed by discrete-valued matrix data (such as
contingency tables, co-occurrence tables, adjacency matrices of graphs and
networks, and multivariate binary time series) can often be greatly reduced by
focusing on the conditional distribution of the pattern of entries in the
matrix, given the margins of the matrix. Although this conditioning simplifies
the statistical challenges, it greatly increases the computational challenges of
any associated statistical procedures. This project has two principle aims: (1)
to design practical methods and algorithms for statistical inference about the
conditional distribution of a matrix given its margins, and (2) to specialize
these methods and algorithms to the scientific needs of a variety of
disciplines, including neuroscience, ecology, network analysis, educational
testing, and combinatorial approximation.

With the advent of new technologies for gathering and storing large amounts of
complex data, statistics is playing an increasingly central role in science,
technology, engineering, medicine and commerce. These new data sources require
new types of statistical thinking and improved statistical algorithms. This
project develops new algorithms for the statistical analysis of networks, such
as social networks, ecological networks, and brain networks. Preliminary results
are already being used by neuroscience collaborators to better understand the
structure of human seizures. This project also funds the training of graduate
students who will become the next generation of innovators in science and
engineering.
