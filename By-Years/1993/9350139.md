This is a coordinated team research project to be conducted in ten large
American cities to analyze the circumstances and dynamics by which cities
organize efforts to achieve significant educational reform and further related
human capital development opportunities. The primary goals are to analyze the
origins, progress, and extent of education reform efforts; to map out the
coalitions and political interactions and structures that form the context for
effective or ineffective policymaking; to determine empirically the success of
different types of civic arrangements in initiating and sustaining education
reform; and to provide information about the factors that activate
sociopolitical support for education and related programs. The concept of "civic
capacity" as a dynamic win/win construct for all important civic actors is the
central theoretical notion. The cities to be studied are: Atlanta, Baltimore,
Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington. The research teams will use a common set of instruments and
procedures and analyze the results using a common framework. Fieldwork,
analysis, and initial reporting will take approximately two and a half years.
The project should not only illuminate the process of systemic reform, but
should provide independent information useful in interpreting the progress and
results of NSF's Urban Systemic Initiative.
