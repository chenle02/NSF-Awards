Nearly all animal species have two distinct sexes. However, the genetic
differences between males and females of a given species are generally very
small and sometimes even non-existent. This project will use the nematode C.
elegans, a powerful genetic model system, to test the hypothesis that a set of
conserved genes (the DMRT genes) acts as a bridge between these minimal genetic
sex differences and the changes in developmental and physiological programs that
distinguish males and females. It is expected that these genes provide tailored
information to individual cells during development, instructing cells to undergo
sex-specific processes only at the correct time and in the correct place.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how these genes carry out these functions
will help reveal the ways in which two distinct sexes can be "encoded" in one
genome, a fundamental issue in developmental biology. Moreover, it will provide
fundamental insight into the ways in which developmental programs can be fine-
tuned to bring about changes in structural appearance and physiological
functions. This research will also have important value in training
undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge molecular genetics, and will
make special efforts to involve those from groups traditionally underrepresented
in the biological sciences. The research process and its findings will be shared
with the community through a variety of outreach mechanisms, including novel
uses of social media by student researchers.
