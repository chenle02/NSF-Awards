*** 9709233 DERVAN This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
California Institute of Technology to acquire a quadrupole ion trap mass
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) long -range electron transfer (ET) reactions, (2)
bimolecular and unimolecular reactions of peptides and oligonucleotides, and (3)
application of metal-peptide complexes for the sequence-specific binding and
reaction with double helical DNA. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of
the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic
acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest technique
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry. ***
