An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program
(Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth Sciences, 1991) is understanding and
modeling the geospace environment. As part of its contribution to the U.S.
Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation's Division of
Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research initiative, Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal of supporting basic research into the
dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of
a global geospace model with predictive capability. The subjects of the first
GEM campaign are the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and
the connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.
This grant is to use low-altitude spacecraft data to test and refine the open-
magnetosphere model of Toffoletto and Hill ?1989! with respect to the mapping of
the cusp to low altitude. The model provides quantitative predictions of the
local time extent and locations of the equatorward boundary of the cusp as a
function of the cross-polar-cap potential.
