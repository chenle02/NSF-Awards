This grant provides funding for the development of a high performance
computational method for the fast and accurate pricing of various option
contracts with non-standard payoffs. The proposed research results will be used
to price such option contracts in stochastic volatility and jump models which
relax the restrictive assumptions of the widely used Black-Scholes-Merton model.
A method based on the Hilbert transform will be used to price Bermudan style
vanilla, lookback and barrier options in pure jump Levy process models, certain
Asian equity and interest rate options in square root models, as well as option
contracts in multi-asset models. The method will also be applied to efficiently
invert an analytic characteristic function to obtain the cumulative distribution
function of a random variable, and to simulate pure jump Levy processes and
processes with stochastic volatilities.

Option contracts are widely used by corporations and fund managers to hedge
against financial risks they face due to the fluctuation of interest rates,
currency exchange rates, and equity prices. Many option contracts have
complicated payoffs, depending on the maximum, minimum, or average of the
underlying financial variable, to satisfy specific hedging requirements. Most
option contracts can be exercised before their maturities. The commonly used
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model significantly underestimates risks
that are associated with these derivative products. If successful, the results
of the proposed research will lead to accurate and efficient pricing of many
important classes of option contracts when risks associated with the underlying
financial variables are modeled in more appropriate ways. The research results
will also contribute to various application areas in applied probability,
engineering, and economics.
