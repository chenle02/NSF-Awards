This project develops algorithms for learning from images and video with noisy
labels. The overwhelming amounts of images and video freely available online
present unprecedented challenges for machine learning and computer vision
research communities. They also bring tremendous opportunities and great
potentials for addressing human-machine semantic gaps in image understanding and
for revolutionizing our ways to index, retrieve, and interact with images and
video. Inaccurate labels and mislabeled data are common problems for image and
video datasets. Noisy labels would cause problems with the existing learning
algorithms. This project can have broad impacts on other big data problem. The
project is integrated with education by training students, ensuring broad
participation of underrepresented groups, and outreaching general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research exploring distributed learning
methods for large-scale images and video with noisy labels. The PI investigates
the learning problem of loss functions with both smooth and non-smooth
regularization terms, and accordingly develops new distributed learning
algorithms that are capable of leveraging the abundance of images that are too
large to fit into a single machine. The research has an immense potential in
image and video analysis, and computer vision applications. Specifically, this
research emphasizes both algorithmic and theoretic aspects by (1) developing
distributed learning based approaches for optimization and learning of noisy
labels; and (2) investigating issues such as guaranteed convergence, convergence
rate, and scalability. This work provides new methods that are widely applicable
to many economically, medically and scientifically important large-scale
datasets for novel discoveries across many domains.
