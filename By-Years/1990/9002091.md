This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the
general area of materials chemistry and in the subfield metalorganic chemical
vapor deposition (MOCVD). The goal of this activity is the development of
volatile MOCVD reagents for use in the fabrication of tellurium alloy thin
films. Mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) has important potential applications as a
material for passive infrared detectors. MOCVD of MCT necessitates development
of new tellurium element source reagents with increased volatility and lower
growth temperatures. During the tenure of Phase I research under NSF grant
ISI-8860518, a new class of compounds, trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides, was
synthesized via a novel ligand exchange reaction. These compounds were shown to
have a significantly higher volatility and comparable decomposition temperatures
to the best reagents currently available. In this Phase II study, large scale
syntheses of these compounds will be developed and they will be used as Te
source reagents for the growth of CdTe films. The physical and electrical
properties of the films will be determined. Simultaneously, further work will be
done to elucidate the pyrolysis mechanisms of the
trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides and the mechanism of the ligand exchange
reaction. This information, combined with the film growth studies, should allow
determination of the optimum source reagent and the development of a large
scale, high purity synthesis of that compound.
