This award provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers, and junior faculty to attend the Fifeenth International Conference
on the Science and Applications Of Nanotubes (NT14) to be held at the University
of Southern California in June 2014. This annual international conference is
being held in the US for the first time in a decade and will span a wide range
of topics including chemical separation techniques, materials science, and
thermal and solar energy conversion that are of interest to CMP researchers.
Many of the topics covered in this conference will address the key research
challenges facing the community at large, such as inhomogeneity of carbon
synthesis, toxicity, and utilization of carbon nanotubes in large integrated
circuits. The conference will attract a broad audience, which includes world
leaders in nanotube and carbon physics and condensed-matter physics (including
several Nobel Laureates), emerging academic stars, and young researchers at
graduate and early post-graduate levels.
