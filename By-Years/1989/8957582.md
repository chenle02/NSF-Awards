This award provides funds for a PYI award to an outstanding young scientist
interested in the development of new bioanalytic techniques. His planned
activities include further development of automated DNA and protein sequencing.
Dr. Smith's previous work was central to the development of the first generation
of automated DNA sequencers. The development of new instruments and associated
techniques intended specifically for the chemical and physical analysis of
molecules of biological interest has played a key role in the remarkable success
of modern genetics and biochemistry. Continued progress in these development
efforts, with the aim of further automation and increased sensitivity should
have a significant effect on our understanding of the control of gene
expression, of the adaptation and evolution of living organisms, and of the
biochemistry that is basic to the biotechnology industry.
