The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will host a 3-day
workshop with a broad and diverse group of researchers and practitioners from
various disciplines and from a variety of institutions and companies around the
general theme of climate science, sustainability, and clean energy. This in-
person meeting will be held in the Washington DC area in fall 2022. Participants
will work together to develop recommendations to federal research and
development agencies for support of research and education to advance scientific
knowledge, anticipate future conditions, accelerate clean energy innovations and
sustainable practices, and increase resilience in the face of climate change.
The ultimate deliverable will be a synthesis report representing the major
challenges, themes, and suggestions. The report will include an appendix of
whitepapers that delve deeper into specific challenges, as well as links to
presentations that will be available on a SIAM
webpage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SIAM Convening on Climate Science,
Sustainability, and Clean Energy aims to (i) result in a better understanding of
the challenges and problems affecting research innovation and translation
gleaned from discussions across the various sectors and communities; (ii)
provide input and recommendations for addressing the challenges and
opportunities identified; and (iii) identify mechanisms to encourage the growth
and health of the research workforce. In 2021, SIAM distributed to the NSF and
to other federal agencies the document “Research and Education Priorities to
Address Climate Change, Boost Environmental Resilience, and Advance Clean
Energy” which was prepared by a task force established under the SIAM Committee
on Science Policy. That report represented the applied mathematics and
computational science viewpoint; this convening will build on the previous study
by including other disciplines to expand the perspective and broaden its
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
