Under an International Travel Grant, the Principal Investigator and two
graduate students will participate in the Second International Congress of Fluid
Mechanics, to be held in June 1993 in China. They will also visit and attempt to
initiate collaborative research programs in atomization in three Chinese
institutions. Preliminary contacts with these institutions have already been
established. Atomization processes for the production of uniform fine droplets
is an important process in the production of ceramic materials.
