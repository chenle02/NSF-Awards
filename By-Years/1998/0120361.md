The long range goal of this project is to develop models of how the cellular
environment influences gene expression and metabolic network response. The
approach entails probing and modeling how viruses can redirect metabolic
function in a host. Viruses "encode" a manageable amount of information and thus
a virus-host system may prove to be a tractable system. After performing
quantitative kinetic studies of the growth of duck Hepatitis B (duck) virus,
stochastic and deterministic models will be developed and
contrasted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
