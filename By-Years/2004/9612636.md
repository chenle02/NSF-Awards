9612636 Liu This proposal deals with two important aspects in the emerging
electric power industry environment: power engineering and economics. From a
power engineering point of view, a new challenge is to maintain the reliability
of the power networks given higher levels of uncertainties. Traditionally,
generation units are owned and scheduled by the utilities. However, in the
emerging environment, the available generation depend primarily on the contracts
established by various purchasing-selling parties. Since a high reliability
level has to be maintained for the power systems, new techniques for operation
and decision making will be desirable. Engineering constraints on the power
systems such as available transfer capabilities have to be met as energy
transactions are implemented. The proposed research incorporates power system
engineering constraints into a contract decision making method. ***
