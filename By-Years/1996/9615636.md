This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
UCLA. The student will investigate how unequal access to coastal natural
resources affects the household management of shrimp aquaculture in China. The
hypothesis is that resource-rich households will develop entrepreneurial
management styles and practice intensive production, while resource-poor
households will follow a risk-averse, diversified and diffused style of
management and economic production. Households practicing intensive shrimp
aquaculture differ from those using more sustainable traditional methods in
terms of labor allocation, decision making, financial management and household
culture. Methods include structured interviews, formal studies of decision
making, time allocation studies as well as participant observation. This
research is important because the growth of shrimp aquaculture is part of
economic development in many poorer nations of the world, and has been
associated with harm to the local ecosystem. The advance in our knowledge of how
these economic systems work in micro-level detail of household decision making,
will be helpful to planners trying to maintain the developmental benefits while
ameliorating the ecological costs.
