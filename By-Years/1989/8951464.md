This award provides funds to equip an undergraduate Molecular Biology laboratory
at the University of Southern California with those instruments necessary to
offer an introductory course to students planning careers in biological research
or medicine. The Department of Biological Sciences awards bachelor degrees with
a variety of major options to 120 students per year. Many of these students
would be better prepared for their career goals if they are introduced to
research techniques in molecular biology. A limited number now satisfy this need
by taking directed research in faculty laboratories. This course would allow
them to acquire the basic skills in an instructional laboratory while still
leaving them the option of individual faculty directed research. The Molecular
Biology laboratory course will admit selected honors level juniors and seniors
who have completed courses in introductory molecular biology and introductory
biochemistry with laboratory. The course will provide students with experience
in mutation analysis, plasmid utilization and analysis, RFLP analysis by
Southern blot, polymerase chain reaction applications, DNA synthesis and
sequencing, gene cloning and analysis, bacterial genetics, and phage genetics. A
recently remodeled laboratory in the microbiology instructional area with
adjacent preparative facilities is dedicated to the sole use of this course in
the fall semester and continuation projects in the spring semester. The NSF
funds and university matching funds will together provide for 10 completely
equipped paired student work stations plus the larger community use equipment
which is required. Individual experiments will be directed by the departmental
faculty member most experienced in the specific techniques required. A member of
the instructional laboratory faculty will have the course as a full-time
responsibility and experienced teaching assistants will be present at all time.
