The meeting "Mouse Molecular Genetics" will be held at the Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratories from August 24, to August 28, 1988. A total of 250-300 scientists
at all stages of their careers are expected to attend. The use of mice as
research tools, while alsways important because of the ease of doing genetic
crosses, has exploded during the last five years primarily as a result of the
ability to transfer new genetic information into the germ line. This meeting
will bring together scientists of different ages and with different interests
who, however, use mice as research tools in a atmosphere conducive to optimal
interaction.
