&lt;br/&gt;Dissertation Research: The effects of early social environment
&lt;br/&gt;on the physical, behavioral and social development of prairie voles,
&lt;br/&gt;Microtus ochrogaster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Zuleyma Tang-Martinez
&amp; Danielle N. Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early family environment
can have profound effects on both the physical and behavioral development of
individuals. Being raised by two versus one parent or with or without siblings
can influence growth rate and even adult behavior and personality of some
animals and humans. However, the interaction of early social conditions, defined
as the family unit, and later behavior and personality are not yet well
understood. This study examines the early social conditions during the pre-
weaning period on the personality and behavioral differences in a social rodent,
the prairie vole. Variable early social conditions include the presence or
absence of the father, siblings, and the sex of siblings. Personality is
assessed through behavioral clusters that measure sociability and response to
novelty, examined under controlled laboratory conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
