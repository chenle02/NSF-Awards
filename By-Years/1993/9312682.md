The overall objective of this workshop is to critically examine current needs
for strong motion data to support advances in earthquake hazard mitigation. The
requirements include a complete definition of the earthquake wavefield that may
effect engineering structures as a function of earthquake source conditions and
propagation path: range, depth, geology and topography. Both deterministic and
random characterizations are considered. Specific objectives of the workshop
include: Review past and current activities in earthquake strong motion
recording, processing, archiving, analysis, and application. Identify crucial
strong motion data needs in earthquake engineering and engineering seismology.
Develop a strategic plan to fulfill those needs. Explore and implement a working
group to coordinate, advise and provide supporting details for implementation of
the plan, and to oversee the activities initiated to implement the plan. The
objective will be accomplished in a 1-1/2 day workshop involving geotechnical
and structural engineers and earth scientists.
