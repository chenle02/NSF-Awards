The focus of this research is the use of carbene-isocyanate cycloaddition
methodology for the preparation of heterocycles The hydroindolone products
derived from the cycloadditions are common features of many structurally
elaborate alkaloids. Additional studies involving the reactions of TMSCN with
vinyl isocyanates, radical-based lactam forming reactions and the use of vinyl
isocyanides as umpolung equivalents of vinyl isocyanates will also be carried
out. With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
is supporting the research of Dr. James H. Rigby of the Department of Chemistry
at Wayne State University. Professor Rigby will focus his work on using vinyl
isocyanates as key reactants for the development of synthetic methodology
leading to the preparation of alkaloids and other heterocyclic compounds having
interesting biological properties..
