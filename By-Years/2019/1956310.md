This research project concerns the chaotic properties of smooth dynamical
systems. Smooth dynamical systems may exhibit chaotic behavior, this is where
the future evolution of the systems is strongly independent of its present state
and the evolution behaves like a sequence of independent coin tosses. The
principal investigator plans to study such chaotic behavior for a wide class of
natural dynamical systems. The developed methods will result in progress in the
understanding of fundamental dynamical phenomena, with possible applications to
other mathematical fields such as geometry and number theory, and also to the
natural sciences. The principal investigator also plans to be involved in
synergistic activities including organizing conferences and working with
graduate students and postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaotic properties of
(uniformly) hyperbolic systems are by now well understood. Much less is known
for partially hyperbolic systems, especially those with non-trivial (fast)
growth on the center space. The principal investigator plans to create a general
framework for studying K and Bernoulli properties for partially hyperbolic
systems, and also plans to study mixing and spectral properties of parabolic
systems, trying to further develop a general theory for systems of polynomial
orbit growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
