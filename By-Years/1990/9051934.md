Inter American University - Ponce, responding to increasing concerns for the
environmental quality and health in Puerto Rico, has developed an Environmental
Science program. The final component of this program is equipping the
Environmental Science laboratory, which will be utilized throughout the science
program, be used in many undergraduate science courses, and by students involved
in independent research projects. Other students, working with faculty, will be
allowed to work with local industries in identifying potential waste problems
and suggesting corrective measures. A variety of pieces of equpment will be
used, including an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer to analyze metallic ions,
an Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer to identify organic compounds, and a High
Pressure Liquid Chromatography system to identify organic contaminants. The
university is contributing 140% of the NSF contribution.
