In computational studies of intelligent behavior several phenomena have been
isolated, among the most important of which are learning, reasoning, and
planning. Obstacles that have been found pervasive are that the formalization of
the various phenomena are often inconsistent with each other, and, even more
often, that they are computationally intractable. This main thrust of this
research project is to develop a computational framework and some algorithms
that would comprise a unified approach to this problem area. The proposed
starting point is the idea that the concept of probably approximately correct
(PAC) learning provides a quantitative criterion on the behavioral performance
of a system. These analytic methods used in computational learning theory, are
extended to a wider class of phenomena, including various notions of reasoning
and planning.
