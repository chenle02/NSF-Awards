A consortium of six Washington DC metropolitan community colleges (Prince
George's&lt;br/&gt;Community College, Northern Virginia Community College,
Howard Community College, Montgomery College, Frederick Community College, and
Lord Fairfax Community College) and the Virginia Community College System
Institute for Excellence for Information Technology, joined by three
universities (Johns Hopkins University, G W Solutions - a George Washington
University Enterprise, and University of Maryland College Park), Eleanor
Roosevelt High School, CompTIA, CISCO, and a number of private sector and
government enterprises are collaborating in developing a Strategic Plan for a
NSF-ATE Washington area regional cybersecurity center. The goals of the planning
period fall into four broad areas: 1) to gather information on special regional
needs and existing education and training; 2) to share curriculum and course
information about existing courses and seek information on cybersecurity courses
and curricula at other community colleges; 3) to begin professional development
activities; and 4) to begin the process of creating seamless pathways from high
schools, through the community colleges, to four-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
