The goal of this research is to close these information gaps. The researchers
will adapt their laboratory hardware to measure the fractional yields of
vibrationally excited OH in the range of 150-300 K. This information is needed
to accurately recover temperatures from satellite and ground-based observations
of OH airglow. Knowledge of mesopause temperature is particularly important for
quantifying the heat budget of this atmospheric region, and for monitoring long-
term trends.

At altitudes around 87 km, the exothermic H + O3 reaction produces vibrationally
excited hydroxyl (OHv). This molecule radiates visible and near infrared light
("airglow") from which it is possible infer atmospheric density, temperature,
and species concentrations. The OHv molecule is therefore an extremely valuable
observable in the mesopause. Although the total reaction rate coefficient of H +
O3 is well known, estimates of the vibrational OH product yields vary
considerably. Moreover, the temperature dependence of these yields has never
been determined for conditions relevant to the mesosphere.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
