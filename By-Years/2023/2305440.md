This award will support early career scientists attending the Multiscale Genome
Organization subgroup symposium at the Biophysical Society Annual Meeting.
Support will include sponsoring student trainees to attend and actively
participate in the symposium. The trainees will help organize a career panel
with scientists from diverse careers, with the goal of sharing information on
various career paths and professional development strategies that promote
retention in STEM-related fields.

The MGO subgroup brings together computational and experimental researchers with
a focus on biophysical characterization of mechanisms underlying chromatin
biology. The symposium will advance research and training in chromatin biology
and catalyze cross-disciplinary collaborations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
