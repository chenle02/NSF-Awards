The Organic Dynamics program will support Professor Paul Dowd's study of
"Synthesis of Vitamin K Models" in the Chemistry Department at the University of
Pittsburgh. Vitamin K is required for blood clotting, where it is an essential
cofactor in the complex enzymic sequence known as the blood clotting cascade.
This study will explore a new experimental model for the vitamin K-dependent
carboxylation reaction since in the absence of carboxylation blood clotting is
inhibited. A variety of methods are being used to study the new experimental
model for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction, including inter- and
intramolecular condensation reactions, oxygen labelling experiments, exploration
of new strong bases, and new oxygenation reactions. Model experiments will
determine whether molecular oxygen triggers the carboxylation reaction by
reacting with the anionic form of vitamin K hydroquinone to produce vitamin K
oxide, whose formation provides the energy necessary to furnish a base
sufficiently strong to effect carboxylation.
