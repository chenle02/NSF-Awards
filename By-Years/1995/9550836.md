This project provides new improved laboratory experiments pertaining to analog
electronics courses in a 2-year electrical engineering technology program.
Experiments related to temperature effects, nonlinear systems, advanced devices
and circuits, and noise effects are conducted using the microcomputer-based
workstation and LabVIEW. The project involves developing new test methods or
virtual instruments to characterize the new laboratory experiments. The
workstations can also be utilized for other laboratory experiments related to
circuit and analog electronics courses in electrical engineering technology and
sophomore engineering curricula. In this project, the student's learning
behavior and understanding of the concepts related to proposed experiments are
also studied. A survey of questions is being devised to get the feedback from
students regarding the usage of new laboratory equipment and LabVIEW.
