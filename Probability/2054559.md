The projects supported by this award involve studying mathematical models for
random growth. Some examples include bacterial or tumor spread, and fluid flow
through porous media. The research questions center on geometric aspects of
optimal growth paths, as well as the overall size and speed of growth. The
proposed work has connections to other areas of mathematics and physics, like
the structure of disordered magnets, and satisfaction problems from computer
science. The projects call for work by undergraduate and graduate students, as
well as postdoctoral researchers, and provide research training opportunities
for graduate students.

This project contains questions in probability theory and mathematical physics,
and centers on percolation-type growth models including first-passage
percolation (FPP) and Bernoulli percolation. These are models that were
introduced in the 1950's, but despite decades of effort by researchers, many of
their fundamental properties remain elusive. The proposed projects include
determination of fractal properties and scaling limits of box-crossing paths in
Bernoulli percolation, the effect of random noise on passage-time asymptotics in
critical FPP, and the geometry and topological structure of the growing set in
sub-critical (usual) FPP. It is expected that results obtained in these studies
will affect work on epidemic models, disordered spin systems, and polymer
models.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
