Reklaitis This award will support the renovation of the Advanced Materials
Laboratory in Chemical Engineering at Purdue University. In 1987, Purdue
identified research in the molecular and engineering properties of materials as
a strategic area for their contributions to science. Following their strategic
plan, they have put in motion a process to strengthen the analytical processes
involved in materials science as well as improve and provide for sophisticated
training of a diversity of students in this research area. Purdue has already
acquired some of the latest and most sophisticated analytical instrumentation
for materials analysis but is now renovating the out-dated labs in which this
instrumentation is housed. This renovation will modernize about 2600 square feet
of lab space designed: 1) to support graduate and undergraduate thesis research;
and 2)to improve an innovative program for training students in the design and
execution of experimental research. This renovation project will directly impact
8 faculty, 44 graduate students, 4 postdoctoral fellows and a large number of
undergraduate students while increasing this institutions capability to do
research and train students in materials science.
