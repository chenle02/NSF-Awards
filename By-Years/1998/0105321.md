0105321 Theis This grant provides support for a conference entitled "Summer 2001
Symposium on Sustainability" to be convened by the Center for Environmental
Management at Clarkson University in June 2001. The symposium will bring
together educators, students, researchers and practitioners with a common
agenda, but different backgrounds in natural and industrial ecology, engineering
and science, economics, management and social sciences, and environmental policy
to investigate the basis of sustainability, factors asociated with its
applicability and the possibility of progressing towards an agreement of
research and education principles and methodologies that transcend traditional
disciplinary boundaries. This symposium will emphasize the integration of
research and educational approaches to sustainability and, therefore, graduate
student participation is central to its objectives. The symposium will be
organized around four overlapping research areas: Industrial Ecology, Ecological
Economics, Ecosystem Health and Environmental Policy with the overarching goal
to foster further collaboration among individual researchers and educators in
these areas. &lt;br/&gt;A major output of the symposium will be the publication
of principal findings in the peer-reviewed academic journals affilitated with
the above four areas: Ecological Economics, Journal of Industrial Ecology,
Ecosystem Health, and Environmental Engineering and Policy. Additionally, the
Center will dedicate a special section of its web pages to the conference and
proceedings. ***&lt;br/&gt;
