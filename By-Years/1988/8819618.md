This project will document and analyze the social, economic and ritual
variation in communities on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The researchers
will photograph, describe, map and prepare an integrated database for a large
body of previously unanalyzed material in the A. B. Lewis collection at the
Field Museum of Natural History. Much of the collection comprises objects made
in one community but collected in another, and the researchers will create a
regional analysis of material culture for this region of the world at the time
of collection, in the early 20th century, which they will test with a field
survey of current material culture in this area. This project is important
because the relation of local communities to a regional culture is a fundamental
problem in understanding society and culture. A project which can increase our
understanding of this issue, especially with the time depth of this research,
will help us understand how these local communities will interact in the future.
