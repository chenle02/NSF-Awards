This SBIR Phase I project from Learnimation (TM) will produce a browser-based
assessment and feedback engine prototype that evaluates mathematical problem
solving skills for students with learning disabilities. This assessment engine
prototype will provide adaptive instruction in a learning environment designed
to meet individual students' needs. It will also provide adaptive guidance to a
student's teacher and caregiver. The importance of high level mathematical
problem solving and reasoning and the assessment of these skills is emphasized
for all students by the national standards-governing bodies in the United States
(NCTM, AAAS, NRC), yet as many as 6% of all school age children have severe math
deficits with very few tools at their disposal to help them gain fluency and
measure accountability in an increasingly information-based society. This
investigation will provide an alternative assessment platform for mathematics
skill development designed specifically for learning disabilities and will
ensure that all students with disabilities are included in the present national
educational assessment reforms.
