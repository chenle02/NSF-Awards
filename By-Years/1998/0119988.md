This award provides support for one year of funding to construct and operate a
biospectrologger (BSL) in a borehole in polar ice. Such an optical device has
already been developed and tested for measuring dust in polar ice. The same
general principle can be exploited to study microbes and biomolocules as a
function of depth in glacial ice. Microbes adapted to oligotrophic, low-
temperature environments are found in glacial ice, frigid lakes, in permafrost
and in cold, deep ocean water and sediments. Polar ice contains the lowest
concentrations, from a few hundred to about 104 cells/cm3, probably transported
by wind into the atmosphere, precipitated with snow, and compacted into ice. The
great majority are dormant or dead. With varying success, cultivation of
microbes recovered from ice cores yields colony-forming units in a fraction
(~10-4 to ~10-2 ) of dormant cells. Chemical, physical and biological arguments
indicate that as many as 103 microbes/cm3 can extract enough energy from acids
confined in narrow liquid veins in otherwise solid ice to survive for a few
thousand years (or a smaller population for a correspondingly longer time). No
search has yet been carried out for living bacteria in liquid veins. The
biospectrologger will be field tested at Siple Dome, Antarctica during the
2001/02 field season as part of an existing borehole logging program there.
