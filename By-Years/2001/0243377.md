The research of this project focuses on developing models that address the
interface between product variety/architecture and production/supply chain
management. With a series of interrelated optimization models that draw on the
literatures of product design, operations management, marketing and economics,
we seek to: (a) quantitatively evaluate the effect of production and supply
chain capabilities on product variety decisions, (b) develop principles for
matching product platform architectures to various production and market
environments, and (c) construct methods for dynamically evolving a
production/supply chain system to support a product family in a web-enabled,
collaborative customization design environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of
the research will focus on using discrete choice theory to represent consumer
preferences and modern supply chain theory to characterize support costs.
Research will focus on discrete choice theory instead of the more traditional
approach of using a location model to represent customer decisions because it is
more compatible with conjoint analysis techniques from marketing, and hence is
more likely to yield results relevant to practice. The models will first address
product families containing horizontally differentiated variants and will then
move to more complex product architectures involving modules and vertically
differentiated variants. Similarly, the models will begin by optimizing the
product variety decision from the perspective of a single firm, but will
ultimately consider environments in which variety decisions are an important
part of competitive market strategy.
