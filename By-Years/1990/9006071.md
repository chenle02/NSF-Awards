In warmer habitats, plants possessing the C4 photosynthetic pathway have higher
photosynthetic rates, greater potential productivity and greater competitive
potential than the more common C3 species. The vast majority of C4 plants,
including the economically important species such as corn and sugar cane, are
limited to habitats which are worm and sunny. Since 1982, however, several
species of the C4 grass Muhlenbergia have been discovered in forest understory
habitats at light levels significantly lower than normal for C4 plants. This
project investigates the photosynthetic responses of Muhlenbergia sobolifera,
the most shade-tolerant C4 species known, to determine if it uses both
photosynthetic pathways, either concurrently or in response to environmental
cues. Because M. sobolifera is thought to have evolved regressively from the
more common high-light, fully-functional C4 plants, an understanding of its
metabolic pathway will provide scientists valuable insight into the
environmental pressures which lead to the evolution of photosynthetic pathways.
In addition, this knowledge may lead to breeding approaches for producing plants
with the desirable characteristic of both photosynthetic types.
