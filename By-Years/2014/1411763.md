This award funds work to obtain and analyze X-ray, optical, infrared, millimeter
and radio wavelength observations to study the explosion properties of short-
lived Gamma Ray Burst emission (GRBs). GRBs are mysterious, transient highly
energetic phenomena (significantly brighter than supernova explosions) that may
be caused by the merger of binaries composed of neutron stars and/or a black
hole. The investigators also plan to use the GRBs from very distant sources as
'flashlights' to illuminate foreground galaxies and intergalactic medium. The
measurements will be used to measure the chemical enrichment of galaxies, and to
constrain models of the Epoch of Re-ionization (EoR), which plays a dominant
role in cosmological models. The EoR occurred when the universe was only a few
hundred million years old, and marks the transition from when the universe's
gaseous component changed from mostly neutral to mostly ionized. The researchers
will integrate astronomy research into undergraduate courses, train and mentor
students and post-doctoral fellows, and conduct public outreach.

This work will be accomplished by focusing on three main goals using a variety
of telescopes, including the JVLA, CARMA, ALMA, Magellan, Chandra and Gemini.
The investigators will: 1) determine the composition of the GRB ejecta (baryonic
vs. magnetic) in the first few hours to days after a burst is detected; 2)
measure the jet opening angles of short GRBs to determine the energy scale and
rate, search for r-process powered counterparts to test models that predict that
GRBs are generated from compact object binaries; and 3) use GRB emission to
measure galaxy metallicities and reionization at redshifts that are inaccessible
to direct observations, and to study the mass-metallicity relation at z = 2 - 5.
