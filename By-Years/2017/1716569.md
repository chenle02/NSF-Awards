Astronomers seek to understand how stars and galaxies formed. Galaxies have come
to exist in relation to the diffuse gas that surrounds them. Understanding this
relationship is essential for understanding how galaxies, including our own
galaxy (the Milky Way), evolved into their present forms. Ribaudo and colleagues
will combine observations of nearby galaxies and their surrounding gas made with
the Arecibo Observatory with other ground-based observations as well Hubble
Space Telescope archival data. These combined observations probe the
constituents of the gas surrounding galaxies and its physical distribution. Such
information reveals the inter-relationship between this gas and the galaxies
within. This project will provide educational research opportunities for three
undergraduate students at Utica College and laboratory activities for
undergraduate education. This project will also include outreach to the Utica
Children?s Museum, where the PI has previously been involved. Such outreach
activities may include creating ?dirty snowballs? to illustrate comet formation
and hands-on spectroscopy and observing programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ribaudo
and collaborators will use results of the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA)
Survey to generate a sample of galaxies for study. Their physical properties are
determined in conjunction with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
The CircumGalactic Medium (CGM) is investigated using absorption spectroscopy of
background quasars from archival Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph data. They will characterize the CGM using absorption line
diagnostics including Lyman-alpha, CII, SiII, SiIII, NV and OVI. They will
investigate covering fractions, equivalent widths of spectral lines and
metallicities. These researchers will characterize the properties of the CGM of
galaxies in the nearby universe and compare them to previous studies at z &gt;
0.1 and smaller studies of more nearby galaxies. Results of this work will be
presented by undergraduates at regional (New York area) and national (AAS)
astronomy conferences in addition to being published in refereed journals.
