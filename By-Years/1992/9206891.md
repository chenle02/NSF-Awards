The development of multicellular organisms is a complex process whereby
programmed changes in gene expression give rise to specific changes in cellular
physiology, morphology and behavior. Our long term goals are to understand the
control of gene expression and its relationship to morphogenesis in the cellular
slime mold Dictyostelium discoidium. These studies have addressed the genetic
regulation and function of the discoidin lectins and have isolated and
characterized regulatory gene mutants affecting transcription, demonstrated
translational control, examined cAMP and folate mediated down-regulation, and
shown that discoidin is required for normal cell morphology and cytoskeletal
organization during aggregation. The investigators now wish to a) determine the
signal transduction pathways responsible for down-regulation, b) examine the
mechanisms of translational control in drsA strains, c) establish the
relationship of discoidin to the cytoskeleton and d) characterize the dynamic
behavior of discoidinless mutants during aggregation. They use a combination of
molecular genetic, biochemical and cell biological techniques to accomplish
these goals.
