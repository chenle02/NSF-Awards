The Cincinnati Symposium on Probability Theory and Applications 2018 will be
held November 9 to 11, 2018 at the University of Cincinnati. The symposium will
bring together junior and senior researchers working at the forefront of random
matrix theory and stochastic processes. Results from these fields are
increasingly used throughout the sciences and other areas of mathematics with
direct applications including finance, insurance, statistics, number theory, and
combinatorics. By connecting a broad array of researchers at different career
stages with expertise in a variety of innovative techniques, the symposium will
help foster the development of the mathematical theory of these fields.
Professional development of the next generation of probabilists is a major focus
of the symposium by providing early-stage researchers opportunities to present
their work in talks and a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently
developed techniques in random matrix theory and stochastic processes have led
to many significant advances. As the scope of these fields expands, further
progress is increasingly dependent on the combination of ideas from multiple
areas. In order to break down barriers between researchers working with
different tools and to foster new collaborations at the frontiers of these
fields, the symposium will bring together experts working in several related
areas. Topics from random matrix theory will include universal probability
distributions, martingale techniques, and integrable probability, while those
from stochastic processes will include Brownian excursions and combinatorial
stochastic processes, stochastic partial differential equations, and infinitely-
divisible processes. By connecting junior and senior probabilists using
different methods, the symposium will help build bridges between areas and
stimulate new cross-disciplinary investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symposium
