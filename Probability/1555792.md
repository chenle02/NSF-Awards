This award supports participation in a conference entitled "Geometric and
Probabilistic Methods in Group Theory and Dynamical Systems," held from November
9 to November 12, 2015, in College Station, TX, on the campus of Texas A&M
University. Geometric, topological, and probabilistic methods are often used in
the study of groups and dynamical systems. The conference will provide an
opportunity to all participants to keep abreast of recent developments
simultaneously in all five of these components (geometry, topology, probability,
group theory, dynamics), with special emphasis on their interplay. There will be
close to 100 participants, who will present 16 invited talks and 45 contributed
talks. At least half of the contributed talks will be presented by researchers
in early stages of their careers and graduate students. The mixture of
participants, ranging from some of the world's most established researchers to
postdocs and graduate students, will provide a sense of community and
continuity. The conference, blending research and education, will stimulate
healthy communication flow and collaboration between researchers in different
areas and in different generations for years to come.

The wealth of ideas and applications related to the use of geometric and/or
probabilistic approaches in group theory and dynamical systems is immense, and
it practically touches all other areas in mathematics. Many important open
problems in group theory and dynamical systems are essentially related to
asymptotic, geometric, analytic or probabilistic concepts. The conference will
showcase the recent advances and achievements related to such problems and it
will provide strong momentum and set directions for further research in such
diverse areas as amenability, virtual Haken conjecture, CAT(0) cube complexes,
random groups and random subgroups, Borel equivalence relations and cost, sofic
groups, interval exchange groups, iterated monodromy groups, and many others.
