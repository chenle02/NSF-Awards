Enabling faster and more energy-efficient numerical simulations is critical, for
example, in basic science for enabling novel scientific discoveries, or in
engineering for developing revolutionary new products. In the last decades,
technology trends in computer systems have resulted in widely differing rates of
improvement in computational throughput as compared to data movement
performance. With future systems, the cost of data movement through the memory
hierarchy is expected to become even more dominant relative to the cost of
performing arithmetic operations, both in terms of time and energy.
Consequently, the data movement and communication costs of a numerical
simulation become determinant factors for the time to solution and the energy
consumption. This research is developing novel generic techniques for tightening
bounds on the data movement complexity of numerical simulations. The outcomes of
this research are methods to derive the communication needs of numerical
simulations. The ability to assess the optimality of an algorithm enables
understanding of the implications of various computing platform's parameters on
the performance of a numerical simulation. The PIs are developing novel generic
techniques for tightening bounds on the data movement complexity of a given
algorithm on a given architecture. This work engages in novel interdisciplinary
perspectives and brings together applied mathematics, theoretical computer
science, data analytics and high performance computing.
