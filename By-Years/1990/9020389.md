A workshop will be held to bring together leading mathematicians and experts in
the development of symbolic software. The goal of the workshop will be to
identify areas of mathematical research which would benefit from improvements in
symbolic software, to discuss the form that new software should take, and to
explore the possibility of setting up a multi-national development project to
produce symbolic software needed for mathematical research. The workshop will
focus primarily, but not exclusively, on research in such fields of algebra as
number theory, group theory, algebraic geometry, and commutative algebra. The
workshop is in part a response to recommendations in a recent report to the NSF
urging increased activity in the field of symbolic computation.
