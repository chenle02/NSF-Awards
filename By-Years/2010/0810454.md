This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I develops a new acoustic particle
focusing technology in a low-cost flow cytometry analyzer/imager that is capable
of both high particle analysis rates (1000's particles/s) and capturing images
from user selected subpopulations of cells. This new technology will give
researchers the ability to rapidly search through large populations of cells
while imaging only those of interest. This project will examine and resolve the
technological hurdles and demonstrate the technology in a proof-of-principle
device.

The broader impacts of this research are in the areas drug discovery, medicine,
homeland security, and general biomedical research. Acoustic focusing, with
triggered imaging, combines the traditional high throughput and statistical
power of flow cytometry with the high information content of imaging. This
combination will reduce cost and increase information in drug discovery assays,
allow high content/rare target analysis in cancer diagnostics and open doors to
new high throughput/high content assays in cell biology. It will also bring this
combination of analysis to dilute samples which will lead to new applications in
urinalysis, environmental monitoring, and industrial contamination. Acoustic
cytometry combines adjustable flow velocities with tight single particle/cell
focusing. If this technology can be implemented at a lower-cost than
conventional solutions, it will have broad impact on world health and research
by making cell analysis more accessible to researchers and clinicians worldwide.
