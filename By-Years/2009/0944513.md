&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks funding to begin a research effort on
characterizing and extracting galactic dust emissions from the data that will be
collected by the NASA-funded Antarctic Long Duration Balloon-borne (LDB) ?E and
B Experiment? (EBEX). A leading cosmological paradigm for the beginning and
evolution of the Universe posits a period of Inflation shortly after the Big
Bang. Inflation generated primordial gravitational waves in the Universe that
imprinted a distinct signature called the "B-mode signal" on the polarization of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. This signal is extremely weak,
around 100 microKelvins or smaller, and astrophysical foregrounds such as
polarized emission from galactic dust and synchrotron radiation swamp the
Inflationary signal over most of the sky. The EBEX balloon payload will have the
sensitivity to detect the B-mode signal if it is stronger than 1/10 of the
current theoretical upper limit. The balloon observations will be carried out in
frequency bands between 150 and 410 GHz. The higher end of this band is not
accessible from the ground; thus, EBEX can provide valuable information on the
properties of galactic dust emissions. This information is critical for all the
CMB experiments searching for the Inflationary signal. EBEX is currently
awaiting its flight from Antarctica in the austral summer of 2010/2011. The
requested funds will be used to support a post-doctoral fellow and a graduate
student to work on the characterization and extraction of galactic dust
foregrounds from the EBEX data. &lt;br/&gt;
