Crystallographic studies have long made use of spectroscopic techniques such as
electron microprobe, x-ray fluorescence, Mossbauer, and Fourier transform
infrared spectro- scopy, but these methods have rarely been applied together in
a complementary fashion to petrologic problems. Proposed work seeks to further
develop and utilize the capabilities of these methods to study biotites within a
petrologic framework. Major and minor elements, Fe 3+, Fe 2+, OH, and octahedral
ordering will be examined in two suites of biotites and coexisting minerals from
western Maine and northern Idaho. Spectroscopic data will be used to study the
cation site occupancies and resultant crystal structures of biotites, as well as
the influence of mineral assemblage on biotite composition. Results will be used
to evaluate the effects of Fe 3+ and octahedral ordering in minerals on activity
models and geothermometers. Most importantly, a new unified substitution model
will be sought in order to explain the compositional variation of biotite as a
function of metamorphic reactions and mineral assemblage.
