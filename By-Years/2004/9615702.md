Abstract EEC-9615702 Christian This award provides funding for continuing
support for the University of Washington's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) for the next two years
(two-year phase out). After 12 years of operation, CPAC is a viable organization
serving the needs of its industrial and governmental sponsors by continuing to
discover and demonstrate new analytical methodologies for use as an integral
part of automated chemical process monitoring and control. The focus has been on
relevant technical areas including: sensors, real-time measurement systems,
adaptive multivariate calibration, and instrument standardization. The main
thrusts have been to create the analytical tools that not only provide direct
chemical information, but also are integrated with sophisticated sampling, data
processing, and intelligence capabilities. These tools allow for real-time
optimization and control to meet applicable requirements in product
registration, regulatory requirements, productivity goals, quality management,
and worker safety.
