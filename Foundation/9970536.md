9970536 Mitchell The main topics of Mitchell's investigation concern the core
model, particularly its structure and existence in the vicinity of a Woodin
cardinal. The structure of the core model is known far above a Woodin cardinal,
but its existence depends on the existence of a measurable cardinal lying above
the desired model. Thus there is no core model in the important case when a
Woodin cardinal exists, but nothing larger. Preliminary results suggest,
however, that some of the core model structure remains. Mitchell will attempt to
understand this structure better. He will also study related topics involving
closed, unbounded sets and the existence and structure of the core model for
larger cardinals. Larson will study Ramsey properties of countable ordinals and
of larger ordinals that are not small finite powers of cardinals. Set theory is
usually considered the foundation of all mathematics, so studies of this kind
are in a sense exploring the limits of mathematical possibility. The core model
forms, as its name implies, the rigid foundation of the universe of sets and is
the major tool for studying and validating axioms that extend the power of set
theory and hence of mathematics. The ordinals form the skeleton of the universe
of sets, and understanding their combinatorial properties are vital to
understanding the universe of sets. ***
