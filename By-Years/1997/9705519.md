9705519 Spitzer The New England Aquarium (NEAq) will develop "Sounds of the
Sea", a 2000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will provide visitors an opportunity
to learn about the importance of sound in the ocean and acoustic oceanography as
a tool for research, for such issues as global change. Both natural and
anthropogenic sounds will be examined. The goals of the exhibit are to
demonstrate the richness of sounds in the ocean, to educate visitors about the
physics of sound in the air and under water, and to present current scientific
research on the physics and biology of underwater sounds. One of the special
features will be real ocean sounds in real time. Visitors will be able to hear
sounds picked up by hydrophones in the inner and outer Boston Harbor and view
spectral data. The exhibit will reach a broad audience including those with
visual and aural impairments. NEAq will collaborate with MIT's Department of
Ocean Engineering, the MIT Sea Grant College Program, Wood Hole Oceanographic
Institution, and the WGBH Educational Foundation's National Center for Media
Accessibility in the development of the exhibit. Supplementary materials for
visitors to the exhibit will include an exhibit guide and a web site.
Complementary programming for use by formal educators will include pre and post
visit materials and special programming for school groups.
