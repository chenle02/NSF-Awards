Nitrogen fixation, the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonium by the
enzyme nitrogenase, is repressed by fixed nitrogen and, because all nitrogenases
are oxygen labile, by oxygen. Cyanobacteria of the genus Anabaena have
specialized cells called heterocysts whose function is nitrogen fixation.
Anabaena variabilis has three different nitrogenases; a V-dependent nitrogenase
(vnf) and two Mo-dependent nitrogenases, one that functions under aerobic
conditions (nif1) and one that functions only under strictly anaerobic
conditions (nif2). The nitrogenase genes are tightly regulated; however, very
little is known about their regulation. An understanding of nitrogenase gene
regulation in A. variabilis will broaden our understanding of mechanisms of
prokaryotic gene regulation. The nitrogenase genes in A. variabilis are
regulated at many levels including nitrogen deprivation, oxygen tension, metal
availability, and heterocyst development. The goal of the proposed research is
to identify the regulatory circuits that control the nitrogenase genes that
function under aerobic conditions in heterocysts of A. variabilis. The aims are
to characterize the regions of the nitrogenase genes that are essential for
regulated expression in heterocysts and to identify the proteins responsible for
regulation. The broader impact of this project includes the integration of
research with both undergraduate and graduate education, including the
development of an undergraduate research course that will allow each student in
the course to make a substantial contribution to this research project.
