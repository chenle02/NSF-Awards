This exploratory study is designed to determine attributes of large urban
school districts which would maximize the probability of success for
implementing and sustaining major educational reforms. The study will include
personal interviews with key change agents in a number of such school districts
where changes have been attempted and will identify attributes which lead to
failure as well as those which lead to success. The project will culminate with
a draft document of an "Urban School District Systemic Reform Initiative in
Science and Mathematics" which incorporates findings, in NSF solicitation
format.
