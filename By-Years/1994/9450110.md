This research involves a model of candidate evaluation. The important
considerations, individual difference and contextual variables, and cognitive
processes of the model are specified. The basic components of the model are
"institution free"; i.e., the model is a general one that transcends any
particular electoral context. A strategy will be developed for applying the
model to the presidential primary context using data from the American National
Election Studies of 1980, 1984, and 1988, and Thomas Patterson's panel study of
the 1976 election. These data are available through the ICPSR. The new
application of the model will cover multi-candidate contexts, and thus will
considerably advance our understanding of vote choice processes across different
electoral arenas. Interactive activities include: teaching a graduate course on
political applications of social and cognitive psychology; serving as guest
director of an interdisciplinary colloquium on political psychology; engaging in
collaborative research with several members of the department; and presenting
these results in a regular departmental lecture series.
