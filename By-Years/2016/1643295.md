This project is a renewal of the Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node to continue
creating a robust and broad-based entrepreneurship infrastructure built on the
scientific, technology, and engineering strengths as well as the business
thought leadership of three globally recognized universities, the University of
California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF), and Stanford University. This I-Corps Node will continue building on its
success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through
classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These
startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-
based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also
will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and
engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing
mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the
subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad
principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the
nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways
of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent
with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps
Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will
achieve the most favorable outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partner schools
have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development
of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the
Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For
Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for
government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies
,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training
products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through
their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All
activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of
groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities.
