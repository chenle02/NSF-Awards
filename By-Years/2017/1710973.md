This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the
Cornell University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael Scanlon.

One approach to promote food security in a fluctuating climate is to identify
and develop climate-resilient crops. Maize is an indispensable food source and
industrial feedstock for much of the world. Maize is susceptible to stress, such
as heat, drought and flooding. Ethylene is a key regulator of plant growth,
development and stress response; however, neither the genetic control of
ethylene growth response nor its natural variation are understood in maize.
Knowledge of the genetic architecture of ethylene response will enable future
engineering efforts on ethylene-mediated stress tolerance in the cereals.
Broader impacts include the formation of interactive programs to increase public
genetic and genomic literacy. The Fellow will teach core concepts in genetics
and genomics to participants outside of STEM fields. Participants, in turn, will
interpret this into public art that communicates genetic principles. Training
objectives for the Fellow include gaining proficiency in plant genomics,
association mapping and bioinformatics.

This research will evaluate the genomic architecture of ethylene growth response
in maize. The ethylene response is an important target for crop adaptation to
climate. The Fellow will conduct genome wide association studies to investigate
the allelic architecture of maize ethylene response, and will identify
transcriptomic networks and chromatin signatures associated with ethylene
treatment. The proposed research has significant potential to discover key
alleles and genomic regions in maize that underlie stress tolerance associated
with ethylene. This work will provide a foundation for future investigations on
the underlying mechanisms of ethylene response in maize and in other
economically vital cereals. Research outcomes will be shared with the public and
research community through conferences, in publications and by submissions to
data repositories: phenotypic data to Panzea (http://www.panzea.org), raw
sequence data to NCBI-SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), and gene expression
data to NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), Maize Genetics and Genomics
Database (http://www.maizegdb.org), and qTeller (http://qteller.com).
