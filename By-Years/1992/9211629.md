Graphical models can be defined as statistical models structured in terms of
conditional independencies. These models are particularly successful in
representing expert systems. This research will develop Bayesian methodology
including elicitation of informative prior distributions, model updating and
expression of model uncertainty for expert systems and some generalized
applications. Expert systems, which are computer programs which mimic human
experts, have found both commercial and scientific research application over the
last decade. Their actual use in some areas has been limited because of the high
level of uncertainty problem solvers must deal with in problematic areas. A
rigorous probabilistic basis for expressing uncertainty can be incor- porated
into these systems which will allow automated modifica- tion of the system in
response to new information.
