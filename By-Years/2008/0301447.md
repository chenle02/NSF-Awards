The MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (MPS-DRF)
enables U.S. scientists to conduct research abroad. This allows the awardees the
opportunity for collaborative research benefiting from expertise, facilities and
interactions in a non-U.S. institution.

This award will support a 24-month research fellowship for Dr. Megan M. Spence
to work with Prof. Dr. Beat H. Meier and his group at the Laboratorium fur
Physikalische Chemie, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich (Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology Zurich).

The proposed study will investigate the structure of membrane associated
proteins using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).
Switched-angle spinning, a solid-state NMR technique, will be employed to
determine the structure of a prototype bicelle-associated polypeptide as a proof
of principle experiment. Prof. Dr. Beat Meyer is a leading authority in the
field of solid-state NMR. His laboratory has developed procedures to use
bicelles under spinning techniques. This will assist Dr. Spencer to effectively
carry out the proposed work.
