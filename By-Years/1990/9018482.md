The principal investigators will study the Lilloise Intrusion of East Greenland.
In particular, they hope to discover the nature of the mantle-derived magmas
from which this deposit formed, and to relate this to present-day igneous events
in Iceland. This study also will have important geological implications relative
to crust/mantle interactions during the initial stages of rifting of the North
Atlantic.
