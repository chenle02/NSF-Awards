9224168 Clark This award is to start a new Materials Research Group at the
University of Colorado at Boulder on the topic of ferroelectric liquid crystals.
The research is organized in three main activities: synthesis of new materials,
fundamental physics of ferroelectric liquid crystals, and modeling of the
molecular structure and physical properties. The synthesis activity includes
making of new monomer, polymer, and gel ferroelectric liquid crystals to explore
the molecular origins of particular property characteristics, to test
predictions from the modeling, and to develop new electro-optic and nonlinear
optical materials. The physics activity emphasizes evaluation of the relevant
physical properties of the materials, structure of the phases, and dynamics of
the phase transformations. Included in this activity are x-ray scattering,
optical microscopy, time-dependent optical and vibrational spectroscopy,
molecular conformational dynamics, dielectric relaxation, scanning tunneling
microscopy, and optical reflectivity. The modeling activity includes molecular
dynamic simulations of molecular arrangements and conformation, and calculation
of measurable macroscopic properties. Ferroelectric liquid crystals offer
exceptional capabilities in electro-optic applications, such as electrically
operated light valves having microsecond response times, high contrast intrinsic
memory, low power consumption displays, and nonlinear optical materials. The
materials research group offers excellent educational opportunities for multi-
disciplinary training of advanced students for research and teaching.
