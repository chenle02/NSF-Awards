This work is aimed at the important area of large.scale system planning or
decision.making under uncertainty. It is anticipated that, as result of this
work, a comprehensive problem statement (or series of problem statements) will
be produced that will be a guideline for re.orienting future research. This
reorientation is expected to have a significant impact in attracting a new cadre
of researchers to the problem who, through fresh insight, could provide a broad
and useful perspective on the types of decision.making tools that would be
useful in an environment where uncertainty is accounted for.
