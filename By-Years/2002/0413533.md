The 3rd Duke Mathematical Journal Conference will be held at
Duke&lt;br/&gt;University Friday, April 23 through Sunday, April 25, 2004. The
goal of&lt;br/&gt;the conference is to bring young mathematicians together for a
weekend of&lt;br/&gt;high quality mathematics. There will be talks by eight
leading young&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians on diverse subject areas which are
regularly represented in&lt;br/&gt;the journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to
the Conference, speakers will distribute introductory material&lt;br/&gt;related
to their talks via the conference web site. All talks will
be&lt;br/&gt;videotaped and made available on the Web, along with the speakers'
notes.&lt;br/&gt;This will benefit the participants as well as the broader
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;community. The conference will also benefit the
mathematical community in&lt;br/&gt;the south-eastern US by providing a high-
quality mathematical experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
