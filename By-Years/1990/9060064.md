Many manufacturing processes involve as an intermediate step the spot cleaning
of small areas of a part which will be subjected to subsequent assembly, coating
or adhesive bonding. Pulsed lasers can give the desired degree of cleanliness
but a portion of the technology for the controlled delivery of the laser energy
to the workpiece has not yet been developed. All experiments will be conducted
in the facilities of Laser Technology, Inc. utilizing existing large scale
prototype pulsed lasers. The Phase I experimental work will not only identify
and specify those materials (lenses, mirrors and windows) which would be
required for construction of an industrial prototype cleaning station but also
more specifically address the unknowns involved in gas flow requirements in the
neighborhood of the final lenses and the workpiece.
