The Political Science Department of The Ohio State University in conjunction
with the American Political Science Association is conducting a three-week
summer (1992) workshop on the teaching and research applications of statistical
data analysis. The general objective is to enhance the instruction of
undergraduates in the research practices of political scientists with access to
a large variety of individual and aggregate, citizen and leader data on
political and related phenomena. This includes data on a number of democratic
nations, international relations, elections of members of state legislators,
voting in the U.S. Congress, presidential elections, and the U.S. Supreme Court.
The American Political Science Association is assisting this project by assuring
access to the workshop, evaluating its effectiveness and impact, and
disseminating its instructional strategies and materials to all political
science faculty.
