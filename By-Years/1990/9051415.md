The psychology department computer lab is designed to provide modern instruction
through the use of personal computers. Students in a large number of
undergraduate courses, including introductory and advanced courses, are learning
to use computers as a teaching/learning tool and are also acquiring relevant
computer skills to help prepare them for careers or graduate study in
psychology. The department, which serves large numbers of minority and women
students, is purchasing twelve Zenith PCs with color monitors, two laptops, a
number of printers, modems for mainframe connection of three omputers to permit
their use as terminals, and on hard disk drive file server to network the
system. This system is also available for use by independent study and honors
project students. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
