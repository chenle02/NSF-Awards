PI: Wilfred F. Denetclaw, Ph.D. Proposal Number: IOS-0821324 Title: "Ectoderm
Nitric Oxide Somite Signaling."

In vertebrate embryos, the first skeletal muscles are called myotome fibers and
develop in ball-like clusters of cells called somites. Recent evidence from this
laboratory suggests that nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent, ubiquitous,
messenger molecule, plays an important "signaling" role in mediating the
formation of myotome fibers in somites. Nitric oxide was found to be elevated
and dynamically changing in the dorsal somite and in an adjacent tissue called
the ectoderm layer. Furthermore, experimental treatments that stopped NO
increases in the ectoderm layer resulted in a block of myotome formation.
Therefore, the central problem in this proposal is to determine the role of NO
signaling between ectoderm and dorsal somite for myotome formation. To
investigate NO signaling, live tissue from early chicken embryos will be tagged
with fluorescent molecules to monitor NO concentration changes and concurrent
myotome formation will be detected by muscle protein antibody labeling. Confocal
microscopy will be used to obtain clear images of fluorescent labeled cells that
lie deep inside tissue. The effect of NO to induce follistatin gene expression
in somites will also be studied. The follistatin protein is known to remove
BMP4, a protein that inhibits myotome formation. It is expected that a pattern
of NO signaling will be seen between the ectoderm and somite that correlates
with the activation of the follistatin gene, which in turn will allow myotome to
form. The outcome from this research will show for the first time that NO is a
major regulator of myotome formation in somites which is not presently
recognized in the vertebrate embryo.
