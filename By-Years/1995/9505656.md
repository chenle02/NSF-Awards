American industrial and living standard dominance has eroded away since 1950.
This fact implies economic convergence as evidenced by the catching up of Japan,
Germany, and now a number of newly emerging economies. Until recently,
economists paid very little attention to the contribution which the
globalization forces of trade, migration, and international investment have made
to this convergence. Furthermore, they typically limited their convergence
measures to GDP per worker-hour, while excluding factor prices like wages and
land rents. This project seeks to repair those shortcomings. There have been two
golden ages of convergence for the OECD countries: 1850-1914 and 1950-1994.
Previous NSF funded research by the principal investigator has shown that the
globalization forces of mass migration and trade caused most the convergence up
to 1914. It was also shown that convergence stopped between 1914 and 1950, while
America fended off the challengers. The purpose of this project is to determine
why convergence stopped during those four decades when the pre-1914 open world
economy imploded into autarky. In particular, what role did policy restrictions
on trade and migration play? The findings should help guide any effort to assess
the contribution to convergence which the retreat from autarky and the advance
to global integration has made since 1950. It will also help identify the forces
of de- globalization which seem to be lurking on the horizon of the next
century.
