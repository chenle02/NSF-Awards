TERC, in collaboration with McLean Media, is developing multimedia-rich teaching
modules that highlight the work and personal stories of EarthScope scientists
and engage students in grades 7-12 in data-based investigations connected to the
scientists? research. The EarthScope Chronicles modules include compelling
videos that feature interviews with scientists and footage of them conducting
EarthScope research. The investigations incorporate EarthScope visualizations,
data, data products, and geospatial technology to connect STEM classroom content
to current real-world scientific research. To increase EarthScope?s visibility
within the educational community and the public at large, individual media
resources from the modules, such as video clips, image sets, and e-books are
distributed through online digital libraries and social media sites such as
TeacherTube, YouTube, Vimeo, and STEM Stories. EarthScope Chronicles modules
raise awareness of EarthScope research initiatives and resulting scientific
discoveries, support the use of EarthScope visualizations, data, and data
products in middle- and high-school classrooms, and provide engaging multimedia
resources and a replicable model for connecting STEM classroom curriculum to
current real-world research.
