This award supports the attendance of US-based participants in the 2022 Congress
of the Pacific Rim Mathematical Association (PRIMA), hosted by the Pacific
Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
in December 2022. The Congress helps mathematical scientists to build new and
strengthen existing collaborations across the Pacific Rim. A strong US presence
at this conference is a steppingstone to wider US participation in mathematical
activities in the Pacific Rim.

The Congress includes scientific sessions on Algebraic Number Theory and
Arithmetic Geometry, Arithmetic Geometry, Enumerative Algebraic Geometry,
Geometric Analysis, Geometric Group Theory, Graph Theory and Combinatorics,
Harmonic Functions and Laplace Eigenfunctions, Mathematics of Information,
Moduli Spaces in Algebraic Geometry, Geometry and Mathematical Physics, Optimal
Transport and Applications, and Representation Theory and Applications. The
Pacific Rim Mathematical Association was founded in 2005, and currently consists
of 48 member institutions around the Pacific Rim. The PRIMA charter calls for
PRIMA to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of scientific
knowledge via a quadrennial Pacific Rim Congress. PRIMA Congresses have been
held in 2009 (Sydney), 2013 (Shanghai), and 2017 (Oaxaca).
