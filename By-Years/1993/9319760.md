9319760 Jayaram The third Austin Spring Meeting addresses the genetics and
biochemistry of intra-cellular communication and intra- and extra- cellular
signal transduction in prokaryotes, yeast, and higher organisms. The central
theme is the role of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades that
regulate the pathways of information processing. Unifying principles among the
diverse systems dealt with will be elaborated. The meeting will have about 20
invited speakers. In addition, about 25 young faculty, postdoctoral, graduate
and undergraduate students from areas outside of Austin will participate. The
meeting will be small enough to foster strong interactions among the conferees.
%%% This meeting is on an important topic in cell and molecular biology. In
addition, it will benefit young scientists and students whose attendance will be
supported. ***
