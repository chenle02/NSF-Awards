Economic theory suggests that the lack of product market competition in non-
competitive industries gives employers in these industries more latitude to
employment discriminate relative to employers in fiercely competitive
industries. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will utilize
individual data from the Current Population Survey and industry data from the
Census of Manufacturers and Manufactured Commodities to explore factors, which
influence the racial composition of US industries. Particular emphasis will be
given to examining the influence of product market competition on racial
employment. The specification developed will measure the influence of both
foreign and domestic competition on racial composition. Indeed, if the stated
hypothesis holds true, competition, regardless of its source - international or
domestic product markets- will reduce employers' ability to engage in racial
preference hiring. Additionally, the developed empirical model will allow for
labor supply and labor demand effects that may influence the racial composition
of industries.
