In the minutes and hours following the recent earthquakes in New Zealand and in
Japan, and storm in Haiti, thousands of locals posted pictures to social media
sites like Facebook and Twitter. These pictures when coupled with extremely
granular spatio-temporal information (e.g., timestamps and GPS-style geocodes)
provide a minute-by-minute and region-by-region pictorial account of the
emergency as it unfolded. The goal of this project is to assess, characterize,
and model the quality of these images posted to social media in the minutes and
hours post-emergency for guiding policy-based stakeholders and assets. Carefully
framed images can convey a wealth of structural information to recovery experts:
revealing damage levels, guiding resource allocation, and directing other
policy-based assets. First, a sample of several thousand social media images
from New Zealand will be assessed by domain experts and specifically structural
earthquake engineers. Second, with RAPID funding, this project will link images
posted during the emergency to actual damage assessments made in Christchurch
for validating the quality of images. First, a sample of several thousand social
media images from New Zealand will be assessed by domain experts and
specifically structural earthquake engineers. The results of this project will
have broad impacts, particularly in the development and deployment of a new
rapid assessment tool for earthquake damage assessment based on social media. An
additional broader impact is the ancillary development of training modules for
increasing the effectiveness and image quality of future socially-generated
image capture, which would greatly improve social computing for disasters. The
methods and data generated by this project will be archived and made available
for future studies.
