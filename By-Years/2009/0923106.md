Advanced optical techniques (such as PIV, LIF and LDV) represent the most well-
resolved and accurate means of experimentally documenting the physics of flows,
yet there exist a wealth of practical complex flows spanning many fields of
science and engineering that have yet to be rigorously explored due to
inadequate optical access, including flows over complex topography (relevant to
aerodynamics and geophysical phenomena, for example), within complex geometries
(flow in porous media and coral reefs, turbines, etc.) and in the presence of
particulates (sediment transport, nutrient transport, pollutant and aerosol
dispersion, etc.). This lack of high-quality experimental data necessarily
limits the design of effective models, predictive tools and/or control
strategies for these important flows. It is proposed to transform the
experimental study of such flows by developing a large-scale flow facility that
will alleviate these debilitating issues by allowing the refractive index (RI)
of the working fluid to be tailored to match that of the solid (or particulates)
under study. This RI-matched (RIM) flow facility will permit Illinois
researchers to render complex solid models and/or particulates optically
transparent when immersed in the working fluid, thereby minimizing reflections
and distortion and facilitating thorough non-intrusive experimentation. The
uniqueness of this facility includes its large spatial scale (0.45 m × 0.45 m ×
2.5 m test section), allowing the study of flows at relevant scales and Reynolds
numbers with high temporal and spatial resolution, as well as the types of
working fluids to be accommodated.
