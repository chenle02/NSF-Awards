This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns research
within the field of topology, a branch of mathematics with a focus on
understanding the global large-scale structure of spaces, in contrast to
geometry’s focus on local fine structure. The abstract nature of topology has
made it a useful tool throughout the sciences, from asking questions regarding
the shape of the universe to understanding the large-scale properties of complex
networks. This project focuses on understanding topological symmetries of
Riemann surfaces, which are two-dimensional objects, including the complex
plane, the two-dimensional sphere, and objects that look like the surface of a
doughnut. Riemann surfaces appear in almost every branch of mathematics and
naturally arise in science, especially via string theory and via the solutions
of differential equations. In addition, the project has several outreach
components aimed at supporting students in pursuing a career in the mathematical
sciences. The PI will create an organization dedicated to building a network of
alumni to foster relationships in the community and create internship
opportunities. Additionally, the PI will host several career panels featuring
former students working in a diverse range of fields and will provide research
experiences for undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is focused on
understanding the algebraic structure of the (topological) mapping class group
of a Riemann surface. In the finite-area case, the structure of mapping class
groups is well understood, and the theory has deep connections to geometric
group theory and Teichmüller theory. This project investigates the infinite-area
case, where relatively little is known. The main goal is to characterize the
countable-index normal subgroups of mapping class groups of infinite-area
Riemann surfaces. The investigation will forge new connections between low-
dimensional topology and recent developments in topological group
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
