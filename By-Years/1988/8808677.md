Microtubules are a major component of the cytoskeleton of nerve cells and are
necessary for the formation and maintenance of neuronal structure. In order to
provide material for neuronal growth and to preserve neuronal structure,
microtubule proteins, along with other cytoskeletal proteins, are transported at
a slow rate down neuronal extensions. The PI has discovered that microtubule
preparations can undergo slow, energy-dependent, contractile behavior in vitro
and has proposed that this process, microtubule gelation-contraction, is related
to the normal process of protein transport in nerve cells. The proposed
experiments will help demonstrate the validity of this hypothesis. Experiments
will be performed to directly compare the properties of neuronal transport in
vivo to microtubule gelation-contraction in vitro. The PI will attempt to
identify the enzyme needed for the conversion of chemical energy into kinetic
energy in this process. The experiments should provide important information on
how nerve cell structure is produced and maintained and could have significance
in understanding the processes leading to neuronal degeneration such as occurs
in Alzheimer's disease and diabetic neuropathy.
