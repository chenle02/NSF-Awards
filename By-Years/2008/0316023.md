This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Janet Braddock-Wilking at the University of Missouri at
St. Louis on transformations that occur between organosilanes and late
transition metal complexes in order to obtain insight into the reaction pathways
and to investigate the reactivity of a variety of primary and secondary
hydrosilanes with low-valent electron-rich late transition metal complexes of
metals such as Pt, Rh, and Ir to gain a better understanding of the factors that
influence Si-H bond activation. Stoichiometric reactions will be examined that
involve silanes with sterically hindered groups at silicon and silanes where the
SiH2 group is incorporated into a heterocycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better
understanding of how metal-catalyzed reactions such as dehydrocoupling of
hydrosilanes, hydrosilylation, and silane redistribution occur is crucial for
the future development of new materials and processes. The research will provide
students with the opportunity to learn about two overlapping areas of chemistry,
transition metal and organosilicon chemistry. Students will develop synthetic
organic and organometallic skills, utilize a number of purification,
spectroscopic and presentation techniques. &lt;br/&gt;
