This research, which is part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and
sponsored by the Special Projects Office, is aimed at probing chemical reactions
as a function of the local solvent microenvironment. Stuctural determinations of
both clusters and isolated species will be performed. A pump-probe technique
will be developed to study ground state chemical reactions. It will include an
infrared pump beam and an ultraviolet probe beam with fluorescence detection.
