Ernst Berndt and Zvi Griliches SBR-9511550 This proposal will continue ongoing
research into the incorporation of technical change into price indexes. This is
an important practical issue since the failure to account for changing quality
is thought to be the largest source of bias in aggregate price indexes. And
price indexes are used for such important tasks as the adjustment of social
security payments to offset inflation, the implementation of cost-of-living
clauses in union labor contracts, and the setting of monetary policy. The key
problem in accounting for changes in quality is the determination of pre-
introduction reservation prices for new goods. The proposal reviews a number of
ways of doing this. These include using hedonic regressions, comparing branded
and generic good prices, and estimating differentiated demand models. The P.I.s
will implement these various approaches using data on pharmaceutical products
and personal computers. In addition, they will seek out other data sources, such
as scanner data.
