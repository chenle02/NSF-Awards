Isbell will continue his study of a reinterpretation of descriptive set theory,
the natural interpretation in metrizable locales. This shift has already been
shown to produce at least one gain in metrizable spaces (the standard setting)
although there are three or four losses. The completed work is almost all in
Borel multiplicative class 1. Most of the main problems now visible are in
multiplicative class 2 (F-sigma-delta). Hopeful indications that the technical
losses by the central reinterpretation may be outweighed by conceptual
enrichment are to be explored. The goal is to shed light on standard descriptive
set theory by demonstrating the existence of an alternative.
