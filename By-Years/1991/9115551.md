This study will use enzymatic indicators of metabolic function and direct
measurements of respiratory rates to describe the pattern of metabolic
potentials of midwater animals as a function of depth of occurrence, the
presence of mid-depth oxygen minima, and body size. Preliminary data suggest
that previous generalizations based on physiologically complex, visually-
orienting fishes and crustaceans are not generally applicable to micronekton and
zooplankton of other taxa which have largely been ignored in previous studies.
This study will allow investigation of a broader range of animals than
previously possible, especially those which are more fragile in structure,
enabling us to extend the description of the patterns of variation in metabolic
potential to all of the major midwater groups (with emphasis on chaetognaths,
medusae, worms and molluscs and more superficial work on ctenophores and
siphonophores). The research is directed at achieving a synthesis of the carbon
fluxes through this ecosystem. This application of the research will be tested
by collecting data on the biomass of the major groups of midwater animals in a
4100 m California Current water column and using the metabolic data to estimate
respiratory carbon flux due to zooplankton and micronekton in this community.
