This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Oklahoma in the
purchase of an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
analysis of allosteric transition metal complexes, electronic structures of
Cytochrome P-450 model compounds; characterization of stable free
radical/cations and anions, and paramagnetic metallocenes; determination of the
distribution of spin density and molecular structure of organocobalt radicals;
study of spin states and oxidation states of both porphyrin and nonporphyrin
Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes; photo-EPR, to probe the photogeneration of charges
in photoconducting polymers; analysis of nitroxide spin-labeled proteins, and
copper-labeled proteins, as a measure of polypeptide structure, folding and
conformational dynamics. An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer
is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the
lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for the initiation of tumor
growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.
