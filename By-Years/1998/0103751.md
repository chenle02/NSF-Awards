The 43rd Annual Maize Genetics Conference is being held March 15-18, 2001 in
Lake Geneva, WI. The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community the
opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results. A wide
range of topics are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics. The
43rd Annual meeting features 45 minute talks by four invited speakers, 15 minute
talks given by individual participants, two poster sessions, and two workshops.
The invited speakers are: Alice Barkan, University of Oregon; Kelly Dawe,
University of Georgia; June Nasrallah, Cornell University; and Laurie Smith,
University of California-San Diego. The workshops focus on two timely topics:
Comparative Genomics of Maize and Rice and Bioinformatics. This award provides
partial support toward student participation in the conference. The Maize
Genetics meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to
meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas
as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will
prove invaluable throughout their careers.
