One of the significant problems in concurrent-software analysis research is
achieving a balance between general theoretical concepts and specific practical
techniques. This is the motivation for this research. The focus of the project
is on applying and adapting Petri net theory for solutions to pragmatic problems
in concurrent-software analysis. The specific research topics addressed
represent natural points of extension from previous efforts. The research
explores Ada tasking analysis issues within the framework of an existing
experimental toolkit and also expands on research in analysis of Petri nets
using some new reachability concepts and techniques. One area of emphasis is in
empirical studies of various deadlock detection techniques and the applicability
of these techniques to generic language structures beyond the example of Ada
tasking. A second emphasis is the investigation of a generalized form of
reachability graph and its construction. This area of work exploits some
identified connections to recent research in use of Binary-Decision Diagrams
(BDDs) for representation of symbolic state spaces.
