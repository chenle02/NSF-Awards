The study involves the consideration of a theory of dialogue with meta-control
features that previous research have indicated as desirable for improved
efficiency in human-machine voice-interactions. In particular these features
include: (1) process meta-statements which overview and report progress in the
interaction; (2) an automatically set level of initiative in the system; and (3)
perform dialogue corrections and automatic adjustment of other parameters. The
first feature serves the purpose of informing the user of the system's
intentions to encourage cooperation, educating the user about the process of
debugging, and maintaining morale to maximize efficiency. The second feature
enables the system to take charge and lead the interaction when the user lacks
the knowledge required and to release control to the user when he or she has
sufficient expertise. The third is used to optimize aspects of system
performance. The effects of these meta-behaviors in human-human dialogues on the
efficiency and educational value of the exchange are also considered with views
toward their implementation in automatic dialogue systems.
