This research project will test four hypotheses about evolutionary forces that
affect the behavior of pair-bonded birds to each other and to the nestlings they
raise: 1. Male-male aggression during a female's fertile period decreases the
likelihood that the female's young are sired by males other than her territorial
partner. 2. Female-female aggression during the egg-laying period functions to
decrease the likelihood that females' broods contain nestlings from other
females of the same species that lay their eggs in the nests of neighbors. 3.
Mate- guarding by males is a response to females' behavior or ecological
circumstances that increase the likelihood that females mate with more than one
male. 4. Parental feeding of nestlings by males varies according to males'
likelihood of genetic paternity as indicated by the behavior of females when
they are fertile. These are important questions for several reasons. Dr. Gowaty
and her colleagues are attempting to observe evolutionary processes as they
occur, by testing the current functional utility and evolutionary significance
of important, sometimes dramatic, social behaviors. Also, the researchers are
testing hypotheses about the relationship of "confidence of paternity" (the
perceived likelihood that a male is the actual genetic sire of the offspring he
cares for) to actual genetic paternity as assessed using DNA markers. This in
turn is important because ideas about confidence of paternity are theoretically
prominent explanations for variation in the social behavior of male animals.
