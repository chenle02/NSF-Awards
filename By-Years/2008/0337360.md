The focus of the program is on the acquisition of spatial representation and
reasoning. The researchers believe that in order to achieve their long-term goal
of devising optimal education programs in spatial competence, they must first
come to understand the nature of spatial learning and determine the types of
experiences that lead to higher achievement in the domain, about which
relatively little is known. Their previous research indicates that the
development of spatial cognition is highly sensitive to input and thus is
malleable. The current project brings together researchers from across cognitive
science. They will explore three, presumably interrelated, aspects of spatial
intelligence: First, one part of the team will investigate how spatial expertise
can be enhanced directly by training the mental processes that operate on
spatial representations. Second, another part of the team will investigate how
spatial reasoning can be enhanced through maps and language. Third, the
remaining part of the team will investigate how spatial reasoning can be
enhanced by applying measurement and graphs to quantitative information.
