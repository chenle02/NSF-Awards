A multiplexed holographic Fabry-Perot (MHFP) etalon technology which
incorporates a multiplexed hologram into a novel holographic Fabry-Perot (HFP)
etalon is being investigated by Physical Optics Corporation (POC). Two unique
advantages of the MHFP etalon technology are: (i) coherently-coupled fabrication
of HFP mirrors significantly reduces the need to have nearly flat surfaces
typical in conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) etalons (and thus, results in an
inexpensive, large aperture FP etalon) and (ii) the angular/wavelength
multiplexing capability of a multiplexed hologram can be combined with the
uniqueness of FP etalons (such as narrow- band operation and tunability). The
primary objective in Phase II will be the continued development of both HFP and
MHFP devices and applications not achievable by conventional FP etalons.
Specifically, Phase II will concentrate on optimizing the performance of HFP
etalons, advancing the fabrication technology HFP etalons, developing tunable
HFP technology in solid and air- spaced etalon configurations, studying the
enhancement of diffraction efficiency in MHFP etalons, and developing a tunable
MHFP etalon technology. POC will also demonstrate prototypes for optical
communications and processing applications based on these novel technologies.
