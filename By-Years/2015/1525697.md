Simulation of natural and engineering phenomena is a multi-layered technical
task with high demands on mathematical sophistication and computational power.
Producing a computer simulation code requires work at many different levels of
detail. A computer program should represent a scientific problem in a language
close to that used by domain specialists, but this differs greatly from low-
level, hardware-specific details of computers. Bridging between the two requires
several different links. This project sets up many intermediate software stages,
called ?representations? modeling the domain knowledge of engineers, numerical
analysts, and computer scientists by describing partial differential equations,
the so-called weak forms needed for numerical methods, loop nests required to
build discrete operations, and finally low-level code that can be executed by
computers. ?Transformations? are then programs connecting these representations,
injecting knowledge about algorithms and hardware. The key advance in this
research is that, through this chain of transformations, domain knowledge about
each level of detail, be it application-related, numerical, or computational,
can be supplied at the appropriate level of detail. The tools developed in this
project promote the advancement of science by both shortening the development
time and increasing the resulting power of high-performance simulation codes
used by scientists and engineers, enabling them to impact the world.
