The objective of the workshop is focus on the evolution and transmission of
pathogenic microbes in models of infectious diseases. Because pathogenic agents
may evolve rapidly, have varied mechanisms of transmission, and involve complex
treatment strategies, researchers from a variety of fields are necessary to
understand and control infectious diseases. The contributions of researchers in
mathematical models of epidemics is important in this effort. This workshop
provides a forum for leading researchers in the subject of mathematical models
of epidemics to exchange ideas, explore new methods, and discuss future
directions with experts in epidemiology and public health. The workshop greatly
benefits researchers and their graduate students at universities in Canada and
the United States.

In recent years mathematical models have been widely used to study emerging
infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are a vital concern to society, and
mathematical modeling allows the design of epidemic control strategies and the
development of effective vaccines. Mathematical insights also help in
understanding and predicting the emergence of antibiotic and antiviral drug
resistance, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to better address these
important public health concerns. The outbreak of SARS in Asia and Canada in
2003, the increasing number of AIDS cases worldwide, and the recent resurgence
of tuberculosis in Canada and the United States all demonstrate the urgency and
importance of this research.
