9553567 Bond Through this project, the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards (NBTPS) will conduct the necessary research and development to build a
Science Certificate for teachers of students ages 14 through 18+. The components
of the assessment will be a teacher portfolio and activities undertaken at an
assessment center which focuses on issues science teachers regularly encounter.
During the project, systematic pilot tests will be conducted, scoring rubrics
developed, and procedures invented for administration of the assessment center
exercises along with the training of examiners. The project will advance the
state-of-the- art in teacher performance assessment, and results will inform
policymakers, teachers, administrators and scholars interested in teacher
preparation and continuing professional development.
