An optically-pumped, near-mm-wave, high-intensity laser has been constructed at
Cornell University for the purpose of measuring the nonlinear susceptibility of
two dimensional electron gas (2- DEG) structures in the Terahertz frequency
region. A collaborative Industry/University research program is proposed,
entered around this instrumentation, in which measurements are made on the far
infrared nonlinear properties of high mobility 2- DEG samples provided by IBM.
One goal is to drive the collective 2-DEG electronic modes far from equilibrium
with high intensity resonant radiation tuned to the natural quantum transition
frequencies. Since very little research has been carried out as yet on the
nonlinear high frequency properties of 2-DEG systems a number of different
experiments are proposed. These include saturation measurements on the sub-band
states and on the cyclotron resonance mode in magnetic fields up to 11 Tesla,
identification of resonant and nonresonant hot electron effects, observation of
period doubling and a new type of second harmonic generation predicted to occur
for the 2-DEG surface layer and appears in the sample at high intensities. A
continuation of the investigation of persistent IR hole burning at defects in
semiconductors is also proposed with effort directed toward probing the dynamic
of the DX center in aluminum-gallium-arsenide and the divacancy in silicon.
