AST 0205969 Katz

Over the past ten years, our basic ideas about how galaxies form has reached a
consensus. This "standard" model has been able to explain numerous and varied
observations of galaxies. However, four vexing problems remain. These problems
arise from predictions made using computer simulations. This has led some
researchers to significantly alter or abandon this otherwise very successful
standard model. However, computer simulations are not perfect, and it has
recently been shown that correctly simulating the dynamics of galaxies and their
dark matter halos is much more difficult than previously realized. Hence the
cause of these problems could be purely numerical in nature. Alternatively, the
cause of these problems could be physical effects which are not properly
included in the simulations.

Dr Katz and his collaborators will study the origin of these problems and
possible solutions to try and assess whether or not the standard model for
galaxy formation should be changed or abandoned. They will use numerical
simulations of ever increasing realism and novel numerical techniques to study
these subtle dynamical processes and their impact on the above problems. ***
