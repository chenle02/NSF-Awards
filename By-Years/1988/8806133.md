We will purchase a contact mask aligner. This equipment will be used on seven
projects related to high speed semiconductor devices and materials. These
projects are as follows: 1) heterojunction Bipolar Transistor Device materials
characteristics, 2) Uniaxial Stress Dependent Studies related to III-V
Semiconductor Devices, 3) Nonlinear GaAS MESFET Applications, 4) Heterojunction
bipolar transistor in millimeter wave circuits, 5) Rapid thermal vapor phase
epitaxy, 6) Lifetime and Recombination Studies in Mercury Cadmium Telluride, and
7) an etched groove vertical MISFET.
