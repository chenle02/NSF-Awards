9312825 Dick This is an award to provide support for research, the objective of
which is to determine the source and fate of fine particles emerging from
wastewater and associated treatment processes as an initial step toward improved
process design and operation to exercise control over these discharges. The
investigator plans to develop procedures for tagging particles that enter the
process and tracing their path through the various unit operations that comprise
a wastewater treatment system. Techniques for tracking the particles that will
be investigated include neutron activation, fluorescent marking, radiolabeling,
elemental and chemical analyses, particle size measurement and microscopic
examination. Results of this project are expected to provide a better
understanding than now exists for the fate of fine particles that are present in
wastewater and those produced during the treatment processes. This improved
understanding in turn is expected to provide the basis for improvement of
engineering design and operation of processes and systems for wastewater
treatment and for managing the residual sludges derived from these treatment
processes.
