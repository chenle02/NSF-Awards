An award is made to the University of Georgia to develop a novel super-
resolution microscope for biological research. For students and early-career
researchers, this close collaboration at the intersection of biology, physics,
optics, and chemical engineering will provide an invaluable training experience,
and it will be enriched with professional development in interdisciplinary
science communication skills. All team members will contribute to the
development of an online team blog, lab notebook, and public website that will
capture the progress of the research within a broader historical, scientific,
and visual context, curated by the Boston Museum of Science. The Museum of
Science team will also disseminate this work to thousands of science museum
visitors, students, and the broader community with live presentations,
demonstrations, podcasts, and a short NOVA-style film on the quest to see more
clearly and deeply into the mysteries of life. The film will be directed by a
multiple award-winning NOVA producer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument will
combine holographic imaging using high resolution spatial light modulators and
new techniques for correcting distortion induced by light scattering in thick
biological tissue to achieve molecular-scale resolution inside organisms
important for modern biological research, such as fruit flies and zebrafish. At
The Ohio State University, semiconductor nanotechnology will be combined with
DNA origami to create intensely bright and switchable light emitters,
individually targetable to selected molecules operating within biological
systems. This novel combination of high-precision technologies will provide
investigators an unprecedented view of important subcellular biological
processes, such as neuronal signaling in intact organisms, potentially
contributing to breakthroughs in areas of molecular and systems biology,
biological engineering, medicine, and human health.
