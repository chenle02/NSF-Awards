It is proposed to study the two-electron process of ionization plus excitation
of the hydrogen molecule by fast projectiles, testing the theory of Reading and
Ford. Three measurements are proposed: (1) Cross sections for excitation of
various excited states, as a function of projectile velocity and charge and as a
function of orientation of the internuclear axis, intended to understand higher
Born contributions and the importance of nondipole interactions. (2) Cross
sections for charge capture plus excitation to dipole allowed and nondipole
allowed states, as well as charge capture plus ionization, intended to
illustrate the importance of a fast or slow continuum electron. (3) Correlation
between ejected electron and excited hydrogen molecular ion state formed in an
ionizing collision.
