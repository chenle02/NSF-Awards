This award to the National Academies will provide partial support for the core
activities of the Committee on Science, Engineering, Medicine and Public Policy
(COSEMPUP). Since 1961, COSEMPUP and its predecessor committees have played a
major role in U.S. science and technology policy, interacting closely with the
Director of the National Science Foundation, the President's Science Advisor,
other executive branch leaders, and members of Congress, including leaders of
key science and technology committees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will
provide partial support for COSEMPUP's bi-annual meetings, two annual workshops,
and related program and administrative resources. Individual consensus studies
are separately funded by a range of agencies and foundations and are not
supported through this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
