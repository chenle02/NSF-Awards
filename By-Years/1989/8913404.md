This award supports a visit by Dr. Peter R. Jones of Marquette University to the
University of Tasmania, in Hobart, to work with Dr. Peter G. Trotter on an area
of number theory involving semigroups. The investigators plan to merge two areas
of semigroup theory research which have seen the greatest advances over the past
decade, but whose development has been almost completely independent. The first
is "finite" semigroup theory, which arises from the explicit connections among
formal languages, automata and finite semigroups. The other is the theory of
completely regular semigroups--those which are unions of their subgroups, and
research on which has seen a resurgence of late. Important recent developments
in each field will be applied to the other, notably Polak's decomposition theory
for varieties will be applied to finite semigroup theory, and the "derived
category" of a morphism will be applied to completely regular semigroup theory.
The key fusion will involve a systematic study of the "local" varieties of
completely regular monoids.
