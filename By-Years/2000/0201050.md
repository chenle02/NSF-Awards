The research program examines novel procedures of spectral estimation related to
the processing of seismic data. Wavelet analysis is employed to describe the
time-dependent characteristics and localized events present in earthquake
records. The wavelet transform is increasingly being used in a variety of
applications.

Various wavelets families are examined for use in seismic spectrum estimation
problems. The suitability of the various methods for estimating the cross
spectra of two accelerograms is investigated, and the spatial variability of
seismic records examined. The method developed will be applied in processing a
small but representative number of records from important earthquakes, such as
the Kocaeli seismic event in Turkey, and the Northridge seismic event in
California. The evolutionary spectral content of seismic records, obtained via
the wavelet method, has potential application to the safety of critical
constructed facilities.
