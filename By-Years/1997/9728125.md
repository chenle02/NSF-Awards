Mount MCB 978125 Plants are constantly exposed to UV-B light from the sun and
oxygen as a product of metabolism and both can and do damage DNA. Hence, plants
are likely to utilize efficient mechanisms for repairing these types of DNA
damage. Mutants of Arabidopsis that are abnormally sensitive to UV light have
been isolated and found to comprise several complementation groups that map in
different locations. Two genes, which have been tentatively identified as
encoding products which are involved in the pathway for nucleotide excision
repair of UV damage are under study. An attempt to positionally clone UVH1 and
UVH3 is underway. Preliminary evidence suggests that the UVH1 locus may be a
homolog of the human XP-B gene, a gene which is one of the several
complementation groups involved in the human genetic disease xeroderma
pigmentosum, as well as the yeast Rad 25 gene. The cloning of these genes will
be completed, complementation tests performed and mutant genes sequenced. A
radioimmune assay and complementation of the appropriate yeast mutants will
further explore the function of the genes. The response to changing
environmental conditions such as variation in UV light intensity and oxygen-
production by the modification of transcriptional regulation will be
investigated. Additional Arabidopsis excision repair genes will be identified,
characterized and mapped. Plants can be expected to require highly efficient
mechanisms for removal and repair of DNA damage since they are constantly
exposed to sunlight and molecular oxygen, both factors known to cause DNA
damage. Since the reproductive organs of plants are developmentally derived from
undifferentiated somatic tissues, that task becomes even more critical in
plants. Information derived from this on-going study will give greater insight
into that repair process.
