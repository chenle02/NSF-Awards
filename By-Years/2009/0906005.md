This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009 using
funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5). The training and development plan is entitled "Using Evolutionary &
Functional Turnover in Community Structure to Elucidate Processes of Community
Assembly" for James C. Stegen. The host institution for this research is the
University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, and the sponsoring scientist is
Allen H. Hurlbert.

Community ecology aims to understand processes that influence community
structure. This knowledge informs predictions regarding impacts of global change
on biological communities. To this end, analyses of community structure that
include species' functional roles and evolutionary relationships provide greater
insight than traditional analyses. This research quantifies turnover in
community structure with respect to the function and evolutionary position of
trees, birds, and mammals throughout North America. A major focus of this work
is to quantify the effect of spatial separation (geographic distance) relative
to climatic differences on community turnover to better understand how these
communities respond to ongoing global change. This study will therefore provide
critical information for mitigating the deterioration of biological communities
and the services they provide to human societies. Training goals include
broadening theoretical skills and developing a strong bioinformatics experience.
Several outreach activities are being implemented, including (i) co-teaching a
bioinformatics course; (ii) providing bioinformatics training to undergraduate
researchers and high school students through a NSF-funded research program; and
(iii) building a bioinformatics website focused on modeling and bioinformatics
computer code and information regarding how bioinformatics can be used to
address the impacts of global change.
