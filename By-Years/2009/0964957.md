DMS-0600967&lt;br/&gt;Pham Huu Tiep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses
on several important problems in representation theory of finite groups and its
applications. Many of these problems come up naturally in the group
representation theory, and others are motivated by various applications,
particularly in the theory of finite primitive permutation groups, Lie algebras,
integral lattices and linear codes, combinatorics, curve theory, and quantum
information processing. They tie together different areas of mathematics, with
the main unifying ingredient being the representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator intends to continue his long-term project to classify cross
characteristic representations of finite groups of Lie type of low dimension.
The second main project centers around certain local-global problems, which
should provide links between rationality properties of complex and Brauer
characters of a given finite group&lt;br/&gt;on the one hand and the structure
of the group on the other hand. He then applies the results on these two
projects to achieve significant progress in a number of applications, including
the subgroup structure of finite simple groups, minimal polynomials of group
elements in linear representations, integral lattices and grassmannian
designs,&lt;br/&gt;derangements in primitive permutation groups and rational
points of curves, mutually unbiased bases and quantum information
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main area of research in this proposal is
the&lt;br/&gt;representation theory of finite groups. Groups in mathematics grew
out of the notion of symmetry. The symmetries of an object in nature
or&lt;br/&gt;science are encoded by a group, and this group carries a lot
of&lt;br/&gt;important information about the structure of the object itself.
The&lt;br/&gt;representation theory allows one to study groups via their action
on vector spaces which models the ways they arise in the real world. It has
fascinated mathematicians for more than a century and had many important
applications in physics and chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;particularly in quantum
mechanics and in the theory&lt;br/&gt;of elementary particles. Finite groups and
their representations have already proved valuable&lt;br/&gt;in coding theory
and cryptography, and are expected to continue to play an important role in
the&lt;br/&gt;modern world of computers and digital communications. The
investigator's research will lead to&lt;br/&gt;important advances in
understanding the representation theory of finite groups and help achieve
significant progress in a number of its applications.&lt;br/&gt;
