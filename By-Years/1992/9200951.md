The primary objective of this proposal is to continue excavations at an
important fossil-bearing site in Kenya. The site, Maboko Island has yielded some
very important fossil primates dated to the Middle Miocene, a time period of
great anthropological importance as it frames the divergence of the Old World
monkeys and apes. There has long been debate as to the conditions that allowed
the diversification of the higher primates. Due to the rich fossiliferous beds
at Maboko, the investigator should be able to clarify not only the diversity of
middle Miocene mammals, but also the climatic and environmental conditions in
which they existed.
