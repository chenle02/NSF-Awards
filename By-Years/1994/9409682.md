The proposal is directed at system level testing by developing algorithms and
circuit configurations which can be loaded into FPGA's to provide self-testing,
fault diagnostic and repair capabilities. Once faults in an FPGA have been
detected and identified, reconfiguration algorithms would then be used to remap
the system function into the FPGA while avoiding the existing faults. It is
conjectured that by using this approach, development of application-specific
system diagnostic software for testing the FPGA system function can be avoided.
