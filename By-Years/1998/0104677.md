0104677&lt;br/&gt;Puri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports travel of
fifteen US participants to a transatlantic workshop, "New Combustion Models with
Practical Fuels," associated with the meeting of the Italian Section of the
Combustion Institute in Portofino, Italy, September 16-19, 2001. The organizers
are Ishwar Puri, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Tiziano Faravelli and
Eliseo Ranzi at the Polytechnic of Milan, Italy, and Antonio Cavaliere at the
University of Naples, Italy. The objective of the project is to consider issues
related to the current understanding and future challenges related to new
combustion models in the context of practical fuels. Specifically, the workshop
will address the flame chemistry of realistic fuels, the nature of the reaction
zones in "new" combustion models, and state relationships for the laminar
flamelet approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The workshop will be specifically
designed to encourage international research collaboration through the
development of a research agenda. International research experiences fur
undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral researchers will be developed under
the aegis of the Student Transatlantic Engineering Program at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
