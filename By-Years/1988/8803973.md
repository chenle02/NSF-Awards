This award under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program supports
the research of nine students at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory. A concurrent
academic course will help place the research experience in a wider academic
context. Nine students will be supported for a summer of research concerning
infrared astronomical observations. The goal is to provide the students with a
realistic research experience while working with active professionals. The
students supported during the summer of 1987 were highly enthusiastic about
their experience.
