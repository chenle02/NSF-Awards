The award will support the development, testing and evaluation of algorithms to
enable the functional and structural mapping of the brain between different
modalities, subjects and developmental stages. The algorithms will spatially
deform data from varied sources so that they become comparable. The algorithms
will be applied to positioning, warping, interpolating and parameterizing of 3D
brain data. The PI will model brain using volume and surface based approaches,
then transform it using methods ranging from rigid repositioning to nonlinear,
local deformations. Transformation algorithms will first be measured for
accuracy, reliability and validity via experiments using simulations and
previously acquired data. The goal is to develop algorithms that are
biologically valid as well as numerically accurate. This work will complement
the Human Brain Project research and will enable the integration of independent
yet complementary brain information from different sources and projects.
