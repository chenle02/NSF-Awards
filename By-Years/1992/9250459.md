Montgomery County Community College is revising its Engineering Technology
Program in response to a plan developed by merging ideas and experiences of
engineers, educators, and engineering technicians. The goal of the improved
curriculum is to give the students a fundamental background in general
engineering theory and applications of this theory to laboratory analysis. The
curriculum emphasizes good laboratory techniques, computer- aided data analysis,
and both written and oral communication of laboratory results. This project
provides equipment for the required laboratory courses. The laboratory equipment
demonstrates various laboratory procedures that are specifically designed to
reinforce the engineering principles presented in lecture. Some of this
equipment includes software to aid in data analysis, and the project includes
two computers, one printer, and one plotter to enable the students to perform
computer-aided data analysis.
