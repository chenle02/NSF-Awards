This grant in the Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program is for a
faculty member in the physics department at Ball State University to participate
in the analysis of a major Fermilab fixed target experiment, E683-
Photoproduction of High Pt Jets. Prof. Thomas has been a participant in the
experiment (using an NSF grant) from its inception and has effectively used it
as a research experience for Ball State undergraduates and as the research
project for their masters degree program. Two students used projects in E683 to
earn their masters degrees during his last grant and two are in progress.
