This project concentrates on the collective manipulation of internal and
external degrees of freedom of atomic samples interacting strongly with an
optical resonator. The indistinguishability of the processes associated with
different atoms leads to entanglement between them, and can result in strong
collective emission into the resonator. A method is proposed to attain spin
squeezing on an atomic clock transition. The squeezed state reduces the readout
noise to a value below the standard quantum limit, as will be experimentally
demonstrated with two samples of cesium atoms inside an optical resonator. These
studies will elucidate the relation between collective emission processes and
light-induced forces. In the most favorable case, the collective-emission-
induced mechanism will provide a new tool for manipulating polarizable
particles, and significantly broaden the scope of laser cooling and trapping
techniques. The proposed work will unite research and educational goals by
training graduate students, and by involving undergraduate students in
significant parts of the research effort. Particularly for undergraduate
students, experimental firsthand experience with quantum mechanical objects will
provide an important, motivating and rewarding educational component.
