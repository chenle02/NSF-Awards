9405412 Goodfriend PIs and Mexican collaborator will attempt to develop a
relatively inexpensive geochronological tool for the analysis of Holocene,
mixed-age deposits. Amino acid racemization ratios will be calibrated by
radiocarbon dating in modern to 4,000-year-old mollusks from the cheniers of the
Colorado Delta of Baja California, Mexico.
