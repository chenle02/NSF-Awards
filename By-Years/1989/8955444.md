The Pennsylvania State University will initiate a two-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering for 25
students in grades 11-12. The project is a pre-engineering program for high
school students, taught by tenured engineering faculty. In computing, students
study numerical methods, graphics, CAD, and fractals. They perform six original
experiments on the properties of materials, including the use of scanning
electron microscopy, ultrasonic detection, laser scanning technology, image
processing, and expert systems. The social context of technology and engineering
careers are also studied. A follow-up project is required. Algebra-II and
Trigonometry are required. The program is located at the University Park campus
of The Pennsylvania State University. All tuition, room, board, and textbooks
are free. Five stipends of $200 are available, based on need, for travel and
lost earnings.
