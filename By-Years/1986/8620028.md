The Topical Meeting on Photonic Switching is organized under joint sponsorship
by the Optical Society of America and the Lasers and Electro-Optics Society of
IEEE. It is scheduled to be held March 18-20, 1987, at Incline Village, Nevada.
The meeting will solicit invited and contributed original papers on the subjects
of devices and architectures suitable for switching, multiplexing, or routing
optical signals. The purpose of the meeting is to foster interactions between
two groups exploring possible applications of photonic switching technology:
those working on optical switching devices, and on future switching systems and
networks. Serving as meeting cochairs are Dr. P.W. Smith, Bell Communications
Research, and Dr. T.K. Gustafson, NSF; program cochairs are Dr. J.E. Midwinter,
University College London, and Dr. S.D. Personick, Bell Communications Research.
The organizers of the meeting are acknowledged leaders in the field, and the
topic area is central to long term research directions within the QEWB program.
