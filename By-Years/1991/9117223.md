This award provides for approximately 17% of the total amount necessary to
acquire an electron microprobe. The remaining 83% will be supplied by the
University of Hawaii(40%),NASA(25%),and NSF- OCE(17%). This state-of-the-art
electron microprobe will replace a 12 year old instrument,which lacks the
imaging capabilities,beam stability,and computer strength needed for modern
research. An excellent group of researchers with wide ranging interests will
benefit from this acquisition.
