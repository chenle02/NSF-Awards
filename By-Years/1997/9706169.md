9706169 Tromp This research involves the use of a pseudospectral or spectral
collocation method with which techniques will be developed to simulate the
propagation of elastic and anelastic seismic waves in complex local, regional,
and global Earth models. This method requires significantly fewer grid points
than spatial finite- differencing techniques to achieve comparable accuracy,
exhibits no grid anisotropy and limited grid dispersion, and requires less CPU
time because of the use of Finite Fourier Transforms (FFT). On a local scale, it
will be used to simulate seismic wave propagation in the Boston, Los Angeles and
Tokyo basins based upon detailed geological models. A spherical version will be
used to simulate regional wave propagation across Australia where data from the
dense SKIPPY array are available for comparison and inversion. On a global
scale, the goal is to replace waveforms calculated based upon the path-average
approximation with pseudospectral waveforms. These much more accurate waveforms
will be used in the Harvard centroid moment-tensor project and in our global
tomographic inversions. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
