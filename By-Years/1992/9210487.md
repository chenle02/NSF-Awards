Mixing experiments at short vertical scales will be done in the Eastern North
Atlantic using both the High Resolution Profiler (HRP) and Shadowgraph
Television (STV). This cruise will be closely related to and coordinated with
the North Atlantic Tracer Release Experiment (NATRE), a WOCE Core Three
contribution.
