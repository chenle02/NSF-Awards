This award is for continuing support of research at the millimeter wave
interferometer, operated by the California Institute of Technology in Owens
Valley, California. The Principle Investigator, one of the world leaders in
millimeter wave astronomy and radio interferometry, directs one of the most
creative and productive groups of astronomers in the world. These workers have
not only pioneered in the application of millimeter wave technology to important
astronomical problems, but have also been instrumental in developing the
technology itself. Objects to be investigated under this award range from our
own solar system to the most distant galaxies. The first global measurement of
Martian winds is expected, using absorption features of carbon monoxide. The
high resolution of the three element array (soon to be expanded to six elements
or more) will permit detailed mapping of circumstellar structure associated with
young stellar objects - possibly planetary systems in the making. The great
sensitivity of this instrument will allow the extension of cosmological studies
of the Hubble expansion, now frequently conducted with the 21 cm radiation of
neutral hydrogen, to the use of the millimeter wavelength lines of carbon
monoxide. This will broaden the base of galaxies for which high accuracy red-
shifts may be obtained.
