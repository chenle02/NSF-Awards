9725386 Opdyke During the late Paleozoic most of the southern hemisphere
continents were joined into a "supercontinent" called Gondwana , that
subsequently collided with Europe and Asia to form Pangea, which itself
dispursed during the Mesozoic. During the late Carboniferous, Gondwana was still
a coherent block, therefore all paleomagnetic poles from rocks of this age
should align if the age and magnetic data are robust and the reconstruction of
the paleogeography is covert. Recently determined late Carboniferous poles in
Australia do not match poles from the same aged sediments in Africa that were
determined 30 years ago. This project will restudy these rocks to determine if
the age and magnetism data re in error, or if the plate reconstructions of
Gondwana are in error. Results are expected to clarify and resolve this
perplexing mis-match in these poles, which will read to a more robust
reconstruction of Gondwana.
