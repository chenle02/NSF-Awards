9351185 Miller The project will purchase equipment for a chromatography teaching
station that consists of gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), and an HPLC simulation program. The teaching station will
be used to introduce chromatography in a developmental and experiential way
throughout the chemistry laboratory curriculum. During the advanced courses,
students will modify instrumentation to obtain more sophisticated results. The
teaching station will be interfaced with a microcomputer to allow data
acquisition, analysis and
