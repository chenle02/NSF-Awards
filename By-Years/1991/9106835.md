Hydrographic and Chlorofluorocarbon measurements will be taken along a
meridional section of the South Atlantic Ocean, with additional sections along
the equator and 10 degrees South to determine the role played by the deep basin
circulation of Antarctic Bottom Water on climate change on decadal time scales.
This work is part of the Deep Basin Experiment, a component of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
