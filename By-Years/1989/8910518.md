A class of shear flow instabilities which occur in the flow of polymers through
melt extrusion dies will be investigated. A physical model devised from
molecular kinetic theory will be used to analyze the phenomena. The modeling
will be numerical, using techniques based on finite element and spectral
methods. Understanding of such phenomena is critical to the maximizing of
industrial production rates of polymeric extrusions.
