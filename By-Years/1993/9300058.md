9300058 Taaffe This research is concurrent with creating methodology and
software for efficiently analyzing models of manufacturing systems, including
complexities such as assembly, blocking, and time dependence. We obtain
efficient analysis by combining the speed and efficiency of queueing network
approximations with the details and generality of computer simulation
experimentation. Our combined approach, which we refer to as Correlated-
Decomposition Approximation and Simulation (CDAS), allows the strengths and
weaknesses of these two methodologies to complement each other. The
approximations and simulation can work together by using the approximations as
control varieties or the our newly developed more general biased-control
varieties, for the simulation. The goal is to improve analysis efficiency by two
or three orders of magnitude compared to ordinary simulation experiments. The
combined CDAS methodology should analyze the behavior of large complex
manufacturing systems in a matter of seconds or minutes rather than the hours or
days that simulation alone can require and to do so with accuracy beyond that
possible in present queueing network approximation software.
