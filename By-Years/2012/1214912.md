We will use a large seismic dataset recorded by a geophysical contractor in Long
Beach CA, in 2011, to test several seismic techniques. The dataset consists of
5200 sensors distributed over a 7x10 km area that recorded continuously for up
to 6 months. The data will be used to construct detailed micro-zonation maps
(maps of anomalous ground shaking potential) based on local earthquakes recorded
during the deployment. We also plan to backproject the continuous recordings
onto the Newport-Inglewood fault plane, which traverses the region in order to
determine the time history of micro-motions that occur on that fault.
Furthermore, we will also estimate the shallow velocity structure based on
correlations of the data, and search for scattered body waves in order to image
the subsurface structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this research is successful it
will have an impact on our understanding of earthquake rupture dynamics and on
the substantial lateral variations in seismic hazard, and will show the power of
a dense seismic network to assess these. The research also has the potential to
have a major impact on the oil and gas industry by showing what can be done with
a passive survey, and hence possibly eliminate the need for sources in urban
areas.
