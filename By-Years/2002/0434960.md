The National Academy of Engineering, in partnership with several engineering
journals (including the Journal on Engineering Education, Computer Science
Education, and the Journal of Research on Science Teaching) published by
professional societies and commercial publishers, is hosting a web portal
linking education research papers in engineering (including computer science)
and related science (including mathematics) disciplines. This virtual Annals of
Research on Engineering Education (AREE) is serving to present, in a unitary
fashion: the most rigorous research on engineering education in a manner that
builds upon rather than competes with existing outlets within engineering
disciplines; a forum for researchers on engineering education to discuss
applicable standards for the evaluation of engineering education research; a
reference site offering annotated bibliographies of the most recent research on
engineering education research; a discussion forum through which engineering
faculty and administrators with limited ability (or time) to perform research on
engineering education can learn of research findings with immediate implications
for improved classroom practice; a gateway to existing archives of relevant
engineering education conference; and a gateway to relevant education research
in non-engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
