The objective of this study is to use observations of the developing global
warming signal to better understand sensitivity and resilience within the
climate system to climate forcing. The study will focus on the tropical and
subtropical climate system's response to tropical/subtropical forcing, and on
regional-scale climate processes. Are some regions more resilient to change
under greenhouse gas forcing, while other regions more vulnerable to the same
forcing? If so, why? What regional physical processes operate to produce or
resist change? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity combines an analysis
of observed climate change during the satellite era with regional climate
modeling to improve fundamental understanding of how the tropical/subtropical
climate responds to tropical forcing over a range of time scales. The focus is
on the tropics and subtropics (35°S to 35°N), and the analysis begins with an
in-depth investigation of changes in the surface heat budget. Multiple datasets,
including atmospheric and ocean reanalyses and satellite observations, will be
included to evaluate confidence. Simulations using regional climate models, with
and without coupling between the atmosphere and oceans, are used in process
studies to simulate and further evaluate the role of various climate
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will shed insights into sensitivity
and resilience in the climate system, emphasizing the tropical and subtropical
region. This has substantial broader impacts.
