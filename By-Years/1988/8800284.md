The research project consists of three problems. The first deals with
prediction theory and improper priors. The goal is to find usable inferential
procedures starting from improper priors, which will have certain optimal
properties. The second problem will find asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues
of random symmetric matrices. The third problem is that of construction of
confidence intervals for linear functions of regression parameters. Such
confidence intervals are found by asymptotic arguments and hence computable
tight upper and lower bounds are hard to find. The principal investigator will
develop such bounds.
