This project involves a workshop of scholars expert in studying African
agricultural history and ethnography. The scholars will meet over three days to
exchange information and develop research strategies to advance the study of how
agriculture changes over time, specifically in land use as assessed by remote
sensing, and the role of generational change among farmers themselves in this
process. Broader impacts: The new knowledge to be created about the nature of
African food production will be valuable to agricultural and environmental
policy makers and planners as well as to other scholars of the topic.
