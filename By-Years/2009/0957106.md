This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor T.
Don Tilley at the University of California, Berkeley, to carry out fundamental
studies on the search for new chemical transformations that are mediated by
transition metal-main group element multiple bonds. In general, reactivity
centered on multiple metal-ligand bonds is very important, and the chemistry of
metal-silicon double bonds in silylene complexes is expected to lead to new,
useful transformations. Chemical conversions mediated by silylene complexes have
recently been found to promote the addition of hydrogen-silicon bonds to
alkenes, and a range of related transformations seem likely. The fundamental
principles established from these studies should be applicable to a range of
problems in chemistry, materials science and catalysis.

The basic research of this proposal should point the way to replacement of rare
and expensive metals such as platinum and rhodium with less abundant metals such
as iron and cobalt, in industrial catalytic processes. In general, new, more
efficient chemical transformations will enable the more efficient use of energy
and resources.
