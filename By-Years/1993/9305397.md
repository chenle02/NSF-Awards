Constructed Civil Infrastructure Systems (CCIS) is one of the largest components
of the civil engineering construction business in the United States. Development
and implementation of advanced and innovative CCIS technologies are pivotal for
maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. design and construction industries. In
particular, with a "United Western European Community (EC) " beginning in 1993,
potential high-volume business opportunities are emerging markets in previous
Soviet Block Countries. Thus, it is important to identify CCIS state-of-the-art
in Western Europe, forecast technology trends, and gain an understanding of the
highly effective R&D mechanisms being developed and used successfully by western
European countries for promoting and implementing innovation into practice in
Western Europe. ASCE's Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) and the
National Science Foundation (NSF), in conjunction with the World Technology
Evaluation Center (WTEC)/Japanese Technology Evaluation Center (JTEC), are
organizing an International Task Force trip to selected sites in Western
European countries. //
