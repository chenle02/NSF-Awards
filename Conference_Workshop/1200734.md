This award provides funding to defray the expenses of participants in a week-
long summer symposium on recent advances in real analysis that will be take
place from July 25-30, 2012, at the Berks College campus of the Pennsylvania
State University. Much of the funding will be directed toward the goal of
disseminating knowledge to and the inclusion of underrepresented minorities and
women mathematicians.

This conference is the thirty-sixth in a long-running series of real analysis
summer symposia. The past decade has witnessed a resurgence, on both the
national and international scenes, of research activity in the classical area of
real analysis, a resurgence driven in part by the ever-growing importance of
real analysis for many other mathematical disciplines. This trend is typified by
the work of the three plenary speakers at the 2012 event: Zoltan Buczolich, Emma
D'Aniello, and Yang Wang. The Summer Symposium, which throughout its existence
has attracted a large international audience, will play a central role in future
developments in the field. The conference will offer researchers the opportunity
to hear and share the newest findings in the field of real analysis.
