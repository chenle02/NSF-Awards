The Great South Channel region contains unusually abundant populations of three
endangered whale species: right, humpback and fin whales. The South Channel
Ocean Productivity Experiment (SCOPEX) will look at the physical oceanographic
and biological/ecological mechanisms responsible for these aggregations. Using
both aerial and ship-based surveys, the distribution and abundance of right
whales in the region will be determined. Detailed distributional and behavioral
observations of these animals, including data from intensive sonar and radio-
tagging studies will provide tests of hypotheses on how the aggregations form
and are maintained. A model of the energetics of right whales with regard to
r=feeding and diving behavior will be analyzed.
