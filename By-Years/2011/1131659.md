The objective of this award is to improve the power density of Proton Exchange
Membrane fuel cells using a bio-inspired design. Graphite composite bipolar
plates will be designed with complex flow paths modeled after leaf structures
and fabricated using selective laser sintering, an additive manufacturing
process that enables manufacture of the complex designs. Optimization of the
design will be based on mathematical flow models taking into account governing
mass, momentum, species and charge conservation. Experiments will be conducted
to verify accuracy of finite element analyses of power density versus pressure
distribution. Power density comparisons will be made with bipolar plates of
conventional design.

If successful, this research is expected to yield a new approach to the design
and manufacture of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells that will have more
efficient fuel transport and water removal. This could lead to more widespread
adoption of fuel cell technologies for energy conversion across a variety of
applications.
