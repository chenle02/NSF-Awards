Introduction to Molecular Biology is being offered to 24 faculty members to
improve the level of undergraduate molecular biology instruction. Participants
receive up-to-date information, hands-on training in scientific methods,
continued support to facilitate the incorporation of information into
undergraduate courses and an opportunity to conduct research. The discipline of
molecular biology is at the forefront of medical research, in agricultural
production and in solving criminal investigations. However, undergraduate
faculty at community colleges are unable to disseminate the most current
information and laboratory techniques to their students because they have had
little direct discipline renewal, and cannot keep abreast with the rapid
advances in this vital field. An intensive one-week lecture/laboratory course in
molecular biology is addressing this problem with on-site follow-up support at
targeted institutions and opportunities for research internships. The project is
being evaluated through a combination of pre- and post tests, participant
surveys and reports provided for on-site visits and internships.
