The Organic Dynamics Program will support Professor Gerald R. Stevenson's study
of "An Isotopic Probe into Bonding Changes due to Electron Addition" in the
Chemistry Department at Illinois State University. Thermodynamic isotope effects
are being obtained in order to generate a new probe into the nature of
aromaticity. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance
spectroscopy, and calorimetric techniques are being used to measure the
thermodynamic parameters controlling one and two electron transfer reactions
from reduced annulene anion radicals or dianions to neutral annulenes and
perdeuteriated neutral annulenes. The resulting thermodynamic isotope effects
will be related to changes in the aromatic nature of annulenes upon one or two
electron addition. These data will generate a new probe into the nature of
aromaticity. The "probe" will be tried on other homoaromatic annulene systems.
