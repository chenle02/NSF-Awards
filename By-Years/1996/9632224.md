Lyne AST 96-32224 This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports the
theoretical investigation of the break-up of meteoroids upon entry into the
terrestrial atmosphere. The work will improve on several of the simplifying
assumptions made in the past in atmospheric entry physics, such as material
ablation and the associated energy transfers; the effects of shock layer shapes,
densities, and pressures; the problems that arise from hyper velocities (i.e.,
velocities in excess of about 10 km/sec); and the problem of mechanical bolide
fragmentation. The Principal Investigator has unique practical qualifications
for this research. He has been a test engineer at the hypersonic wind tunnels of
the Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center (1984-85) and he has
worked on atmospheric entry of manned spacecraft on Earth and Mars at NASA's
Ames Research Center (1992). For the past two years, he has redirected his
practical experience to the theoretical and computational investigations of
terrestrial meteor entries.
