This project is important because it will significantly extend our understanding
of the impact of unions on the behavior of firms. Recent studies on the effect
of unions on the profitability of firms indicate that unions have the effect of
reducing shareholder wealth. A recent paper by the principal investigator
suggests that an unanticipated increase in new wage settlements results in an
equal reduction in shareholder wealth. The purpose of this study is to determine
how the effect of labor unions on profits influences investment decisions of
firms. This research has the potential of explaining the degree to which union
activity affects firm-investment behavior, which in turn may have altered
employment patterns and union membership in the U.S. A comprehensive model of
investment behavior will be developed which explicitly considers, among other
traditional determinants of investment, unionization and collective bargaining.
The model will be tested extensively with firm level bargaining and unionization
data, and investment and financial data.
