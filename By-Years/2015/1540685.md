Algorithms based on spectral techniques tend to be fast and to have a simple and
elegant structure; their analysis helps explain the empirically good performance
of related heuristics that are adopted in practice; and their analysis often
uncovers useful mathematical relationships between algebraic and combinatorial
graph invariants, which can have useful applications outside of algorithm
design.

The research supported by this grant explores new algorithms for cut and
clustering problems, rigorous justifications for popular spectral clustering
heuristics, and various relationships between the spectral profile of a graph
and its combinatorial properties. The PI and his collaborators will study the
use of multiple eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of a graph in the design of
clustering algorithms, they will provide rigorous analyses of clustering
heuristics based on multiple eigenvectors, and will explore combinatorial
characterizations of eigenvalue near-multiplicities. New approaches to the use
of random walks and other probabilistic processes will be explored in the design
of graph partitioning algorithms.

The PI is working on a monograph on the three related themes of sparsest cut
approximation algorithms, constructions of expander graphs, and analysis of
random walks in graphs. The three topics are closely related mathematically, but
they are pursued by largely distinct community; the monograph will emphasize the
connection and encourage researchers in each of the three areas to pursue
research in the others.
