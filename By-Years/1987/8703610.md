Analyses of simple and complex genetic loci in microorganisms continue to reveal
the presence of new and distinct regulatory mechanisms. The ilv genes of
Escherichia coli K-12 will serve as the principle focus of the proposed
research. The objectives are: 1. Identify and characterize the sequences
required for the expression and potential regulation of the promoters located in
the ilvGMEDA cluster by selecting mutants in vivo with altered expression of an
indicator gene, use nuclease Bal-31 to generate deletions in vitro, and use
standard in vitro mutagenesis techniques to generate mutants predicted to have
specific phenotypes. 2. Clone the coding sequences of the ilvD and ilvA genes to
suitable expression vectors, such as plasmid pk30 or pAS1, so that these enzymes
can be purified for in vitro studies and for amino terminal sequence analysis,
in order to compare the actual and predicted translational start sites for these
gene products. 3. Test the apparent dependence of the synthesis of the ilvO
coded 15 kd protein upon ilvG expression using ilvO-lacZ fusions on plasmids and
as single copy chromosomal forms. Isogenic strains with and without chromosomal
deletions of ilvO will be monitored for expression and regulation of the
ilvGEMDA genes. 4. Test our working hypothesis that the inhibition of cell
growth observed following arabinose induced expression of ilvO on plasmid pMC81
derivatives is due to readthrough into the closely linked rrnC cluster and the
production of anti-sense transcripts of the unique tRNA Trp gene trailer of the
rrnC cluster.
