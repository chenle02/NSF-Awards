The statistical mechanics of various dynamical systems is an important area of
research which has seen a high concentration of recent active research. The
major objective of this research is to develop estimates for physical dynamics
where the random walks contribute microscopically. These random noises will
behave differently under different scales, and therefore provide models for
various physical phenomena. The estimates to be developed will help control the
magnitude of the fluctuation fields introduced by the random noises at different
scales. It will also allow a quantification of the evolution behavior under
different scale and a better understanding of chaotic structures. Many models of
physical phenomena are being explained by the interaction of particles at the
microscopic level. Different interactions at the microscopic level lead to
different macroscopic structures. The study of these models leads to fundamental
progress in material sciences, chemical engineering and biological engineering.
This research is a continuation of the study of the random interaction between
particles in statistical mechanics.
