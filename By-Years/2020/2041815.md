A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the efficacy of
partnerships between TCUP institutions and their mainstream university or
private sector partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Indian Higher
Education Consortium (AIHEC) will organize and convene a group of TCU STEM and
Information Technology Staff to develop and incorporate cyberinfrastructure (CI)
planning into institutional planning processes. The project will recruit, train,
and support TCU faculty, IT professionals, and administrators in CI planning
efforts to support growth in STEM fields. The team will work with TCUs to
participate in planning workshop activities, which includes evaluating STEM
plans and CI needs, linking TCU teams with subject matter experts, and
facilitating the development of CI strategic plans from participating TCUs. The
project will help TCUs identify potential sources of funding and assist in the
development of competitive proposals. The aim is to foster the collaboration and
planning needed to support and strengthen TCU STEM research and education
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
