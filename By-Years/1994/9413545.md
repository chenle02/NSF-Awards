This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia acquire an
Automated Neutron Irradiation Nuclear Spectroscopy System which will be used in
research. The research activity to be supported includes research and research
training utilizing: (1) instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA),
including variations such as epithermal INAA (EINAA), cyclic INAA (CINAA) and
cyclic epithermal INAA (CEINAA), (2) radiochemical neutron activation analysis
(RNAA), and (3) radioisotope production. Neutron Irradiation/Nuclear
Spectroscopy systems allows scientists to determine the energies of neutrons and
their relative intensities by observing the gamma rays released in nuclear
reactions. Activation Analysis bombards a specimen with neutrons, where
identification is made by measuring the resulting ratio isotope.
