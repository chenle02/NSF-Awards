ABSTRACT CTS-9303695 Glicksman The proposed research focuses on the influence
of bed hydrodynamics on the heat transfer occurring at the wall of circulating
fluidized beds. It is proposed to measure the mean time of contact for a cluster
of particles at the wall and the mean distance the cluster falls prior to being
shed. The results for several different wall geometries and roughnesses will be
compared in terms of a cluster or layer stability at the wall. The mechanism of
cluster deposition and its magnitude will be observed and related to the bed
operating conditions, allowing the fraction of the wall coverage to be
determined. Experiments will be conducted on cold models to simulate the
hydrodynamics and determine the influence of bed diameter and core/wall
interactions. These results will then be extrapolated to hot beds using
previously verified cold simulation laws.
