The proposal is a request for partial support for a two-day conference to
recognize the scientific achievements of P.A.M. Dirac. The conference will take
place in Tallahassee on December 6-7, 2002. There will be lectures on various
frontier topics in physics research, many of which were strongly influenced by
Dirac's work. The conference will be of great educational value to young
scientists and the proceedings will be published by World Scientific. The funds
will be used to cover the costs of registration and travel for attending
students working in experimental or theoretical particle physics.
