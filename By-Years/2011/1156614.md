The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will host a ten-week
Computational Astronomy and Physics (CAP) Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) summer program, starting with a "beta-plus" program for
local UNC and North Carolina Central University students in 2012 followed by a
fully funded national program running for three years from 2013-2015. The CAP
Program will address the acute need for computational science training
opportunities for undergraduates, providing both hands-on seminars on
computational methods and individual research experiences involving techniques
ranging from numerical simulation to visualization to computationally intensive
data modeling to remote instrument control. Specific projects will build on UNC
faculty research efforts in astrophysics, bio/medical physics, condensed matter
physics and nanotechnology, fluid dynamics, and nuclear/particle physics.
Students will gain professional skills by preparing poster and talk
presentations and written reports, as well as by attending seminars on research
ethics, literature search strategies, and communication skills. For more
