The research includes studies designed to: relate rheology of microphase-
separated block copolymers to molecular characteristics; elucidate morphology of
polymers with a crystalline block; understand block copolymer order-order
transitions in-situ; to determine the effect of interfacial mixing on mechanical
behavior of two-phase polymer blends, engineer more effective interfaces;
prepare new ionomers and ion-containing blends; and to synthesize new
biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates by microbial fermentation, studying
morphology and structure-property relationships.
