"Mechatronics" is a strategy which involves integrating mechanical engineering,
electronic engineering and computer science into the fundamental design process,
rather than engineering each set of requirements separately. This project will
conduct an intensive summer workshop and a follow-up conference to enhance the
knowledge, skills and instructional capabilities of 40 undergraduate faculty
members drawn from institutions throughout the USA to launch and lead
interdisciplinary courses in "Mechatronics Education" at their institutions. The
workshop will illustrate how mechatronics engineering concepts can be
successfully introduced at the undergraduate level in an integrated way--from
the design of complex products to final manufacturing. The program will be
offered in the following three phases: A six-day Residential Workshop at CalPoly
(Summer '95) involving hands-on projects and demonstrations on design and
manufacturing of complex products and concurrent engineering, a two-day follow-
up session at an industrial site (Summer '96) in which participants report on
efforts to introduce new concepts at their home institutions. During a one year
follow-through phase, the participants will utilize electronic mail and
teleconference facilities to exchange ideas. The participants will be provided
with ample opportunities to gain hands-on experience with several traditional
and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes as well as concurrent engineering
tools. Lecture notes, comprehensive multi-media course material demonstrating
the equipment, software and the manufacturing processes used by the participants
during the workshop in the design and fabrication of the complex products will
be prepared and will be made available to the participants. The follow-up
activities will be in the form of a conference that will be held at an
industrial site, and industry participation will be provided through tours of
plants in the San Francisco bay area. Conference proceedings in which the
participants report on their accomplishments will be prepared as an outcome of
the workshop. Several papers will be submitted for publication, and
presentations will be made at national ASEE conferences.
