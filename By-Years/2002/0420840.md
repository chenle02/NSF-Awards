0420840 San The goal of this proposal is to establish a central metabolite
profiling facility for research and education. To achieve this goal, a
multidisciplinary research team has been assembled. Several of these team
members share the same research interests and synergistic
collaborations/interactions among the group already exist. The facility will
support a wide range of research activities, spanning across six academic
departments which include: Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Computational
and Applied Mathematics, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Biochemistry and
Cell Biology, and Chemistry. The facility will provide much needed quantitative
and analytical instrumentation for a number of biological projects. The facility
will be equipped with three major sets of instrumentation: high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with various detectors, a liquid
chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) system and a flow cytometer system with
cell sorting capability.
