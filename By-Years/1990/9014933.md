The primary goal of the proposed research is to understand and quantify the
sensitivity of tropospheric chemical processes to dynamic and chemical processes
occurring in clouds. The PI will employ satellite derived cloud data to more
accurately specify cloud properties within a comprehensive tropospheric
chemistry model, conduct a series of sensitivity studies to quantify the
influence of clouds on concentrations and chemical production rates of various
species investigate the uncertainties in tropospheric chemical processes
associated with uncertainties in cloud processes, and evaluate and improve our
ability to diagnose cloud cover using mesoscale meteorology data assimilation
systems.
