Through this project, the Cyber-Physical System Virtual Organization (CPS-VO) at
Vanderbilt University will organize the 2014 NSF CPS PI Meeting. This meeting
convenes all Principal Investigators of the National Science Foundation's (NSF)
Cyber-Physical Systems Program (CPS) for the fifth time since the program began.
The PI Meeting is to take place on November 6-7, 2014 in Crystal City,
Arlington, Virginia. The PI meeting is an annual opportunity for NSF-sponsored
CPS researchers, industry representatives, and Federal agencies' representatives
to gather and review new CPS developments, identify new and emerging
applications, and to discuss technology gaps and
barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CPS PI meeting program agenda is community-
driven and includes presentations (oral and poster) from PIs, reports of past
year program activities, and showcases/pitches of new CPS innovations and
results. The CPS meeting will report on new discoveries in the program and
provide networking opportunity between the program PI, invited researchers,
government, and industrial researchers. More broadly, the multiple technology
domains that will be discussed and research progress described including
medical, transportation, manufacturing, energy, and others are of critical
importance to the Nation.
