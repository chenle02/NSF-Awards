ABSTRACT EEC-9613968 Messing This award is to allow the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)at the Pennsylvania State University for
Particulate Materials to collaborate with the I/UCRC at Rutgers The State
University for Ceramics on research on the fundamental scientific and
engineering methodology for identifying and implementing optimal routes for
mixing particulate raw materials that impart controlled microstructure and
properties for multi-phased ceramics. The physical blending of chemically
different particulates is fundamental to a number of core industries other than
ceramics, for example, powder metallurgy, mineral processing, pharmaceuticals,
etc. The research includes processing of particulates, modeling of mixing,
processing of electronic ceramic mixtures and ceramic metal mixtures,
characterization of microstructure and properties of the resulting specimens,
and modeling of the entire processing regime. Transmission electron
microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy will be one of the major
characterization tools/techniques. ??
