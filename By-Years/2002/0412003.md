The project aims to develop robust numerical methods and a high quality
&lt;br/&gt;software package PolynPak for solving three fundamental algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;problems: the univariate polynomial AGCD (approximate greatest common
&lt;br/&gt;divisor), the multivariate polynomial AGCD, and accurate
&lt;br/&gt;multiplicity-identification/root-finding. All three problems are
under &lt;br/&gt;a common assumption in application that the given data are
empirical &lt;br/&gt;and may contain errors from measurement and rounding-off.
The methodology &lt;br/&gt;in this project consists of a two-stage approach and
the theory that, &lt;br/&gt;while GCD and multiple roots are ill-posed/ill-
conditioned under &lt;br/&gt;arbitrary perturbation, they are remarkably
insensitive when perturbations &lt;br/&gt;are structure-preserving. Therefore,
the ill-posedness can be removed by &lt;br/&gt;reformulating the problem in a
least squares setting under a structural &lt;br/&gt;constraint after calculating
the structure of AGCD and multiplicity. The &lt;br/&gt;approach in this project
may also be applicable to other ill-posed &lt;br/&gt;problems in numerical
computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is carried out in the fields of
computer algebra and &lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis where the mission is to
provide the scientific and &lt;br/&gt;industrial community with reliable
algorithms and software for solving &lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems. Since
polynomial is one of the most fundamental &lt;br/&gt;models in applied
mathematics with a wide range of applications in areas &lt;br/&gt;such as
economic equilibria, chemical reaction, image processing/restoration,
&lt;br/&gt;to name a few, developing robust algorithms and software for
polynomial &lt;br/&gt;algebra, as the objective of this project, may have
profound impact in those &lt;br/&gt;applications and in scientific computing.
