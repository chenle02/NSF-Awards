*** 9761140 McKenna This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes a novel technique for cleaning of semiconductor wafers using Acoustic
Coaxing Induced Microcavitation(ACIM). This technique relies on precisely
controlling the intensity and location of acoustic microcavitation at a
particulate site to dislodge that particulate from the wafer surface. It will be
effective for removing even sub-micron particles without damaging the wafer
substrate. ACIM is a chemical-free, environmentally friendly process operating
in a de-ionized water environment. The objective of Phase I is to establish the
feasibility of using ACIM for fine cleaning. Through detailed experiments we
will assess the performance of ACIM assisted fine cleaning of post-CMP(chemical
mechanical polishing) wafers. The experiments will study the feasibility and
provide information for prototype design during Phase II. ACIM assisted cleaning
will solve the need for cleaning without damage of precision surfaces,
specifically the silicon wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. It is a chemical
free, environmentally friendly technique for ensuring ultra-cleanliness with
precision and speed unlike other methods available today. ACIM is very cost
effective, and easy to implement in the existing infrastructure. ***
