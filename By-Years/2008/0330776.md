This award supports travel of young researchers to a School and Conference on
sources of gravitational waves to be held at the International Center for
Theoretical Physics at Trieste in September 2003. The School will provide
training for young scientists in gravitational wave theory, detector physics,
data analysis, and source modeling. The conference will focus on a general
overview of sources of gravitational waves and methods to simulate them.
Gravitational wave physics, especially the source simulation addressed by this
School and Conference, is a growing area where it is important to have the best
young people entering the field.
