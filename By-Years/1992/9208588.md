The Pacific to Arizona Crustal Experiment (PACE) is a multidisciplinary transect
which crosses an old magmatic arc, a continental rift, a transform plate
boundary, and an extensional terrane located in southern California. This award
supports a magnetotelluric survey along this transect. MT soundings, to date,
have revealed a strong correlation with detachment fault geometry east of the
Salton Trough in the Chocolate Mountains extensional terrane. Also, a regional
detachment surface postulated by seismologists has probably been detected
beneath the Peninsular Ranges.
