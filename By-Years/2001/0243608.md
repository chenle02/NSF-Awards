0243608 Kujawski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Western Michigan University to
provide a summer research experience in computer-aided testing and simulation of
mechanical components and systems for ten undergraduate students each year. This
program will take a multidisciplinary approach utilizing experimental and
numerical techniques to provide a research experience that encourages students
to consider graduate studies and pursue careers in engineering research.
Students will be recruited from colleges in the Great Lakes region and also
nationwide, with a special focus on students that do not have access to research
opportunities at their home institution and students from underrepresented
groups. Activities will include a short course on computer-aided testing and
simulation; an ethics workshop; an evaluation program; and other related
professional and social activities that will allow a fuller appreciation of
research opportunities and careers in academia. This REU Site is supported by
the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;
