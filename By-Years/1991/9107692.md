Various environmental conditions including both abiotic (wind, temperature,
water, soil, light, etc.) and biotic (micro-organisms, viruses, insects, plants
and animals) exert their influences on plants. Here, four environmental factors
have been selected for dicussion. They include abiotic (water and temperature)
and biotic (insects and plant diseases). Despite the evolution of natural
defense mechanisms, many especially food and fiber crops, still experience
serious losses every year due to environmental stress. Recently, scientists have
learned to manipulate plants to overcome some of these conditions through newly
discovered techniques such as molecular genetics and biotechnology. An important
goal of this workshop is to bring together specialists in these fields to share
their expertise with the plants scientists at the major Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU's).
