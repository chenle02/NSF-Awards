It is proposed to develop a geoenvironmental engineering facility to train
engineers in pollution control and contaminant transport in soils and other
geomaterials. Analytical equipment will be purchased for the study of reaction
and transport mechanisms and kinetics. Analytical equipment will be purchased to
study soil structure, composition and contaminant interactions, particle size
characteristics, and contaminant transport in soils.
