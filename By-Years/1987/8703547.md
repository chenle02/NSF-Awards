Steinberger will study homotopy groups of equivariant classifying spaces and
their stability properties. He and Shaneson will continue to attack the
classification of linear representations up to topological similarity. Shaneson
plans to study the local and global analysis and topology of singular spaces in
general and of algebraic varieties in particular. He also plans to continue to
work on some open questions concerning 4-manifolds. These are all central
problems in geometric topology, and some of them can be expected to migrate into
theoretical physics with an appropriate time lag, if history can be our guide.
