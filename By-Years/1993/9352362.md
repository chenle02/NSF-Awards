9352362 Martin The enormous progress in computational technology has generated a
new methodology, computational science, for learning and advancing the
traditional sciences such as physics and chemistry. We are initiating
fundamental change in undergraduate science education by providing a model for
computational-science laboratory instruction in physics and chemistry. We are
setting up a seed laboratory devoted to computational science and developing a
curriculum for computational degree options in undergraduate physics and
chemistry. The faculty involved are developing the necessary courses and course
materials and the computer hardware to implement the courses has been obtained.
The project personnel consist of interdisciplinary teams of faculty with
expertise in computational physics and chemistry education and research, and
computer science. We anticipate that results of the project will be transferable
to the national scene in science education. ***
