Excited states of atoms and molecules are present in lasers, high-temperature
plasmas, discharges and flames; the behavior of such systems is partially
governed by the structure and properties of those excited states. This proposal
examines the excited states of a variety of atoms and molecules. During the
first year the research will focus on one-electron atoms in external electric
and magnetic fields. Also, two-electron atoms and the collisions of atoms and
molecules in excited states will be pursued. The overall objective of the
research is the characterization of chaotic spectra and the relationship of
classical chaos to "quantum chaology."
