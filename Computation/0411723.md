This proposal is concerned with the approximate solution of systems of nonlinear
elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations posed on complicated
domains. Such problems are used to model a wide variety of physical phenomena in
various fields of engineering, mathematics, and science. Particular applications
considered in this project arise in chemical electrostatics, in the topological
classification of general surfaces in geometric analysis, and in semiconductor
physics. Common characteristics of such nonlinear problems presenting hurdles to
computational science include: multi-domain and time-dependent domains, multi-
scale and multi-physics, and potential loss of regularity and blowup. In this
project, the investigator plans to develop some fundamental mathematical tools
for dealing with these difficulties that will have a wide range of
applicability.

The results of this project will have a broad impact in mathematics as well as
in science and engineering. In this project, the investigator is focused on
applications in geometric analysis that are used to address fundamental
questions in geometry, and on applications to highly complex mathematical models
arising in modern biology, chemistry, and physics. However, the computational
difficulties associated with complicated, multidimensional domains and multi-
scaled, multi-physics differential equations that require new computational
approaches arise in many contexts. The methods developed here will contribute to
the advancement of numerical methods for complex three dimensional nonlinear
dynamical simulations. The simulation technology we produce will provide
exciting and powerful tools for the exploration of models in physics, chemistry,
and biology, as well as in some areas of pure mathematics such as geometric
analysis.
