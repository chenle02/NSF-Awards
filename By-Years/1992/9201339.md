The origin of the Sr-isotope anomaly spotted around 39oN and other shorter
wavelength anomalies along the axis of the MAR at 46N43N, &amp; 35N is unclear.
The P.I. proposes to analyze glasses that are already in existence for Pb, Nd,
&amp; Sr isotopes to investigate the origin of such geochemical anomalies and
generally develop models of mantle heterogeneities and dynamics along MAR and
the Azores plume.
