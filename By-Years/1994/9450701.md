9450701 Spencer Chemists investigate problems important to society in teams that
apply chemical concepts and modern technologies to answer challenging questions.
We propose to restructure the first two years of chemistry so that all students
experience directly how chemists do chemistry. We will develop, test, and
implement theme-based courses that start with important interdisciplinary
problems and use open-ended group projects to apply chemical principles and
techniques to their solution. Relevance, learning chemistry by using it, and a
cooperative learning environment will better serve students with diverse
learning styles and the non-scientists, pre-professionals, and other science
majors who comprise the vast majority in those first two years.
Interdisciplinary themes will require continuing contact with other disciplines
and with scientists in industry and government. Restructuring will require
better articulation with curricula in related disciplines and in the sequence
and content of upper-level chemistry courses. The participating liberal arts
colleges (Beloit, Carleton, Colorado, Grinnell, Hope, Kalamazoo, Knox, Lawrence,
Macalester, Rhodes, St. Olaf, Wooster) and research universities (Chicago,
Washington - St. Louis) already have experience working together on chemistry
curricular reform. By collaborating with Project Kaleidoscope, they will be able
to involve a much more diverse group of schools in making systemic and
sustainable changes in undergraduate chemistry education.
