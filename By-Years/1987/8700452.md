Major new developments in XUV and x-ray optics, with applications in a wide
variety of scientific fields ranging from x-ray astronomy to laboratory plasma
diagnostics and synchrotron radiation instrumentation are due to the improvement
in techniques for producing stable multilayers of sufficient quality. The
specific goal is to understand the basic physics of the instrumentation being
built. The construction of multilayer normal incidence optics depends on a
proper understanding of the x-ray optical properties of materials on very small
spatial scales. This problem is one of the central issues demonstrated by the
large differences between actual and theoretical performance. Three distinct
issues will be addressed: (i) continued development of techniques for the
fabrication of multilayer coatings, with the specific aim of optimizing the
procedures and materials for the production of high quality normal-incidence
optics at soft x-ray and XUV wavelengths. (ii) measurement and evaluation of
multilayer coating performance, with emphasis on achieving near-theoretical
results on figured substrates; this includes determination of material
combinations and substrate fabrication procedures which provide optimum
performance; and (iii) development of techniques for producing extremely fine
grain x-ray phosphor converting screens, as part of a program to produce a large
area, high resolution soft x-ray detector for measuring multilayer mirror
performance. Such detectors are required because of the ability of normal
incidence optics to image large fields of view with high spatial resolution.
