The purpose of this project is to continue work on slow hydromagnetic waves in
rotating geometries using multiple scale asymptotic techniques, in particular,
to extend this work to a parameter regime in which the primary force balance is
magnetostrophic rather than geostrophic as previously assumed. These waves will
also be studied for stability while incorporating the effects of ohmic and
viscous diffusion, buoyancy and differential rotation.
