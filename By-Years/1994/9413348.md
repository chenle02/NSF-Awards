9413348 Myers This award provides one-half of the funding required for the
acquisition of an electron microprobe instrument system to be installed and
operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
Wyoming. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed to
acquire the instrument. The new electron microprobe will be used in research and
teaching projects requiring accurate elemental analysis of geological samples
with microscale spatial resolution in areas such as igneous, metamorphic and
sedimentary petrology, geochemical weathering cycle and soil formation,
diagenesis in petroleum and gas bearing sediments, and mineral deposits. ***
