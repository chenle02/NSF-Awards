Abstract Berenstein 9622249 Berenstein will investigate several problems in
complex analysis and integral geometry which have applications to subjects like
computational algebra and medical imaging. The original link between these
problems lies in the use of methods from complex analysis, especially
multidimensional residues. Specific questions on the first subject include
effective bounds for the Nullstellensatz over fields of positive characteristic.
On the second, the use of wavelets and hyperbolic geometry to study,
respectively, localized versions of the Euclidean Radon transform and the
Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for the Laplace operator in the Euclidean plane. The
project involves an interplay between Pure Mathematics (complex and harmonic
analysis) and applications to several imaging and detection problems. Most
notable is the localization of the Radon transform using wavelets. We expect
that this algorithm will help to significantly decrease the radiation dosage
received by patients during CAT scans, as well as reduce processing time. The
last consideration would be especially important if it could be applied to MRI
scans and we plan to consider how to adapt our method to this widely used
medical imaging procedure also (eventually helping reduce its cost). Another
question we study is motivated by a different imaging method, Electrical
Impedance Tomography. This low resolution but very low cost procedure has
applications to Medicine as well as Material Sciences (detection of cracks).
Finally, the problems of Commutative Algebra mentioned in the proposal also
arise from engineering applications, for instance, robot motion planning and
control of distributed parameter systems.
