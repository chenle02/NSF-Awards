Standards-based reform curricula are making serious inroads in the high school
classroom. These curricula are truly different in significant ways. The content,
pedagogy, technology, and assessment of these new programs bear little
resemblance to those of only a few short years ago. Currently, colleges and
universities are graduating and certifying students to teach mathematics at the
secondary level who are not prepared to deal with the new texts and courses.
This guarantees that even new teachers from undergraduate and graduate programs
have to be retrained if their schools adopt one of the new reformed curricula.
This project is developing, field-testing, and publishing a text for a modeling
course which is intended both for majors and for future secondary school
teachers of mathematics which mirrors and models courses that future teachers
will experience in the high school classroom. The course emphasizes both how to
mathematize the problem and how to select the mathematics to use. It also makes
frequent use of technology, group and inquiry based learning, and alternative
assessments.
