The national attrition rates in first-year calculus courses continue to be very
high. This problem is exacerbated by the declining skills of high school
graduates in algebraic manipulation and trigonometry. The use of small classes
(30-35 students) makes it possible to assess individual needs better and respond
accordingly. The introduction of technology in many of these classes further
provides students with support mechanisms for their limited skills in algebra
and trigonometry. The ease in graphing and the use of computer algebra systems
encourages students to address many of their own questions. Entering students,
in most cases, have a considerable familiarity with the use of computers and
have grown up with computer games and their interactive approach to `problem
solving.` This project harnesses that approach by extending the present symbolic
algebra system capabilities to a broader use of multimedia in the classroom and
the student laboratories. The incorporation of sound, video, and animation can
provide a richer, more dynamic learning environment for students. To this end
educational authoring softwares, Authorware and Director, are being used to
create interactive multimedia presentations illustrating many of the major
concepts of calculus and differential equations for classroom demonstration and
as introductions to each of the laboratory projects involving Mathematica. This
will substantially enhance the Mathematica laboratory projects that have been
developed over the past 6 years.
