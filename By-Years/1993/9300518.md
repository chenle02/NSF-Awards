This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of the effect of corporate mergers on social solidarity
among the employees of two Silicon Valley organizations. The investigators will
collect both qualitative and quantitative data through interviews and other
means to develop and test a model of solidarity that integrates organizational
structure and performance with members' role sufficiency, sense of belonging,
affect, and attachment. The research will develop a multi-dimensional
understanding of worker commitment and organizational effectiveness, during
times when a small industrial organization is taken over by a larger one, thus
contributing both to social psychology and to the sociology of organizations. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower and the
thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
