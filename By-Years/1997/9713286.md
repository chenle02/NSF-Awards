9713286 Ataai Purification of a target protein constitutes the major fraction of
the total cost of its production. The high cost of purification often limits the
availability of such proteins, which in turn impedes studies in immunology,
vaccine development, and the production of pharmaceutical and diagnostic
reagents for human health care. Although immunoaffinity purification should
allow for purification of such target proteins, it suffers from a number of
shortcomings including high cost of the ligand, and, in some cases, strong
binding of the target protein to the antibody, which could require the use of
extremes of pH or other harsh conditions for the elution of the protein. IMAC
has shown promise for the purification of proteins fused to metal affinity
tails. Based on preliminary results, screening of combinatorial peptide
libraries may identify peptides capable of purifying target fusion proteins in
one chromatography step with high recovery, purity, and low cost. ***
