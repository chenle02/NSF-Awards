The PIs will continue comprehensive studies of mesosphere and lower thermosphere
aeronomy. This program will utilize Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) data and
optical facilities of Arecibo Observatory, a sodium/iron resonance lidar at
Arecibo on a campaign basis, and data analysis coupled with modeling/theoretical
studies conducted at Penn State. The renewal grant will cover: (1) continued
ISR/lidar observational and modeling investigations of the relationship (or
"coupling") between small-scale neutral atmosphere structure, acoustic-gravity
waves, tides and the presence of sporadic metal and ion layers; (2) temperature
dependent chemistry; (3) the origin of the 6-hour tide; (4) the complex of newly
observed short-period waves and ion layers in the 100-250km region; (5) the
origin of the (sometimes complex) ion layer structures in the 90-100km region
and their relationship to sporadic metal layers; and (6) apparent "convective"
processes as observed in the sodium and ion layers as well as in the
"background" ionosphere.***
