Dr. Grover is studying a key regulatory enzyme of plants adapted to a high
temperature, low moisture environment. The CAM plants, commonly known as
succulents, absorb carbon dioxide through stomata in their leaves only at night
where temperatures are low and water loss through these leaf openings is
minimized. Reactions of carbon fixation and metabolism are regulated on a
diurnal basis and the enzyme PEP carboxylase plays a key role here. With the
assistance of undergraduate students, Dr. Grover will determine how certain
known "regulatory ligands" bind to and control the activity of this enzyme. He
will probe the physical nature of the binding sites with chemical modification
and labeling. This study will likely lead to knowledge of new regulatory
mechanisms for enzymes of photosynthesis, an important payoff.
