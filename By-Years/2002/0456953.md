A theoretical study is proposed of a promising new approach to quantum computing
which uses the vibrational eigenstates of molecules to represent quantum bits,
and fast femtosecond infrared laser pulses shaped with optimal control to apply
quantum logic gates (i.e., to induce specific vibrational transitions). This
approach potentially meets all five DiVincenzo criteria for quantum computing
and offers the unique possibility of operation on a sub- picosecond time scale.
Current experimental techniques use feedback loops to optimize the pulse shape.
However, without theoretical guidance, experimentalists are faced with an over-
whelmingly large parameter space in which to search for optimal pulse
parameters. If pulse parameters are not carefully chosen, the experimental pulse
shape optimization procedure may not converge, or it may induce highly
undesirable transitions. The objective of this study is to provide crucial
theoretical guidance for choosing the various parameters (duration, frequency
spectrum, amplitude, etc.) of the shaped pulses. Furthermore, specific molecules
which are best for quantum logic operations are unknown and theoretical
calculations will help to choose the best candidates for experimental
consideration. Preliminary results presented in the proposal demonstrate
importance of theoretical studies for further progress in the field, support
feasibility of the approach and attest to the ability of the author to conduct
the proposed research.
