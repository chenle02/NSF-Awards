9304859 Grand This research is a continuation of a collaborative effort of four
universities to use the PASSCAL portable broad-band seismometer array facility
for a comprehensive imaging study of the lateral transitions in mantle structure
beneath the Rocky Mountain Front. Field work was completed under the first grant
and this will complete the analysis and synthesis of the data. The Front Range
of the Colorado Rockies marks the eastern boundary of heavily tectonized western
North America and the western physiographic boundary of the stable continental
interior. Earlier studies show that there is a major lateral transition in
seismic velocities across the Front Range transition, but its details are poorly
understood. Understanding this transition will provide constraints on models of
western U.S. dynamics and evolutionary models of the North American craton. ***
