ABSTRACT OPP-9614126 WELLER U. ALASKA The proposal is a request for support of a
symposium "A synthesis and analysis of the regional impacts of global change in
the western Arctic/Bering Sea". The symposium will provide a forum for
multidisciplinary discussion of the nature and magnitude of changes in the
Western Arctic/Bering Sea region as a consequence of global change through
prediction and assessment of the consequences of these changes on the physical,
biological, and socio-economic systems in the region, determination of the
cumulative impacts of these changes on the region, including assessment of past
impacts; and investigation of possible policy options to mitigate these
cumulative impacts. A series of synthesis workshops are proposed in which the
key questions and issues will be addressed. The symposium will bring together a
large number of scientists, policy-makers, and local people for the purposes of
identifying critical issues likely to be very important in understanding the
dimensions of global change on the Bering Sea ecosystem.
