9354453 Lewis The project will develop high-end workstation quality computer
graphics to aid in the visualization of concepts taught throughout an
undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The goal of the work is to focus on visual
presentations, and real-time visual manipulations, of a variety of concepts that
are included in the current chemistry curriculum. Specific projects include
3-dimensional animation sequences of atomic and molecular orbitals, 3-D views of
polymer structure and stereochemistry, videos that introduce basic
stereochemical concepts in organic chemistry, and animated sequences of crystal
structures and Miller index planes. Additional projects include other basic
organic transformations, periodic trends, and hybridization. The specific goals
of this project are to develop materials that can be used in courses throughout
the U.S. and can be readily distributed on computer disks, laser disks, and
video tapes, so that the efforts of this project can have a broad impact on the
national undergraduate and high school chemistry curriculum. ***y
