The purpose of this research is to perform additional work for the development
and conceptual evolution of Modelworld - a national research facility for
Intelligent Manufacturing. Modelworld is an evolving center at Texas A&amp;M
University whose major purpose is to fill the research voids identified in the
Committee On the Next Decade in Operations Research study. The principle intent
of Modelworld is to provide a manufacturing applications studio to researchers.
Modelworld will consist of a modern flexible manufacturing system accessible to
manufacturing researchers throughout the country via an electronic
communications link Internet. The link will connect Modelworld to other
researchers so that research information can be shared among geographically
separated researchers.
