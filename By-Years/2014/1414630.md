Many diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and others are triggered
by unusual perturbations in the expression of certain genes. The interactions
between these genes and other present in the human genome are poorly understood,
and it is not known how these interactions may be changed over time due to
abnormal gene expression. This project will focus on computationally detecting
perturbations that may lead to disease using publically available gene
expression data from human cancer cell lines, with the eventual goal of
confirming these results using experimental cell culture. This research will be
conducted in collaboration with the Dr. Hsueh Fen Juan's laboratory at the
National Taiwan University due to their expertise in computational and
experimental analysis of human disease. This research will help to understand
how these diseases begin and sustain themselves while revealing possible new
targets for pharmaceutical treatments.

The principal goal of this research is evaluate the transcriptional network
motifs that drive the initial formation of cancerous or other diseased cells,
and then discover how these motifs depend on the underlying transcriptional
context of a given cell line. Both tissue and time dependence of these motifs
will be considered to better understand the transition from normal to diseased
cells. This project will also increase the visibility of a combined
computational and experimental approach to biological problems. All new gene
expression data will be stored in the National Center of Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus. Cell lines created for experimental
validation will be distributed through cell line repositories for use by other
researchers. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National
Science Council of Taiwan.
