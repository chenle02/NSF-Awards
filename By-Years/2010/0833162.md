&lt;br/&gt;Until recently, most high-performance computing applications involved
matrix computations. However, new application areas such as computational
biology and machine learning involve constructing, computing with, and modifying
large sparse graphs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galois team at the University of
Texas, Austin has been building a system that exploits optimistic
parallelization and compiler analysis to raise the level of abstraction at which
these applications can be coded without a substantial performance penalty. The
programming model is sequential Java augmented with two constructs called
optimistic set iterators. This project brings together Galois project team
members, computational biologists and machine learning experts to extend and
evaluate the Galois system on high-end shared-memory machines and large-scale
distributed memory for applications that involve computations on large sparse
graphs. The main thrusts of the project are (i) design and implementation of
modest language extensions for supporting nested data-parallelism, (ii) porting
the existing system to distributed-memory machines, (iii) implementation of
adaptive feedback-driven parallel execution, and (iv) development of compiler
analyses to optimize execution.&lt;br/&gt;
