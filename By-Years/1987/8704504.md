A programmable hotpress and a miniclave system and testing facility for advanced
composite materials will be used to investigate thermoset and thermoplastic
polymer matrix composites. The goals of the research are to study the
manufacturing aspects of these materials and the minimization of fabriction
flaws, delaminations, and "hotspots." Samples will be fabricated, and the
manufacturing process will be investigated and optimized.
