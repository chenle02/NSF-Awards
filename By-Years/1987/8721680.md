The goal of this research is to develop accurate and efficient computational
algorithms that will enable engineers to routinely analyze transport phenomena
without relying on methods that utilize simplified physical models. In
particular, several methods to accelerate the interactive convergence of
numerical transport solutions will be examined, they include: developing the
diffusion synthetic acceleration algorithm (DSA) in multidimensional geometries,
applying a multigrid method for the acceleration on inner iterations, and
applying a "synthetic" acceleration method for the acceleration of outer
iterations. Transport process is characterized by the movement of some quantity
in an interacting medium. The transport of heat in a solid, of steam-water
mixture in a heat exchanger, or of photons in the upper atmosphere, are all
examples of transport process. Transport process can be categorized as continuum
or particle depending on whether one describe the transfer of continuum
quantities; e.g. mass, momentum, or energy, or particles; e.g. protons or
neutrons. However, if the number density of the particles are sufficiently
large, then the detailed statistical fluctuations can be smeared out so that an
approximate continuum formulation may be used; i.e. Boltzman transport equation
which for the linear case can be further reduced to a diffusion limit. The key
issue is to strike a balance between the accuracy and efficiency (cost) of doing
the computations associated with each of these formulations
