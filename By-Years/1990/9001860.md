Research will be conducted to produce a coherent system for the robust analysis
of designed experiments. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals as well as
estimators will be studied. Mixed effects and random effects models are to be
studied as well as fixed effects models. Specifically, a new analysis of
variance table with three additional "mean squares" per line will be given based
on high-breakdown, high-efficientcy estimates of effects and of scale. The new
mean squares will provide information on unusual aspects of the data. Also the
robust scale problem will be studied and robust methods for variance components
will be given. Tests for significant effects in two to the power k designs
without replication will be given. Proposed interactive dynamic graphics for
designed experiments will be evaluated.
