This grant provides the first of an expected three years of support to permit
Dr. Wallace and his colleagues to apply their mtDNA techniques to a number of
anthropological problems. It will allow continued categorization of both Old and
new World mtDNA types and provide additional information on the original
peopling and subsequent diversification of Native American populations in the
New World. Dr. Wallace will collect blood samples from various Native American
and Asian groups. These will be fractionated into cell types and lymphocytes
immortalized with EBV. The mtDNA type of each individual will then be determined
by digestion with six restriction endonucleases and the fragment types detected
by Southern blotting. Lymphoblast mtDNAs from representative individuals will be
examined in greater detail using additional restriction endonucleases, mtDNA:RNA
heteroduplexes and mtDNA sequencing. Because each individual inherits mtDNA only
from their mother, mitocondrial DNA reflects lineage in a straightforward
genetically simple way. Because because it mutates relatively rapidly it serves
an an excellent marker to trace population movement, both human and non-human
over time. For many years anthropologists have used other genetically controlled
physical traits such as tooth shape and size in a similar way to determine both
the relationships between extant populations and trace their history. mtDNA can,
in theory, do this much more effectively. One question of great anthroplogical
interest is when prehistoric humans entered the New World and where they may
have come from. Although it is known that these first inhabitants are of Asian
stock and crossed over a then-exposed Bering land bridge, the details of this
major migration are missing. Dr. Wallace's research should help to answer this
question. This research is important for several reasons. It provides a new and
extremely powerful tool for anthropological and historical research. Because the
scientists who are most expert with this technique are not anthropologists it is
important to build bridges between these two communities and this project will
help to accomplish that. Also, because, in some instances, archaeological and
linguistic data allow reconstruction of past population movements, anthropology
can provide controlled contexts which molecular biologists can use to advantage.
