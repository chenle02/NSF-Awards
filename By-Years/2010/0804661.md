In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Dennis J. Clouthier of University of Kentucky,
together with his graduate student researchers, will study the spectroscopy of
molecular radicals containing boron, arsenic or phosphorous atoms. These species
will be studied with laser-based spectroscopic methods. The goal of these
studies is two-fold: to study the electronic structure and molecular properties
of some interesting chemical species and to build-up a database of spectroscopic
fingerprints for these molecules -- a database that could be used by astronomers
or industrial process chemists interested in the chemistry in these unusual
environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The silicon electronics industry fabricates
useful devices through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. These
processes are chemically complex, and much is unknown about the actual gas-phase
chemical species involved in the deposition process. Prof. Clouthier and his
students aim to provide spectral fingerprints for a number of radical
intermediates that have been postulated to be important species in CVD process
environments. In addition, a number of the compounds of interest are interesting
targets for astronomical researchers. The graduate students mentored by
Clouthier have gone on to successful positions in the technical workforce, and
Prof. Clouthier has created a welcoming environment for undergraduate students
from other schools (e.g. Eastern Kentucky University, Oklahoma Baptist
University) in which to pursue physical chemical research.&lt;br/&gt;
