Investigations will be conducted on the implementation and use of a higher-order
metalanguage that has several applications in prototyping derivation systems.
This metalanguage is based on the logic programming paradigm but it enriches
conventional such languages by incorporating a polymorphic typing regimen,
providing the terms of a lambda calculus as data structures, using higher- order
unification for probing these data structures and including two new search
primitives for realizing hypothetical reasoning and for creating new constants
during search. The implementation problems that are raised by each of these
features have been studied and a preliminary abstract machine has been designed
for the underlying logical language. Efforts will now be devoted to a practical
realization of a programming system based on these ideas. Language and interface
design aspects will be considered to enhance the usability of the metalanguage
based on the logical language. The abstract machine will be extended to cover
the additional language features and an implementation of the overall system
will be undertaken. Experiments will be conducted with the implementation to
obtain feedback on specific design decisions pertaining to the abstract machine.
Attempts will be made to tailor the implementation to sublanguages that are
becoming of independent interest. Theoretical issues affecting the quality and
correctness of the implementation will also be examined. A particular interest
will be the study of notations for lambda terms and their relevance to
optimality in reduction.
