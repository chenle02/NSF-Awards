The National Zoological Park, a component of the Smithsonian Institution,
proposes transforming three traditional zoo exhibit buildings into centers for
informal science learning. Based on current knowledge about learning, the
proposed project will feature interactive elements as well as the greater use of
human interpreters to help visitors examine animals, handle objects and play
games. The project is to be a collaborative effort by the National Zoological
Park, the Dallas Zoo and Zoo Atlanta, with the National Zoo developing the
materials and making and shipping copies to Dallas and Atlanta as centers for
tryout and evaluation, with the results of the studies going to other zoos in
way of encouraging them of the importance of interactive science education.
