This research will develop novel biomaterials with unique properties including
self healing and bio-recognition that will be assembled into biomimetic
structures, by utilizing biosynthetic hydrogels derived from polyethylene glycol
(PEG) that covalently crosslink to produce materials with highly controlled
physical properties. In order to enable PEG functional substitution, PIs will
develop a method that provides multiple chemical arms on a PEG polymer and
hydrogel. Through an interdisciplinary team including materials scientists and
engineers, biomaterials will be developed that provide an integrated
sensor/actuator technology platform for designing a system with multi-scale
unique properties. This bio-inspired sensor/actuator technology can be employed
in numerous applications ranging from biomedical to civil applications. This
novel material and engineering design will be applied to the development of a
nervous system for self-monitoring, self-diagnostics, and self-healing of civil
structures, including bridges and high rises. The proposed sensor/actuator
platform technology can have extensive applications in medicine, security, and
infrastructure systems. Given the research team composed of three universities,
this will enable cross-institution educational programs. Furthermore, with the
award winning summer camps for the middle and high school students and teachers
at the University of Denver, this research will bring new and exciting projects
to these outreach programs.
