ABSTRACT ESI-9453830 Teodoro Halpern Building Bridges for Cooperation in
Physics Education Forty participants from the United States will attend the
Fifth Inter-American Conference on Physics Education. These participants include
20 high school physics teachers and 20 physics faculty from 2- and 4-year
undergraduate institutions. The goal of the conference is to build bridges for
cooperation among physics educators in the Americas and Caribbean and extend
networks which were established through previous Inter-American Conferences on
Physics Education. The particular emphasis of this conference will better
prepare teachers from the United States to teach students of the "emerging
majorities". The conference design includes simultaneous translators at the
conference and translation of the conference's papers from the original
language. The papers will be grouped by grade level and published in booklet
form for use by elementary, high school and university teachers. The conference
will be held at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas on July
17-22, 1994.
