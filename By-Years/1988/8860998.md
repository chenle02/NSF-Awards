The Data Structure Machine, a massively parallel computer is used as a basis
for implementing a nested relational database system. Nested relational database
are formed by relaxing the First Normal Form (1NF) requirement that was imposed
on relational databases. As a result, values can be complex objects instead of
atomic values we associate with the relational model. Object oriented databases,
engineering and graphics applications, and image analysis can all benefit from
an efficient nested relational database implementation. The Data Structure
Machine (DSM) is a particularly good candidate for a nested relational database
computer. The scaling properties that the simple tree-base connection topology
provide, will allow the DSM to grow to a massive degree of parallelism. Further,
the DSM is optimized to exploit locality within data structures. A serial nested
relational database will maintain the locality properties that the DSM exploits.
