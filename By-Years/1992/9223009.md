A 3D digital audio signal processing system, a 3D tracking system, adapters for
wireless network technologies capable of position location (radio, infrared),
six notepad computers, one workstation, and bus expansion boxes to connect
peripherals to the requested workstation and existing computers shall be
obtained in this project. This equipment will be dedicated to support research
in the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Laboratory and the Mobile Computing
Laboratory, both within the Department of Computer Science at Columbia
University. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
in particular: development of "hybrid user interfaces'' that merge 2D and 3D
displays and interaction devices; design of "augmented realities'' in which the
surrounding physical world is annotated with knowledge-based 3D graphics;
development of virtual worlds for multivariate data visualization; invention of
methods for ``bandwidth aggregation'' achieved by combining distinct wireless
network channels into a single high-speed channel; and development of means by
which application programs can sense their location and ``localize,''
customizing themselves to their physical surroundings.
