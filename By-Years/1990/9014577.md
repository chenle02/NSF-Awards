The distribution, ecology, and taxonomic variations of contemporary patterns of
ornamental and ritual plant species are the observable end product of no longer
observable and often poorly documented prehistoric and historic processes. These
patterns provide a solid framework for reconstructing the past and for
interpreting current human-environmental relationships. Although ornamental and
ritual flora have often been noted as important elements in the cultures of
modern Mexico and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, they have not been studied
extensively. This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on the
complex of culturally significant flora in four ecologically and economically
distinct Yucatecan Mayan communities. Among the plants to be studied are
Yucatecan species, pre-Columbian domesticates, colonial-era introductions and
species that have been incorporated more recently. The researcher will survey
housegardens to determine species and cultivars present, observe ceremonies to
determine plant species used, and interview gardeners and ceremonial
participants. This biogeographical study will contribute to a fuller
understanding of Mayan ethnobotany and culture. In addition, it will address
more general questions of plant domestication and human ecology. The project
also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to
continue to develop independent research skills.
