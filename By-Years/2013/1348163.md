University of California-Davis doctoral student Lajos Szoboszlai, under the
guidance of Dr. Martha Macri, will investigate the processes and outcomes of
adult language acquisition in the absence of a community of native speakers. The
research will be conducted with an adult tribal member who is learning his
ancestral language Mutsun, a Costanoan language traditionally spoken in Northern
California, using a grammar, a dictionary, and a few pedagogical materials.
Szoboszlai will identify how language accessed solely through these documentary
materials influences what structures are learned, which are simplified, and
which are modified by speakers. Since most of what is known about second
language acquisition is based on learning in a classroom or through emersion in
a robust speech community, the results of this project will provide brand new
insights on the process of adult language acquisition.

Lajos Szoboszlai will employ qualitative analysis to conduct this longitudinal
study. His database will consist of e-mails, semi-structured interviews, and 77
hours of audio-recordings of tutoring sessions with the tribal member. This data
will be coded to allow for tracking of acquisition of particular grammatical
forms. The many efforts underway by indigenous communities trying to revive the
use of traditional languages offer an opportunity to investigate the learning
process and the effects of this specific learning environment for language
change.

The repurposing of language documentation materials as reflected in this project
reflects the importance of high-quality language documentation for endangered
language communities. It is only with such materials that worldwide linguistic
diversity can be maintained and that communities can hope to regain use of their
ancestral languages
