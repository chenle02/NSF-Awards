This project is concerned with intelligent structures, structures with highly
distributed actuators, sensors, and processing networks. The goal of this type
of instrumentation is to enhance noise , vibration and motion control of the
structure. This research focuses on piezoelectric films and shape memory alloys
for use as actuator and/or sensor elements of an intelligent structure. Examples
of some of the potential application areas of intelligent structures include
active noise and vibration control in large space structures, turboprop
aircraft, transportation vehicles, artificial heart valves, and lightweight
robotic manipulators. This project also addresses research in the development of
new and better control algorithms using digital signal filtering techniques.
Specifically, effort is focused on the development of a multi input/multi output
active control systems with adaptive capabilities to enable the controller to
track changes in the motion, vibration, or acoustic response of a structure and
instantaneously apply the appropriate compensation.
