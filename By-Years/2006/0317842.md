Under the direction of Dr. John Singler, Mr. William Haddican will conduct
fieldwork for his doctoral dissertation. He will interview residents of the
Basque town of Oiartzun in the local language, Basque. This research will
investigate whether important social changes in the Southern Basque Country over
the last two centuries have led to grammatical change in local Basque dialects.
Mr. Haddican will use quantitative methods to assess the influences of Spanish
and Batua, the new linguistic standard, on the local dialect. He will also study
how the linguistic practices of speakers are connected with their identities,
language attitudes, and the sociopolitical context of the contemporary Basque
Country. The present study capitalizes on a rare opportunity to study the
effects of standardization on language at the earliest stages.

This project will contribute to the understanding of social constraints on
grammatical borrowing. The project is also of practical relevance to Basque
language planning efforts, in that it explores how local dialects are changing
and what social factors bear on these processes of change. A more thorough
understanding of these processes may inform current language planning strategies
in the schools and the media, and thereby contribute to efforts to preserve
linguistic diversity more generally. The results of this study will be made
available both on-line and in Basque and international print publications.
