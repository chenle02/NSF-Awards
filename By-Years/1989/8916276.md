This research is to study the detail of the uppermost mantle beneath the
Tibetan Plateau, the Tarim Basin and the Tien Shan using broadband, regional
distance body waves. The details of the upper mantle lid, such as depth to the
low-velocity zone, velocity gradient below the Moho and the lateral variability
of the lid, can provide very important constraints on the dynamics of the uplift
of the Tibetan Plateau. Preliminary work based on long-period body waves has
shown that they can be used to constrain the velocity gradient beneath the Moho
and depth to the low-velocity zone. This work will analyze the regional phases
of earthquakes which have crossed the plateau and surrounding regions as
recorded on the broadband Chinese Digital Seismic Network. Although the network
has only been operational since mid-1986, the broadband nature of the recording
allows modeling which has not been possible before. Because this involves the
structure of an active seismic area, the work is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
