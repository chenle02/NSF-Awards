This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will yield a new heat
flow or differential temperature sensing technology that will fundamentally
improve micro-calorimeters and other instruments that depend on temperature
measurement or control. The activity will complete the detailed design and
fabrication of a new type of heat flow sensor having 10 to 100 times greater
sensitivity than currently available thermopile and Peltier devices. The new
"Micro Fabricated Silicon Thermopile Sensor" employing patented technology will
be optimized for use in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter designed
specifically for the study of biopolymers in dilute solution. A DSC test
platform will be constructed for the evaluation of prototype MFST sensors and
the performance of the MFST-DSC will be compared to existing Bio-DSC
instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-throughput screening approaches are
ubiquitous in the pharmaceutical industry as part of the drug discovery process.
The new MFST sensor will be critical to the development of high throughput bio-
calorimeters with sufficient sensitivity to address applications in drug
discovery, diagnostics, cell screening, and other practical health care
applications. &lt;br/&gt;
