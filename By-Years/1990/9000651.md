Professor Richard W. Holder and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of New Mexico are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from design of inorganic and
organic films for chemical sensors to study of reactions in molecular beams.
Early contact with research directors will enable participants to choose a
research project and prepare for the summer's work prior to the start of the
program. Students will give a presentation regarding their proposed work during
their first week on campus.
