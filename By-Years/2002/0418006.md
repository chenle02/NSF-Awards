Professor A. L. Crumbliss of Duke University will investigate biological iron
transport mechanisms. The research plan will employ in vitro methods to probe
the mechanism of iron transport mediated by bacterial Fbp and mammalian Tf
proteins. Natural processes have evolved to efficiently sequester, transport and
store iron, and studies of iron speciation, coordination, and ligand exchange
will contribute to unraveling the details of biological iron manipulation.
Multiple techniques will be employed to monitor the dynamics of iron transport,
and MALDI-TOF SUPREX will be used to determine binding affinities. The working
hypothesis that reduction of Fe(III) promotes release of iron from transferrin
will be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural processes have developed to control
the uptake, transport and storage of iron. Iron manipulation is essential in
many biological sytems. This project will probe fundamental inorganic chemical
reactions that regulate iron mobility in selected proteins and small molecules.
