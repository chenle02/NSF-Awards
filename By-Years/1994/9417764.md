9417764 Carlson This project will apply the novel technology of high- resolution
computed X-ray tomography to the quantitative analysis of metamorphic textures,
with the aim of identifying mechanisms of metamorphic reactions and quantifying
their rates. High resolution and ultra-high- resolution X-ray tomographic
imagery of porphyroblastic and non-porphyroblastic rocks will be digitally
processedp and analyzed to gather comprehensive data on the spatial disposition
and size distribution of crystals. Successful completion of this project will
permit calculation of actual rates of fundamental metamorphic processes
including rates of crystal growth. Knowledge of crystal growth rates will
ultimately lead to a more precise quantification of P-T-time paths, better
constrained rates of tectonometamorphic processes, and estimates from textural
data of rates of heating and influx of chemically reactive fluids in appropriate
metamorphic rocks.
