This is a proposal submitted under Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER), employing laboratory methods to explore the feasibility of
experimentally testing theoretical propositions developed through computer
simulations. It will investigate the behavior of human subjects in a social
dilemma in which they must choose between contributing to or withdrawing from a
common fund, testing hypotheses concerning the classic problems of the free
rider and the evolution of cooperation. Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1)
Serial consistency in observed contribution will be smaller when the associated
outcomes are negative and larger when they are positive. (2) The observed
contribution rate increases with the rate of contribution by the simulated
group. (3) The second hypothesis holds only in a public-goods condition and not
in a private-goods condition. This is preliminary work that develops novel
ideas, applies a new approach, and opens a new research area. Whatever the
outcome of the three hypotheses, it will make a significant contribution in two
ways. First, it will link the two methodologies of computer simulation and
laboratory experimentation with human subjects, which can then be adopted by
other researchers. Second, it will demonstrate that a promising set of new
theoretical developments can be assessed empirically, thus opening the door to a
number of valuable studies by other investigators.
