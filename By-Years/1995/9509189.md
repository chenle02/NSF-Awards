9509189 Auer One group of plant hormones, the cytokinins, influence many
fundamental aspects of plant growth including shoot, root and leaf development.
The active cytokinins in the plant are delicately regulated by complex enzymatic
metabolism pathways which also control cytokinin transport, storage and
inactivation. While single-gene plant mutants have been used to study the
biochemistry of other plant hormones, no cytokinin metabolism mutants have been
reported in higher plants. In this project, Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin
metabolism mutants will be selected using a combination of biochemical and
visual screening procedures. The cytokinin metabolism mutants will be used in
plant physiology, biochemistry, plant development and genetic experimelts. In
the future, this research will allow the genetic control of cytokinins within
plants and the modification of agricultural crop plants to increase sustainable
productivity.
