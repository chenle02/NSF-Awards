Sherwood Richers is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of
California, Berkeley. He will perform computer simulations of the effect of
subatomic particles called neutrinos on material ejected during the merger of
two neutron stars. The treatment of neutrinos remains one of the biggest sources
of uncertainty in modeling these events. Results from this research will allow
astronomers to understand how heavy elements are formed in binary neutron star
mergers, which are sources of gravitational waves. Along with this research,
Richers will conduct astronomy outreach to high school and college students in
Central America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will incorporate key
physical processes, including neutrino transport, collisions, and flavor
transformation, into existing large-scale computer codes used for modeling
neutron star mergers. The central thrust of the project is a rigorous treatment
of the impact of neutrino flavor transformation on merger ejecta. Including this
critical missing process in models will permit a thorough interpretation of
light curves from binary neutron star mergers, and allow a better understanding
of heavy-element nucleosynthesis in such mergers. This project advances the
goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
