122010009 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Interdisciplinary Title: Improvement of
a Science Teaching Center for Pre-Service Teachers Science instruction at the
secondary level must change if we expect to improve the level of science
literacy in the U.S. Many students now age 13 will be the consumers of science-
based technological advancements in the year 2061 and beyond! Furthermore, a
science teacher who graduates in 1995 may not retire until the year 2030. With
this in mind, it is essential that pre-service teachers learn to use the most
current classroom technology. This project is the upgrading of the Science
Teaching Center (STC). The courses which use this laboratory emphasize hands-on
activities in a laboratory of 15 computers and other demonstration equipment.
Faculty work with pre-service science education majors to better prepare them
for entry into the modern science classroom. Three courses (SED 307, SED 308,
and seminars for SED 408) are targeted in this proposal. Each of four activity
centers in the STC are being furnished with two networked computers. Five
computers are being placed in the student work area, and two computers are being
placed in the curriculum library. Data collected by the pre-service students is
stored and displayed on the networked computers. These data are the basis for
increasing the students' understanding of science concepts and how to teach
these concepts to students in grades 7-12. The STC is also being furnished with
computer accessories (i.e., transparency adaptor, MacHandwriter pen input pad,
color scanner, color printer, and nView LCD projector), commonly found in
secondary schools. Project evalu ation includes usage of the facility, student
surveys of student perception of the impact on their learning and preparation
for teaching, and follow-ups of the students in their field and teaching
experiences. The outcome of this project will be disseminated through
presentations at professional meetings and in educational journals.
