This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides a
unique opportunity for collaborative research in plant genome and agricultural
biotechnology for a diverse group of US graduate and undergraduate students. The
students will investigate gene function in plants exposed to five major abiotic
stressors (drought, salinity, heavy metal lead, low and high temperature). In
each of the three award years, five students will be selected from East Carolina
University (ECU) and nearby historically black institutes, including local
community colleges, in North Carolina. These students will be trained at the ECU
PI's laboratories and then travel to China to conduct field and laboratory
research at the Henan Institute of Sciences and Technology (HIST) for six
weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IRES project will impact a broad scientific
community within the US and internationally. The diverse group of students, from
2- and 4- year undergraduate and graduate programs, will receive international
mentoring and research-based education. Recruitment from historically black
universities and local community colleges in North Carolina with large
disadvantaged populations will ensure a diverse student group. Through the
proposed student research program in China mentored by Chinese scientists, this
IRES project will provide students with unique opportunities to become globally-
engaged scientists and to build their international scientific networks.
