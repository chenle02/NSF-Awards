0115311&lt;br/&gt;Cundari&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports
U.S.-India cooperative research entitled "Novel Approaches to Quantum Modeling
of Chemical Systems. Professors Thomas Cundari, University of Memphis and
Shankar Bhattacharyya, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science will
collaborate on developing genetic algorithms for use in molecular modeling.
Novel soft computing techniques - genetic algorithms, neural networks, and fuzzy
logic - for solving the Schroedinger wave equation for chemical systems will be
developed, refined and implemented. Further development and application of such
algorithms are important in creating efficient computation of molecular
properties in realistic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The international
collaboration will exploit the synergy between the US and Indian research
groups. The expertise of the Indian team in algorithm development and genetic
algorithms will complement the US team's strengths in other branches of soft
computing and the chemical applications. This project will promote mutual
benefits with respect to scientific exchange and graduate student development.
The project is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and
the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology. &lt;br/&gt;
