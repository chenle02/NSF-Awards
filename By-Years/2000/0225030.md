WAMC Northeast Public Radio (WAMC) will produce, air, and distribute a series of
segments on its radio programs 51% and The Best of Our Knowledge that will draw
material from projects funded by the NSF Program for Gender Equity in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The show 51% is dedicated to coverage of issues
affecting women. The Best of Our Knowledge is devoted to coverage of issues and
topics related to education, educational policy, innovation, and research. The
program segments will place a national spotlight on gender equity in STEM,
specifically in the areas of high school, undergraduate, teacher and faculty
development, and educational technologies. They will be delivered in multiple
media formats: radio, CD, tape, and the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WAMC's long-
term goal is to play a pivotal role in the national effort to broaden the
participation of women and girls in STEM education and workforce. In the
shorter-term, WAMC's goals are: 1) to significantly expand education and
awareness of targeted audiences and the general public about research and
strategies to improve education policies and practices; and, 2) to enhance the
image of the STEM professions and their practitioners so that the image is
positive and inclusive of women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the project
will be: a set of quality radio programs for multiple uses, targeted nationwide
distribution, new segments within WAMC's regular programming, and new
collaborations between a media organization and women' groups, major science and
education institutions engaging in research and demonstration projects, high
schools, government agencies, trade associations, and private
foundations.&lt;br/&gt;
