This project will host a MARGINS workshop in April 2009 in Charleston, SC. The
main purpose of the workshop is to 1) integrate the research results from
studies from the Rupturing Continental Lithosphere (RCL) initiative of MARGINS,
primarily from studies conducted in the Dead Sea and the Gulf of California, and
2) to plan future lithospheric extension initiatives. Comparing of results from
these two near-endmember focus sites will help develop new perspectives on
rupture processes. Discussions among researchers mediated by this workshop will
provide a healthy venue for intellectual exchange and thus better assure that
the goals of the RCL initiative are achieved.

Broader Impacts: The workshop will involve an international community of
researchers from academia and industry who are recognized experts of the Gulf of
California rift system. The workshop will facilitate cross exchange and dialogue
amongst these participants, which will be vital for planning future research
efforts and analyses. The workshop conveners will compile a progress report that
summarizes the accomplishments of the RCL program.
