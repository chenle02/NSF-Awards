participants to a 3-day workshop to be held in Pusan, Korea. This U.S.-Korea
Joint Workshop is about Smart Infrastructural Systems. Objectives of the
workshop are to assess the current state of theory and practice and to foster
communication across a variety of technical disciplines representing theoretical
and experimental research as well as design, for a broad range of applications;
to stimulate future cooperative research and development in subjects of common
need and importance; to evaluate the results of Korea's civil infrastructure
research program and their practical application to U.S. engineering practice;
and to continue to build the long-term bilateral scientific
relationship&lt;br/&gt;
