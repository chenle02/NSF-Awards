The purpose of this project is threefold: development and analysis of fast,
randomized, easily parallelizable algorithms, study of average behavior and
limiting distributions for eigenstatistics of large random matrices (which is
crucial in understanding the performance of numerical algorithms), and software
development for symbolically and numerically computing eigenstatistics of random
matrices. To this extent, the investigator will use tools from numerical linear
algebra, orthogonal polynomials theory, probability, perturbation theory, and
combinatorics.

Numerical linear algebra and stochastic eigenanalysis (classically known as
random matrix theory) are mathematical fields with deep and various connections
to sciences and engineering, as well as wide and far-reaching applications. One
such application is randomized high-performance computing. At a time when an
industrial-sized problem is being defined by six or more digits, the
astronomical rate of increase in computer processing speed does not compensate
for the far slower growth of memory speed; as a result, the processor-memory gap
is increasing -- a fact which is now the main obstacle to improved computer
performance. Randomization offers a way to successfully address this issue. The
project focuses on "transplanting" methods of numerical linear algebra to the
study of stochastic eigenanalysis, and using the theoretical results thus
obtained for the development of high-performance computational algorithms, as
well as in other applications such as the study of Internet networks, building
more reliable cell phone networks, and so on. The project also includes several
educational endeavors, including initiation of a series of public lectures held
at University of Washington to showcase applications of mathematics to sciences,
economy, etc. and increasing female participation in undergraduate mathematical
competitions.
