This research is to 1) determine earthquake paleoliquefaction features and
landforms where they occur by means of remotely- sensed data, including LANDSAT
Thematic Mapper and SPOT Panochromatic images, and 2) provide new information on
the ages and locations of past earthquake in the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ).
Focussing o known liquefaction features identified during previous field work,
the work will compare possible prehistoric sand blows to those that formed
during the great 1811-12 New Madrid earthquakes. Radiation characteristics
unique to the possible prehistoric features will be used to locate other
possible prehistoric sand blows. The results of this analysis will be verified
by field investigation at selected sites. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported under the NSF
Career Advancement Award program for women.
