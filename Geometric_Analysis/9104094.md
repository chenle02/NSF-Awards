Professor Stanton's research project will apply noncommutative harmonic
analysis and operator determinants to gain an understanding of holomorphic
torsion on Hermitian locally symmetric manifolds. This effort, in collaboration
with H. Moscovici, will focus on the current phase of the project which is to
construct zeta functions associated to general rank spaces and to evaluate their
special values in geometric terms. Another project, begun jointly with A. Knapp,
will investigate certain differential operators on globally symmetric manifolds.
This project will attempt to give a representation theoretic characterization of
the solution space of these operators thereby resolving a conjecture of Vogan. A
manifold is a generalization to higher dimensions of a smooth two dimensional
surface. For example, the curved space-time continuum is a four dimensional
manifold. Professor Stanton's research is aimed at understanding these geometric
objects by exploiting connections with certain partial differential equations.
