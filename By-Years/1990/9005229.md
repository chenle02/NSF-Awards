This award provides funding to upgrade the automation of an old, but
serviceable, X-ray spectrograph operated in the Department of Geology-Geography
at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. The instrument is the backbone of
the Regional X-Ray Analytical Facility at the University of Massachusetts which
serves the research needs for multi-element chemical analysis of rocks and
minerals of the geochemistry community in much of New England.
