This project will build information retrieval interfaces for the
rapidly&lt;br/&gt;expanding but virtually unstudied domain of biodiversity
databases. An&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the nature and magnitude of biological
diversity is fundamental to most pressing environmental and conservation
debates. Biodiversity databases contain organism-related information such as
distribution, taxonomy, natural history, and conservation data. This project
will combine information visualization techniques and rapid feedback dynamic
query interfaces coupled with an aggressive approach of working with
representative users at all levels, from design through evaluation. It will also
utilize zoomable interfaces to allow users to navigate multiple hierarchies, in
order to visually accommodate highly interconnected data. The goals of the
project are: &lt;br/&gt; * To develop a searching interface for biodiversity
databases &lt;br/&gt; targeting domain-novice adults. &lt;br/&gt; * To build
interfaces combining "folk" and "scientific" understanding. &lt;br/&gt; * To
evaluate the developed interfaces and compare them to existing &lt;br/&gt;
interface models in the biodiversity domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
