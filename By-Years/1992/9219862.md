This award will provide one-half the funds required for the acquisition of a
thermal ionization, solid-source mass spectrometer to be installed and operated
in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University, St.
Louis. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds that will be
needed for the acquisition. The instrument will be used primarily in a research
program utilizing state-of-the-art techniques in isotope dilution, uranium- lead
geochronology and hafnium isotope measurements in zircons. The scientific
purpose of the measurements is to understand the formation of the continents
during the evolution of Earth's crust through geologic time.
