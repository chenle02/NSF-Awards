Professor Fleming and his coworkers have discovered that cyclic nitrile anions
generated in tetrahydrofuran or toluene can be selectively alkylated
intramolecularly to generate trans- and cis-decalins, respectively. They will
apply this discovery to the syntheses of two decalin containing clerodane
natural products. With the help of his collaborator, Professor Madura,
computational modelling of the structures of the metallated nitriles which
participate in these reactions will be investigated. Lastly, the PI will
generate chiral metallated nitriles and investigate their enantioselective
intramolecular alkylation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Fraser F.
Fleming of the Department of Chemistry at Duquesne University. Professor Fleming
along with his collaborator, Professor Jeffrey D. Madura, and their students
will study the structures and reaction chemistry of a class of molecules known
as nitrile anions. Intramolecular carbon-carbon bond forming reactions of these
nitrile anions will be used to construct two naturally occurring diterpenes,
strigillanoic acid and epi-strigillanoic acid. Nitriles which can be metallated
on the carbon next to the nitrile functional group will then be used in
enantioselective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions called intramolecular
alkylation reactions. These alkylation reactions produce cyclic molecules which
are chiral (have two nonsuperimposable mirror images) and make only one of the
two possible forms (a single enantiomer). Development of this family of
reactions is one of the most important problems facing the pharmaceutical
industry today. Students trained during the course of this work will gain skills
in computational chemistry and organic synthesis. These skills are needed by the
pharmaceutical and speciality chemicals industries.
