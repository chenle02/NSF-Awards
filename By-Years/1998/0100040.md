Theory revision is the correcting of a given, roughly correct
rule,&lt;br/&gt;also known as a concept or theory. This problem arises
frequently in&lt;br/&gt;machine learning, for instance, when the initial output
of an &lt;br/&gt;expert system is not correct, and when the machine
learning&lt;br/&gt;problem is too large or too complex to solve from scratch,
and an&lt;br/&gt;approximately correct rule is needed to jump-start the
learning&lt;br/&gt;process. There has been considerable ad hoc building of
theory &lt;br/&gt;revision systems, but the theory is poorly understood. This
research&lt;br/&gt;investigates fundamental mathematical possibilities and
limitations&lt;br/&gt;of efficient theory revision. It is hoped that as a result
of&lt;br/&gt;this research, theory revision in computational learning theory
will&lt;br/&gt;emerge as a general framework for the study of learning
situations&lt;br/&gt;where a large amount of initial information is available
or&lt;br/&gt;necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the PIs investigate
the following areas: extensions&lt;br/&gt;of their previous work on
propositional logic theory revision&lt;br/&gt;with queries, relations to
certificate complexity and&lt;br/&gt;attribute-efficient learning, revision
problems for predicate logic&lt;br/&gt;representations, and both the learning
and revising of categorial &lt;br/&gt;grammars.
