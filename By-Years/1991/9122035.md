In the phase II work proposed research we will determine the overlapping
relationships between-10,000 clones from a cosmid library derived from
partially-digested, chromosome-sorted human DNA. This information will allow the
creation of an ordered chromosome specific library. This library, and others to
follow, will be indispensable tools for the human genome mapping and sequencing
project. The phase II work will create an ordered cosmid library as well as
kits, devices, and instruction manuals that can be used by other investigators
to accomplish the same result on segments of DNA as large as entire human
chromosomes. The phase II work involves cross-hybridization of the inserts from
a large number of cosmid clones to each other independently in all combinations
using the "pen-line" method developed in phase I work. The "pen-line" method
allows discrete hybridization of all cloned DNAs separately and independently to
all probes generated from the same set clones and, therefore, allows for
simultaneous determination of the overlap between all clones in the set. The
method is several fold faster than current repeatable protocol. In phase II
work, we propose to use the method on an overlapping clone library derived from
chromosome 20.
