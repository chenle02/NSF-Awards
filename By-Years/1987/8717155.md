The goal of this research is to understand aspects of the origin, structure,
and dynamics of the universe, by examining the physics of the very early
universe, near the Planck time. The techniques used come from quantum and
statistical field theory in curved spacetime. The complete quantum theory of
gravitation unified with the other interactions is unknown, so that these
techniques are the best available at present.
