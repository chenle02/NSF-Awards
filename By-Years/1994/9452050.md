9452050 Howland The proposed state-of-the-art computer laboratory will support
an innovative new laboratory computer science course for students majoring in
disciplines other than computer science, especially education majors who intend
to teach science at the secondary level. This new course concept implements a
contained laboratory that uses a breadth first rather than depth first approach
to cover a broad range of computer science topics at the introductory level. The
computer is studied as a phenomena, not just a tool yielding a non-classical but
effective approach to instilling basic computer concepts in non-science oriented
students. Finally, the course uses the Scheme programming notation as a lingua
franca to describe computer science topics, build working models of computer
science constructs and perform laboratory experiments without being a course
which focuses primarily on teaching programming.
