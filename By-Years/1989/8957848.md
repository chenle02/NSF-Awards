This work will research the requirements for intelligent design and
manufacturing systems and produce models of such systems. These will aid
engineers from conceptual design through preliminary design, and on to detail
design, providing an expandable platform which can be used throughout the
product's life-cycle. The models will include geometric as well as non-
geometric information, such as manufacturing and supportability requirements.
The following areas will be studied as they relate to this project: Design
theory and methodology. Object- oriented/feature-based product models.
Engineering design decision making. Man/machine interfaces. Knowledge-based
information systems. Design for manufacture. Prototype systems will be produced
and tested using industrial input as to their veracity.
