This project will examine in detail the compositional, mineralogical, and
textural changes that occur at these horizons in the intrusion where a new pulse
of magma has been injected. It is hoped that the data collected will provide new
insights into the nature and extent of the magma mixing that occurs when a new
pulse of primative magma is injected into a chamber that contains a pre-existing
more-evolved magma. The date may also help to establish some minimum values for
the thicknesses of crystal-liquid mush zones along the crystallization front in
magma chambers, and/or provide some minimum distances for interstitial-melt
migration in rapidly cooled plutonic rocks
