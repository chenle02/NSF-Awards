This award establishes a Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Biological
and Environmental Nanotechnology at Rice University. The Center will foster the
development of nanotechnology through an integrated set of programs that aim to
address the scientific, technological, environmental, human resource,
commercialization issues. The Center's research program is organized under three
themes: (1) wet nanoscience integrating biology and nanochemistry; (2)
nanomaterials in bioengineering; and (3) environmental applications, origin and
impacts of nanostructured materials. Fundamental questions concerning how in
organic materials interact with biochemical and cellular processes will be
investigated. The research will also address the applications of nanomaterials
to biomedical and environmental problems. The Center will work in collaboration
with industry and government laboratories in developing bench-top and pilot
scale proof-of-concept testbeds. A multi-user nanoparticle fabrication facility
will be established with state-of-the art instrumentation. The research outreach
will include the University of Texas Health Science Center and Geoscience and
Environmental Laboratory of CNRS, France. The Center will foster nanoscience and
engineering education by implementing course modules for upper level
undergraduates, publication of a new textbook, and creating of an interactive
web page. The education outreach activities will include training of middle and
high school teachers in nanoscience and engineering. The Center will offer
lectures and tutoring, experience in research laboratories and a sabbatical
semester to focus on integrating their experiences into their teaching. The
industrial affiliate program will enable member companies to send their senior
scientists to the Center for research residency and tutorial courses. The Center
will offer a year-long team taught graduate course on entrepreneurship in
nanotechnology.
