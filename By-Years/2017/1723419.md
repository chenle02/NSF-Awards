The ATE Collaborative Outreach and Engagement (ACOE) project will implement a
strategy and plan to raise awareness of the National Science Foundation's
Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, the centers and projects the
program funds, and the valuable resources these grantees develop. This awareness
will help build partnerships and collaborations, disseminate innovative ATE
resources, and create synergy around the program's efforts. In addition, the
deliverables of this project will help further the case for the critical U.S.
economic need for technician education and the important role community colleges
play in the context of the ATE program and beyond. The project will allow the
whole community - from small projects to national centers - to highlight
individual activities and simultaneously to explain the broader impact of the
ATE program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACOE project will improve the skills and
knowledge of technicians and technical educators by (1) increasing awareness of
the resources available from NSF ATE grantees; (2) fostering collaborative
activities among centers and projects to reach more individual educators and
students, community colleges, and employers; (3) enhancing decision maker
knowledge of the NSF ATE program; and (4) facilitating partnerships between
industry and other stakeholders and those in the ATE community. The project
focuses on providing opportunities for interaction and collaboration in tandem
with high-quality materials that will increase the rigor, relevance, intensity,
and cross-transfer of content knowledge, pedagogy, and technical skills in
advanced technology fields. Collectively, the project will strengthen the ATE
community's outreach efforts through a mixed-media approach to disseminate
information and effectively interact with stakeholders at all levels including
employers, administrators, educators, industry partners, and students.
