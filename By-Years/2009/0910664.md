The project seeks to develop design principles for social computing applications
in which knowledge is produced by large, loosely coordinated groups of people.
The research will be carried out by an inter-disciplinary team that brings
together expertise from computing and information science with the social
sciences; perspectives from all of these areas will be crucial to developing the
next generation of large-scale collaborative information systems on the
Internet. A particular focus of the research will be on phenomena that affect
the quality of information and discussion in these settings, including deception
and the kinds of opinion dynamics that lead to polarization. The research will
offer new analysis techniques and computational models for understanding such
phenomena, drawing on novel styles of investigation involving large-scale
datasets of social interaction and social network activity. Building on this,
the research will also formulate design principles (based on ideas from
intelligent task routing and games with a purpose) to enable creators of social
computing applications to design for particular outcomes in the presence of
complex underlying social phenomena.

The project is motivated by a profound transformation taking place in the way
knowledge is produced and shared; in particular, the way it emerges in a
"bottom-up" manner from global social networks that largely self-organize
online. This raises profound challenges: at a time when a large proportion of
Americans turn first to Internet sources for information about politics, health,
commerce, and education, there is still very little understanding among the
public as well as within the research community of how to deal with deception
and misinformation online, or how to prevent online communities from falling
into conflict and polarization. Through its focus on design principles and on
these challenges, the project will attempt to create more effective means of
online discourse and knowledge production.
