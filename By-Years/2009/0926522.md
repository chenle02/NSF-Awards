Melt fracture in soft solid-like polymeric materials (CMMI
0926522)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
study nonlinear mechanics of a major class of engineering materials, i.e.,
entangled polymeric liquids that are produced at a rate of a few hundred billion
pounds per year. Specifically, the proposed research will probe molecular
mechanisms responsible for different types of fracture-like failure (technically
known as melt fracture) that occur during processing of these materials.
Strategies based on molecular engineering will be developed to reduce or remove
melt fracture to improve the mechanical performance of these materials. Various
experimental methods will be applied to elucidate true physical origins of
rupture-like failures related to 1) yielding and failure in simple shear by
studying their dependence on molecular composition, 2) surface melt fracture
using a new experimental design as a function of molecular formulation, 3) entry
material instability to be investigated with particle-tracking velocimetry and
correlated with gross melt fracture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanical failure
of molten plastics has long prevented more efficient making of such common items
as milk bottles, grocery bags, clothing (fibers), car bumpers, automobile tires
and microelectronic circuitry boards. Results from the proposed activities may
produce practical solutions to postpone or remove melt fracture in manufacturing
so that many plastics articles can be made at a faster speed and lower energy
cost. Akron Global Polymer Academy (http://www.agpa.uakron.edu/nn-scied-
researchfeatures.html) provides the infrastructure to allow access to regional
high school teachers and students. Six movies from previous research have
recently been uploaded onto YouTube.com and received over five hundred hits (key
word: Polymer Rheology).&lt;br/&gt;
