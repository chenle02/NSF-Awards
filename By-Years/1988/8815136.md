This award supports a research cooperation in systems theory between John Burns
and Terry Herdman at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Elena Fernandez at the
Institute of Technological Development for Industrial Chemistry in Santa Fe,
Argentina. The research effort is in the development and analysis of
computational methods for the estimation of parameters and control of partial
and partial-functional differential equations. Approximation schemes will be
developed for application to the identification, control and optimal design of
aerospace systems, especially large space structures and aeroelastic systems.
Accurate modeling in such systems involves partial and functional differential
equations requiring considerable mathematical analysis for necessary dynamic
modeling, estimation, computation and control science. The U.S. scientists are
experts on such modeling using these kinds of differential equations and have
established a good rapport with their Argentinian counterpart. Currently, there
is much international interest in this area, especially from Europe and Japan
and recently from South America. This cooperation will enhance the participation
of the Argentinian mathematics community and the position of the U.S. as a
leader in this important field.
