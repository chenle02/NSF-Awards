The goals of the research to be carried out under this award are (1) to map the
velocity field of galaxies within a distance of approximately 100 megaparsecs,
and (2) to attempt to understand this velocity field in terms of a model in
which galaxies are accelerated by a gravitational field related to all of
galaxies in this volume. In order to carry out this mapping a set of 68 clusters
of galaxies will be used. The relative distances of these clusters and their
mean redshifts will be measured. A comparison of the observed and predicted
velocity fields will enable the investigators to learn about the mass
distribution in this volume of space and the background density on which the
visible galaxy clusters and voids are superposed. The Principle Investigator is
recognized to be an expert in this particular area of research.
