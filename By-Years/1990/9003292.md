Testing sequential logic circuits and systems is the research subject. Solutions
to this problem usually require costs that are, for many applications, too
formidable to allow wide adoption. The goal is to find low cost techniques that
reduce overhead of time, area and test data volume while maintaining high fault
coverage. The approach is to use the notions of partial scan and partial BIST,
which show promise in testing sequential circuits. One research thrust is to
develop new measures of testability and a new criteria for scan element
selection. A second is to systematically avoid elements of existing techniques
that contribute to high costs. Effective test algorithms are being developed by
using scan elements derived from information about the actual test generator.
Substantial empirical evaluation with experimental tools using real circuits is
being done.
