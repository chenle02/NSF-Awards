The radiative transfer equation (RTE) is an important modeling tool with
applications in biomedical imaging, clinical radiation therapy treatment
planning, study of the composition and structure of atmosphere, and other
fields. Because of its complicated structure, the RTE presents challenges to
analysis and simulation. This research project aims at developing novel,
accurate, and e?cient computational methods for both forward and inverse
radiative transfer problems. More generally, the insights obtained in this
project are expected to provide new perspectives on solving a class of integral
equations. The mathematical tools and computational algorithms under development
will be disseminated broadly for advancing scienti?c and technological progress.
Integration of research with education at di?erent levels will provide training
for computational mathematicians. Supervised research projects and seminars
related to the proposed research will be available to junior/senior
undergraduates and graduate students. Participation of members of
underrepresented groups will be encouraged.

Solutions to radiative transfer equations behave very di?erently in di?erent
regions/regimes. These challenges require well-designed and well-understood
numerical algorithms that can take into account special properties and
structures of the RTE and its solution associated with the underlying
application. Although studies and developments of numerical methods for RTE
based on di?erential and probabilistic formulations have been done, integral-
formulation-based approaches are less understood and not fully developed. This
project will systematically develop and analyze e?cient numerical algorithms
based on integral formulation and also explore a combination of integral and
di?erential formulations. The key idea is to utilize dimension reduction,
careful treatment of singularity, and the special structures of the resulting
dense matrix to develop fast solvers. This research is applicable to numerical
simulation of radiation hydrodynamics and modeling of wave propagation in random
media. Further applications in inverse problems that are modeled by RTE, such as
optical tomography, photoacoustic tomography, ?uorescence imaging, etc., will be
studied as well.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
