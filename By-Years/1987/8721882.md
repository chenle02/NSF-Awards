This empirical research project is designed to explore the social values and
ethical implications posed by the creation of computer programs designed to
replicate human expertise. The plan is to examine the values underlying this
artificial intelligence technology by concentrating on ascertaining the
professional and social standards of desirability held by the knowledge
engineers who design and build these systems. The methodology consists of
intensive and structured interviews especially designed to elicit tacit values.
It is expected that the ensuing information will make a significant contribution
to the forthcoming ethical deliberation as to the development and use of
"intelligent machines." Initially, an advisory group composed of two
philosophers and one social scientist will scrutinize the method and results.
Two additional people, one lawyer and one person knowledgeable in this
technology will also be consulted on the project. The results will be
disseminated to philosophers, computer scientists, social scientists, and lay
audiences in papers and presentations. This project addresses an important
issue; the applicant and her advisors are well qualified and she has unusual
access to the population to be studied. Collaborative efforts are likely to
continue beyond the period of this award. The project is designed well;
university support and plans for the dissemination of results are appropriate.
An award in the amount of $75,170 is therefore recommended.
