Ponnuswamy Sadayappan of Ohio State is supported by the Chemistry Division under
the Information Technology Research (ITR) program to develop program synthesis
tools that will facilitate high-performance parallel programming for electronic
structure calculations. Co-PI's include Gerald Baumgartner and Russ Pitzer of
Ohio State, Jagannathan Ramanujam of Louisiana State, and Marcel Nooijen of
Princeton, (the latter two via collaborative proposals CHE-0121706 and
CHE-0121383). This team of computer scientists and computational chemists will
develop a tensor contraction engine that can synthesize efficient parallel code
in Fortran or C from an input specification expressed in a high-level notation,
for a number of target architectures. This tool will be made freely available to
other developers of quantum chemistry software.

The development of high-performance parallel programs for scientific
applications is complicated by the effects of algorithm choice on memory access
costs and communication overhead. Currently available tools for software
development and performance modeling/optimization do not provide adequate
support to developers of scientific code. This research will provide a novel
approach to the automated synthesis of high-performance parallel programs, with
the particular emphasis on electronic structure codes widely employed in
chemistry, physics, and materials science.
