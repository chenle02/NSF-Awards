America's two-year colleges (2YCs) educate a large and rapidly growing number of
undergraduate students, including many students in science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The student population at 2YCs has high
racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity, making 2YCs critical entry points to
STEM careers for students who have been historically underrepresented in STEM
disciplines. Although National Science Foundation (NSF) programs that increase
representation in STEM are open to 2YCs, 2YC faculty often lack the experience,
resources, and institutional support to effectively compete for these program
grants. The Advanced Technological Education for 2 Year Colleges (ATE-2YC)
project will support meritorious proposal writing among 2YC faculty teams.

The project will convene annual proposal writing workshops and follow-on
mentoring for 2YC STEM faculty members. The project design addresses barriers
faced by 2YCs seeking participation in the Advanced Technological Education
(ATE) program. This project builds on previous projects that facilitated 2YCs in
preparing meritorious proposals for NSF grant competitions. The workshops and
mentoring by experienced ATE principal investigators and faculty who have served
as Program Officers in the Division of Undergraduate Education will strengthen
faculty and institutional capacity to pursue NSF support. The expected outcomes
include an increase in the number of competitive ATE proposals submitted by 2YC
institutions and a stronger STEM grant writing culture for 2YCs. Overall, this
project will contribute to the national agenda of strengthening the STEM
workforce by empowering more STEM faculty and two-year institutions to compete
for meritorious NSF awards that can support education innovations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
