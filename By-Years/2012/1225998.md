This award will fund a workshop of experts in the area of thermodynamics and
geoinformatics. The goal is to bring the scientists from across the disciplines
of geosciences and computer science to consider the task of initiating a
geomaterials genome project along the lines suggested for the materials genome
project. The conference will permit the attendees to plan a community-driven
development of an integrated database with contributions from geologists,
geochemists, geophysicists, and thermochemists. They will interact with computer
scientists who will devise methods for implementation of databases for different
applications and thus promote geoscientific research and education.
