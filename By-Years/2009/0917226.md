Timing errors resulting from process variability, manufacturing defects, and
aging effects in scaled CMOS technologies are an important failure mode that
impact the reliability of multi-level control logic in commodity mainstream
computer systems. This project makes a case for lookahead logic circuits based
on the principles of prefix computation to address performance, reliability, and
power challenges posed by timing errors in multi-level control logic. Lookahead
logic circuits promise low-cost logic-only solutions that can be used to (i)
increase performance and/or yield by reducing logic delay, (ii) improve logic
circuit robustness to timing errors by masking them, (ii) lower power
consumption by increasing the scope of aggressive dynamic voltage and frequency
scaling, and (iv) enable more effective and targeted post-silicon debug and
online wearout prediction. The research will formalize the principles of
lookahead-based function decomposition and prefix-based computation for multi-
level logic circuits, develop logic synthesis and design solutions for lookahead
logic, and investigate its applications in the context of superscalar and multi-
threaded processor design.

A major impact of this research is to enable ubiquitous low-cost highly reliable
computing, by expanding its reach to domains, where custom solutions are
economically infeasible. An integrated outcome of this project is the
development of a testbed and web-based resources to facilitate research in
reliable system design. Through course development and collaborations with
industrial partners, the research will contribute to education, community
resource development and technology transfer to industry.
