Assimilate distribution (partitioning) in plants is hypothesized to be regulated
by transport processes located in importing organs (sinks) such as developing
seeds. The transport of amino nitrogen, in particular, is a major factor
influencing plant productivity, crop yield and reproductive success. However,
key nitrogen transport processes remain to be identified and characterized. This
project utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to characterize amino acid
transport processes in sink tissues and specifically to determine the function
of amino acid transporters expressed in reproductive structures. The overall
goal is to understand, at a cellular and molecular level, the role of amino acid
transporters in controlling nitrogen transport to and within seeds. Using
Arabidopsis fruits (siliques) and seeds as a sink model, we intend (1) to
identify the cellular and subcellular localization of members of the amino acid
transporter family that are expressed during silique/seed development, (2) to
understand mechanisms controlling amino acid transport in sinks by
characterizing the physiological and molecular regulation of amino acid
transporters, and (3) to assess the functional significance of amino acid
transporters in controlling import of organic nitrogen into developing seeds
using molecular genetic manipulation of transporter expression and activity. The
information obtained from the proposed work will form the basis for
understanding the function of various amino acid transporters in nitrogen
transfer and partitioning to and among seed tissues. In addition, it will
provide a platform for more detailed future studies to evaluate transporter
contribution to nutrient accumulation by seeds in other plant species. The
program will also offer a framework for the development of biotechnological
innovations to increase crop yield and for modifying nutritional qualities of
seeds with respect to their amino acid complement.
