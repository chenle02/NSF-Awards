This project is concerned with developing and analyzing matrix algorithms that
arise in signal processing applications. The emphasis will be on exploitation of
special structures and the stability of fast algorithms. In particular,
algorithms will be studied for Toeplitz matrices, matrix approximation problems,
and matrix updating problems.
