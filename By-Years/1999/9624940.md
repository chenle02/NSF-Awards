DMS 9624940 Singh This research is on six subtopics in the area of resampling
and data-depth: robustification of the bootstrap; second order balanced
confidence regions and bands based on resampling and data depth; semiparamtric
models and the bootstrap; resampling on bioequivalence; inference spectrum; and
descriptive statistics and inferences based on data-depth. These areas have been
the investigator's main focus of research in the past decade. Efron's bootstrap
in particular is the dominant subject throughout the research. The research may
seem mathematical in nature, however the potential impact on statistical
methodology has been the key factor in the selection of these research problems.
Besides being of independent interest, the notion of data-depth has an important
application in bootstrap methodology. The use of data-depth in multivariate
descriptive-statistics is being further explored in the research. Bootstrap is a
new technology in statistics, discovered by B. Efron in 1979, which has made
tremendous advances in the eighties and the nineties. This PI has been involved
with these advances since the early years of this discovery. Bootstrap has had
impact in nearly every area of statistical sciences and this research is geared
toward its further advancement. One of the ideas included in this research is
the construction of a spectrum of statistical conclusions using bootstrap when
some of the responses in a survey are missing. One other thrust of this research
is towards pictorial and other types of summaries when data have many, many
components. The latter research is based on what is known as data-depth, which
is essentially a measure of centrality of a datum with respect to the totality
of the data-cloud. Other topics involve efficient computing when a methodology
is too computer intensive.
