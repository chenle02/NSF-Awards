Nerve cells communicate with each other by secreting chemical messengers known
as neurotransmitters. Exocytosis, a form of secretion, is a cellular process
which involves the fusion of membranes, resulting in the discharge of substances
from cells. Though poorly understood, the mechanism of exocytosis is of
fundamental importance for understanding synaptic transmission and intercellular
communication between cells. The goal of this research project is to ascertain
the steps involved in the regulation of exocytosis that occur in neuronal and
paraneuronal cells. Dr. Holz will examine the role of annexins, a class of
lipoproteins, in the process of exocytosis. Previous results suggest that
annexins play a significant role in the normal secretory pathway. Experiments
using cultured chromaffin cells will be used to determine if annexins interact
with granule, a specialized cell product involved in secretion, and to test the
possibility that annexins may regulate the binding of granule to the plasma
membrane. Results of these studies are likely to be applicable to the
understanding of presynaptic events in synaptic transmission.
