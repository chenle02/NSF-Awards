The Departments of Mechanical and Chemical Engineering at Yale University will
purchase an electric spray source and accessories for studying particles ranging
in size from atomic dimensions to 100>m. The electrospray source will be
optimized to extract high mobility ions and macroions from electrosprays of
volatile liquids. Applications include a large range of processes, from spray
combustion to mass spectrometric analysis of large biomolecules.
