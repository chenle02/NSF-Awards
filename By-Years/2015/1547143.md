This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project addresses
strategies and software algorithms for manufacturing utilizing teams of mobile
robots. The research involves the creation of new algorithms, simulations, and
experimental demonstrations utilizing a previously developed minifactory multi-
robot micro-manufacturing system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific problem to
be addressed is automated discovery and calibration of assembly manufacturing
system layouts prior to the commencement of automated assembly, and re-discovery
and calibration as the mix or mobile robots and other components changes over
hours or days.
