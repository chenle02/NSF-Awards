This award will permit the U.S. PI, Dr. Kenneth Golden of the Computer Science
and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Vermont, to travel to
Australia for a six-month stay to work with Dr. Jagadishwar Mahanty at the
Australian National University's, Department of Theoretical Physics. The work
constitutes an extension of the U.S. PI's current research, funded by NSF's
Theoretical Physics Program (PHY 91-15695). The method to be used in conducting
this theoretical work is the Quasi-Localized Charge approximation. It is
expected that this joint effort will advance the state of knowledge about the
dynamical properties of strongly coupled Coulomb liquids, substantially
improving our understanding of how correlation effects modify the collective
mode structures in superlattices. The Theoretical Physics group at ANU has an
outstanding reputation and Dr. Mahanty is renowned for his work in solid state
physics, specifically lattice dynamics and electron band theory. The benefit to
be derived is the joining of the complementary skills of the investigators
working in liquid-state plasma and solid state physics. This research extends
Dr. Golden's current NSF supported research on strongly coupled Coulomb systems.
