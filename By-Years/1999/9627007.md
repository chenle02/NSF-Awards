9627007 Muraski-Stotz The Field Museum will develop a 10,000 sq. ft. exhibit
"Life Underground: Foundations of the Biosphere." This exhibit will introduce
visitors to underground ecosystems and the importance of soil upon which we all
depend. Visitors will be invited to explore the diversity of underground
organisms and the vital processes in which they participate. It will consists of
three main parts: 1) Underground Expedition, where things will be enlarged 100
times life-size; 2) Changes Over Time, which will highlight the dynamic nature
of soil communities and forces of change, and 3) a World Tour, which will
compare soil communities from a variety of ecosystems including forests,
grasslands, deserts, tundra, among others. The exhibit utilizes ideas and
research from all four of the museum's academic disciplines -- botany, zoology,
geology and anthropology and will incorporate hundreds of specimens from the
museum's botany, mycology, and zoology collections to illustrate the diversity
of organisms in and around the soil. Complementary educational programming will
be developed and the project is especially targeting rural and inner city
residents. School and community programs will extend the exhibit into
classrooms, vacant lots, and community centers. The materials developed for use
in a formal education setting will be integrated with current objectives of the
existing curricula. In addition, on-line access to the content of the exhibit
and complementary educational materials will be provided. The scheduled opening
date for the exhibit is May, 1998 and during the ten year projected life span of
the exhibit and complementary programming, it is expected that more than eight
million people will be introduced to :Life Underground."
