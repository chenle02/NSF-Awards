The objective of this research project is to determine the feasibility of
detecting combustible gases at elevated temperatures directly from the change in
work function of a thin metal film. A broad spectrum of environmentally
important inorganic and organic species have been selected for systematic
investigations on promising noble-metal films. The sensing mechanism is believed
to involve oxygen activation of the metal surface prior to combustion, which
provides unique flexibility for developing novel combustible-gas analyzers.
Research activities will be focussed primarily on determinations of the sensor
sensitivity, selectivity, dynamic range, response time, and optimum operating
temperature range. The changes in work function will be detected using an
elevated-temperature Kelvin-probe module already under development by the
Arizona Instrument Corporation. Success in the proposed research will
potentially lead, in Phases II and III, to the commercialization of a new class
of compact, versatile combustible gas sensors and/or sensor arrays incorporating
a degree of sensitivity, selectivity, speed of response, and stability not
previously possible. The worldwide market for combustible gas monitoring and
control instrumentation will permit significant market penetration by AZI in a
technological area currently dominated by foreign interests.
