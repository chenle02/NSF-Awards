A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Oceanus, a 177? research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Oceanus is a general-purpose research vessel
owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State
University. Until 2012, the vessel had been operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution but was then retired. OSU determined that the vessel was in better
material condition than their ship R/V Wecoma so they took Oceanus and retired
Wecoma. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the
Pacific Northwest. R/V Oceanus completed 189 days in 2014, 161 (85%) of which
were for NSF. In 2015, the vessel is scheduled to sail 223 days with 47% (105
days) of the schedule for NSF. With this proposal, OSU provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minus 80 Freezer $6,062 &lt;br/&gt;24
Bottle CTD Frame Upgrade $87,043 &lt;br/&gt;Spare Fluorometer $5,370
&lt;br/&gt;CTD Spares Refresh $11,792 &lt;br/&gt;Spare Oxygen Sensor $5,238
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
