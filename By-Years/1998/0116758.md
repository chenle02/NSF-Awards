With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at San Diego State University will acquire a liquid
chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS). This equipment will
enhance research in the following areas: a) the development of methods for
analyzing air- and/or water-sensitive materials; and studies of b)
organometallic complexes and polymers containing two or more metals; c)
organometallic complexes of proteins and peptides; d) protein and peptide
interactions with DNA; and e) supramolecular interactions of electrogenerated
radical anions with hydrogen-bond donors . &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid
chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
This instrument will have an impact in the areas of chemistry, materials science
and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
