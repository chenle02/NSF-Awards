A prototype "ANEX" facility has been developed that allows lower division Civil
Engineering undergraduates to compare ANalytical and EXperimental results of
small-scale structural model tests in a portable, personal computer-controlled
environment. This project is to refine and test the existing ANEX prototype and
to develop an expert system that will act as a trouble-shooter for student users
when analytical and experimental results do not correlate acceptably well.
Further, a "RIED" facility is to be developed and deployed in the ANEX facility
to improve student skills related to the Reading and Interpretation of
Engineering Drawings. The RIED facility also helps students to correlate
idealized small-scale models with real-world engineering structures. Plans to
assess the impact of ANEX/RIED on introductory structural analysis courses at
the University of Missouri-Rolla and at the University of New Hampshire are to
be prepared, and then, preparation for the disemination of the results will be
initiated.
