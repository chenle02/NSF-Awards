This award provides support for student attendance at the annual meeting of the
Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American
Physical Society. The meeting will be held at the College of William and Mary
from 28 May through 1 June, 2002. This is the principal meeting covering
principles of AMO physics held each year, and this award gives students the
opportunity to participate in DAMOP sponsored events. A new event for this
particular conference is a special pre-conference symposium for students to hear
special presentations on topics of particular DAMOP interest.
