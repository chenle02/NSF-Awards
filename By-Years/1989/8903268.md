Previous cross-cultural studies have suggested that cultural meaning systems
play a role in the development of differing patterns of attachment behavior.
However, no research has been conducted directly assessing the impact of
cultural meaning systems on parents perceptions of attachment behavior. The
present two-part study will compare lower- and middle-class Anglo and Puerto
Rican mothers'views of attachment behavior in toddlers. The first study will
examine mothers' indigenous concepts of desirable versus undesirable attachment
behavior. Consistent with their individualistic cultural orientation, Anglo
mothers are more likely than Puerto Rican mothers to be concerned with the
development of autonomy and internal coping resources in their children. In
contrast, reflecting their sociocentric orientation, Puerto Rican mothers are
more likely than Anglo mothers to emphasize their children's development of
qualities important in maintaining interpersonal harmony. Based on mothers'
responses, prototypes of attachment behavior considered desirable and
undesirable in each cultural group will be constructed. The second study will
compare mothers' perceptions of the prototypical toddlers. It is predicted that
mothers will rate the toddlers most extremely along these descriptors which are
relevant to their culture. This research will contribute to an understanding of
the impact of sociocultural meaning systems on mothers' perceptions of
attachment behavior. We will learn whether mothers from different sociocultural
backgrounds hold contrasting normative conceptions of childhood, and whether
these conceptions lead them to evaluate the same child behaviors differently.
Through this investigation, the sociocultural elements in models of normative
behavior will be made more apparent, and prevailing models of child development
will be enriched.
