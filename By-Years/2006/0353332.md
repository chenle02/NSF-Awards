A planning meeting will be held to study the feasibility of establishing a
research site for the Industry /University Cooperative Research Center
"Connection One", lead by Arizona State University at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. The research focus of the proposed research site will be basic and
applied interdisciplinary research in secure optical and electrical data
transport, switching, and processing. This research will include materials,
devices, systems, and information technology, requiring long-term commitment to
achieve the orders of magnitude improvements needed in the speed, density,
power, cost, and reliability of secure data transport and communications.
