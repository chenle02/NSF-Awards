A force concept approach to introductory physics laboratories seeks to address
the lack of conceptual understanding that students retain as they exit from
introductory courses. The project hopes to aid students in building operational
definitions for the concept of force and provide them with direct, personal
experience with the measurement of force. The goal is that each student (a)
learn about physical phenomena in a hands-on way, (b) overcome conceptual
difficulties, (c) learn the procedures involved in drawing scientific
conclusions, (d) experience working with laboratory equipment including
computers, and (e) use writing and critical thinking as tools to gain
understanding. They use computerized force sensors, motion sensors, and field
sensors to gain direct experience with forces and fields and the resulting
motions of objects subject to these. The target audience includes students from
biology, prepharmacy, premedicine, prephysical-therapy, architecture, preservice
teaching, sciences, math, and engineering, including students who later major in
physics.
