This proposal develops a new mathematical framework for detection and estimation
in applications as diverse as remote sensing and quantum computing. The
application domain defines one Heisenberg-Weyl group, the signal design domain
defines a second group, and the new mathematical framework results from
expressing one group in terms of the other. Classical algebraic error correcting
codes find new application as phase coded waveforms and the geometry of
codewords provides fundamental limits on detection and estimation. In the second
order Reed Muller code, pairs of phase coded waveforms associated with Rudin-
Shapiro sequences enable instantaneous radar polarimetry which provides
concurrent and coherent access to all four dimensions of the polarization
scattering matrix rather than serial and non-coherent access as is the case
today. The value of this new primitive is detection based on simple statistics
in four dimensions rather than detection based on complicated statistics applied
to lossy one-dimensional projections.

As a training program, this proposal provides graduate students with an
opportunity to create new mathematics that brings fundamental change to an
important application domain. It will increase the pool of mathematicians who
appreciate the power of mathematics and the important role that it plays in
engineering disciplines. Graduate students will learn to flourish in the
different cultures associated with the different academic disciplines, develop
an ability to bridge different worlds and this experience will advantage them in
both academic and non-academic careers. This proposal will likely result in
technology transfer to industrial partners, including Raytheon, who have
confirmed the value of instantaneous radar polarimetry in independent analysis.
This engagement and others may lead to additional internship opportunities for
US citizens and permanent residents.
