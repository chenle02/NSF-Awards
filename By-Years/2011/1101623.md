The 15th International Conference on Random Structures &amp;
Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 15th
International Conference on Random Structures &amp; Algorithms &lt;br/&gt;will
take place at Emory University in Atlanta, May 24 - 28, 2011. &lt;br/&gt;This is
a biennial meeting, initiated in 1983 by the Faculty of Mathematics, Adam
Mickiewicz University, in Poznan, Poland. The aims of these conferences are to
present recent research results and to identify and explore directions for
further research in random discrete structures, randomized algorithms and broad
areas of applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics, computer
science, and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is established
as a key locus for the exposition of trends and breakthroughs in the development
of probabilistic methods and their application in discrete mathematics and CS
theory.&lt;br/&gt;The choice of the plenary speakers highlights important themes
ranging from classical topics such as Ramsey theory, phase transitions in random
graphs, and the regularity lemma, which have seen recent exciting progress, to
modern ones including message passing algorithms, unique games related hardness
of approximation for optimization problems, internet related mechanism design,
auctions, and computational game theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main feature of
the conferences is the mix of researchers from discrete mathematics, theoretical
CS and optimization, attracted by a common interest in probabilistic tools and
their application. Holding the meeting in Atlanta is intended to attract more
involvement from the CS theory community, which is arguably best-developed in
this country. Conference activities will be widely disseminated by the
conference proceedings in Random Structures &amp; Algorithms, a leading research
journal, on the conference website, and through archived and/or streaming video
of selected lectures. We hope to attract, and support, a large number of
students and postdoctoral researchers, and participants from groups under-
represented in the community.
