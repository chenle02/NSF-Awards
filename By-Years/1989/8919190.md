High resolution nitrate analyses of snow sequences in Antarctica may provide
evidence that the snow contains a chemical record of ionization from charged
particles incident upon the upper atmosphere of the earth. Nitrate concentration
in snow and firn will be measured on-site in Antarctica by ultraviolet
spectrophotometry to detect short pulses of high nitrate concentration which can
be directly related to specific solar flares known from past records of
geomagnetic activity and satellite data on the charged particle fluence in the
interplanetary medium. This project will analyze, at high resolution, a firn and
ice core that covers the last 3000 years. With this core, it will be possible to
acquire a time series that includes most of recorded history and will permit an
examination of the nitrate record of major solar activity features like the
Maunder, Spoerer and Wolf Minima and to obtain a detailed record of the response
of the solar cycle and associated flare activity to these long-term variations.
