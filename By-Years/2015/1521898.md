There are pervasive storage and transport problems that currently limit the
accuracy of diagnostic tests and distribution of robust testing devices for
remote usage. These problems stem from the inherent temperature stabilities of
the molecules and reagents required for sensitive quantitation including
antibodies, enzymes, protein standards, and the test specimens themselves (i.e.
whole blood, saliva, urine, etc.). This I-Corps team proposes a technology
platform based on using silk fibroin as a stabilizer that can be used to protect
these molecules from degradation at ambient temperatures, which in turn can
expand the use cases of diagnostic devices deployed in the field, will reduce
the costs associated with cold storage, improve the shelf life of precious
internal standards or immobilized chemistries on sensors, and potentially make
the retrieval of fluid bio-specimens more feasible.

The silk technology platform offers many potential avenues for commercial
development within the field of diagnostics. The initial work conducted by this
team has focused on adapting silk purification and formatting to improve its
stabilizing features (i.e. thermal protection / improved recovery) for needs in
field settings. The team has also recently demonstrated thermal stability
enhancements provided by the silk matrix across a wide number of test markers
and demonstrated compatibility with numerous distinct testing techniques such as
immunoassays, quantitative real-time PCR, and various high-throughput
approaches. The team proposes the reduction of these core concepts to the
retrofitting of existing products with poor thermal stability and the
development of new products enabled by the technology, including point-of-care
devices and sample vials containing labile reagents. I-Corps funds will support
the development of a prototype device that incorporates a dried silk matrix and
can be used to capture and dry capillary blood on an ergonomic and inexpensive
consumable.
