The goal of this project is to give students in grades 7-12 tools and materials
to understand complex systems. Students will be able to create models of complex
situations and evaluate the correctness of their models using empirical data. In
short, they will be able to build and test theories, and apply these skills to
the sciences. This goal will be accomplished by a three phase project to develop
powerful, fast software packages with good user interfaces that allow easy model
creation and testing, together with a sequence of instructional material using
this software. This project funds the first phase of this effort during which
prototype software and material will be developed, tested and published. The
resulting curriculum materials will be widely disseminated through newsletters,
symposia, teacher workshops, professional presentations and commercial
publication. The material will be developed by Technical Education Research
Center (TERC) with the collaboration of leading educators and area schools. This
project is funded jointly with the Instructional Materials Development Program.
