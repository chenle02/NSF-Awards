9617209 Bollens The purpose of this project is to quantify predation mortality
on four target organisms (cod and haddock larvae, Calanus finmarchicus,
Pseudocalanus spp.) by fishes and zooplanton on Georges Bank. The principal
objectives are: 1) to determine bankwide distribution and abundance of
vertebrate and invertebrate predators, including the identification of source
regions for predator populations which are off the Bank; and 2) to quantify diet
and feeding rates based on stomach content analysis and gut evacuation rates.
