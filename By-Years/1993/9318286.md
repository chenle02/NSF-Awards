The benefits of mycorrhizae to plants in nature are not known. One presumed
benefit of mycorrhizae is increae phosphorus uptake, but evidence for this is
based mainly on greenhouse pot experiments. Newly developed techniques and an
experimental rhizotron now make it possible to quantify the phosphorus made
available to mature trees in nature by ectomycorrhizae. In addition, new
observations and recording techniques using the Soil Biotron at the University
of Michigan Biological Station make it possible to quantify effects of fungivory
on phosphorus uptake by mycorrhizae. This research will determine (1) if trees
and fungi use phosphorus stored in the ectomycorrhizal sheath asynchronously,
(2) seasonal patterns of grazing by microarthropods on mycorrhizal fungi, and
(3) seasonal patterns of phosphorus availability in the rhizosphere. Field
observations will be conducted on white pine trees (Pinus strobus) and the
common fungus, Cenococcum geophilum, in a mixed deciduous forest in northern
Michigan. %%% Much previous research along these lines has been restricted to
container experiments in greenhouses. This research will provide the first
detailed study of phosphorus availability, phosphorus use, and grazing effects
on mycorrhizal associations in a field situation.
