This proposal will investigate an innovative approach to make the arc amperage
less dependent on wire feed speed plus a unique dual shield torch design which
has application to gas metal arc welding and flux cored arc welding. The
innovative approach is to use two power sources on one weld wire, one for
preheating the wire and the other for providing the welding arc. The
significance of this approach is that the weld deposition rate will be less
dependent on the arc current as a result of the wire preheating by the second
power source. The second part of the innovative approach is to use dual flow gas
shielding of the arc area, instead of the conventional one shielding gas. This
permits different gas types to be directed to the appropriate region to be most
effective. The research plan is to construct the experimental equipment and
investigate how much the heat input, deposition rate and travel speed can be
varied while still maintaining good weld characteristics. Carbon steel solid and
tubular wire will be studied. This Phase I will confirm the feasibility of this
approach and determine the operational envelop of the process parameters for
carbon steel welding. A follow-on Phase II is planned to investigate the effect
of this process on the material properties and expand the studies to other
material types, such as low alloy steel, stainless steel and aluminum. If
successful, plans are to pursue funds to commercialize this approach. This
innovative research, if successful, has the potential to increase productivity
of carbon steel welding and improve welded properties of heat affected metals,
such as low alloy steel and stainless steel.
