This Minority Starter Grant is on mechanisms underlying the function of
biological clocks. Periodic timing of behavior is often regulated by cellular
activity that is considered to act as a biological clock. Recent work has
identified some of the proteins that are released as components of the timing
mechanism, but it remains unclear how these proteins exert their effects on
target cells elsewhere. This project uses a system of cultured tissue isolated
from the fruitfly, Drosophila, which allows the potential for powerful genetic
analysis of physiological mechanisms. Biochemical analyses are used to identify
the timing of protein secretions and hormone secretions from this tissue.
Results will show how molecular rhythms of clock gene expression can result in
timed behavior patterns. This independent research follows NSF postdoctoral
support, and will have a high impact on giving the PI a significant early boost
to her career. This work also is likely to have an impact on both neuroscience
and endocrinology in further understanding the cellular mechanisms that link
brain and hormonal secretions.
