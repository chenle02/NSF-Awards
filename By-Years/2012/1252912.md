This project studies various phenomena related to diffusive tracer particles in
a strong array of opposing vorticies. One particularly interesting aspect is a
seemingly anomalous diffusive behaviour exhibited on "intermediate" time scales.
On long time scales this anomalous diffusive behaviour should "average" to an
effectively Brownian behaviour, recovering classical homogenization results. The
project crucially uses tools from both Probability and PDE. The educational
component of this project aims to further interaction between these two areas
from the undergraduate to the post-graduate
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observing the movement of gravel particles shows
intermittent periods of rest and travel. One aspect of this project studies an
idealised system modelling this behaviour with the eventual aim of rigorously
quantifying the "rest and travel". This is closely related to questions about
homogenization -- the approximation of inhomogeneous media with microscopic
inhomogeneities by a homogeneous one. This project crucially uses tools from two
connected but different areas in Mathematics: Probability and PDE. The
educational component of this project aims to further interaction between these
two areas from the undergraduate level all the way to the post-graduate level.
