The proposed work tests hypotheses on the causes of the evolution of self-
pollination in Clarkia xantiana, a native annual plant composed of an
outcrossing and a self-pollinating subspecies. Previous work shows that the two
subspecies differ in geographic range, plant community associations, and
population size. This project examines the role of plant population size and
plant community interactions in determining the abundance of pollinating bees
and whether an outcrossing versus self-pollinating mating system is
advantageous. The proposed work investigates (1) the distribution and abundance
of specialist bee pollinators with respect to the mating system and population
attributes of C. xantiana, (2) the factors affecting whether reproductive output
is limited by the abundance of pollinators, and (3) the effects of population
size and the plant community on the relative success of C. xantiana individuals
that vary in mating system. A combination of field observations, field
experiments, and molecular genetic analyses will be employed to address these
problems.

The evolution of self-pollination is among the most common events in the
evolutionary history of flowering plants. While the biological consequences of
self-pollination (e.g. inbreeding) are well known, the ecological causes of this
evolutionary transition have rarely been considered. This project will also
provide new information on the importance of native bee communities and plant
communities in the viability of plant populations.
