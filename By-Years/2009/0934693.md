The Wake Innovative Noyce Scholars Program (WINS) is recruiting, training, and
mentoring 32 highly qualified students to become high school teachers in the
disciplines of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. Candidates are
participating in a 13-month education program leading to teacher licensure
(grades 9-12) and a Master's degree in Education. This project includes a unique
combination of training in both content areas and educational practices,
including four key components: content, pedagogy, diversity, and leadership.
Intellectual merit involves analysis of the strategies and refinements of the
innovative recruitment, training, and mentoring activities to determine their
effect on teacher outcomes as well as high school student outcomes. The broader
impacts of this program are production of committed and effective teachers, who
will stimulate and guide the development of future generations. The WINS
Scholars are becoming innovative teacher-leaders who maximize the science and
mathematics achievement of students in high-need schools and serve as models for
other teachers and schools. Research studies documenting all facets of the
program are being planned for dissemination in presentations and publications to
facilitate development of a national model for improving teacher education and
retention.
