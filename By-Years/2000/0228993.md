The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory at the University of Massachusetts
is a group of scientists and engineers who work together in support of a
research program in millimeter-wave astronomy. The FCRAO program emphasizes
three principal areas: (1) astronomical research; (2) development of state-of-
the-art instrumentation; and (3) training of graduate and undergraduate students
in observational astronomy and astronomical instrumentation. The program is
currently known for its operation of a 14m diameter millimeter-wave telescope in
Massachusetts. However, in order to remain at the forefront of research, the
Observatory is participating with the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica,
Optica, y Electronica (INAOE) in the construction, in Mexico, of a 50m diameter
Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), to be completed in 2005. The principal work to
be carried out under this award is to make the transition to the new facility,
including development and testing of new instrumentation to take advantage of
the short 1mm-wavelength operating wavelength of the LMT, and support for
telescope commissioning tasks. In addition, scientific research will continue to
be supported at the 14m telescope until LMT operations commence.
