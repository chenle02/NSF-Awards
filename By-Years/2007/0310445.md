Interdisciplinary (99) The use of models is ubiquitous and essential in
undergraduate engineering education. However, students often do not understand
the distinction between a mathematical model and a real system because they do
not have enough opportunities to compare the behavior of models with the
behavior of real systems. This project is developing an integrated dynamical
systems modeling laboratory shared between the departments of Electrical and
Mechanical Engineering at Rose-Hulman. The laboratory is modeled after and
adapted from the Interdisciplinary Controls Lab developed at the University of
Colorado at Colorado Springs by Plett and Schmidt, and the Dynamic Systems and
Controls Lab developed at Northwestern University by Freeman. Our laboratory
involves all mechanical and electrical engineering students at Rose-Hulman, as
well as middle/high school students through our Explore Engineering outreach
program. Exposing students to dynamical systems in a laboratory setting, in
which mathematical models often lead to only an approximate description of the
system behavior, helps the students better understand the uses and limitations
of models.
