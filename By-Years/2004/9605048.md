This two-year award for U.S.-Netherlands cooperative research in atomic physics
involves Francis Robicheaux and John Shaw of Auburn University, and L.D. Noordam
at the FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) in Amsterdam, The
Netherlands. The objective of the research is to study the physics of time
dependent atomic processes, linking the efforts of the experimental femto-second
atomic physics group at AMOLF and the atomic theory group at Auburn University.
The main focus of the research will be on the behavior of electron wave packets
on alkali atoms in strong fields. The collaboration takes advantage of the US
strength in theory and the experimental insights and data of the Dutch group.
