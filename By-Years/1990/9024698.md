The objectives of the proposed work are: (1) the measurement of the wave number
spectra of gravity-capillary (water) waves using a site on Lake Washington, and
(2) the measurement of heat and water vapor fluxes between the sea and the
atmosphere during relatively low wind speeds in the subtropics (Azores).
