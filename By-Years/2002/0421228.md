With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University will acquire a dispersive
Raman spectrometer and a detection system for an existing nitrogen-pumped dye
laser. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a)
spectroscopic investigation of the formation of host-guest complexes of
cyclophanes with aromatic molecules; b) synthesis and vibrational spectroscopy
of N-heterocyclic carbene complexes of osmium tetroxide; and c) luminescence
spectroscopy to investigate the complexes of lanthanide ions with chelating and
macrocyclic ligands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raman spectroscopy provides a
powerful probe of molecular information. Raman scattering is complementary to
infrared absorption in that it probes fundamentally different types of molecular
vibrational modes. For biological samples, Raman scattering is the preferred
method because it is not affected by the polar water environment that absorbs
strongly in the infrared. These studies will have an impact in the biological
and environmental sciences, and the pharmaceutical industry. &lt;br/&gt;
