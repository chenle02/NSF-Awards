9418793 Siegfried The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism of
cell- cell communication that regulates the development of the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Wingless is a protein that is expressed in a
subset of cells in the embryo that can signal to neighboring cells that don't
express the Wingless protein and regulate their fate. The mechanism of this cell
signalling is unknown but we have identified a number of other molecules that
are involved in the signalling pathway. Zeste white 3 kinase, which has the
ability to modify other proteins by adding phosphate to them, and potentially
alter their activity, is one component of this pathway. We propose to identify
the proteins which Zeste white 3 kinase does modify and to determine how Zeste
white 3 kinase activity is itself modulated. The investigation of Zeste white 3
will lead to a greater understanding of the Wingless signalling. This is
relevant to the understanding of vertebrate growth and development since
Wingless is similar to proteins found in mice that are required for normal
development. In addition, the Wingless signalling pathway is likely to be
conserved in vertebrates since components such as Zeste white 3 also have
vertebrate counterparts. ***
