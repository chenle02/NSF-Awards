The plant family Araceae (the aroids) includes food plants (the taros),
ornamentals, and ecologically important members of the wet tropical forests of
the world such as philodendron, anthurium, and monstera. Taxonomic relationships
among the estimated 100 or so genera are poorly known, in part because
morphological features occur in a complex mosaic-like fashion among these
plants. To acquire an independent dataset for establishing evolutionary
relationships among the aroids, Dr. James French of Rutgers University is
studying mutations in chloroplast DNA isolated from leaf tissues of
representative species of nearly all known genera of the family. Chloroplast DNA
is a useful source of genomic data because its structure and function are
constrained overall; closely related plants differ by only a few mutations while
more anciently diverged groups show greater numbers of mutational differences.
By measuring the amounts and kinds of mutational differences in chloroplast DNA
among aroid genera, Dr. French is constructing a phylogenetic tree for the
family. This diagram of taxonomic relationships will help improve the
classification of these plants, organizing related genera into the same tribes
and subfamilies. With a phylogeny as guide, researchers can study the evolution
of the complex morphology of aroids and the various breeding systems known for
members of the family.
