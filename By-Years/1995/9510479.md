9510479 Penzien This is an international travel award to enable the Principal
Investigator to visit the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Engineering
(KAIST) and Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) to develop the
final plan for the International Symposium on Civil Infrastructure Systems. The
venue of this symposium will be in Seoul, Korea and the host will be KOSEF. This
international symposium, the first major meeting of this kind, was approved by
the last joint staff meeting between INT/NSF and KOSEF. The international
cooperative activity undertaken under this project will enhance NSF's Civil
Infrastructure Systems Research by developing specific cooperative research
activities and joint funding and mechanisms with potential international
partners in Asia. ***
