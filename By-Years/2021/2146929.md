High latitude regions, such as Alaska, have unique meteorological conditions in
the winter which are driven by the lack of sunlight. The atmospheric structure
in these high latitude regions often contain inversions, which are layers of the
atmosphere where the temperature increases with height. Inversions can
effectively “trap” air, allowing it to become stagnant with decreased air
quality. In this project, the researchers will deploy a number of instruments in
the Fairbanks, Alaska region to study these inversions. The societal impact of
the work relates to the long-term goal of improving model representation of
weather conditions that are important to understanding and forecasting air
pollution events, a significant health hazard. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
is for the development of a new experimental approach to characterizing the
dynamic, radiative, and turbulent aspects of the atmospheric boundary layer
structure in extreme high-latitude winter conditions. The project focuses on the
buildup and breakup of shallow-stratified surface-based temperature inversions
(SBIs) during anticyclone synoptic conditions and the radiative coupling and
feedback processes between SBI and elevated temperature inversion layers (EI).
The experiment will be integrated with the Alaskan Layered Pollution and
Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field campaign in early 2022. The researchers will
deploy microwave radiometer and lidar profilers, unmanned aircraft systems, and
scintillometers in the Fairbanks area to provide data that will be used to
advance capabilities to model atmospheric boundary layer physical properties
critical to assessing the chemical transformation of gases and particulate
matter under stagnant, winter conditions in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
