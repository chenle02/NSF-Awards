The reseasrch project is a fundamental synergy of stem cell research, soft
matter elasticity, cell and molecular biology, and computational nano-mechanics.
The adopted interdisciplinary approach combines statistical physics of
macromolecules and polymers, entropic soft elasticity, cell biology, and
variational finite element methods to build a multiscale model for study of
interactions among focal adhesion, extracellular matrix, and membrane
cytoskeleton.

We would like to address the following questions by using the language of
precise mathematical and physical science: (1) How to explain the stem cells'
abiloty for rigidity sensing and surface micro-structure sensing of, and to
explain the mechanism of triggering adhesion-mediated signaling and subsequent
cascade responses, and to predict the mechanosensitivity of cell in quantitative
manner; (2) How to explain and predict contact-induced conformation changes in
proteins and structural changes in cell cytoskeleton? (3) How to explain the
self-assembly and self-dissociation of a focal-adhesion.
