This research project considers the genetic mechanisms of vertebrate
diversification from two perspectives. The first is that of population genetics.
How many genes experience divergent selection during the evolution of new
species? How are they distributed across the genome? The second perspective is
that of the evolution of development. Which genes are modified to produce new
phenotypes? The flock of some 800 closely related cichlids fishes in Lake Malawi
are an ideal model system for this study. These species differ in the shape of
their jaws and teeth, the color of their skin, and their mechanisms of sex
determination. The genomes of 40 Metriaclima populations will be sequenced to
quantify the proportion of the genome that has diverged among sister species.
The genomes of 20 Labeotropheus populations will be sequenced and compared to
Metriaclima to identify regions of the genome that have diverged between these
genera that differ in craniofacial morphology.&lt;br/&gt; These data will
provide the most comprehensive picture ever produced of the genomic architecture
of speciation and adaptation in vertebrates. Analysis of these data will improve
our understanding of the gene network controlling the development of neural
crest cells, which contribute to a wide variety of pigmentation and craniofacial
phenotypes unique to vertebrates. The project will also support a class in which
undergraduate students will perform original research, and a summer workshop in
which senior researchers will share the latest methods for analysis of cichlid
genetics and development.
