Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a 29-kDa antiviral protein isolated from
pokeweed plants catalytically removes two adenines and a guanine from the large
rRNA and inhibits translation. PAP depurinates the large rRNA by binding to
ribosomal protein L3. The investigators recently demonstrated that expression of
PAP in yeast led to specific inhibition of +1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting
(PRF) and interfered with the ability of the yeast retrovirus Ty1 to
retrotranspose. Using nontoxic PAP mutants, they showed that PAP inhibited +1
PRF and Ty1 retrotransposition without inhibiting general translation. PAP had
no effect on -1 PRF or maintenance of the yeast killer virus. These results
suggested that PAP could be used as a specific probe to dissect the mechanisms
regulating +1 PRF and as a general tool to study the role of translational
fidelity in virus maintenance. The primary objective of this project is to use
recombinant PAP mutants and yeast chromosomal mutants to investigate the
mechanism by which PAP inhibits +1 frameshifting and Ty1 retrotransposition in
yeast. PAP sequences critical for inhibition of +1 PRF and Ty1
retrotransposition, and PAP binding sites on ribosomal protein L3 will be
identified. It will be determined whether binding of PAP to the ribosomes, to
the large rRNA, and/or to L3 is critical for inhibition of +1 PRF. These studies
provide a unique way to address questions relating to ribosome structure and
function and may have important implications for understanding the unusual
mechanism of translation inhibition by ribosome inactivating proteins.
Alterations in PRF efficiencies can have profound effects on propagation of many
important plant and animal viruses. Information gained from these studies could
be used to design viral or cell specific translation inhibitors and may lead to
development of more effective means of disease control in agriculture and
medicine.
