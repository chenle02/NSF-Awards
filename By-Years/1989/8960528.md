Marine biomass from seaweeds offers especially important commercial components
for the food, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. Components of marine
biomass now finding commercial markets are alginates, agars, and carrageenans,
all polysaccharides, i.e., polymeric carbohydrates or hydrocolloids. Unique to
marine polysaccharides is the degree of sulfation; lower sulfate contents are
generally considered high-value specialty items. In Phase I it is proposed to
experimentally investigate the potential for identified sulfatase enzymes to
cleave the sulfate groups on selected seaweed-derived polysaccharides with the
objective of increasing their commercial value. To this end of a reduction in
ester sulfation via sulfatase enzymes, comprehensive input/output assays will be
performed, as well as an evaluation of rheological properties to identify
improvements in gelling. In Phase II continuous flow process systems will be
investigated using immobilized sulfatase enzymes with the objective of
documenting and verifying percent conversions and reaction kinetics.
