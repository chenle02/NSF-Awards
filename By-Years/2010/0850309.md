The goal of this S-STEM project is to strengthen student support programming and
increase the number of female B.S. graduates from the Metallurgical Engineering
(MetE) and Industrial Engineering (IE) programs. This S-STEM project goal is met
by strategic recruitment of two cohorts of 15 scholarship recipients,
utilization of an environment and programming that promotes student retention,
and placement of scholars into meaningful and challenging careers in MetE or IE.
Students who demonstrate an interest in participating in the support programming
and have a high probability of success in MetE or IE will be selected as
scholarship recipients.
