The Mazon Creek area of northeastern Illinois yields one of the most important
soft-bodied invertebrate and plant biotas known from the Late Paleozoic. Middle
Pennsylvanian terrestrial, freshwater and marine organisms from this region are
both diverse and abundant. The Field Museum of Natural History houses the
largest and most significant collection of fossils from Mazon Creek, but almost
half of its 94,000 specimens are not yet fully available to the scientific
community. This project will provide support for equipment and temporary
personnel to assist the Museum in (1) reducing a backlog of 43,000 unsorted,
unculled and uncatalogued specimens; (2) rearranging the Mazon Creek holdings to
accommodate the newly sorted material; (3) cataloging the entire Mazon Creek
collection using computerized collection management techniques; and (4)
publishing a catalogue of type, figured and referred specimens from the Mazon
Creek area. Completion of the project will facilitate more efficient collection
management, enhance awareness of the extensive Field Museum holdings, and result
in a unique collection of research-quality specimens that will be more
accessible and significantly more useful for future research.
