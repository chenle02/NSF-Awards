The focus of this research is concerned with developing methods for the use of
water-soluble hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidation agents. Hypervalent
iodine (V) reagents, including chiral examples will be prepared and
characterized. The reagents will then be used for the oxidation of alcohols and
ethers and for the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols.

With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions ((RUI) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. T.K. Vinod of
the Department of Chemistry at Western Illinois University. Professor Vinod will
focus his research efforts on developing new methodology for aqueous oxidations
that involve the use of hypervalent iodine reagents. The methodology follows a
green chemistry theme and will attempt to introduce eco-friendly approaches
towards chemical reactions. In terms of broader impacts, the project will afford
an excellent training ground for high school participants, undergraduates and
masters level students.
