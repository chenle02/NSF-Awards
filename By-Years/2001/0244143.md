In this project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Duncan will investigate metal ion-ligand complexes
synthesized in a molecular beam via a pulsed laser vaporization source. The
ligands are small molecules. The spectroscopy and dynamics of these species are
studied using mass-selected infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy. The
experiments measure ligand-based vibrational frequencies as they are shifted by
bonding interactions with the metal ion. Cluster solvation shells and
intracluster reactions are also identified via ligand vibrations. The
experiments focus on magnesium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon ions complexed
with one or more solvent or ligand molecules, e.g., carbon dioxide, water,
acetylene, and others. Additional experiments include organometallic complexes
in which metals interact with benzene or polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental studies on both small and
large complexes will contribute to an improved understanding of metal bonding
interactions important in inorganic and organometallic complexes, in metal
containing atmospheres, in metal materials and at biological metal centers. The
research is carried out with graduate and undergraduate students as well as with
postdoctoral research associates. The project benefits from collaborations with
outside researchers and internationally with a group in the Netherlands.
