University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GeoCollaborative Crisis Management: Building
Better Systems Through Advanced Technology and Deep Understanding of Technology-
Enabled Group Work&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will bring group work and
collaborative technologies (dialogue-enabled, distributed) into the area of
crisis management and emergency response. Government partners include the Port
Authority of New York, NSAS, the Florida Department of Community Affairs, the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the National Imaging and
Mapping Agency, the Federal Geographic Data Committee, the USGS, EPA, and the
Air Force. There is also a commitment from a user interface company, Advanced
Interfaces, to provide free software and to support some of the project's
research staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most commercial Geographic Information
systems do not include collaborative technologies, nor an understanding of how
emergency responders need to collaborate; this research should push the frontier
in both directions. A strong component of training, outreach, and education are
also included.&lt;br/&gt;
