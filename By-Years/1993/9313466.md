9313466 Mourou This award will support the renovation of laboratory space for
the Science and Technology Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the
University of Michigan. This renovation project will convert about 4000 square
feet of lab space, previously used for biophysical research, into usable space
for optical research by reconfiguring it, adding updated electrical supports,
adding cooling for large frame lasers, modern air conditioning, ceiling,
cabinetry, and changing the floors. This STC has a strong commitment to K-12
education and college education and offers students the opportunity to perform
experiments in laser optics and to have contact at an early age with this type
of research environment. This STC also has strong ties to industry while working
with 20 companies, it has spun off three small companies and five of it's laser
products have already found their way to the market place. This renovation
project will directly impact about 70 researchers working on an
interdisciplinary program that combines physics, chemistry, engineering and
medicine. This research space modernization project will bolster the activities
in a critical technology area for the country, ultrafast optics. ***
