Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0413050&lt;br/&gt;Altman/Yale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Altman and his
colleagues at Yale University, with the support of the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, are studying the surface chemistry of ferroelectric oxides.
In particular, they are investigating the effect of poling direction on the
surface chemistry, using an array of electron spectroscopic and scanned probe
microscopy techniques. Acid-base chemistry on LiNbO3 and CO oxidation on BaTiO3
supported gold nanoparticles or RuO2 epitaxial layers are being examined. The
fundamental information obtained from these studies provides a basis for the
design of externally controllable catalyst systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;External control of the reactivity or selectivity of a
catalytic surface would have considerable impact on the design of catalytic
reactor systems. The effect of poling direction on the subsequent chemistry of
ferroelectric oxide surfaces is a possible route to establishing this sort of
control. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
Professor Altman and his colleagues at Yale are examining these interesting
effects, using surface electron spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy
methods. &lt;br/&gt;
