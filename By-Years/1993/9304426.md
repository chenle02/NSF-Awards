Much of the western edge of North America is accreted, consisting of crustal
fragments that collided with the mainland during subduction over the past 300
Ma. The Insular Belt of British Columbia and Alaska is one the largest pieces to
have been accreted. This project is focused on establishing the timing and
nature of "docking" of this terrane with North America. Acquisition of data on
the timing and geometry of such collisions is important for understanding the
overall tectonic evolution of the region. Because collisions tend to disrupt
local and often global patterns of subduction, this new information may have
whole earth significance in terms of understanding the causes of changes in
plate motions.
