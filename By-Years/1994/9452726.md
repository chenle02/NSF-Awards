9452726 Field The University of Maine seeks to initiate a 4 week residential
Young Scholars project in engineering for 24 students entering grades 11 and 12.
The project aims to stimulate interest in engineering careers among the
participants. This will be achieved by having the students; take part in on-
going engineering research projects; tour industrial sites and talk with
practicing engineers; receive an overview of career opportunities in five
engineering disciplines; take a minicourse in Logic Systems; learn about ethics
in an engineering setting; and complete a follow-up project. Students and
teachers at each participant's school will also become aware of engineering
through a presentation made by the participant that will also be attended by the
Project Director. ***
