Illinois State University has been awarded a grant to acquire an environmental
scanning electron microscope for research and training in the Biology,
Chemistry, Geography-Geology, and Physics programs. The microscope provides
capabilities for observation of fine details of diverse specimens and for
analysis of their elemental composition. In environmental mode, living organisms
can be examined with no preparation. This makes it possible to observe delicate
specimens that would be altered by conventional preparation methods. Faculty and
students use the scope in research projects that include documenting
physiological stress in plants; identifying single-celled algae that are
indicators of past environmental conditions; characterizing mutant fruit flies;
using elemental analysis to assess the chemistry of coordination complexes of
the element vanadium; characterizing nanospheres; documenting surface structures
in plants with defective cell expansion; examining structure of bacteria-host
interactions and bacterial biofilms, evaluating geochemical interactions in
fossils, making nanoscale measurements of thermoelectric lattices, comparing
flower structure and development, evaluating synthesis of lithium cobalt oxide;
and characterizing the material composition of new electrodes being developed
for an improved scanning probe microscope. The results of these diverse studies
will be published in peer-reviewed journals and integrated into courses and
faculty websites as appropriate. Software for remote control operation of the
scope will allow students in classrooms to observe specimens remotely. The scope
will be featured at various community outreach events, and it will be available
to other academic researchers in central Illinois.
