This project adds three engineering work stations and mechanical and civil
engineering software to a recently installed Computer Aided-Design network. The
completed system forms an integrated "Engineering Computer-Aided-Design" center.
The design center strengthens the design content of the engineering curriculum
and makes the new technology available to the students. This award is being
matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
