Abstract CTS-9424617 Gollahalli This proposal is for funds for the partial
purchase of a pulsed Nd/Yag Laser System (including an Optical Parametric
Amplifier and Frequency Doubler). The equipment will be used to develop a Planar
Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) Imaging System capability in order to
visualize and monitor NO and OH in turbulent diffusion flames from non-circular
burners, and in buoyant and weakly-buoyant nonsooting diffusion flames. Future
use of the equipment for Mie and Rayleigh/Raman scattering measurements is also
anticipated.
