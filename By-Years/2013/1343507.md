This grant supports student participation in a doctoral mentoring consortium at
the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). The
ICAPS Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a primary method for broadening participation
and improving retention of doctoral researchers in the field of automated
planning and scheduling. This DC at ICAPS 2013, June 2013 in Rome, Italy, is the
eleventh occurrence of the event.&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is carrying on a
multiyear tradition of holding DCs and summer schools, providing an important
venue to encourage students and junior researchers in automated planning and
scheduling. Activities include research panel discussions, lunch with mentors,
and poster session held as part of the main conference. The DC brings together a
broader community of researchers in planning and scheduling, promoting
integration with other areas of AI and computer science, and encouraging junior
researchers with a more focused attention to this area than is otherwise
possible in other venues. Of particular note is the potential to involve
participants who might not have attended an AI conference before. This is
especially true for those outside of the usual AI research community: those at
smaller institutions who use AI in teaching but not in research; those from
smaller/liberal arts institutions; and those from institutions that are poorly
represented in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;
