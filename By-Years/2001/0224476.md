This award supports an international workshop to bring awardees of the
Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Networks program funded by the German Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft and of the Arabidopsis 2010 Project funded by the
National Science Foundation. The workshop is to take place on June 29-30, 2002,
in Seville Spain, during the XIIIth International Arabidopsis Research
Conference. The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for the two groups of
scientists to meet face to face and maximize the opportunity to coordinate their
research and to develop research collaboration where appropriate. The two
programs share the same goal of identifying the function of all Arabidopsis
genes by the year 2010. Representatives from the 2010-like programs in other
countries will be invited as observers so that international collaborations
could be expanded beyond Germany and the US. One of the expected outcomes would
be an increased exchange of students and young scientists between participating
laboratories.
