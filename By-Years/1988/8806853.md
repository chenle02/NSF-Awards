This award will facilitate a six-month research visit to Japan by Dr. Lorella M.
Jones of the University of Illinois, where she will collaborate with Professor
Yasuo Hara of the University of Tsukuba. They will use facilities of the
Japanese Laboratory of High Energy Physics (KEK) at Tsukuba to examine the
properties of quark and gluon jets and to search for new heavy particles. Drs.
Jones and Hara are both recognized researchers in the field of elementary
particle physics. Dr. Hara's phenomenological approach will complement the
theoretical emphasis of Dr. Jones' work. KEK offers state-of-the-art
instrumentation for experiments in high energy physics.
