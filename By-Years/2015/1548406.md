This exploratory project is to increase the ability of robots to plan and act on
their own in order to safely complete high-level tasks. Whether the task is to
search, inspect, manipulate objects, or navigate to target destinations, it
generally involves abstractions into discrete, logical actions, where each
discrete action often requires complex collision-free motions in order to be
implemented. This project establishes a unified framework for handling the
discrete and continuous spaces that arise in these
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crucial to this goal, as robots are deployed into
less and less structured environments, is their ability to reason and plan at
multiple levels of discrete and continuous abstractions. This research makes it
possible to specify sophisticated tasks using Planning Domain Definition
Languages and automatically compute a sequence of control inputs such that the
resulting trajectory satisfies the PDDL task specification, avoids collisions
with obstacles, and obeys the motion dynamics and the constraints imposed by
physics-based interactions with the environment.
