On-line monitoring of viable cell density is important in monitoring and
controlling fermentation processes. A new, on-line cell density monitor is
proposed which can measure viable cell density directly in a culture medium. In
this method, viable cells are distinguished from other inert particles or dead
cells by using the characteristics of the living cells. The speed in measurement
is achieved by fast counting. The sensor will be usable in any single cell
cultures without requiring calibrations. An ultraviolet exposure system capable
of transferring a sensor image onto a silicon wafer is to be used to carry out
this project.
