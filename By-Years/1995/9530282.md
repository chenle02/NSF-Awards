95-30282 Binzel Dr. Binzel will carry out a 5-year project of infrared
spectroscopy of asteroids using a new, state-of-the-art spectrograph and the
NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, Mauna Kea, HI. The spectrograph covers the
wavelength range of 0.9 to 1.8 microns and will permit pushing the observational
limits for observing asteroids by at least two magnitudes fainter than previous
observations. The spectrograph was designed, purchased, and tested by the
Principal Investigator through a previous NSF Presidential Young Investigator
award (AST 90-58462). The scientific goals of the observations are manifold.
They include identifying asteroid analogs for ordinary chondrite and basaltic
achondrite meteorites, sampling the range of compositional properties of near-
Earth asteroids, and investigating unusual mineralogies among the asteroids.
Supporting visible wavelength spectra will be obtained via a separate NASA-
funded observing program at Kitt Peak, AZ. The ultimate objective of the
investigation is to improve our knowledge of the relationship between the
principal classes of meteorites and asteroids, and to advance our understanding
of the formation and evolution of the planets ***
