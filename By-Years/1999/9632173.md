9632173 Ge This GOALI project develops a computer-aided methodology for
synthesis of low-harmonic trajectories that would reduce the potential of
vibration and related control problems of high-speed machinery. In addition,it
formulates a trajectory-pattern methodology for optimal design of high-speed
machinery. Collaborative research work is performed with OmniTek Research and
Development, Inc. of Brooklyn, NY under the Faculty-In- Industry aspect of the
GOALI program. Polynominal and spline curves have been widely used for planning
motions of computer controlled machinery. The resulting trajectories, when
expressed in Fourier series, generally indicate a considerable number of
harmonics with high frequencies in the actuator coordinate system. The presence
of such high frequency harmonics in the trajectory is a significant source of
the internal induced vibrations. It is the reduction of these vibration
excitations in high-speed machinery that is addressed in this research
project.***
