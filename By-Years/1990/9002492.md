Research to explore the physical properties of strongly interacting many-
electron systems is proposed. The problems of superconductivity near the metal-
insulator transition of the two- dimensional Hubbard model and the two-
dimensional electron-phonon Holstein model will be studied. In addition, work on
dynamic impurities in metals, periodic Anderson and Kondo lattices is proposed.
A common feature of these problems is the need to use non-perturbative
procedures such as numerical simulation or infinite-order diagrammatic
approximations. This work aims at combining numerical simulations and analytic
many-body techniques.
