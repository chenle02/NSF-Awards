This research is on design for testability (DFT), and associated test generation
algorithms for clocked synchronous circuits. The research approach is to
partition the flip-flops into tow groups, each controllable by its own
independent clock line in the test mode. The result is the decomposition of the
original state machine into two communicating submachines, with flip-flops
grouped so as to simplify the test generation process. Flip-flop partitioning is
stated in terms of a graph representation of flip- flop connectivity. A two
clock decomposition algorithm is being implemented. In test generation, existing
test generators are being adapted to serve as an early proof of the DFT scheme.
Also, a test generation algorithm, based on a two dimensional generalization of
the standard time frame expansion is being implemented and tested against
benchmark circuits.
