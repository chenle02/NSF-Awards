Our understanding of spontaneous mutation is still very incomplete Our
information comes from disparate sources. The best studies on the spectrum of
molecular changes involve somatic mutations in microorganisms. Less is known
about germinal mutations in eukaryotes, although these are the source of
variability for evolution. There have been measurements of rates of germinal
mutations, but their rarity has limited the investigation of the relative
likelihood of different kinds of alterations (base substitutions, insertions,
deletions, transposition) among these mutants. In the case of mutant genes for
inherited diseases in humans, there is extensive information, but vexing
questions about selection leave us uncertain as to the frequency and the
spectrum of the original mutations. Germinal mutations result from a series of
rounds of mitosis followed by meiosis. Little is known about the role of meiosis
in producing new mutants or in screening or modifying those mutants which have
emerged from the preceding mitotic divisions. The vegetative growth habit of
Neurospora is ideally designed for the analysis of spontaneous mutations. The
mutants arise in the selectively neutral environment of the coenocyte and are
revealed for assay in the asexual spores. Ascospores provide convenient material
for the deletion of meiotic mutations, and the distribution of mutants in the
fruiting bodies reveals which mutants are the products of the sexual cycle. A
comparison of these mutants to those from vegetative cells will bridge the gap
between somatic and germinal mutation. We propose a detailed analysis of
spontaneous mutation at a specific locus in Neurospora.mtr is the structural
gene for the neutral amino acid permease, and it offers special advantages for
mutation studies. Selective plating can be used to detect rare mutants (or
recombinants) going in either direction: from wildtype to mtr or the reverse.
The gene has been cloned, so probes are available to examine the molecular
properties of mtr mutants.
