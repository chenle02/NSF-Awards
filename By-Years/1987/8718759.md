Ribosomes are key macromolecular components involved in the synthesis of
proteins. They are made up of proteins and ribosomal RNAs. The goal of this
proposal is to map the relative positions of single-stranded regions of rRNA
that occur on the ribosome, using short, complimentary oligomers as probes.
Interactions will be analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy, energy transfer
techniques and photoaffinity labeling. The distance of selected sites from
various ribosomal proteins will be measured by neutron diffraction. These
studies will provide valuable information on the detailed structure of the
ribosome and ribosomal subunits, and thus enhance our understanding of the
process of protein synthesis.
