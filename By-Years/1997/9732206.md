This project investigates the synthesis of effective algebraic and numerical
algorithms and on their practical and theoretical improvement. This includes the
comprehensive study of practical numerical algorithms for polynomial
rootfinding, which is a central subject of algebraic computing. The study should
include many technical novelties. Another fundamental subject covered by the
project and having ubiquitous applications to many areas of scientific and
engineering computing and signal processing is the computations with structured
matrices. The project also includes various extensions and applications of
polynomial rootfinding and structured matrices, in particular to approximating
polynomial gcd, to polynomial interpolation and multipoint evaluation, and to
solving polynomial systems of equations. The work also applies to sign
determination and modular reduction, which is a central subject of algebraic and
geometric computations, and on decoding the BCH error-correcting codes, in
particular Reed-Solomon codes most important in practice.
