Laboratory experiences have been to enhance student participation in the
scientific process at the introductory and thesis levels. Introductory courses
emphasize small group discussions, self-directed experimental design,
quantitative analysis, and scientific writing. This project is creatine a bridge
to thesis -level research using student designed research projects in
intermediate- and upper-level courses. Students are being taught to apply and
develop the skills they learned in introductory classes towards hypothesis
formulation and recognition of the frame of reference they use in testing a
hypothesis. In collaborative laboratory projects of 3 weeks, in intermediate-
level courses and in coordinated semester long research and seminar projects,
students are focusing on making distinctions between "what" questions
(descriptive science), "how" questions (mechanistic science that focuses on
proximate causation). and "why" questions (applied or design science that
focuses on ultimate causation). They are addressing hypotheses at several levels
of biological organization and using multiple methods of data analysis. This
approach provides the curriculum with an effective transition from introductory-
level investigates to upper-level thesis project. This goal is being achieved by
coordinating laboratory experiences in sophomore- junior- and senior-level
courses in neurobiology, animal physiology, physiology of locomotion, and drug
actions in the nervous system, as well as in research and seminar courses in
animal physiology and neurobiology.
