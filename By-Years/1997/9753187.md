9753187 Schweitzer The goal of this study is to characterize the immunogenicity
and antigenicity of organic compounds associated with unpermineralized bony
tissues from Cretaceous specimens. The specific aims are to chemically extract
minimally altered tissues and to characterize components within these extracts
through a variety of analytical and reflect original molecular structure can be
extracted from fossilized remains and that the immunological reactivity of these
compounds can be used to study evolutionary relationships of extinct organisms.
Technological advances in the last two decades have greatly increased the
sensitivity of molecular analyses. Application of these technologies to ancient
tissues has made it possible to extract molecular information from extinct
organisms, shedding light on phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary
processes. Molecular paleontology has focused primarily on Holocene remains with
remarkable success; application of these same technologies to Cretaceous
specimens is uncommon. However, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility
of applying immunological methods to well preserved and minimally altered
Cretaceous specimens.
