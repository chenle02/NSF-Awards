The purpose of this grant is to provide support for the development of an
assessment framework addressing environmental and health risks associated with
the deliberate release of biotechnology products. Despite rapid growth in
biotechnology sales and development, accepted guidelines for evaluating the
risks of genetically-altered organisms that are deliberately released into the
environment do not exist. As a result, neither government nor private agencies
are able to assess adequately whether the analysis of a planned release is
thorough and competent, and the public therefore may be unable to place the
risks of biotechnology within a realistic perspective. The proposed project
requires the researchers to assess a number of important issues that involve
both theoretical and applied questions of great interest to the scientific
community. For example, what characteristics of the organism are of greatest
concern to the public? What features of the environment need to be taken into
account? How can the scale and anticipated risks of the release be described in
meaningful terms? Answers to these and related questions will be based initially
on the assessment of past releases of modified organisms and an analysis of the
current risk assessment requirements of regulatory agencies; this initial
information base then will be used as the basis for developing an improved risk
assessment framework.
