Photocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules at the surface of titania shows
promise as a method for the remediation of organic contaminated groundwater, and
the destruction of organic contaminants. This project by Professor Engel and his
students at the University of Washington, supported in the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed mechanism of this
photocatalytic oxidation reaction. Ultra high vacuum molecular beam scattering
methods, coupled with scanning probe microscopy for structural characterization
of the titania surface, provide detailed mechanistic and dynamic information
about several model reactions. In particular, acetone, formic acid and propanol
are used as model organic species, and a range of photolysis conditions and
surface conditions are investigated. The photocatalytic detoxification of
organic contaminated groundwater is an important environmental remediation goal.
The work of this project is designed to provide the basic understanding of this
photocatalysis on promising substrates such as titanium dioxide. Structural and
kinetic information is combined to supply a complete picture of the
photocatalytic mechanism. This information will be useful in optimizing both the
catalytic surface and the conditions for environmental remediation processes.*
