Description: This project provides partial support for Dr. Amiya Sen to spend
three months as a guest scientist at the Institute of Plasma Research (IPR) in
Ahmadabad, India. During that period he will be conducting theoretical physics
and mathematical modeling research on the control of disruptions in the ADITYA
Tokamak at the IPR. The concept to be investigated is the use of active feedback
of the instability leading to the disruption. Two possible schemes will be
examined, a helical coil suppressor, and a modulated neutral beam suppressor.
The Indian team, headed by Dr. A. Sen of the IPR, will design and carry out the
experiments for this research which are expected to continue for a much longer
period after the visit of the U.S. scientist. Scope: This cooperative research
between the U.S. scientist and his Indian counterpart should be beneficial to
the two countries. The U.S. P.I. has made a short visit to the IPR last year to
discuss arrangements for the proposed research. As a result an official
invitation was issued by the IPR for him to spend his sabbatical leave there.
That invitataion has been approved by The Government of India. This project
meets the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program criteria.
