9403159 Auerbach Dr. Scott M. Auerbach has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Auerbach's doctoral degree was from the University
of California at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor William Miller. Dr.
Auerbach will continue research at the University of California at Santa Barbara
under the sponsorship of Professor Horia Metiu. Dr. Auerbach's postdoctoral
training will focus on the formation and characterization of compound
semiconductor clusters in zeolites. Dynamics of cluster formation will also be
modelled computationally. Longer term, Dr Auerbach will study the physical
chemistry of technologically significant materials, specializing in catalysis
and transport in microporous inorganic environments. Research in this area has
broad implications in petroleum refining, chemicals production, and pollution
control. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as
an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching. ***
