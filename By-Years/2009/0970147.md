Most of humanity's astronomical knowledge has been obtained through
electromagnetic radiation. Gravitational waves, one of the most dramatic
predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity, will provide an entirely
new way to observe the Universe. This award supports research by the
Gravitational-Wave Group at California State University Fullerton (CSUF)
contributing to the search for gravitational waves with the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The research will focus on i) improving
LIGO's sensitivity to transient astronomical events such as black hole
collisions and supernovae explosions through a reduction of non-stationary noise
in the detector data, and ii) expediting the success of Advanced LIGO by
studying the optical properties of samples of its core and auxiliary optics.
These projects will have significant student involvement and help train the next
generation of physicists. CSUF is a hispanic serving institution. The research
activities funded by this award will provide enhanced opportunities to students
traditionally underrepresented in scientific research.
