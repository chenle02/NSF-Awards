The objective is to design new, conformationally homogeneous, enantioselective
receptors for functionalized, chiral organic molecules such as peptides. The
receptors, that will be synthesized from readily available materials, are
expected to show high distinctions between enantiomeric guests, based on
previous work. Such molecules may form the basis of a practical resolution
method based on chiral polymer beads and simple filtration. The binding data
collected will also be valuable for testing the computational methods for
predicting binding properties. Such predictions are crucial for truly rational
molecular design. To use free energy simulations for reliable predictions,
recent results suggest that impractically long simulations may be necessary.
Consequently, new methods will be designed to accelerate dramatically the
convergence to stable free energies. These enhancements will include the
development of useful and more realistic continuum solvation models, and mixed
dynamics/Monte Carlo simulation methods. %%% With this award, the Organic
Synthesis Program will support the research of Dr. W. Clark Still at Columbia
University. The synthesis of enantioselective receptors will be undertaken,
guided by theoretical considerations. This will allow the chemist to separate
the mirror image forms of chiral molecules. The ability to do this
systematically on a large scale will provide an important tool to synthesize the
increasingly complex substances needed in biochemistry and medicine, as will as
in the chemical industry.
