This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award integrates
research with an enhanced teaching curriculum that stresses early exposure of
students to filed and primary research activities. The overall plan has two
basic components: 1) a five year research plan involving the production of a
single-authored book and an edited volume; and, 2) a teaching plan which
stresses interaction between field experience, research training, and classroom
work. The research plan sheds theoretical light on the links between large-scale
social changes and recent institutional changes and political realignments in
Latin America. It also promotes and empirically-grounded agenda of research on
the links between social change and political change. The research involves work
on the recasting of populist parties in Latin America, as well as research
exploring the broader dimensions of social change and democratic politics in
past decades. The education plan is based on the notion that students' learning
experience can be greatly enhanced by first-hand and practical exposure to the
contexts and issues they are studying, and that early opportunities for field
research are vital to training for future scholarship. Through the
investigator's own research activities and teaching curriculum innovations,
research and field experience opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students will be expanded, and students will gain greater exposure to the
practical contexts they are studying. The main types of exposure under this plan
are field research experience through the linking of study abroad with field
research opportunities, as well as integration of support for primary research
into regular undergraduate seminars and independent projects. Student contact
with activists and practitioners in the classroom, and student participation in
individual and collaborative research activities, are included in this research-
education activity.
