Productivity of temperate forests typically is limited by nitrogen supply
Nitrogen cycling in forests is linked to regional and global environmental
issues, such as groundwater quality and the trace gases composition of the
atmosphere. Forests are being fertilized to stimulate forest growth to meet
increasing demands for forest products, and are being used as "living filters"
to remove nitrogen from applied wastewater. Extensive forested areas are
receiving excessive additions of nitrogen through nitrogenous components of acid
rain. Although general patterns of nitrogen cycling in unimpacted forests are
known, little is known about the nitrogen accumulation potential of forests, or
the ability of forests to handle chronic excess nitrogen additions. This
research is first of all a comparative ecosystem study of the effects of excess
nitrogen additions on nitrogen cycling in early, mid- and late-successional
forests on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Secondly, this study will take advantage of
a natural experiment inadvertently set up by the Town of Falmouth, in which 24
hectares of forests and successional vegetation are scheduled to be irrigated
with wastewater highly enriched with 15N, a stable isotope of nitrogen. The
presence of this 15N label will enable isotopic analyses to be used to trace the
fate of the wastewater nitrogen added to the Cape Code forests. The research at
the Falmouth site began in 1985, when the wastewater treatment plant was still
under construction. In the elapsed 2.5 years a baseline study of nitrogen
cycling in the forests has been completed. It is expected that research results
will be of fundamental ecological importance and applicable to the treatment and
use of municipal wastes.
