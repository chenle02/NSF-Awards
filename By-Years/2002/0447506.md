Plants react to chemical and biological challenges from the environment with
rapid changes in biochemical processes and gene expression. These responses
cause plants to adapt by altering their chemical composition, their cell
structure and how they grow. The set of immediate biochemical and genetic
changes is termed the stress- or defense response, depending on whether the
inciting agent is an organism or an environmental stress, such as excess light
or an air pollutant. Ozone is a common air pollutant that affects plants in
urban environments, the productivity of crop plants, and the health of forests
at high altitudes. The present project focuses on the response of the model
plant Arabidopsis to ozone. Leaf tissues respond very rapidly to ozone gas (even
at levels reached in summer in large metropolitan areas) by producing bursts of
highly reactive forms of oxygen, called reactive oxygen species. This response
is called the "oxidative burst" and serves both a signaling function and as a
cell-death trigger. Signals are transmitted within cells by a 3-component
(heterotrimeric) G protein, as well as through other signaling pathways,
including mitogen activated protein kinase cascades. The present research seeks
to understand the role of the G protein in the oxidative stress response to
ozone. The first objective is to ask how the components of the heterotrimeric G
protein interact with each other, as well as with other proteins, during the
ozone-induced stress response, and whether a subunit of the G protein is the
direct target of activation in response to ozone. These experiments will be
carried out using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, immunochemical
methods, tandem affinity purification, and mass spectrometry. The second
objective is to identify genes whose transcript abundance is regulated through
signals transmitted through the G protein and those regulated through other
signals using cDNA microarray expression profiling. Broader Impact: The
importance of this work lies in the fact that the metabolic changes that
comprise the stress response depress plant productivity; thereby decreasing crop
yields. Understanding how plants respond to stress at the molecular level is one
of the most important areas for the future of agriculture and sustainable
development. Expanding knowledge about molecular and genetic networks activated
by stress will open new knowledge-based avenues for enhancing the productivity
of plants under suboptimal conditions, a central task in achieving global food
security. In addition, this project will also provide training for several
undergraduate and graduate students.
