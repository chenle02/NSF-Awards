Dilip Kondepudi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical studies of auto
catalytic and stochastic kinetics of crystallization. He plans to study the
fundamental aspects of spontaneous generation, propagation and amplification of
chiral asymmetry. Kondepudi has discovered that stirred solutions of sodium
chlorite crystallize with nearly 100% either dextro- or levorotatory crystals.
His research program has been directed at attempting to model and explain this
phenomenon of spontaneous generation of chiral symmetry. He has shown that the
amplification arises as a non-linear process caused by secondary nucleation
after the breakup of a small crystallite in the stirring process. He plans to
extend the experiments in new directions, particularly with regard to primary
and secondary nucleation studies of amino acids. It is well known that for many
drug compounds only one enantiomer is biologically active, and in some well
known cases the other enantiomer may have deleterious side effects including
genetic damage. Understanding of physical and chemical processes that generate
chiral asymmetry may be of great practical value in improving methods to produce
enantiomerically pure compounds.
