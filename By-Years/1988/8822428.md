This award will support collaborative research between Dr. William F. Pickard
of Washington University and Dr. Peter E. H. Minchin, Physics and Engineering
Laboratory, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), Lower Hutt,
New Zealand. The investigators intend to test the hypothesis that phloem (the
principle food conducting tissur in plants) transport might be regulated by
sharply dropping the temperature of the calicum channels in the phloem plasma
membrane. Progress has been slow in characterizing the calcium channels in
plants, and this research should help in understanding the nature and importance
of these channels. The project continues collaboration of these scientists who
initially discovered that momentary interruption of phloem transport was
sensitive to temperature variations. The facilities of the DSIR include unique
access to carbon isotopes, which will be used to monitor, in real time,
transport profiles in the phloem of several plants. The research should add
considerably to basic knowledge of phloem physiology. Ultimately, the results
should be of agricultural significance since they relate to plant ability to
withstand insect predation.
