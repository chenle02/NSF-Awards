This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to determine
the feasibility of using photomixing (optical heterodyning) in resonant laser-
assisted field emission as a new means for generating terahertz (THz) radiation.
The many applications of THz radiation include imaging (package inspection,
structural examination, cancer detection), spectroscopy (catalysis, reaction
kinetics, environmental studies), astronomy (local oscillators, imaging arrays),
and high-bandwidth communications. However, researchers describe "hurdles"
caused by present THz sources, including limited bandwidth and power. A
resonance of optical radiation with tunneling electrons, discovered in quantum
simulations, was used to gate field emission current with a laser. Because the
tip is much smaller than the laser wavelength, electron emission varies at the
optical frequency, and field emission is highly nonlinear, so signals from DC to
100 THz could be generated by photomixing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications of this project would be tunable sources with greater bandwidth.
These devices are now used as local oscillators in radio astronomy.There is some
evidence that the new technology may have a flat frequency response at THz
frequencies. Possible applications of resonant laser-assisted field emission
would also include areas where the resistance of field emission to ionizing
radiation and wide ranges of ambient temperature are required.&lt;br/&gt;
