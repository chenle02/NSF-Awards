The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a plasma reactor that facilitates the production of sustainable
fertilizers and various value-added chemicals using renewable and grid
electricity. The proposed environmentally conscious approach has the potential
to decrease CO2 emissions linked to traditional fertilizer production, and
mitigate climate change. In addition, the proposed technology is scalable, which
may allow small-scale farms, including those in disadvantaged communities, to
produce their own fertilizer, stabilizing nutrient prices and supply while
minimizing the environmental impact of transportation. The commercial impact of
this project extends beyond fertilizer production, as the technology may be
harnessed to generate a wide range of valuable chemicals for different
industries.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a plasma reactor that uses
gases, water, and renewable electricity as inputs to generate various chemicals
such as nitrates, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. The proposed core technology,
referred to as plasma reforming, employs low-temperature plasmas as catalysts
for chemical transformations, concentrating on converting air and water into
highly liquid fertilizers. Designed as a one-step process for direct nitrogen
fixation, the technology eliminates the need for secondary process stages. It
may operate intermittently, be controlled remotely, and its modular design
supports scalability from kilowatt to megawatt power loads. The proposed plasma
reactor technology is suitable for both small-scale and large-scale production,
permitting easy expansion as demand for chemicals and electrical load increases.
The plasma reactor may also be used to generate other chemicals such as
hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia, which are used in a wide range of industrial
and commercial applications.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
