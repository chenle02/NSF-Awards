This project will continue geomicrobiology studies in the Cabo Rojo Salterns
Microbial Observatory in Puerto Rico. The project will provide significant
research training experience for students, especially undergraduates. The multi-
institutional team includes researchers in the Biology Departments at the
University of Puerto Rico-Humacao and UPR-Mayaguez, and the University of
Connecticut. They will undertake a multidisciplinary research effort to study
the geological contributions of microorganisms in the Cabo Rojo salterns. Two
different microbial mat systems in the salterns will be used to compare how
microbial metabolism alters the geochemical characteristics of sediments and
ultimately defines the microscale mineralogy. The production of biogenic gases
by these different microbial communities will also be studied. As the salterns
are characterized by extreme seasonal changes, their metabolic and community
composition is continuously altered leading to differential patterns of gene and
protein expression. Knowledge of the molecular aspects that control the
precipitation and dissolution of key minerals such as calcium carbonate has
important implications with respect to sediment formation, construction of
oceanic reefs and deterioration of stone monuments. By the identification of
genes and proteins crucial for the regulation of these processes, it may be
possible to control and possibly even manipulate them at the molecular level.
Besides the scientific contributions, the most valuable products of this project
are a generation of Puerto Rican students trained with state-of-the-art
techniques. Students will benefit with a series of workshops and conferences, a
summer exchange program with students at the University of Connecticut, and a
pioneer program providing information about the field of geomicrobiology to K-12
students. Students will also construct a weather station that will be publicly
accessible to monitor the conditions atthe observatory via the internet.
