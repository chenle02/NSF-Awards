Abstract 9616251 Fraser-Smith This project operates an extremely low frequency
and very low frequency (ELF/VLF) radiometer at McMurdo, Antarctica to monitor
radio noise from natural sources such as thunderstorms. It is one of a network
of eight such radiometers which is operated by Stanford University for the
Office of Naval Research. It is important for operational purposes to
characterize the possible sources of radio interference. Additionally, the
variations in global noise, reflects variations in global thunderstorm activity
and can therefore provide information on global climate change. The site where
the radiometer is located in Antarctica was chosen about 15 years ago because it
is unusually free from man-made electromagnet interference. The ELF/VLF record
now extends unbroken for more than 10 years. ***
