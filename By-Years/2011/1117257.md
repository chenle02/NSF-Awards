This project investigates computational techniques for modeling dissipative
physical systems experiencing contact, impact, friction and plasticity. The
attendant optimization problems are strongly nonlinear, nonsmooth, and nonconvex
in nature, necessitating the development of novel numerical methods. The
research grounds the development of these methods by building on discrete
geometric mechanics and variational integrators, which restate the fundamental
principles of physics in a discrete, hence immediately computable form. The
research examines five core behaviors arising from the Principle
(momentum/energy/symmetry preservation, breaking contact, and non-
interpenetration) and thereby derives computer algorithms whose outputs capture
these physical behaviors. The project success is measured by (a) the production
of novel computer algorithms that are able to simulate dissipative physical
phenomena more accurately and efficiently than ever before, (b) new theoretical
results on what can be expected of computer algorithms that simulate these
phenomena, and (c) the successful adoption of the novel techniques by industry
partners. The project results are publicly disseminated via articles in
journals, release of source code on the world wide web, and transfer of
technological expertise and data to industrial partners. &lt;br/&gt;Improving
computational techniques for the simulation of contact, impact, and dissipative
phenomena helps make engineering safety analyses, biomechanical models, computer
visualizations, surgical training tools, and industrial manufacturing
simulations that better predict reality. Algorithms that accurately capture the
physics help to gain important new insights into many open questions that
influence our understanding of large-scale geophysics of earthquakes and calving
of icebergs, small-scale dissipation in high-frequency micro- and nano-
electronic mechanical devices, prosaic domestic phenomena such as the chattering
of chalk on a board and even the excitation of violin strings.
