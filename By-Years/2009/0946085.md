This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop polymer
dopants that expedite processing and increase yield of well aligned VA
(Vertically aligned) nematic cells in order to improve large area LCD display
technology: Polymer-stabilized vertically aligned nematic (VAN) LCDs for HDTV.
The nematic-polymer mixtures will be optimized to establish reliable processes
to produce well aligned, fast switching cells in high yield that can be used in
displays and other EO devices benefiting from PS-VA remarkably fast switching
speed.

The LCD flat panel display market has been growing at a steady rate, even in the
midst of the economic downturn. The additives developed in this project would
replace the currently used reactive monomers and UV processing step,
significantly reducing the cost and improving lifetime while retaining the
excellent speed advantages of the PS-VA display.
