Light affects daily (circadian) and seasonal cycles in physiology and behavior.
Dr. Nunez will examine the neural and endocrine systems that mediate these
effects of light on these biological rhythms. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the
hypothalamus is believed to be the neural substrate for the biological clock.
Therefore, Dr. Nunez will concentrate on identifying the outputs of the nucleus
to determine how circadian signals reach the rest of the central nervous system.
Both the circadian system and the suprachiasmatic nucleus are involved in the
generation of seasonal reproductive cycles but the projection or output from
this neural structure involved in seasonal cycles appears to be different than
the projections responsible for daily cycles. It appears that seasonal cycles
may also involve the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Dr. Nunez will
also investigate the pathways that originate in this brain structure. In
addition, he will elucidate the endocrine changes that are produced by neural
damage that abolishes seasonal cyclicity. Information about the anatomy and
physiology of this biological clock provides the basic science for a more
comprehensive understanding of certain psychiatric disorders at the extreme and
fluctuations in mood and productivity in the more normal range. An additional
value of knowledge of controls of photoperiodism may lie in an increased
efficiency in animal husbandry.
