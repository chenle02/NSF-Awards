The rapidly increasing number of individuals suffering from chronic diseases is
placing an unprecedented demand on the traditional healthcare. The medical care
costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75% of the estimated
$1.4 trillion for medical care costs in the United States. Yet, there are
significant challenges in creating technologies that enable individuals to
proactively manage their health and that enable physicians, therapists and
educators to effectively and efficiently treat people with chronic, long-term
health challenges. This research examines the role of personal health
technologies for individuals and health care practitioners engaged in chronic
disease management and disease prevention and wellness. Building on our initial
research in technologies for diabetes management, we propose four threads of
inquiry that are integrated into our research activities: (1) Mobile
Technologies for Personalized Health, (2) Automated Techniques for In-The-Moment
Health Advice, (3) Tools for Experimentation, and (4) Measurement Techniques to
Assess Personal Health Care Technologies.

The broad goal is to design technologies that help people take ownership of
their own health and wellness. Advancing the use of information technologies
outside of the scope of traditional critical care is of paramount importance for
making progress in this thorny area. Research results will begin to push the
influence of health technologies ?up the chain? from disease management to
disease prevention and wellness.
