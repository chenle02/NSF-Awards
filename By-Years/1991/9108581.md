This grant supports the research of Professor Wolfgang Schmidt to work on
diophantine problems. He will work on polynomial-exponential equations, linear
recurrences, and the number of integer solutions of Siegel's theorem on curves.
He also wishes to work on extending Vojta's refinement of the subspace theorem
to a wider framework. This is research in the field of number theory. Number
theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of
one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it
was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last
half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
