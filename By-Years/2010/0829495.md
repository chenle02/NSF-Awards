The Yellowstone Ecological Research Center is awarded a grant to support
construction of a carbon-neutral, multifunctional building to support
established biological research and education activities in the GYE. The
proposed 6900 square-foot structure (to replace existing outdated structures
already on site) will provide overnight accommodations for 18 people, a meeting
room/lecture hall for 50, two lab/classroom areas for groups of up to 16
students, areas dedicated to computers and data management, a
garage/shop/staging area, and areas dedicated to equipment storage and
maintenance. It is designed to meet or exceed ADA compliance and be carbon-
neutral to the extent possible given the extreme climatic regime of Cooke City
winter seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yellowstone Ecological Research Center
(YERC) is a non-profit organization that began in 1993 as a program of research
and education in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), a 7.3 million hectare
(18 million acre) area centered on Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and
surrounding National Forests and Wildlife Refuges. The mission of YERC is to
conduct and support collaborative research and education to advance the role of
science in the Yellowstone region.
