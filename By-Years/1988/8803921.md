This award is for the development of a computer program for use in the
beginning stages of the design process. The program will lead the user through
problem definition and conceptual design. Being general in nature, it will help
in the development of products and processes based on mechanical, electrical and
other physical effects. The program will contain the following data bases:
Questions and data for specification lists, functions for generating functional
block diagrams, and solutions to satisfy the functional requirements. The user
will be able to add new functions and solutions, thus continually increasing the
program's knowledge base. The procedures are based on the systematic design
technique which has proved itself to be a rational method for developing new and
improving existing products and ensures that design proceeds without prejudice
and no unusual solutions are overlooked. The method progresses in a scientific
manner and leads to several concepts for fulfilling a given task, which are then
evaluated and ranked. The final product of the program will be a functional
schematic of the product/process showing a pictorial view of its parts which are
drawn from the solutions data base.
