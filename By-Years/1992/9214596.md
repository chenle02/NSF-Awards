This proposal requests funds for an inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometer. It will be used for trace element analyses in research projects in
geochemistry; environmental, diagenetic and paleclimatic research projects will
also use the equipment. There are five senior personnel who will use the
facility on a regular basis. Their projects include: mantle petrology, lunar
petrology, early sediment analysis, study of trace elements in lakes, trace
elements in sediments, studies of pollutant metals in waterways, studies of
terrestrial mass extinctions, groundwater analysis, Other campus researchers
will also use the facility.
