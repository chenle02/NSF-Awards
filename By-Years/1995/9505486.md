The goal of this project is the development of a general approach to explanation
generation for advice-giving systems that use mathematical or other quantitative
problem-solving methods. Specific objectives are: (1) Development of a
generalized methodology for this type of explanation; (2) Implementation of this
methodology in a prototype system that can be used in different applications;
and (3) Creation of systems for real-life environments. In this approach to
explanation generation, the first task is determining the substance of the
explanation, that is, discovering which quantitative values contribute to the
decision process. The second task is translating the quantitative values into
concepts that are understood by the non-technical user. The significance of this
research lies in the development of rigorous methods for performing these tasks:
how to represent the different conceptual ``worlds'' of the quantitative system
and the lay user; how to determine significant factors for explanation; and how
to translate between the two worlds. Practical implications include the
possibility of d eveloping explanation generators for `off-the-shelf' decision
support systems used by individuals who are not familiar with the formal models.
As a result, these systems would be better accepted and more generally used.
