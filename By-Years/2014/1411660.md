This collaborative, exploratory, learning strand project focuses on improving
reflective decision-making among elementary school students during the planning
and re-design activities of the engineering design process. Five teacher
researchers in three elementary schools provide the classroom laboratories for
the study. Specified units from Engineering is Elementary, a well-studied
curriculum, provide the engineering content. In year one, the qualitative
research observes student discourse as students develop designs. Based on the
results, a paper engineering note book with prompts is designed for use in year
two while a digital notebook is developed. In year three, the students use the
digital notebook to develop their designs and redesigns.

The research identifies patterns of language that contribute to the reflective
discourse and determines how the paper and electronic versions of the notebook
improve the discourse. An advisory committee provides advice and evaluation. The
notebooks are described in conference proceedings and made available online.

This work synthesizes what is known about the use of the notebooks in science
and engineering education at the elementary school and investigates how to
improve their use through digital media.
