A recently revised curriculum requires a sequence in Cell Biology and Genetics.
This project will assist the department in strengthening and improving
undergraduate laboratory instruction in these two courses. An epifluorescence
microscope, ultracentrifuge, and UV/VIS scanning spectrophotometer will aid in
the introduction of concepts, principles, and procedures germane to molecular
biology. The instrumentation will also enhance student research projects which
can now focus on contemporary molecular biology. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
