Dr. Hanna Reisler and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Southern California are being supported to provide a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98,
eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged
in basic research projects that facilitate visualization of chemical processes
at the molecular level in the subdisciplines of physical, theoretical, and
materials chemistry. Participants are recruited nation-wide. In addition to
research projects and a final poster presentation, participants engage in
informal evening tutorials on subjects ranging from quantum mechanics to issues
of ethics. Visits to several large research and development laboratories in the
Los Angeles area serve to illustrate technological implications of basic
research.
