The proposal outlines a program of exploring different aspects of
low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional dynamics:&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial and geometric issues
of holomorphic dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;its interplay with one-dimensional real
dynamics &lt;br/&gt; (particularly in the rigidity and renormalization
theories),&lt;br/&gt;interaction with three dimensional hyperbolic geometry and
the theory of&lt;br/&gt;foliations, analytic and geometric aspects of two
dimensional complex and&lt;br/&gt;real dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
dynamical systems theory studies the evolution of various
systems&lt;br/&gt;arising in physics, biology, engineering etc., as well as
simplified&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for those systems. It has been realized
in the past 25&lt;br/&gt;years that even one- or two- dimensional models can
exhibit rich and&lt;br/&gt;important phenomena. It has been also realized that
the methods of complex&lt;br/&gt;analysis provide powerful tools for dealing
with these systems. The&lt;br/&gt;proposal intends to explore further this
branch of dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
