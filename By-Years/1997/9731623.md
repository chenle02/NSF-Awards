Lou, Yu-Qing AST-9731623 Drs. Lou and Rosner will investigate magneto-
hydrodynamic wave processes in magnetized, late-type stellar atmospheres and
winds, combining analytical and numerical techniques to several specific
problems. Their work has application to various nonlinear dynamic processes in
magnetized stellar atmospheres and the basic problem of mass losses through the
process of stellar wind acceleration. Their theoretical investigations have
bearing on the larger issues of stellar and solar activity and atmospheric
heating, massive wind outflows, and stellar oscillations.
