Sen 9423598 The objective of this project is to hold a workshop on the subject
of stochastic optimization and its applications. Stochastic optimization is a
subset of the general subject area of mathematical optimization. However, unlike
most optimization techniques in which the values of the parameters in the model
are assumed to be known with certainty, in stochastic optimization, this is not
the case. Stochastic optimization recognizes the presence of uncertainties in
the values of model parameters. This is an area of optimization that attempts to
capture the uncertainties that exist in modeling and solving real life problems.
This workshop is aimed at providing a forum whereby researchers, industrial
practitioners, and graduate students with interest in the subject area of
stochastic optimization can meet to discuss current research directions and
emphasis, share research results, and identify the challenges and direction for
future research. Invitees to the workshop will consists of known researchers and
industrial practitioners in the field. Graduate students will be invited to gain
some insights on what the research needs and directions are. Stochastic
Optimization has become one the fastest growing fields in mathematical
programming. The growth is the results of the increasing recognition that
uncertainty plays a critical role in many decision making and design
environments. The various sectors in business, science, engineering, and the
social sciences where stochastic optimization can be applied make the
development of this subject area very critical. A better understanding of how to
integrate uncertainties into decision making will significantly improve decision
making processes and ultimately, the quality of life.
