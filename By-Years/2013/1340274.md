This workshop will address the need for the neural engineering community to meet
and address some of the major problems facing the progress in the area of Neural
Interfacing in before the 6th International Neural Engineering Conference that
will take place in San Diego just prior to the Society for Neuroscience meeting.
There are currently unsolved problems at the interface between the nervous
system (both peripheral and central) that prevent clinical implementation for
therapy. These problems involve both engineering and neuroscience and in
particular, biocompatibility, mechanical properties, materials properties,
electrochemistry, neural tissue repair and immune response. In particular
outstanding benefits will be derived from the area of neuro-prosthetics,
understanding the brain circuitry, engineering the brain and neuro-modulation
where it is possible to intervene directly to control or modulate the nervous
system. A report will be developed based on the meeting discussions to provide
guidance for possible future programs.
