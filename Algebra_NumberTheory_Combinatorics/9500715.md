This project is concerned with the representation theory of algebraic groups and
Lie algebras. The spectrum of the cohomology ring will be a fundamental object
of interest. This will enable the principal investigator to apply methods from
algebraic geometry and algebraic topology in order to understand the
representation/cohomology theory of these groups and algebras. The research
supported concerns the representation theory of various algebraic objects
including algebraic groups and Lie algebras. Representation theory is an
important method for determining the structure of these objects. This work has
important implications for a number of areas of mathematics including ring
theory, group theory, topology and the study of Lie algebras.
