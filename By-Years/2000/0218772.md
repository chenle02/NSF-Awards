Water and carbon dioxide, in either liquid or supercritical phases, are widely
regarded as&lt;br/&gt;environmentally benign media for organic chemical
reactions. Significant effort has been&lt;br/&gt;devoted to developing useful
chemistries in these solvents as a means of pollution prevention. All of this
previous work has used either water or carbon dioxide separately. The proposed
research involves the use of mixtures of these two compounds as the reaction
medium for acid-catalyzed, organic chemical reactions. Water will be the main
component in the system. Experiments with different acid-catalyzed reactions
(e.g., phenol alkylation, alcohol dehydration, etc.) will be performed, and the
effects of the composition of the reaction medium, the system density,
temperature, reactant concentrations, and reaction time on reactant conversion
and product yields will be determined. In terms of the broader impacts, acid-
catalyzed reactions are used widely in the chemical industry. It has been
estimated that the number of commercially important acid-catalyzed reactions
exceeds the number of all other catalytic reactions combined. Therefore,
advances that make acid-catalysis more environmentally benign could have a broad
impact throughout the chemical industry. The practice of incorporating examples
from the research in graduate and undergraduate class will be continued. The
results from this research project will provide the reaction kinetics and
mechanistic insights, information that is needed to assess the technical,
economic, and environmental feasibility of doing acid catalysis in carbon
dioxide-enriched high temperature water.&lt;br/&gt;
