The discovery of the hydrothermal vents of the deep-sea has led to dramatic
rethinking of how entire ecosystems can be fueled through primary production
sources. Chemosynthetic production by marine bacteria are now known to support
diverse, thriving and unusual communities of living organisms in locations that
would have been unexpected a decade ago. The use of sulfur compounds, important
to deep-sea hydrothermal vents, has sparked an interest in worlds which are
closer to our everyday experience -- salt marshes, mangrove systems, and sewage
outfalls and treatment systems. These discoveries have also stimulated a great
interest in other types of chemical-based synthetic systems, for example, the
newly discovered ability of animal/bacterial associations to utilize methane
(natural gas) in hydrocarbon seeps on the sea floor. Dr. Jannasch has been one
of the nation's and world's leaders in the study of the exciting microbiology of
the vent ecosystems. He has been extremely productive in the discovery,
identification, and characterization of naval life forms. The proposed studies
will continue these investigations and begin to assess how the organic biomass
(food) produced by the deep-sea bacteria is transferred in the food web to
associated animals. The Biological Oceanography Program recommends support for
Dr. Jannasch's investigations at the following levels: FY87, $128,101, FY88,
$157,130; FY89, $164,769.
