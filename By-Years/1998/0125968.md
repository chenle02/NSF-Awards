The Tibetan Plateau deforms over time much more than any other large piece of
continental crust on earth. Unlike most tectonically active regions, the effects
of plate motion there are not localized to a narrow boundary separating India
and Asia, but are spread across thousands of kilometers, from the Himalayan
foothills to Mongolia. Where this deformation occurs within the Plateau is still
mostly unknown, as are the basic physical mechanisms driving it. The work
supported by this funding intends to attack both of these mysteries by improving
mathematical models of crustal deformation to include edge and surface effects
hypothesized for the Himalayan boundary, and by making direct measurements of
the velocities of remote parts of Tibet using GPS geodesy. Existing models of
Tibetan dynamics have not yet addressed the development of the shape of the
Himalayan arc. Existing maps of observed Tibetan surface velocities are still
mostly blank. It is currently impossible to differentiate among competing
hypotheses of how Tibet grows and moves based on predictions of surface motions
or of geographic shapes.
