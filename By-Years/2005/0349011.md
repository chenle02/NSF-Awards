This research in the Kingdom of Tonga studies whether Tongans think of democracy
as a solution to the problems connected with the country's non-industrialized
status. The research hypothesizes that many Tongans feel that their culture
history is congruent with their monarchy, and explains the Tongan way of
conceptualizing and realizing social relationships and social networks by a
cultural model of "radiality". Over a period of 15 months including two months
of fieldwork in Tonga, the investigator will use linguistic and cognitive
anthropological theory and methods to investigate Tongan conceptions of and
linguistic representations of social relationships. Data will be collected on
observed interactions in public p laces; a survey of social networks in
villages; and ego-centered cognitive networks. The ethnographic data will be
digitized and represented as spatial relations. The project will analyze how
Tongans actively use radial concepts in generating their political actions. The
project also involves experts in social network analysis and in 3-D imaging, who
will collaborate in developing the model of radiality. This investigation
contributes substantially to current research in cognitive science about the
modular organization of cognitive architecture, specifically, how mental modules
are related.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The new knowledge to be produced by this
project will be of interest to politicians and development specialists planning
for reactions to newly introduced democratic concepts and institutions. The
project will increase our understanding of the impact of cultural models on
behavior, and more specifically, how political action is often rooted in
culturally preferred ways of representing and organizing knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;
