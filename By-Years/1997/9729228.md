9729228 Senk Researchers at Michigan State University and the University of
South Florida are investigating what is known about student performance outcomes
related to the comprehensive mathematics instructional materials for K-12
schools that were developed with NSF support. This funding began in the early
1990s and the materials have now been developed, field tested, and are now
available from commercial publishers. Student performance data were collected by
the development projects during the pilot and field testing and a number of
reports have been published in the research literature concerning these results.
The Michigan State and South Florida researchers are studying this data and are
reporting on the results in a form that is readily digested by the potential
users of the instructional materials: parents, teachers, school administrators,
and others interested in mathematics education.
