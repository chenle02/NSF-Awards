0201927 Humayun The goals of this project will be to design and develop a
retinal prosthesis module for intraocular implantation. The design will have a
sensor/power unit and an electronic retinal stimulator array. Both components
will use available technologies to the maximum extent possible.

Program elements: a) Assess and develop a novel implantable image sensor/power
receiver unit using available technology (via DARPA/NRL program) to the maximum
extent possible. b) Integrate the camera/power unit and channel glass electrode
package with stimulator electronics and verify system operation.
