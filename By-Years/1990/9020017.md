Title: US-Poland Mathematics Research in Algebraic Topology The primary
objective of this US-Poland research project between Professor Peter May of the
University of Chicago and Professor Stefan Jackowski of Warsaw University is to
continue major collaborative efforts in equivariant algebraic topology and the
related areas of homotopy theory and manifold theory. The researchers intend to
concentrate upon maps between classifying spaces of compact Lie groups which are
central to many branches of mathematics and play a fundamental role in
theoretical physics. There is already considerable cooperation amongst the
various participants involved in this proposal and number of joint publications
have been produced. Their continued efforts should yield further detailed
information on the properties of the classifying spaces of compact Lie groups
and the various algebraic structures associated with them. This project in
mathematics research fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
