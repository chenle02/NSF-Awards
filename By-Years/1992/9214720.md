Investigators from Morris Brown College, an undergraduate institution, propose
to purchase a liquid scintillation counter for biological research, particularly
in areas of microbiology and cell biology. The instrumentation will be used in
studies of Tetrahymena and cultured eukaryotic cells, among other topics. The
instrumentation will also contribute extensively to the training of students in
biological and environmental research and technology.
