OCE-9415598 Ledwell A chemical tracer (Sulfur Hexafluoride) and RAFOS floats
will be released to study vertical and horizontal mixing and stirring in two
deep areas of the Brazil Basin, one in the interior and the other near the
western boundary. The purpose of the experiment is to compare mixing rates at
two different sites and compare the vertical diffusitivities to estimates
obtained by closing a basin-wide heat budget.
