The objective of the study is to identify and quantify the hydrologic flowpaths
important in streamflow generation on a forested watershed located in the humid
Northeast of the United States. Research involves analysis of stormflow and
baseflow, combining hydrometric measurements (rainfall, streamflow, water table
elevation, and soil moisture) with the use of naturally occurring tracers (18 O,
Cl- , and 222Rn) to provide multiple constraints on the possible scenarios for
streamflow generation. The study includes a two- component (upland and near-
channel wetland) conceptualization of the watershed. The information on and
knowledge about hydrologic flowpaths produced by the study will be crucial for
accurately assessing and modeling the transport of chemicals deposited on
forested watersheds and in their behavior under extreme rainfall conditions.
