This award supports continued study of the paleontology of Seymour Island,
Antarctica. The award will allow data reduction to complete the ongoing
taxonomic study of the Late Cretaceous early Tertiary molluscan fauna collected
during previous U.S. sponsored expeditions and recently collected material
during a joint Argentine-American expedition. The systematic review of the
bivalves component of the fauna has been completed. It is anticipated that with
the completion of this work, a detailed data base for the late Cretaceous/early
Tertiary of Antarctica will provide new insight not only into the nature of the
faunal turnover in the high southern latitudes at the end of the Cretaceous, but
also in to the recovery of the marine faunas during the early Tertiary. These
data will provide a solid foundation for integrating ongoing biogeographic
studies in South America and Australia.
