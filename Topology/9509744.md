9509744 Goodwillie This project uses several kinds of 'functorial calculus' to
investigate the homotopy types of spaces of diffeomorphisms and spaces of smooth
embeddings. These techniques exploit multirelative connectivity estimates to
describe continuous functors of various types in terms of special values; for
example, a functor of topological spaces might be recovered from its values at
highly connected spaces, or a functor of subspaces of a manifold, from its
values at zero-dimensional subspaces, or a functor of real inner product spaces,
from its values at high-dimensional spaces. The project is to refine and combine
these techniques and to apply them to various questions in differential
topology. Each 'functorial calculus' mentioned above is so called because of a
not-entirely-fanciful resemblance to the ordinary 'functional calculus' of
Newton and Leibniz. Sometimes a fact about numbers is best proved by placing it
in a context where a number is part of a huge family of numbers -- a numerical
function. Properties of the function then lead, by general theorems of calculus
that may seem a bit magical on first encountering them, to a computation of the
number. So it is here: sometimes a fact about some geometrically defined object
is best proved by placing it in a context where the object is part of a huge
family of such objects -- a functor -- and using some magic of a more modern
kind. This analogy may convey something of the flavor of the research; the
content is harder to convey, because most of the 'geometric' objects in question
are connected to everyday reality only by rather long chains of abstract ideas.
(Despite the intervention of similar long chains of abstract ideas, however, one
finds that the 'objects' physicists study predict real physical phenomena with
uncanny precision.) ***
