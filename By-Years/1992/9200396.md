The School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science at the University of
Oklahoma is establishing a REU site with a special focus on the development of
enhanced materials and structural components used for small-scale modeling.
Three laboratory projects have been identified for the program: the design of
improved micro-concrete mixtures, bond strength of deformed small- scale
reinforcing bars in micro-concrete, and small scale modeling of base isolation
systems. All three projects improve the capabilities of small-scale models used
to investigate the seismic performance of new or existing structural systems.
Students will be divided into three equal size groups. Each group will work on
one project for two months. This REU site will provide a "total" experience to
the participants: learning, research, report writing, and presentation.
