Thermoluminescence dating (TL) is a technique which holds out great promise for
archaeology in the age determination of inorganic materials, especially in the
period beyond 50,000 years ago. Unfortunately, many complications in the use of
the technique need to be resolved before it can be used routinely and with
precision. Drs. Hornyak and Franklin will conduct a one year project to further
develop the TL technique for archaeological materials as applied to situations
for which other techniques (e.g. C14) are limited or not available. Such
situations include the dating of sediments in archaeological deposits, objects
older that the limits for C14 (over 50,000 years), and inorganic specimens with
no associated carbon deposits, and objects, such as pottery, whose
archaeological context has been lost, as in museums. The development of TL
dating is of extreme importance and the PI's are well-qualified and experienced
to undertake this important project.
