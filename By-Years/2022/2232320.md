Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), to take place during
October 31-November 3, 2022, in Denver, Colorado. FOCS is one of the two premier

science. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students,
particularly those from under-represented groups. The conference serves as a
valuable educational experience both for the technical content of the talks and
for the opportunities for networking that it provides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
