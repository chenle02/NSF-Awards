Abstract for DEB-0317140

A grant has been awarded to Dr. Luis M. Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of
Los Angeles County to conduct 3 years of internationally cooperative research on
a series of exceptionally well-preserved fossil birds from Northwestern China.
The core of this project is a collection of 125 million-year-old fossils
belonging to a group of extinct flying birds, the Enantiornithes, which
represents one of the most primitive chapters of the evolution of birds. In
spite of their significance, these ancient fossils have remained superficially
studied and their evolutionary relationships poorly understood. The purpose of
this research grant is to describe the anatomy of these fossils and to use this
information to clarify their evolutionary interrelationships. This project will
produce knowledge about the early history of birds and the evolutionary
transformations that ultimately led to the unique physical characteristics of
modern birds.

The proposed study will have a significant impact on the professional
development of two junior Chinese scientists, who will conduct 3-month
internships at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and will
strengthen the cooperation between US and Chinese institutions. In addition,
through popular articles and media coverage, the important scientific knowledge
contained in these fossils will be conveyed to the public.
