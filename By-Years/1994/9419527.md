9419527 Wharton This award supports a workshop entitled Antarctic Geographic
Information Systems. The goal of the workshop is to bring together experts in
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and active Antarctic researchers with an
interest in spatial analysis to assess the need for a US Antarctic Program
(USAP) GIS and to discuss how such a system might be developed. The impetus for
holding this workshop is two-fold: 1) the spatial analysis requirements of
Antarctic researchers are growing rapidly; and 2) the USAP requires objective
input in order to prioritize research support decisions relating to the
potential development of a USAP GIS. The three day workshop will be hosted by
the US Geological Survey in Reston, Virginia, and will be by invitation. The
organizing committee represents a good cross-section of the Antarctic research
community and all members are familiar with, though not experts on, GIS. Invited
participants will include GIS experts from universities, government agencies,
and the private sector, as well as active USAP researchers. A workshop report
summarizing results from the workshop will be produced.
