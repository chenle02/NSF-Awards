During early development mesenchymal cells migrate, rearrange, and change shape
to remodel the embryo. Coordinated movements of loosely-packed mesenchymal cells
in the early embryo construct the vertebrate body plan and populate tissues in
preparation for the construction of muscles, connective tissue and bone, as well
as the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Many genes and many cells participate
in these events, but there is little experimental evidence on how genes and
cells generate physical forces and integrate biochemical pathways to drive
mechanical movements within embryos. The goal of this research is to investigate
how genes control the physical mechanics of multicellular mesenchymal tissues
by: 1) analyzing the physics of re-aggregation and the cellular mechanics
responsible for rapid phases of tissue sculpting, 2) challenging cells with
varied micro-environments and assessing how their behavior changes, and 3)vary
levels of cell adhesion molecules and surface contractility to reveal how
mesenchymal tissue spreading and engulfment are mechanically coordinated.
Understanding the molecular basis of rules governing the ordered assembly of
mesenchymal tissue will explain how events at the subcellular scale coordinate
cell behaviors during assembly of organs and functional tissues. These findings
will complement and extend efforts to understand the molecular basis of
mesenchymal morphogenesis and begin the process of integrating the molecular
machinery into larger "morphogenetic" processes that are robust and may be
adapted by tissue engineers. The cross- and interdisciplinary training resulting
from this project will provide biologists and tissue engineers the ability to
integrate learned concepts into a framework the will be important for both
fields.
