This project is renovating an energy technician program through real-world
applications and strong collaboration with the regional energy extraction
industry. The goals of this project are to 1) increase the pool of trained
energy technicians through industry-driven applied education, 2) facilitate high
participation of trained energy technicians in the energy workplace, 3) provide
pathways for two-year energy technician graduates to AAS and BS programs, 4)
provide professional development opportunities for high school teachers and two-
and four- year college faculty, and 5) create energy industry awareness in the
pre-college schools in the region by implementing summer camps for students in
grades 5-9. This project is producing exemplary curricular materials, with
significant input from industrial partners. These materials are not only
enhancing student learning and preparing them for the workplace, but they are
also providing faculty and high school teachers with professional development
opportunities.
