0435632&lt;br/&gt;Joynt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-Vietnam
cooperative research project between Dr. Robert Joynt, University of Wisconsin
and Professor Bach Thanh Cong, Hanoi University to study computational materials
and device physics. This study includes four separate projects related to
computational device physics: magnetic structure of manganites, photochemistry
at the rutile/water interface, spin relaxation in quantum dots, and optimization
of device design for quantum computing. Proposed topics are modern and relevant
to ongoing research in condensed and materials physics. This is a thoughtful and
carefully designed study. It can help the development of computational materials
science in Vietnam and can enhance the human resource development in
computational physics in both countries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
