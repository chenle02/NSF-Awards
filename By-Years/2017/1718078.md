Mobile Cloud Sensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm for collaborative information
collection and sharing in emerging smart cities. MCS is based on the fundamental
principle of Sensing-as-a-Service and enables on-demand network access to a
shared pool of sensing hardware and software that can jointly sense urban
physical/social environments. The major conceptual difference of MCS from
existing mobile sensing paradigms lies in the introduction of MCS providers,
each having virtually owned an extremely large sensing infrastructure comprising
heterogeneous smartphones and tablets (called sensing agents). Upon request from
a smart-city application which may demand realtime or historical sensed data, an
MCS provider either coordinates its distributed sensing agents to jointly
perform the sensing task and then return the sensed data or respond with
historical sensed data previously collected from its sensing
agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to investigate several fundamental
security and privacy challenges associated with MCS. Specifically, there are
four main thrusts in this project: (1) developing a suite of secure and privacy-
preserving data aggregation primitives; (2) designing differentially-private
sensing task assignment mechanisms; (3) developing a unified framework for
verifiable query processing via untrusted smart-city service providers; and (4)
building a prototype MCS system for validation and evaluation. The project also
actively channels the research results into undergraduate and graduate
curriculum, provides research experience for undergraduate and under-represented
students, and includes outreach activities to K-12, underrepresented, and
oversea students.
