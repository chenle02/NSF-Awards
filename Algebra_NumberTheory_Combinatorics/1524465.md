The PI will work on the birational classification of algebraic varieties. The
minimal model program is an ambitious program to classify varieties up to
birational equivalence. To finish the program and to establish existence of
minimal models, it suffices to show termination of flips. The PI will use recent
results concerning ACC for the log canonical threshold to attack termination. A
related project is to study birational boundedness of Fano varieties, especially
the conjecture of Borisov-Alexeev-Borisov. Birational geometry also offers a
potential way to study vector bundles on projective space, to be used as a means
to attack Hartshorne's conjectures. Finally, the PI also plans to study the
connection between birational geometry, foliations and the abundance conjecture.

Algebraic Geometry is one of the oldest and most challenging of areas of
research in mathematics, which combines some very classical geometry, for
example that of conic sections and the more modern techniques of algebra. There
has been a lot exciting recent work in higher dimensional geometry. The PI will
write a survey article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society on this work
which is intended for a general scientific literate audience and the PI will
also try to impart some of the exciting research in algebraic geometry to
undergraduate and graduate students in his teaching.
