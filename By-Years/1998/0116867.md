0116867 Hnat This is a proposal to acquire an industrial micro computed
tomography (microCT) system to be used for the detailed examination of bone
samples. The micro CT system includes a variable power CT, an image intensifier,
a turntable, and 3D visualization software. Some of the areas of research
include: (1) studying three-dimensional trabecular bone architecture, (2)
investigating molecular mechanisms of bone formation and resorption, (3)
assessing the quality of bone during healing of fractures, and (4) creating more
accurate biomechanical joint models. Engineering applications include flaw
detection, measurement of fracture or fracture propagation, feature recognition,
and non-destructive evaluation.
