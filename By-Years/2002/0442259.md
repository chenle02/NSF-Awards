The technical focus of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute research site for
the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Telecommunication
Integrated Circuits and Systems "Connection One" is in broadband data transport
including basic and applied interdisciplinary research in secure optical and
electrical data transport, switching and processing. This research will include
materials, devices, systems, and information technology, requiring long-term
commitment to achieve the orders of magnitude improvements needed in the speed,
density, power, cost and reliability of secure data transport and
communications. The research site will address basic research issues that enable
the massive scaling required by these systems in optical and electrical data
transport, switching, and processing.
