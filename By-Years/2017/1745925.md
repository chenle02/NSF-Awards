Location Based Services are extremely popular, with millions of users making
daily use of mapping services such as Google and Bing maps, as well as location
based features integrated into numerous other systems such as Twitter and Yelp.
Data analytics over the backend databases of these services can reveal
interesting "big picture" information, such as geographic distribution of points
of interest and regional variation in user behavior. In this project we show
that such interesting data analytics can be performed by users whose access to
the databases is limited via the available programming and query interfaces. The
research results of this project will impact the nation's higher education
system and high-tech industries. The ability to pose high-level analytical
queries over location based services is needed by knowledge workers in a wide
variety of corporations, governments, and security agencies. Parts of this
project are being integrated into teaching, which will potentially attract
motivated students to pursue doctoral degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
involves developing a suite of algorithms and techniques for understanding the
opportunities and challenges of data analytics over location based services. The
various data analytics and mining tasks considered include point and path
aggregate estimation as well as dual mining over location based services limited
by available data access interfaces. The research makes fundamental advancements
to engineering by showing how to integrate theoretically-proven algorithms with
application-specific details of real-world location based services. A data
analytics prototype is also being developed and will be evaluated over several
real-world location based services.
