In the aftermath of wildfires, flooding, erosion, and debris flows can damage
buildings, infrastructure, and waterways. This research will examine the role
that snow plays in both short-term hazards and longer-term landscape recovery
from fire. Focusing on the 2020 Cameron Peak and East Troublesome burn scars in
northern Colorado, the project addresses how and why post-fire hazards and
vegetation recovery vary between snow zones of the Rocky Mountains. Initial
observations at these fires indicate that burned areas with limited snow have
greater flooding, erosion, and debris flow activity during the first few years
after fire compared to locations with deep winter snowpack. In contrast,
vegetation recovery has proceeded more rapidly in low snow than in high snow
areas. The research will explore reasons for these differences between snow
zones, with the aim to identify what types of settings are most vulnerable to
post-fire hazards. Findings will inform flash flood forecasts and help land
managers prioritize actions such as erosion mitigation and channel
stabilization. The project incorporates public outreach through a citizen
science stream monitoring program and presentations to stakeholders, and it
includes a 5th grade river field day, education resources for K-12 teachers, and
undergraduate and graduate student training.

The research will involve two main components: (1) evaluating causes of post-
fire hazards during the first 1-3 years post-fire, and (2) examining snow
changes and their effects on vegetation recovery over a decade or more post-
fire. The hazard analysis will examine three possible causes for greater post-
fire hazards in lower snow zones: (1) higher rainfall intensity; (2) greater
overland flow generation, and (3) greater hillslope-stream connectivity.
Rainfall analyses will use rain gauges and gridded rainfall products; overland
flow analyses will use stream stage measurements and rill network mapping from
drone imagery, and hillslope-stream connectivity metrics will be computed from
LiDAR and drone topographic data. The snow and vegetation analysis will
incorporate both a field and a remote sensing component. Field measurements will
compare snowpack in burned and unburned areas, with a focus on how tree char
depth affects snow albedo. Vegetation plot surveys and drone imagery will
document vegetation recovery rates. Remote sensing analyses will extend the
findings beyond the study fires to the full Southern Rockies eco-region,
evaluating fire effects on snow-free dates and post-fire vegetation recovery
rates. The combination of local field observations and regional scale analysis
will enable connecting site-specific findings to their implications for larger
watersheds.
