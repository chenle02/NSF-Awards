9352833 Blanchard A large-scale revision of the traditional sophomore-level
ordinary differential equations course is being developed which emphasizes
qualitative theory with a distinct dynamical systems orientation. A discussion
of difference equations will precede the introduction of differential equations,
the computer will be used to analyze solutions, and a more detailed discussion
of nonlinear systems will be included. A consortium of colleges and universities
will assist in developing the syllabus and materials, as well as serve as
initial test sites for the textbook.
