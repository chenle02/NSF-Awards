Heart disease is responsible for 24.2% of the deaths in Unites States in 2010,
and annual economic costs related to heart diseases are around $448.5 billion in
the Unites States. Smart cardiac care calls for on-line monitoring, early
identification of disease patterns and timely delivery of life-saving preventive
care. Real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) contains a wealth of information on
cardiac dynamics. Realizing the promise of ECG sensing, however, depends to a
great extent on the advancement in information processing methodologies.
Existing methodologies increasingly fail to address fundamental issues important
to patient-centered care. The proposed technology, Mobile and E-network Smart
Health (MESH), advances cardiac telemedicine with wireless sensors, smart mobile
devices, and big data analytics. Specifically, the proposed technology enables
mobile-based ECG sensing and network-based information processing for anyone,
anytime and anywhere (especially in rural areas and developing
countries).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MESH technology supplies in-situ
information processing capabilities, and enables physicians to access the
patients' ECG signals in real time, remotely interact with patients and rapidly
respond to life-threatening cardiac disorders. The MESH technology will overcome
critical technological barriers in the early identification of acute cardiac
events, personalized cardiac monitoring, and smarter management of heart health.
The MESH technology will bring the ECG to people's daily life and raise the
public awareness of smarter health and wellbeing.
