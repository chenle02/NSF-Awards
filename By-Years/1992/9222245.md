Molten polychalcogenide salt and hydrothermal techniques will be used to
explore the synthesis of new chalcogenide materials at low and intermediate
temperatures. Both synthetic techniques will use various A2Qx salts in reactions
with late transition metals and main-group elements. Reactions at temperatures
between 200-500 oC will be studied because this range has been little explored
previously. It has been demonstrated that in this temperature range new
materials with new structure types can form and crystallize. The remarkable
ability of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium to bridge different sub-structures in
two and three dimensions, and the relatively low temperatures provide a
lucrative opportunity for synthesis of a very large number of new compounds.
Physical properties of these new compounds to be explored include magnetic,
sorption as a function of temperature, and redox properties. In order to probe
unusual electronic phenomena, the charge transport properties of the new
compounds will be studied in detail via variable temperature four-probe
resistivity as well as thermoelectric power (Seebeck) measurements. The
measurements will be primarily done on single crystal samples. This grant is
jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the Chemistry
Division.
