Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congestion Options, A Market Based Solution to
Congestion Externalities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terry L. Friesz and Tao
Yao&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project
we study the idea of creating congestion rights that may be bought and sold,
much as air pollution rights can now be traded. By creating a market for
congestion, it is hoped that congestion can be tamed and mitigated. The main
focus of our work is congestion securities, especially congestion options ?
which are contracts that allow one to buy or sell the opportunity to initiate
congestion-inducing movement or flow over a transport, data or voice network.
Although passenger automobile traffic on metropolitan road networks is the
principal focus of this research, we will also explore the impact of congestion
options on urban logistics and telecommunications. Our principal tool in the
study of congestion options will be computer-based models of option pricing
informed by vehicular traffic and message flows in a dense urban setting, such
as New York, Boston or Washington. These models will be instructed to consider
circumstances like those a city dweller, commuter or tourist might experience in
taking a taxi, driving to a dental appointment, sending a package or exchanging
information via a PDA. In this way we will gather synthetic data describing the
impacts of congestion options and markets for congestion rights. That data will
be analyzed to determine the financial, economic and social implications of
congestion options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide the
infrastructure engineering community with case studies, instructional aids and
software useful for teaching undergraduate and graduate students how to
construct and analyze markets for congestion rights. It will also provide
material for informing the general public about the potential role of congestion
options and congestion markets in alleviating one of the great social problems
of the modern age, namely congestion. If successful, this research may establish
congestion securities as a new field of specialization within financial
engineering that has the potential to literally change how people commute,
telecommute and employ freight services in urban environments with substantial
congestion. Additionally, our research will illuminate how congestion options
may be used to promote social justice for the poor when congestion pushes their
jobs farther and farther from their places of residence and makes commuting by
public transit prohibitively time consuming. In particular, we will show how
congestion options may be written assuring payments to such groups when
congestion creates an untenable commuting environment for them.&lt;br/&gt;
