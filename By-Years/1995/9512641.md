Project Summary This project will provide equipment to enable the Hawaii
Institute of Marine Biology to serve as a center for diverse research on UV
radiation in the tropical marine environment. An international workshop on UV
radiation in the sea (Aug., 1994) concluded that HIMB's history of such research
and its sub-tropical location make it the most logical site in the U.S.A., or
the world, for such a center. A scanning spectroradiometer will allow precision
measurement of radiation in the laboratory and the field. A UV-
sensitive/visible wavelength remote controlled television will allow visual
perception and measurement of portions of the sensory world of marine animals of
which humans are dismally unaware. Visitors will be encouraged to use these
facilities and several leading investigators in the field have firm plans for
participation.
