Models of atmospheric behavior are important for understanding and predicting
the behavior of the atmosphere. A previously developed two-dimensional model,
known as the BISA/NCAR model, has benefited significantly from past
contributions of the PI on this project, and attempts to link the dynamics,
chemistry and radiation in the atmosphere from the ground through the mesosphere
(85km altitude) into a unified picture. The present award will continue the
development of the model, with special attention to extending its range of
applicability upward from the upper mesosphere through the lower thermosphere
(120km). The modeling study will place particular emphasis on the mean
meridional circulation and on an accurate representation of the energy balance.
