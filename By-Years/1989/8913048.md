This award will support cooperative research between Professor Richard G. Weiss
of Georgetown University and Professors Giovanni Gottarelli and Bruno Samori of
the University of Bologna, Italy. The researchers intend to study the influence
of liquid-crystalline environments on the order, reactivity, and conformational
lability of selected solutes. The data will be analyzed on the bases of solute-
solvent length similarities, the proximity of the solute carbonyl to the aqueous
interface, and the order of the solvent phase. The order parameters will be
measured using linear dichroism and 2H nuclear magnetic resonance. They will
develop a comprehensive data set from which details concerning specific
solute/ordered solvent interactions may be derived. It should be useful in the
design of systems intended to control the rates and selectivities of solute
reactions and to limit dopant molecules to pre-selected motions in ordered
matrices.
