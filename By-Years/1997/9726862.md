ABSTRACT 97-26862 Hopkinson W/WS: Integrated, ecological-economic modeling of
watersheds and estuaries at multiple scales The objective of this research is to
integrate socioeconomic models with spatially explicit models of land use,
ecosystem biogeochemistry and watershed hydrology to provide comprehensive
assessments of human activities on nutrient, sediment and water fluxes for the
Ipswich watershed in coastal Massachusetts. An additional objective is to
develop approaches that will allow application of these models to other
watersheds. To assess human impacts on watershed dynamics, the investigators
will use four types of models: socioeconomic, land-use change, hydrologic and
stream biogeochemical. A key goal is to develop a means of assessing the impacts
of urbanization and land-use change on watersheds and estuarine ecosystems in
general, not just a specific assessment for the Ipswich River. The approach will
enable the researchers to better assess human impacts on watersheds and to
evaluate management strategies for minimizing or reversing watershed, riverine
and estuarine degradation.
