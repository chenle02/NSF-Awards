The Forty-Fourth Annual Gaseous Electronics Conference, to be held at the
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, on October 22-25, 1991, provides a
forum for investigators of the basic physics and chemistry of ionized gases and
macroscopic gas discharge phenomena. It plays a significant role in interfacing
basic science with related applications, emphasizing collisional, radiative and
plasma processes that occur in electric discharges, arcs and gas lasers. The
grant supports participant costs (notably for graduate students), publication
and administration expenses.
