9406250 McMillan This award provides partial (69%) funding to acquire a light
detection system and a laser heater for the Raman spectroscopy system in the
Department of chemistry and Biochemistry at the Arizona State University. The
institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed to purchase the
equipment. The Raman spectroscopy system at Arizona State is used in research
primarily to characterize chemical bonding and thermodynamic properties such as
heat capacities and entropies in minerals, liquids and glass materials held at
high-temperature and high-pressure. ***
