Research on Congress and on the dynamics of the legislative process in the
United States is hampered by the lack of significant short term variation in
important aspects of the legislative process. For example, although the
structure of the congressional committee system is believed to be important in
determining the operation of Congress, the fact that the structure of the
committee system has changed only very little over the past half century makes
analysis of the effects of committee structure difficult to study using
contemporary data. To compensate for this problem congressional scholars have
turned increasingly to history. Specifically, by studying congressional change
over longer periods of time it is possible to observe greater variation in key
concepts and variables. The problem, however, is that systematic and reliable
data have not been collected on many aspects of Congress for the years prior to
about 1950. This award supports a planning conference of congressional scholars
to study the feasibility of developing a comprehensive, multi-user, historical
data base on congressional structure, process and composition. The conference
will involve the leading scholars in the field and will seek agreement on the
types of data that should be collected, the format a comprehensive data base
should take, and on the types of questions that could be addresses if these data
were collected. When completed this project will provide a much better
understanding of the data needs and opportunities in this important area of
Political Science.
