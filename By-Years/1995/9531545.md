Abstract 9531545 Pauley This REU Site will provide opportunities for 10-12
mechanical engineering students to participate in research related to real
problems in manufacturing systems, control systems, thermal systems, combustion
and fluid mechanics. Each student will work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to
define and execute a complete and original research study. The student will be
expected to take an active role in defining the objectives of the study and the
research methods to be used. During the research process, the student will apply
and extend the knowledge gained from engineering courses. The final results of
the research will be a report detailing the procedures and results of the
investigation, and a formal oral presentation during the final seminar week of
the summer program.
