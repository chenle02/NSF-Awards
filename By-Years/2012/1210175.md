This action funds Priscilla Zhi-Xian Liu of University of Arizona to conduct a
research project, entitled "Perception of Singapore English consonants by
multilingual Singaporeans," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological
University in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Ng Bee Chin.

Intellectual Merit of the research project is shown through the investigation of
the connections between the details of linguistic phenomena and larger
transnational language and sociocultural ideologies. This exploration of
Singapore English complements existing research on Singapore English by
providing a focused analysis of linguistic features and provides a deeper
understanding of general speech production and perception phenomena by providing
a case study on Singapore English.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
