This award will provide half the funds necessary to upgrade the rock mechanics
laboratory at St. Louis University. The additional funding to make this possible
has been committed by St. Louis University. This will be an upgrade of equipment
borrowed from Texas A&M on a long term,renewable loan. The upgrade will involve
the building of apparatus especially designed by the PI to carry out experiments
of special interest to scientists studying the behavior of materials in fault
zones. The proposed upgrade involves construction of a computerized data
acquisition and servo- controlled system,a flow- through pore fluid system,a
simplified sealing and sample assembly,and a furnace and controller to achieve
elevated temperatures. Upgrade of the rock deformation apparatus and laboratory
will allow the development of a research program that will involve graduate
students and other researchers interested in the frictional and brittle behavior
of rock in fault zones under conditions that favor soluttion transfer and
cataclastic mechanisms.
