This study proposes to study the diversity, abundance, and structure of the
salmonid fish community of the high altitude headwaters of a critical arctic
watershed (Katun-Ob' River) in the Altai Republic of the Russian Federation of
States. No comprehensive ichthyological surveys have been ever been conducted in
this region, and this study will represent one of the first to document the
aquatic fauna, and the hydrographic and limnological correlates, of upstream
habitats of arctic rivers. The proposed research will provide critical data that
will be used to test the generality of ecological hypotheses developed through
research at the Toolik Lake, Alaska LTER site. The PI is able to undertake this
research in the Altai Republic, Central Siberia, because of a unique opportunity
afforded by collaboration with researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Because the logistical demands are extreme and the window for opportunity is
time-sensitive, the PIs have chosen to submit a proposal of limited scope under
the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
