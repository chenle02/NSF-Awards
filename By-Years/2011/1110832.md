This doctoral dissertation improvement project will test a method to identify
the source areas for nitrogen being deposited as dry deposition in the
surrounding landscape. Stable isotopes of nitrogen in dry deposition can be used
as a fingerprint to identify possible source areas, but to date it has been
unclear whether the isotopic composition of nitrogen that is collected by
passive filters is altered significantly during the collection process. This
project will test this widely used methodology and determine whether isotopic
composition of nitrogen collected on filters can be used to identify the
original source areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere
and subsequent deposition to the landscape has increased significantly over the
past several decades, leading to nitrogen leaching off the landscape into
waterways and coastal oceans where it causes algal blooms and other
environmental problems. Understanding the source areas of nitrogen that is
ultimately deposited in specific locations is an important tool in mitigating
this environmental problem.
