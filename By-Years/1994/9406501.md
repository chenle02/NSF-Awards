9406501 Carr Dr. Carr will continue his investigations of the low frequency
magnetospheric radio emissions from Jupiter. Included in the program are: a) the
continued operation and upgrading of the University of Florida Radio Observatory
for the monitoring of Jupiter's decametric emissions between 15 and 32 MHz; b)
the analysis of Jovian decametric data from this and other observatories and the
development of models to account for the characteristics of the emissions; and
c) the continuation of the analysis of the Voyager spacecraft decametric,
hectometric, and kilometric data from Jupiter and its use in emission source and
beam modeling. These studies are intended to enhance our understanding of the
sources of Jovian low frequency radio emission and their relationships to the
magnetospheric environment.
