Professor John Pople is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the application of
molecular orbital theory to a wide range of chemically important problems. The
molecular orbital theory, as implemented through Pople's series of Gaussian
computer programs, has had a very significant impact on all ares of research in
the field of Chemistry, and has contributed to the fact that Pople is one of the
most widely cited scientists in the world today. Pople plans to continue his
algorithm development and research in the following three areas: 1) the
development of additional new approximations to deal with the electron
correlation problem which are aimed at providing more accurate descriptions of
energies, potential surfaces and other physical properties of molecules; 2) the
improvement of computational efficiency of the well-established Hartree-Fock and
Moller-Plesset theories with particular attention being paid to opportunities
raised by recent developments in computer hardware; and 3) the application of
molecular orbital theory to problems of current chemical interest where
traditional experimental approaches are difficult to apply.
