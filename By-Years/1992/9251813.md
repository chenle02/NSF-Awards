The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatography mass spectrometer
(GC-MS). The instrument is being incorporated throughout the curriculum, from
introductory courses for non-science majors to the senior research program for
chemistry majors. Acquisition of the GC-MS is making possible the development of
a new environmental chemistry program.
