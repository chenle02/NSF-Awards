DMS-0104318&lt;br/&gt;Jesper Grodal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of
developing the homotopy theory &lt;br/&gt;of classifying spaces of compact Lie
groups (including &lt;br/&gt;finite groups) and their generalizations. The goal
of &lt;br/&gt;this is to solve central problems in homotopy theory involving
classifying spaces, as well as to discover new relations&lt;br/&gt;to problems
in group theory and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;A further goal is to
produce results in related fields &lt;br/&gt;such as in the theory of group
actions, equivariant &lt;br/&gt;cohomology, and group cohomology. The project
centers&lt;br/&gt;around developing the homotopy theoretic group theory
&lt;br/&gt;of the classifying space BG, or rather of its p-completion.
&lt;br/&gt;This involves examining the induction theory, p-local theory,
representation theory as well as the more general actions &lt;br/&gt;of these
objects. The methods used come from modern unstable &lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory,
developed since the solution of the &lt;br/&gt;Sullivan conjecture, combined
with ideas and techniques &lt;br/&gt;from modern group
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forming the classifying space BG of a group of
&lt;br/&gt;symmetries G is a way of geometrically or topologically
&lt;br/&gt;encoding the "symmetries" present in G. Geometric spaces
&lt;br/&gt;of this form and generalizations thereof are ubiquitous &lt;br/&gt;in
topology, and hence form an important class of &lt;br/&gt;spaces to study.
Furthermore, the less rigid structure &lt;br/&gt;of the classifying space BG,
compared to that of&lt;br/&gt;the group G, makes certain techniques available in
&lt;br/&gt;the study of the former which were not available when
&lt;br/&gt;dealing with the later directly. Hence, studying the
group&lt;br/&gt;theory of BG provides an interesting and useful way of
&lt;br/&gt;studying the original group G.&lt;br/&gt;
