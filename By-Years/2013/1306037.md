This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. David Kikuchi is supported by
both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International
Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During the 24-month
fellowship, Dr. Kikuchi will work on a project titled, "Optimal learning and the
evolution of Batesian mimicry" under the sponsorship of Prof. Thomas Sherratt at
Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and Prof. Johanna Mappes at the
University of Jyv채skyl채, Finland.

The goal of this project is to evaluate how the costs of acquiring information
about an animal's environment influence its behavior. Currently, little is known
about this process because most theories assume that animals have perfect
knowledge of their environments (or at least cannot improve their information).
New models of optimal animal foraging behavior will be built using computer
simulations. Those models will then be tested in a "novel world" environment
where wild birds learn about prey that they have never encountered before. This
work is important because learning is a universal problem that animals face; it
can be an expensive process, and a better understanding is needed of how the
value of information dictates how much is learned.

Dr. Kikuchi will work with undergraduate students who will be trained with both
computer simulations and field work. This project will also foster international
collaboration between Carleton University and the Center of Excellence in
Biological Interactions in Jyv채skyl채. Results of this work will be presented to
the public, during events such as Darwin Day, or in ScienceNOW that has
previously highlighted Dr. Kikuchi's work.

This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with
foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions available abroad.
