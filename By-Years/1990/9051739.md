Through this project, the institution was able to acquire a gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer and laboratory instrumentation interfaces with
computers. The utilization of the GC/MS begins in the sophomore organic course
which has been converted to microscale. The GC/MS is used extensively in
molecular weight determination for unknowns in organic qualitative analysis.
Students in instrumental analysis use the instrumentation for analyzing prepared
acetylacetone complexes. Students doing undergraduate research continue to use
the GC/MS for such problems as rate comparison of nucleophilic displacements
which are phase transfer catalyzed versus the same reaction conducted with
ultrasound. The acquisition of the GC/MS and interfacing instrumentation has
greatly enhanced the chemistry program at the institution. The institution
contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
