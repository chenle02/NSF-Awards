This project is in the area of Complex and Harmonic Analysis and applications to
Spectral Theory and Mathematical Physics. It concerns open problems on
completeness of complex exponentials in weighted spaces of square-integrable
functions posted decades ago by such prominent mathematicians as Norman
Levinson, Andrei Kolmogorov, Mark Krein, George Polya and Norbert Wiener. Three
key problems in this area, the Beurling-Malliavin Problem, the Gap Problem and
the Type Problem will be revisited in this project. The Beruling-Malliavin
Problem was solved in the early sixties, although its numerous generalizations
and applications remain open. A solution to the Gap Problem was recently
suggested by the investigator. The solution brings up a number of new questions
that will be considered in this project. The Type Problem, perhaps the most
studied and important of the three, remains open. Recent partial results,
produced via the approach used for the Gap Problem, suggest that a full solution
may finally be within reach.

The problem of approximating an arbitrary wave by combinations of simple waves,
or "harmonics," belongs to the very foundations of Harmonic Analysis. Versions
of this problem have been studied by many famous mathematicians. Despite
considerable efforts, many of such questions remain open. Such problems have a
number of important applications in Approximation Theory, Signal Processing,
Prediction Theory, Spectral Theory of differential operators and Mathematical
Physics. Further progress in this direction is the main goal of the project.
Solutions to these problems could bring a satisfactory closure to the decades-
long study of this area of Harmonic Analysis. Some of these problems remained
open for more than half a century, and some of them were even considered
"transcendental," i.e. not having a closed form solution. However, a recently
developed approach, described in the main part of the proposal, has produced
solutions to several of such problems and brought new optimism to the area. A
research conference in the area of the project was recently held at Texas A&M
University (January 2011). A survey of the main topics of the project will be
included in the graduate Complex Analysis classes taught by the investigator at
Texas A&M University. Two minicourses in the area of the project, directed at
young researchers, will be given by the investigator at an international
research program in 2011.
