Girls RISE (Raising Interest in Science &amp; Engineering) is a model program
that will showcase how an informal, non-competitive learning environment that
includes hands-on, reality-based applications of engineering principles and
teamwork, can build confidence and encourage girls to develop an interest in
science, engineering and mathematics and related careers. Project objectives
are: (1) to build competent, confident, enthusiastic learners equipped with an
array of advanced computer and technology skills; (2) to expose girls to a
variety of engineering careers through interaction with professional women
employed in science and engineering related fields; (3) to increase girls
confidence in their ability to perform in traditionally male dominated technical
and engineering arenas while improving their problem solving and information
processing skills; (4) to foster sustained participation in engineering-related
studies, reducing the attrition that occurs as girls move from the middle school
to the high school level. The project builds upon the work the Miami Museum of
Science conducted with under-represented youth, and includes several key
components that have proven successful in related projects. These include: the
acquisition of advanced computer skills; the use of college level mentors as
instructors; interaction with professionals in their workplace; project based,
active learning; and paid internships.
