So Hirata of the University of Florida is supported by a CAREER award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the
development of quantum chemical methods for macromolecular systems. The
Materials Theory program within the Division of Materials Research is providing
partial funding support for this project. Hirata's group is studying (1)
crystalline polymers; (2)localized excitations in polymers; (3) molecular
clusters; and (4) molecular crystals. The methods being developed recognize the
characteristic length scale of effective interparticle interactions in these
systems and use this knowledge to make exact the distance-based truncation of
the interactions. The approach uses Gaussian-basis-set ab initio molecular
orbital and density functional theories to treat both small molecules, solids
and clusters of all sizes, thereby bridging the gap between quantum chemistry
and solid state physics.

The work is having a broad impact through the study of technologically important
systems, but also through Hirata's efforts to involve his students in
international collaborations with Mexican and Japanese colleagues.
