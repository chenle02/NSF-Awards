Evidence suggests that existing STEM faculty workshops have been reasonably
effective in meeting the goals of introducing faculty to pedagogical practices
well-grounded in discipline-specific education research and motivating faculty
to try these ideas and materials to enhance student learning. Current workshops,
however, reach only a small fraction of STEM faculty in colleges and
universities and they offer a wide range of models for faculty development. This
project is to organize and hold a national symposium focusing on the role of
scientific societies in STEM faculty professional development workshops. The
symposium will bring together the leaders of these workshops to find a set of
best practices for these workshops and discuss ways of extending these workshops
to a larger fraction of STEM faculty members. It is an important attempt to
catalyze large scale adoption of effective teaching practices in this country
and will contribute to the transformation of undergraduate STEM education.
