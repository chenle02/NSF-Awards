9505454 Bisesi This is an award to support exploratory research on the potential
for enhancement of biological processes for degradation of petroleum
hydrocarbons present in soil that has been polluted by these substances. In this
research, soil contaminated with the target hydrocarbons will be innoculated
with earthworm species, selected for their enzymatic pathways known to
accelerate transformation of organic compounds, and with soil microorganisms
that contain enzymes known to catalyze the degradation of toxic organic
compounds. The investigator plans on studying the influence of extracellular
enzymes produced by microorganisms and soil characteristics that affect the
process by which organic soil contaminants derived from petroleum may be
transformed into substances of lesser or no pollutional significance. The
proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF under the Special Guidelines
for an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) in the NSF Grant Proposal
Guide (NSF 94-2). Results of this research are expected to provide the basis for
further research on the potential for biologically augmenting and enhancing the
decontamination of soil that has been polluted by gasoline, lubricating oil and
diesel fuel that has leaked from underground storage tanks or otherwise entered
soil where the hydrocarbons pose a potential for contaminating groundwater. ***
