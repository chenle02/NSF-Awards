9600124 Kleshchev This grant supports the research of Professor A. Kleschev to
work on problems in the modular representation of the finite groups. In
particular he wants to find the mutiplicities of some composition factors of an
irreducible representation of the symmetric group of order n. He also want to
study branching rules for Hecke algebras via the theory of quantum groups and
the study of irreducible representations of the alternating group and
irreducible Specht modules. This is research in the field of group theory. Group
theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, this
area has direct applications to many areas of physics and chemistry. Moreover,
within the last 30 years, many connections to problems in data transmission have
been solved using techniques from group theory. There are also direct
connections to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern computing
such as working with CD-ROM's.
