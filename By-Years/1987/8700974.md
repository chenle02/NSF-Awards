Virtually all polymeric membranes are more permeable to oxygen than to
nitrogen. In current commercial membranes the ratio of oxygen-to-nitrogen
permeabilities is between 2 and 5. With these low selectivities, the highest-
purity oxygen- enriched air obtainable in a single membrane stage is about
50%--and more typically, membrane processes make 30% to 35% oxygen. This
research addresses the development of a new type of membrane that should exhibit
an oxygen-over-nitrogen selectivity of up to 200, leading to a membrane process
that can produce oxygen at a purity as high as 98% in a single stage.
Furthermore, preliminary calculations show that for a 10-ton-per-day plant, the
membrane process should produce oxygen at a cost of $15 to $25/ton, compared
with a cost of about $90/ton for merchant oxygen and $120/ton for oxygen
produced via pressure-swing adsorption. During Phase I research a novel polymer
was synthesized that had a selectivity toward sorption of oxygen over nitrogen
of about 100. During this Phase II research, membranes will be developed that
consist of extremely thin films of similar, highly selective polymers. Efforts
will be directed toward obtaining high rates of oxygen transfer through these
selective polymer films. The need for an inexpensive method of producing high
purity oxygen has been recognized for many years. The standard method for
producing pure oxygen is by distillation of air at very low temperatures.
However, this technology is old, and improvements in the economics or the
efficiency of the process seem unlikely. In contrast, a process based on
membranes seem promising, particularly for small scale production of oxygen.
This research seeks to develop a novel method to produce a specially coated
membrane for the above purpose.
