This project involves research in the areas of applied mathematics related to
petroleum engineering and geophysics. The petroleum engineering work will
consider simulation of flows in porous media, including, in particular,
multiphase flow in naturally fractured petroleum reservoirs. Attenuated waves
are best described by means of hyperbolic pseudo-differential equations. Much of
the research will be devoted to developing numerical methods for such waves,
with emphasis on attenuated waves in porous media saturated by single- or
multiphase fluids; interpretation of scattering phenomena related to the slow
compression wave in Biot media will be studied by means of homogenization
theory. Applications of the same concepts in elasticity theory and
electromagnetic theory will be considered. Several numerical analysis questions
related to these problems will be treated. This research will have applications
in structural analysis and electromagnetic theory.
