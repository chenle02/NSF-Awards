This RAPID grant establishes the foundations for long-term ethnographic
fieldwork examining an ambitious renewable energy development project in North
Africa. The umbrella organization for a complex nexus of public and private
investors, seeks to connect Europe's power grid to a series of solar and wind
farms with claims that this 400 billion euro "super grid" of electricity
production may be able to supply 15% of Europe's energy needs by 2050. This
grant allows for urgent research on the construction and bringing online of the
initial solar farm. The research will examine how residents and the organization
officials experience and understand the launch of this first critical component.
The researcher will conduct approximately ten weeks of interviews and
preliminary ethnographic fieldwork first with organization staff at its
headquarters and those of its affiliates, then with local officials and
community. The ethnographer will examine the cultural perspectoves that operate
in the planning of the development of energy resources of Northern Africa and
compare these to how local people and communities living near the initial site
understand the implications of environmental investment and
development.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;What kinds of material, infrastructural, and
cultural differences are brought together in this ambitious trans-continental
project, and how are they experienced and negotiated by people involved "on the
ground." How are complex political relationships, and transfers of capital and
technology, between European and North African stakeholders, structured and
managed? What comparisons and contrasts may be relevant in weighing Europe's
historically colonialist interventions against its current development of North
African renewable energy resources? This ethnographic study will help us to
understand the trans-cultural dynamics, ethical issues, and lived realities of a
new generation of trans-border, trans-regional energy development.
