Abstract 9316774 Deshler This project is a continuation and expansion on
earlier research, to study the causes and nature of the annual Antarctic ozone
hole. Balloon borne sensors will be flown from McMurdo, Antarctica to measure
vertical profiles of ozone, aerosols, polar stratospheric clouds and, in
collaboration with other researchers using the same balloons, water vapor,
nitric acid vapor and aerosols remotely sensed by a small lidar. The researchers
will also work closely with a ground based Italian lidar group. The chemistry
and physical conditions which will be studied all play a crucial role in the
formation of the ozone hole. The balloon flights in the first year (1994) will
be coordinated with a NASA sponsored ER-2 aircraft mission which will be flown
from Christchurch, NZ to Antarctica. This project supports the Global Change
Initiative. ***
