9415983 Schilling This is a multiprong analyical investigation of the origin of
the Easter-Sala y Gomez seamount and island chain in the southeast Pacific
Ocean. At present there are four models for the origin of the chain: simple
hotspot chain, leaky fracture zone, hot line delineating the limbs of two
ascending convection cells, and plume-ridge interaction. The principal
investigators have collected rocks containing fresh glass during two cruises to
the chain. In this project they will obtain radiometric dates on the samples and
determine the chemical and isotopic composition of the samples ***
