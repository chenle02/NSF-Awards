The objective of this research is to develop an automated, computerized and
integrated evaporative heat-moisture control system in the solid substrate
fermentation of ammonia freeze explosion treated wheat straw by Trichoderma
reesei for cellulase production. The system is based on blowing dry air through
the moist substrate to cause controlled evaporative cooling, at the same time
replenishing lost water by cool water spray. Solid substrate fermentation (SSF)
could be an alternative to submerged fermentation (SF) for producing fuel and
animal feed from agricultural residues such as wheat straw and corn stover. The
main advantage of SSF, compared to SF, is the high volumetric productivity which
is based on the low water content of substrate and product. This reduces
fermenter volume, simplifies technology, increases product concentration and
saves the cost of water removal. The most critical problem for SSF
commercialization is the control of moisture and temperature. The PIs plan to
design and test a completely automated and computerized system based on blowing
dry air through the moist substrate to cause controlled evaporative heat
removal, and at the same time replenishing lost water by cool water spray to
maintain constant moisture. If the concept can be proven in this research, a
realistic technical base will be available for the scale-up of SSF processes.
