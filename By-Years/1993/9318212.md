9318212 Lohmann This award supports a project to develop the methods for
extracting seasonal temperature variability information from mollusk shells that
represent coastal marine sites in the Antarctic Peninsula during the latest
Cretaceous and early Tertiary. The climatic records will be based primarily on
stable isotopic analysis of annual growth bands preserved in aragonitic bivalve
shells of several taxa from sedimentary sequences exposed on Seymour Island. The
goal of this work is to add information about seasonal variations in temperature
to interpretations of long term climate change over the late Cretaceous to early
Tertiary interval. If the method can be proven, these high resolution seasonal
temperature records would represent an important aspect of the long-term
climatic history of the region. ***
