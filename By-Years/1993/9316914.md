9316914 Paulsen This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists
to take part in a workshop on heat tolerance in temperate cereal plants to be
held at Kona, Hawaii in February 1994. The American coordinator is Prof. Gary
Paulsen from Kansas State University. The Australian organizer is Dr. Ian
Wardlaw of the CSIRO Institute of Plant Production in Canberra. The workshop is
being conducted under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program and support
in Australia is provided through the Department of Industry, Technology and
Regional Development (DITARD). Recent advances in both the U.S. and Australia
have increased the understanding of heat shock and high temperatures on grain
yield and quality. This workshop will provide an interactive forum for
scientists in molecular biology, plant physiology, plant genetics and cereal
chemistry to discuss high temperature stress in plants. Although the workshop is
primarily concerned with the response of wheat to high temperatures, other crop
plants and biological systems will be included where they can assist in better
understanding the mechanisms which result from stressful environments.
