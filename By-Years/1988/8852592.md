The undergraduate chemistry laboratory program is being improved by the
incorporation of new infrared laboratory experiences. An infrared spectrometer
has been purchased which is suitable for teaching, routine analysis and senior
research applications. Increasingly complex laboratory utilization of the
instrument is planned as the students progress from organic chemistry to
instrumental analysis and physical chemistry and finally to senior research
applications. These laboratory experiences are complementing and supplementing
the student's present laboratory experiences which are centered around an array
of basic instrumentation and a few more sophisticated items. These additional
laboratory experiences are better equipping the graduates to meet the challenges
of industry and graduate programs. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
