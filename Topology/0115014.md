DMS-0115014 Ralph L. Cohen This award provides partial support for participants
to attend a workshop to be held at Stanford University in July and August 2001.
The scientific focus of the workshop will be centered around the Mumford
Standard Class conjecture, one of the most important outstanding conjectures on
the topology of moduli spaces. There has been considerable progress on this
conjecture in the last few years from several perspectives, including Algebraic
Geometry, Algebraic Topology, and Theoretical Physics. The workshop will bring
together experts working on these questions. The workshop will culminate with a
five day meeting in August. Further information, including invited speakers,
schedule of talks, and housing information, is available at both
http://www.aimath.org/ and http://math.stanford.edu
