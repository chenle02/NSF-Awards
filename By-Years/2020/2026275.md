The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of technologies to improve bandwidth in the wireless infrastructure.
Regulatory agencies world-wide are allocating new wireless spectrum to support
increasing throughput demands. Radio systems will require wide bandwidth with
low loss to meet the demanded data throughout. Currently available handset
filter technology is not able to achieve such wide bandwidth with acceptable
loss, resulting in sub-optimum system throughput. The proposed technology
triples the bandwidth available in a radioâ€™s front-end to serve the needs of the
5G filter market space. The thin-film technology enables a system that achieves
wide bandwidths, low loss, may be manufactured with high yields in a cost-
efficient manner at external foundries, and can be used in a form factor
consistent with industry standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
is based on the development of a radio frequency filter technology that uses
thin-films of lithium niobate (LN) resonators. Of particular interest are the
LTE 77-79 bands defined as part of the 5th generation cellular network
deployment plan (5G), which serves the 3.3 GHz - 5 GHz spectrum. The proposed
technology explores translation of a microfabrication process capable of
manufacturing acoustic resonators using thin-films of LN. The main challenge for
the LN technology is ensuring operation at the frequency of interest for 5G
bands (3-6 GHz) in a low-cost manufacturing process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
