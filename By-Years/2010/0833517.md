DRL-0833517 PI: Joan Abdallah Institution: American Association for the
Advancement of Science Title: GET SET Global Education for Tomorrow in Science,
Engineering, and Technology

This project focuses research on understanding what it takes to get
underrepresented students to succeed in STEM (science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics) as its central goal. It is implementing and testing an
instructional model for 2,000 6-8th grade students in ten Washington, DC public,
charter schools to increase student interest in and pursuit of careers in
engineering and other STEM areas, with a focus on energy and renewable
resources. Students may also apply for out-of-school learning activities,
including engineering clubs, summer institutes, and career exploration. Thirty
teachers and ten counselors are receiving professional development to implement
the project in their schools. Research is focusing on the "dosage" and
"duration" of the interventions by controlling these two variables. Students in
the 6th grade at the start of the project are experiencing 3 years of
participation, while the 8th graders have only one year. The activities
completed by different cohorts of students also are being varied.
