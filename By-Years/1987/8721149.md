This award provides one-half of the funds required for the acquisition of an
hydrogen.compatible internally heated pressure vessel. The vessel will be
installed for high.pressure and temperature experimental research in the
Department of Geological Sciences at Brown University. The usual design of
pressure vessel precludes work at high- pressure and temperature on rock systems
in the presence of water because the dissociation of water can lead to
considerable amounts of hydrogen which is corrosive to the metal jacket. But
such experiments are essential in experimental petrology because water is
ubiquitously present in the Earth. The system requested here will allow long-
term experiments on water-rock systems under conditions simulating those in the
Earth.
