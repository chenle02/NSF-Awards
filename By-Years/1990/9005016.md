We will use genetic approaches to study the structure, function and assembly of
ribosomal RNA in E. coli. The main feature of the method is to use antibiotic-
resistance mutations in 16S and 23S rRNA as genetic markers. This allows us to
use both random and site-directed mutagenesis approaches. The construction of
inducible rRNA operons allows us to identify lethal mutations, as well.
Mutations that confer a variety of phenotypes, including temperature-sensitive,
cold-sensitive, "downs," nulls, Ram, suppressors, etc. will be isolated and
localized by marker rescue and DNA sequencing. Second site revertants will also
be sought, in an effort to identify long-range structural and functional
interactions involving ribosomal RNA.
