This award in the Organic Dynamics Program provides support for the continuing
research of Dr. Paul Engel of Rice University. The main thrust of the research
is a study of the chemistry of azoalkanes and the transient intermediates formed
in their thermal and photochemical decomposition. This chemistry will be
approached on a broad front. Several different approaches to understanding the
behavior of transient intermediates will be undertaken. The mechanism of bond-
breaking in azoalkanes will be investigated by nanosecond transient absorption
experiments. The effect of azoalkane structure on the cation-radicals formed by
one-electron oxidation will be studied by flash photolysis of azoalkanes with
electron-deficient sensitizers. Thermolysis kinetics and mass spectroscopic
measurements will be used to determine the stabilization energies of a series of
carbon-centered free radicals containing alpha-nitrogen functionality. Biradical
lifetimes will be "clocked" by generation and rearrangement of
cyclopropylcarbinyl radical centers. It is expected that these varied studies
will lead to new experimental approaches to observing excited states in chemical
reactions.
