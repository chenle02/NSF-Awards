This project concerns research in algebraic geometry, the study of polynomial
equations. The investigator works on the connections between the algebraic
properties of equations and the geometric properties of the spaces they define.
In particular, this research project uses syzygies to study fundamental
questions regarding Riemann surfaces, one of the most important classes of
geometric objects. The investigation of syzygies, or the relations amongst
equations, has long played a central role in algebra, with a history ranging
from 19th-century invariant theory to 21st-century theoretical physics.
Applications of this research include moduli spaces, matrix factorizations,
string theory, enumerative geometry, and mirror
symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the investigator is working on
relating the algebraic invariants associated to the extrinsic geometry of a
Riemann surface embedded in projective space to its intrinsic geometry. The
relevant algebraic invariants are the Betti numbers of the minimal free
resolution of the coordinate ring, as defined by Hilbert, whereas the intrinsic
geometry is encoded in the invariants of Brill-Noether theory. The investigator
will explore longstanding fundamental conjectures predicting precise
relationships between these invariants. The project investigates these
conjectures and generalizations of them using several new techniques such as
intersection theory, the moduli space of curves, Hurwitz space, and vector
bundle techniques.
