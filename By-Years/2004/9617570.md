9617570 Marotske In this project, the PI will estimate the climatological annual
cycle of the Indian Ocean from hydrographic and altimetric data. Observations
will be synthesized using an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM), and the
adjoint of the OGCM will be used to drive the model towards the data. The PI's
previous results have created a controversy about the strength and depth of the
overturning in the Indian Ocean, and even whether or not it occurs. Some of this
is a result of the boundary conditions used by the PI. Approaches to resolving
this controversy are included in this work.
