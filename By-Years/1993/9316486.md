9316486 Lasaga This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase
computer equipment to be installed, operated and maintained in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics at Yale University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the equipment acquisition. The
computer system will be used primarily by the geochemistry group at Yale who are
engaged in computer-intensive research on modeling of erosion and geochemical
cycles, quantum mechanical calculations of silicates, kinetics of mineral
dissolution and surface adsorption, molecular dynamics of silicate glasses and
melts, Monte Carlo simulations of crystal growth and solution under natural
conditions, and studies of chemical reactions in sedimentary basins and ore
deposits. ***
