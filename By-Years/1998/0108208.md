DEB- 0108208 Kalisz&lt;br/&gt;White-tailed deer population sizes have increased
dramatically over the last 50 years in the eastern half of North America. As a
result of this increase, the non-woody understory vegetation in forests is being
consumed to a greater degree. This has resulted in a significant decline in
flowering and fruiting of the native wild flower community in the presence of
deer. However, when deer were excluded via fences, some plant species that were
previously consumed by deer were observed to grow to larger sizes and reproduce.
Other species in the deer exclosures are not reproducing. The goal of this
research is to determine the likelihood of persistence or decline of understory
wild flower species in the continued presence or absence of deer. Using key
species naturally occurring in deer exclosure plots (fenced) and paired control
plots (no fence) we will monitor their growth, survival , flowering and
fruiting. Comparative demographic analyses using data from exclosure and control
plots will be conducted to determine the likelihood of persistence or extinction
of these species. This research will help inform wildlife and forest management
decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
