TITLE: ITR: Multiple-Word DNA Computing on Surfaces

This effort will extend the scope and power of surface-based DNA computing in
two major respects: i) by scale-up of the size of problem addressed
experimentally, ii) by increasing computational generality by extending
capabilities to the solution of circuit-SAT problems.

Goal (i) will be scaling up the computing process using a problem size of 24
bits as a target goal. 24 bits corresponds to a solution space size of 1.7 x 107
elements, a factor of ten million increase over the 4 bit problem addressed
previously.

Goal (ii) - For a computing model to be general, that is, capable of efficiently
simulating algorithms used in conventional electronic computing, it must be able
to efficiently simulate circuits. The ability to simulate Boolean formulas is
not sufficient. In theoretical work, it is shown that the surface-based
approach, when using multiple words and the MARK, DESTROY-UNMARKED, UNMARK, and
APPEND operations, is such a generalizable approach to computing, but it has not
been implemented experimentally. This proposal seeks to implement this approach
experimentally and to apply it to the solution of circuit-SAT problems.
