This is a renewal project to study carbon balance in the Florida everglades and
the interactive effects of climate change, hydrology, and saltwater intrusion.
This effort supports continued atmospheric observations of carbon dioxide and
methane concentrations, and water and energy fluxes at 2 sites in the freshwater
marsh regions of Everglades National Park. The collection of data from 2
additional sites will allow the science investigators to scale up to a regional
level and to better develop predictive models to estimate future ecosystem
greenhouse carbon balance in the Everglades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four study
sites are co-located with Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological
Research (FCE-LTER) sites and represent the strong gradients found in marsh and
mangrove ecosystems of the Park. This work will also contribute to research
being conducted through the NSF-supported National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON) Program, the National Park Service, the South Florida Water
Management District (SFWMD), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
