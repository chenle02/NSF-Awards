0420821&lt;br/&gt;Lomas&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
Bermuda Biological Station for Research provides funds for acquisition of a
sorting flow cytometer. This instrumentation will be used to address such topics
as ecology and physiology of symbiotic assemblages in coral reef ecosystems,
molecular mechanisms of organism and ecosystem response to stress, biodiversity
of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in the marine environment, especially in
the oligotrophic regime of the central Sargasso Sea gyre, biogeochemical cycling
processes, and especially the role of trace metals and biology in such
processes, as well as other projects. The broader impacts of the project include
training and education of undergraduates in use of the system to study the
biology and oceanography of the marine environment, as well as to provide
critical shared-use infrastructure for resident and visiting researchers who
study the Sargasso Sea. BBSR is providing cost-share of 30% of the project cost
from non-federal funds. This proposal is supported by the Division of Ocean
Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
