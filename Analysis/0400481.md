Measures, Dimension and Dynamics

University of N Texas

Abstract

The principal investigators propose to further advance the theory of conformal
systems as well as its applications and connections to areas of mathematics such
as the number theory, geometric measure theory, probability theory, and complex
analysis. Of special interest is the development of analytical tools required
within the context of conformal graph-directed Markov systems, infinite iterated
function systems, iterations of transcendental entire and meromorphic functions
and holomorphic endomorphisms. The proposed work involves graph-directed Markov
systems with infinitely many vertices and edges, interpretations between
counting functions, approximations and asymptotic limits, the properties of
various dimensions and measures within the context of graph directed Markov
systems. Applications involve Gauss' circle problem and Steinhaus' lattice
problem, Diophantine approximation and self-conformal measures, return times,
Kolmogorov's superposition theorem, the geometry and dynamics of the Fatou
function, Gibbs measures for elliptic functions, critically pseudo non-recurrent
elliptic functions, multifractal analysis of hyperbolic exponential functions,
and multifractal analysis of Axiom A holomorphic endomorphisms.
