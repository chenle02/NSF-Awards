The importance of the numerical simulation of physical phenomena by computers
cannot be overstated. Such computations have become essential tools both in
scientific research and in industrial research and development. This project
concerns the numerical simulation of the scattering of waves. Such simulations
have applications to sonar and radar, as well as in medical imaging, geophysics,
and many other applications. Wave phenomena become more complicated to model as
the frequency of the wave increases, and our current ability to accurately model
high-frequency waves is quite limited. This project seeks to develop new methods
for modeling high-frequency waves efficiently and to high accuracy. The project
provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

The numerical simulation of the scattering of waves from inhomogeneous media has
important applications in radar and sonar, medical imaging, geophysics, and a
host of other scientific applications. In many cases of interest, such
simulations can be performed by solving the variable coefficient Helmholtz
equation. The solutions of this equation are oscillatory, and the difficulty of
calculating them using conventional approaches grows quickly with the frequency
of the oscillations. Recently, one of the investigators developed a new class of
solvers for the variable coefficient Helmholtz equation that achieve extremely
high accuracy and have run times that scale much more slowly with increasing
frequency than conventional solvers. They operate by solving the nonlinear
Riccati equation that is satisfied by the logarithms of solutions of the
Helmholtz equation. Currently, these solvers only apply in special cases. This
project aims to extend them to the general case to develop a method for the
variable coefficient Helmholtz equation that is significantly faster than
current techniques.
