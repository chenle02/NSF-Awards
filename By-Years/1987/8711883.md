The purpose of this research is to study the effects of a parameterization of
orographically induced gravity wave drag in a limited area model and examine its
impact on two types of weather events. A series of short-range forecast
sensitivity experiments will be conducted for the cases of a midlatitude lee
cyclone and a monsoon depression over the Indian subcontinent. Forecasts using
this new parameterization will be compared with others in which an enhanced or
"envelope" topography is used. The effects of including shallow convection and
increasing model resolution will also be examined. A number of diagnostic
calculations will be made to better understand the formation and maintenance of
these storms. This grant represents a research initiation award under the
National Science Foundation's Research Opportunities for Women Program.
