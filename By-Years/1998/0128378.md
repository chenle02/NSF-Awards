This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
compositions of nanocomposite metal oxide catalysts for use in automotive
catalytic converters. Such nanocomposite catalysts will potentially lower
emissions of polluting gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons and
nitrogen oxides (NOx) particularly in the initial warm-up phase of engine
operation. With more stringent regulations on mobile source emissions, the need
for improved catalytic conversion has become a major priority for research
efforts worldwide. The key task will be to develop the ceria-based
nanocomposites suitably doped with highly dispersed noble metal (Pt or Pd) to
achieve highly active and thermally stable performance at costs comparable to
conventional catalysts.

The proposed project will have a major impact on commercial and consumer
automotive applications. Catalytic converters are used in nearly all gasoline-
powered automobiles. Improvement in catalytic converter efficiency will have
significant environmental impacts on the mobile air pollution sources.
