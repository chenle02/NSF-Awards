9731620 He This award supports initiation of collaborative research on testing
concurrent software systems between the research group led by Xudong He at North
Dakota State University and the research group led by Hong Zhu at Nanjing
University in China. Professor He is an expert on formal methods for concurrent
systems and Professor Zhu is an expert on software testing theory. The goals of
the project are to develop a theory for testing concurrent software systems in
general and to develop a methodology specifically for testing Hierarchical
Predicate Transition nets. Support on the Chinese side will be provided by the
National Natural Science Foundation of China.
