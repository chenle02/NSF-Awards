This SBIR Phase II research project will incorporate machine-learning techniques
into agneto-cardiography (MCG) that measures minute magnetic fields emitted by
the heart's electrophysiological activity, based on SQUID technology and
operable in typical (magnetically unshielded) hospital rooms, for early non-
invasive diagnosis of heart disease. The overall objective of this project is to
identify and localize, using MCG, cardiac ischemia, the leading cause of death
in the US. The focus will be on excellent predictability, ease of tuning, and
user transparency of machine learning tools. Upon successful completion of this
project MCG has the potential to become the new gold standard for the detection
of cardiac ischemia in patients presenting with suspicion of acute coronary
syndrome.

Worldwide, the lack of inexpensive and non-invasive cardiac diagnostic
techniques causes unnecessary delays in the recognition of acute coronary heart
disease and its treatment. The feasibility of MCG to diagnose heart disease has
been demonstrated. Machine learning tools provide quantitative methods for the
automated diagnosis of heart disease. After successful completion of this
project, physicians and nurses in leading U.S. hospitals can be trained in
automated MCG diagnosis. It will also usher the use of machine learning tools
for medical diagnosis in general.
