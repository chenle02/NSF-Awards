This award provides travel support for student participation in the 2017 meeting
of the APS Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. The conference
program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and
Optical Physics and Quantum Information Science. The support of students through
this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of
future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular,
and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable
them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held in Sacramento, CA in
June of 2017. It offers an opportunity for students to present their research
results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States,
but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US
students (students enrolled in US universities).
