The objective of this project is to develop a robust and effective sensing
technology to reconstruct acoustic radiation from a complex vibrating structure
subjected to an arbitrarily time-dependent excitation. The ultimate goal of this
investigation is to provide practicing engineers with a versatile and powerful
tool to visualize vibro-acoustic sources of complex structures such as
automobiles or airplanes. Special attention will be given to developing an
optimal regularization method to enhance accuracy and efficiency of
reconstruction of an acoustic field in a non-ideal environment. In particular,
the effect of acoustic reflection from nearby surfaces and transient nature of
acoustic radiation that have never been addressed in the traditional near-field
acoustic holography (NAH), will be considered. The research undertaken will have
a broad impact on providing a better understanding of acoustic radiation by
enabling one to "see" sound as it propagates away from a source and interacts
with surrounding fluid medium and structures. This visualization technology will
also significantly enhance the effectiveness of classroom teaching of acoustics.
The goal of education plan is to integrate the proposed research with
undergraduate and graduate programs in the Department of Mechanical Engineering
at Wayne State University (WSU), which will have a significant impact on student
learning of acoustics and noise control.
