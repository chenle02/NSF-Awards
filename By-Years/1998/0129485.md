The potential usage of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) for temporary in-
situ&lt;br/&gt;solidification of coarse-grained soils is being investigated.
Should magnetorheological&lt;br/&gt;materials be successfully introduced into
the pore space of a soil and solidified by&lt;br/&gt;application of a magnetic
field, they could significantly improve our ability to
sample&lt;br/&gt;saturated or dry cohesionless soils with minimum disturbance.
The cost savings over&lt;br/&gt;pore fluid freezing could be very significant.
Other potential future applications of MRFs&lt;br/&gt;in geotechnical
engineering may include: stabilization of soil for excavation
and&lt;br/&gt;tunneling, control of seepage and contaminant migration,
liquefaction hazard reduction,&lt;br/&gt;control of machine vibrations, soil
surcharging to accelerate pre-construction settlement&lt;br/&gt;and others. The
present exploratory laboratory program will include tests for
hydraulic&lt;br/&gt;conductivity, stiffness, strength, volume change
susceptibility due to vibration, and&lt;br/&gt;stability of open cuts in MRF-
stabilized soils.&lt;br/&gt;
