Auburn University will use this grant to connect Patterson State Technical
College to the Internet. The students and faculty of Patterson State Technical
College need the Internet connections to be able to access information resources
throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the
faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.
The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
