This is a 3-year continuation of GPS and precision gravity measurements and
modeling of the kinematics of the Yellowstone system. The PI will 1) observe in
1989 and 1991, a 50+ station GPS network for systematic long-term studies of
horizontal and vertical deformation focusing on the caldera, 2) observe a 208
station precision gravity network particularly in areas of the caldera that may
be near magma bodies, 3) observe GPS at trilateration stations established in
1950 across the Yellowstone caldera, 4) compare GPS and trilateration
measurements at key sites that were originally observed by EDM in 1975, 5)
invert the newly acquired GPS, leveling and precision gravity data using Green's
function formulations for source geometries, and 6) assess the temporal and
spatial relationships of crustal deformation to rheological models and the
temporal and spatial variations in seismicity and stress fields. The study will
address several key issues: 1) the kinematics of a volcanically and seismically
active continental hot spot, 2) a comparison of the methodologies of GPS. EDM
and precision gravity to assess deformation sources, and 3) to determine the
inter-relationships between volcanic features, seismicity, crustal deformation
and magmatic sources.
