This project develops and analyzes mesh and method-adaptive high-order numerical
methods for solving partial differential equations. That is, high order methods
such as spectral methods, WENO schemes, radial basis functions and discrete
variable expansions will be incorporated with various mesh sizes to create a
highly accurate, flexible and robust method that varies by domain depending on
the smoothness of the solution in that region. High order adaptive viscosity
discontinuous Galerkin methods will also be considered to stabilize the
nonlinear problem and enhance accuracy. Such techniques can be considered as
optimal, since they combine the best mesh with the highest possible order
accuracy throughout the computational domain. In one important application, an
efficient three dimensional parallel multi-domain mesh-adaptive spectral penalty
code will be created for the simulation of the reactive flow in a scramjet
engine's cavity flame holder, which is critical for designing a supersonic
engine. This work will use an already successful two dimensional static multi-
domain spectral penalty reactive code. One and two dimensional mesh-adaptive
hybrid methods will be simultaneously developed.

These robust, accurate and adaptive techniques have a broad range of
applications, including combustion, wave propagation in heterogeneous media and
supersonic shock waves. Such problems demand highly accurate and efficient
numerical algorithms in order to capture small-scale features of the solution.
The proposed techniques in this project are well suited to perform these types
of simulations. In addition to the supersonic scramjet engine example, one
interesting application is the modeling of water propagation in a fuel cell
unit. Understanding the small-scale phenomenon is critical to enhance the fuel
efficiency of a fuel cell. In this case, the adaptive high order numerical
simulations are crucial since the laboratory experiments are costly, difficult
to measure and even fail to capture such small-scale phenomenon. Finally, this
project advances state of the art computational methods and will provide
valuable insight into the investigation of various challenging physical and
engineering problems.
