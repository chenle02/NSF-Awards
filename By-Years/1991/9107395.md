Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a general scheme for extending logic
programming languages to include constraints. However, CLP languages, as well as
most other constraint-based languages and systems, only allow the programmer to
specify constraints that must hold. In many applications, such as interactive
graphics, page layout, and decision support, one needs to express preferences as
well as strict requirements. The authors have designed a generalization of the
CLP scheme, Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming (HCLP), which allows a
programmer to express both required and preferential constraints, with an
arbitrary number of strengths of preference. Development of HCLP will continue
on the practical side, a goal is to improve the implementation of an instance of
the language scheme, including incorporating efficient constraint solvers and
adding new ways of comparing potential solutions. Its utility will be tested by
using interactive graphics, as well as document formatting, decision support,
and scheduling, as test applications. On the theoretical side, it is planned to
extend the constraint hierarchy formalism to include read-only variables and
partially ordered hierarchies.
