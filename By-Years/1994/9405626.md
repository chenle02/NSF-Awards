9405626 Anastasio Ambiguity exists as to the extent and scale of volume strain
associated with cleavage development. Geochemical and geometric methods commonly
produce differing measures of strain in the same formation. This project will
examine folds with variable cleavage development in the Lost River Range, Idaho.
Strain will be measured both chemically and geometrically. Results will provide
independent estimates of strain and help resolve the several different
hypotheses for the conservation or mobility of various ions in pore waters.
