The long term goal of this research is to elucidate the basic mechanisms
underlying the regenerative response of central neurons to injury. Pathway
selection of the goldfish Mauthner cell will be determined, after injury to its
axon by spinal cord crush and the relationship to those pathways to the presence
of extracellular matrix glycoproteins. These studies will be done in the context
of potential recovery of behavior. Elucidation of factors that influence growth
of neurons within the central nervous system is critical to our understanding of
the failure of many central mammalian neurons to undergo regeneration.
