The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Professor Duncan on gas-phase complexes of metal ions of
the form (M+)(L)sub-x, where M is a metal such as aluminum, calcium, or
magnesium, and L is a small molecule. Pulsed laser vaporization techniques are
used to produce ion complexes in a molecular beam environment. Time-of-flight
mass spectrometry, laser photodissociation, laser-induced fluorescence, and
threshold ionization photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to obtain
information about the structures, electronic state energies, vibrational
frequencies, and dissociation energies of these species. Ab initio calculations
of certain systems will be carried out for comparison with experiment. In the
gas phase metal ions are capable of attaching to small molecules, forming
complexes with unusual bonding and energy characteristics. These are being
studied in this project in spectroscopic and photochemical experiments in order
to better understand the nature of the forces holding the complexes together.
The data obtained from these studies will assist in understanding processes
involved in metal-containing plasmas, metal solutions, and biological metal
centers.
