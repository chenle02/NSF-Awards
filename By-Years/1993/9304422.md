Utility of marginal marine foraminifera as criteria for sequence boundaries
will be tested, in three intervals in the Campanian Blackhawk and Sego
formations. Samples will be collected from known marginal marine facies, a known
sequence boundary related to an incised valley event, and a suspected sequence
boundary. Foram assemblages will be analyzed by faunal abundance, planktonic/
benthonic ratios, agglutinated/calcareous ratios, and species diversity. Areal
extent of marginal marine deposits along a suspected sequence boundary will help
predict likelihood of encountering such an interval in a core or outcrop.
