This proposal requests funds to assist in the implementation of a Molecular
Graphics Facility at the University of Minnesota. The Molecular Graphics
Facility will support research on protein and DNA structure, function, and
dynamics by biophysical methods. The development of this facility will enhance
the research capabilities of a number of researchers of national and
international reputation whose well-established projects require access to
molecular graphics. Support is recommended.
