Intelligent interface agents are computer programs that employ artificial
intelligence and other techniques in order to provide expert, autonomous
assistance to a user dealing with particular computer applications. This
research addresses the question of learning as a method by which an agent can
acquire sufficient amounts of information about the user, the application, and
the communication and collaboration strategies to be able to empower the user.
The goal of this project is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for
the hypothesis to hold that an interface agent can be given access to the
information it needs to program itself. The agent is given a minimum of
background knowledge and learns appropriate situation-action rules by observing
the user's interaction with the application, by receiving feedback from the user
about certain rules, and by copying the situation-action rules employed by
agents assisting other users in the same application. The project will first
develop a generic architecture for building learning interface agents. This will
then be used in concrete examples to test the main hypothesis.
