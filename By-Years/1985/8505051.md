The National Science Foundation will seekassistance from and interaction with
the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and National Research Council in the
engineering research and development field. Activities to be engaged in will
cover a wide range of subjects in the field of basic engineering and technology
and will have been identified as a result of discussions between both parties
and with other Government agencies. A Cross-Disciplinary Research Committee will
be established to review the programs and management of the Engineering Research
Centers to help insure that a high quality research program is sustained over
the long-term. Further, a Committee will be established to review and analyze
the National ScienceFoundation's current and planned Engineering Programs within
the Engineering Directorate to improve the engineering research program. In
addition, the NAE will make recommendations to strengthen the Engineering
Directorate programs to meet the needs of engineering fields which are of basic
importance to the Nation's technical and economic leadership and to contribute
to the development of the manpower and research base for critical and emerging
technologies in the United States.
