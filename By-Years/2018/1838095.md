Faculty from five different institutions will organize and manage a workshop for
undergraduates that will provide an opportunity to learn how to conduct
meteorological research in Greenland. Students who participate in this
experience will learn how to make measurements of energy fluxes and upper air
radiosonde measurements at or near the Greenland ice sheet. They will also learn
about the history of weather and climate measurements in Greenland and get the
opportunity to share cultures with faculty and college students from Greenland.
The workshop will be held in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland and potentially include
training at Summit Station, high (11,000 ft.) on the Greenland Ice
Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for participation in the workshop will
be available in early 2019. Selection of the workshop attendees will be made by
a committee of faculty from five different institutions, including the
University of Michigan, Virginia Tech University, Hampton University,
Pennsylvania State University College Park and the University of Albany.
Students who attend the workshop will benefit from an exceptional experiential
learning opportunity for undergraduates. The group will include students and
faculty from Greenland, providing an opportunity for international
collaborations. The workshop contributes to NSF's Strategic Objective 2.2 "STEM
Workforce: Foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce
and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation." (NSF Strategic
Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
