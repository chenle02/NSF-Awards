The PI (principal investigator) plans to continue his research&lt;br/&gt;program
in metric and comparison geometry. The PI is pursuing to solve or&lt;br/&gt;make
progress on some basic problems in the following two areas:
collapsed&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian manifolds with curvature bounded from below and
positively&lt;br/&gt;curved manifolds with symmetry. In this research,
mathematics from several&lt;br/&gt;disciplines interact, such as metric
comparison geometry including&lt;br/&gt;Alexandrov geometry, geometric analysis
and topology. This project is buit&lt;br/&gt;on the early success by PI in the
study of the collapsed Riemannian&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with curvature bounded
from above and below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is the foundation of the
natural sciences, and&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry and Riemannian geometry
are among the most important&lt;br/&gt;branches that interact with other natural
sciences such as physics. The PI&lt;br/&gt;is pursuing to solve some basic
problems in the above fields, which will have a broad intellectual impact. The
PI will continue to actively pursue collaborations with other mathematicians in
the United States and abroad, and speak at several national and international
conferences in the next three years.&lt;br/&gt;
