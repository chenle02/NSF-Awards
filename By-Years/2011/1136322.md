The Phase I Robert Noyce Teacher Education Scholarship program at Siena College
recruits, certifies, and retains twenty-one unique high-achieving STEM majors to
become teachers in high-need middle and high schools. In years 2, 3, and 4 of
the project, seven new Noyce Scholars are selected and supported in their junior
and senior years with $20,000 scholarships. A number of faculty from several
STEM disciplines participate in the project. The Siena Noyce Scholarship program
benefits from partnership with the Schenectady City School District and several
additional local schools that have significant high-need populations. The
program implements a cohort strategy that builds on rigorous research-based
undergraduate STEM programs. The program implements the viewpoint that STEM
teachers should balance the content of authentic science, which should be the
same for all students in a particular major, with practical preparation in
education. The model also addresses and tests the importance of research
experiences and interdisciplinary learning for STEM education majors as the
basis for excellence in teaching. Assessments are measuring the effectiveness of
attracting and retaining students, preparing them to teach in high-need schools,
and retaining them as teachers.
