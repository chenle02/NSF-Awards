This research program aims at developing the geometric foundations that
underlie practically relevant properties of highly nonlinear control systems
(that is, systems whose dynamics are inadequately, or not at all, described by
linear approximations). Highly oscillatory control variations will be examined
with the goal of obtaining better criteria for controllability and optimality
than presently exist, and to obtain new algorithms for stabilizing feedback
laws. Methods from algebraic combinatorics will be used to characterize the
computational complexity of deciding controllability, stabilizability and other
relevant control objectives and to develop new path planning algorithms. This
project will develop the geometric foundations that underlie the dynamics of
high-performance automatic control systems. It focuses primarily on systems that
have very highly nonlinear dynamics and that have many interconnected components
influencing each other. The engineering demands for ever higher performance, or
even optimality, often require completely new control designs since classical
linearization techniques for control design is often inadequate in such
situations. By bringing together techniques from various areas of pure
mathematics, such as differential geometry and algebraic combinatorics, new
algorithms for finding optimal solutions to path planning problems (e.g., for
robot arms or largely autonomously operating intelligent vehicles) will be
developed.
