This project builds on the PI's archival fieldwork and initial analysis of turn-
of-the-century Argentine criminology, to document its rise and application in
state practices. It incorporates newly available sources that connect it to the
broader political and legal history of the nation and region. It examines the
impact of criminological theory on law and legislation and state policies
intended to regulate and discipline deviant behavior in the context of
modernizing Argentina. It examines the practical application of criminological
theories in four key areas: &lt;br/&gt;New techniques of identification in
policing&lt;br/&gt;The scientific reform of prison discipline&lt;br/&gt;The
impact of positivist criminology on national legislation in the "social defense"
laws of 1902 and 1910&lt;br/&gt;The campaign to modernize the national Criminal
Code. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Encoding the Criminal unites two approaches, the
history of science, and Latin American history. It focuses systematically on the
contributions of Argentine scientists, and the impact of their ideas on local
developments as well as on a larger body of international scientific thought.
The project is part of an emerging field of historical inquiry that examines the
interaction between science, politics, and culture. It provides new data and an
important perspective not often taken into account in studies of science,
technology and society. The project contributes to broader discussions of the
role of science on state policy and law. It illuminates public debates about the
role of science in determining the causes and treatments of crime. &lt;br/&gt;
