The avian song control system provides a model for many aspects of neural
integration, plasticity, and learning. Songbirds learn their songs by imitating
external models, and the major brain nuclei involved in vocal behavior have been
identified. Dr. David Vicario will employ physiological, anatomical, and
behavioral techniques to study the development, organization and operational
principles of this system, conceived of as a circuit assembled from cellular
components. The main experimental theme will be the initiation of learned
vocalizations and their assembly out of respiratory and syringeal components.
The results of this work will help elucidate how learned and unlearned elements
are combined to produce a complex behavior and how they are represented in the
brain.
