Principals for the Advancement of Leadership in Science (PALS) is a three-year
project designed to establish a network of centers throughout the United States
for the enhancement of science leadership among elementary school principals.
The National Science Teachers Association, the National Association of
Elementary School Principals, the National Science Supervisors Association, and
other public and private groups will form an alliance promoting science
leadership of principals. In l988, twelve PALS Network center directors,
assisted by a cadre of experienced elementary school principal consultants, will
establish centers of science instruction and support for principals. Beginning
in l989 each of the centers will conduct three Regional Science Leadership
Conferences for principal/partner teams, for a total of thirty-six conferences
involving approximately 1,080 school administrator leaders. In addition, the
PALS network sites, interconnected by computers and linked to the National
Science Education Computer Network, will establish themselves as highly-visible,
long-term centers of support and service for advocating science leadership among
elementary school principals.
