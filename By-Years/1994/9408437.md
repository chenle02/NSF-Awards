9408437 Bernholc A comprehensive theoretical investigation will be done of the
electronic properties and growth of wide band gap semiconductors. The studies of
growth of diamond will concentrate on mechanisms and focus mainly on atomic
layer epitaxy processes and step-flow growth. The studies of aluminum nitride
and gallium nitride will focus on native defects, stoichiometry effects, and
doping and impurity incorporation. For aluminum nitride, conditions leading to
negative electron affinity will be identified. There will be extensive
interactions with experimentalists. Quantum molecular dynamics will be used,
supplemented with semi-empirical methods. Codes will be run primarily on
massively parallel computers and algorithms will be developed as required. %%%
This theoretical research will focus on an important class of semiconducting
materials. Advanced computational methods will be utilized in these
investigations including massively parallel computers. Of particular interest is
the emphasis on growth processes for these materials. ***
