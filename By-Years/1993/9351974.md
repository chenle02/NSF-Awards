The department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Calvin College is creating
a Macintosh laboratory in which students can use Mathematica and other
mathematical software to do mathematics. All sections of first-year calculus are
being taught in a lecture/lab format, meeting three hours per week for lecture
and for one two-hour period each week in the laboratory. The laboratory
component of the course is improving the student experience in calculus.
Students are gaining a deeper, more conceptual understanding of mathematical
ideas because they are freed from some of their computational limitations and
can visualize more easily using the powerful graphical capability of Mathematica
and the Macintosh. Students are working in pairs; thus facilitating cooperative
learning. The laboratory is equipped with 19 Macintosh IIvx computers.The
laboratory are also being used in most upper-level mathematics courses, but in a
somewhat different way. Students in those courses are already familiar with the
software, so they are working more independently. They are given regular
assignments that require them to go to the lab on their own to complete the
assignment using Mathematica.
