Project will move West Valley College's successful prior efforts in the
computerization of the curriculum into a more advanced stage. The mathematics
faculty members have been forward looking in their extensive use of the
previously available computing devices in their instructional program. They are
now ready to undertake an expansion that will incorporate important new
technologies, i.e., computer graphics and symbolic algebra systems.
