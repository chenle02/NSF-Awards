This individual investigator award will support research in ultrafast optics and
semiconductor physics. As switching rates in electronic devices are pushed to
ever higher frequencies, it becomes increasingly important to understand carrier
transport phenomena in semiconductors on picosecond and femtosecond time-scales.
Using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy it is possible to impulsively excite a
semiconductor with a femtosecond optical pulse or single-cycle electromagnetic
pulse, and record the resulting motion of charge in time. This project, at a
predominately undergraduate institution, will use these techniques to
investigate charge transport and hot-carrier phenomena in semiconductors and
semiconductor heterostructures on time-scales that will be relevant to future
devices. One focus of research will be to investigate hot carrier phenomena in
semiconductors using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy in a magnetic field. The
second project will use ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to study coherent
intersubband phenomena in semiconductor quantum wells. The undergraduate
researchers involved with this project will obtain training in state of the art
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support research in ultrafast
optics and semiconductor physics at a predominately undergraduate institution.
As computers and other electronic devices become ever faster, it becomes
increasingly important to understand the flow of electrical current in
semiconductors and other electronic materials on time-scales of a trillionth of
a second or less. This project will use femtosecond light pulses to excite
bursts of current in semiconductors, and will record the evolution of the
current pulses in time by recording the electromagnetic waves they emit. The
project goal is to study the scattering of electrons and coherent phenomena in
semiconductor devices. This will be relevant to the development of electronic
technology. The undergraduate researchers involved with this project will obtain
training in state of the art techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
