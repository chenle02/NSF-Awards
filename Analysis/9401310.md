9401310 Tartar In the last twenty years, the Principal Investigator has
pioneered the creation of most of the new mathematical tools which are now used
for studying microstructures appearing in the (usually nonlinear partial
differential equations of Continuum Mechanics or Physics: Homogenization,
Compensated Compactness, H-measures. The present Proposal deals with research of
a theoretical nature, with the purposes of unifying many fragmentary results and
of creating a still more powerful tool. It links questions of Classical Analysis
on one side to the description of microstructures observed in existing materials
on the other side, one important application being to devise new materials whose
microstructure creates some improved properties over existing materials. In the
last twenty years, the Principal Investigator has pioneered the creation of most
of the new mathematical tools which are now used for studying the
microstructures appearing in important situations in Material Sciences and
Engineering. This Proposal deals with theoretical questions which can help
describing how to devise new materials whose structure at a fine level is
responsible for improved properties over existing materials.
