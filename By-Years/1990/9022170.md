The objective of this research is the physics of the return stroke in natural
lightning. Much of the experimental work would be performed in Florida as part
of future coordinated studies of rocket-triggered lightning. Correlated, two-
station measurements of electric fields are planned and would be used to better
characterize the lightning near-field environment, and to test the transmission-
line model and other return stroke models. Return stroke velocity, a key
parameter in return stroke modeling, would be measured photelectrically, and
fast time- and height-resolved measurements of narrow-band lightning emissions
near the base of the channel would be used to investigate recent hypotheses
concerning the mechanism of return stroke initiation. Radiometric observations
of lightning emissions in the near- IR and visible would be used as a means of
remotely determining lightning channel temperatures. Together with simultaneous
measurements of current, these data would provide a unique opportunity for
testing numerical models of slow time-varying arcs in air.
