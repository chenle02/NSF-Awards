Support is provided for acquisition of an automation research instrumentation
system which consists of a VAX 11/750 minicomputer system having a 2-megabyte
directly addressable memory and 121-megabyte disk storage and a Ramteck image
display system. This equipment will enhance research in image processing/pattern
recognition, robotics, automatic inspection methodologies, and biomedical
applications. Eight specific projects involved are: automated inspection of VLSI
resist patterns on wafers as imaged by scanning electron microscopy, development
of a knowledge-based system for image processing methodologies, orientation
identification and shape recognition of three-dimensional objects, robotic touch
sensors and position sensors, non-stationary statistical image modeling, pattern
recognition study of sarcomere dynamics in striated muscle, digital radiographic
processing research, and analysis of diastolic filling parameters by multiple
gated acquisition studies.
