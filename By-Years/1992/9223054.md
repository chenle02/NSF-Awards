This research project addresses the magneto-optic response of ZnSe- based
quantum well structures incorporating diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS)
layers such as ZnFeSe or ZnMnSe. DMS-based heterostructures are unique among
semiconductor quantum wells in that the band offsets between layers can be tuned
continuously via the application of an external magnetic field. The project also
involves the preparation an study of new magnetic alloys based on zinc,
manganese, iron and selenium. The materials can be viewed as two phases, one
being a Brillouin paramagnet, the other being a Van Vleck paramagnet. The two
phases lead to novel magnetic behavior which can be tuned by varying temperature
and the external magnetic field. %%% This research project involves the
synthesis and characterization of new semiconducting materials which are also
magnetic. These unusual materials have optical properties that vary when they
are placed in a magnetic field. These properties offer promise in microwave and
information storage technologies.
