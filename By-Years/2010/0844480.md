This goal of this research project is to understand the tradeoffs between the
MapReduce and parallel DBMS approaches to performing large-scale data analysis
over large clusters of computers, and to bring together ideas from both
communities. Both MapReduce and parallel database systems provide scalable data
processing over hundreds to thousands of nodes. Both provide a stylized, high-
level programming environment that allows users to efficiently filter and
combine datasets while masking much of the complexity of parallelizing
computation over a cluster. But they differ in substantial ways as well, such as
their approaches to dealing with fault tolerance, their data modeling
requirements, their query flexibility, and their ability to function in a
heterogeneous processing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-university
team of researchers is investigating the effect of these differences on the
performance and scalability of these two approaches. The research team is
running a set of experiments that compare an open source MapReduce
implementation (Hadoop) to two commercial parallel database systems (DB2 and
Vertica) on a benchmark that includes a range of tasks designed to assess the
tradeoffs between both approaches. The research team is seeking to understand
which differences between the two approaches to performing large scale data
analysis are fundamental tradeoffs, and which differences are possible to
combine inside a single solution, so that ideas from one community can benefit
the other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
