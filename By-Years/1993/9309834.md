9309834 Laguna Gravitational Physics is one of the areas in which supercomputer
technology has imprinted its most dramatic effects. One and two dimensional
numerical simulations of strongly gravitating systems and inhomogeneous
spacetimes can be performed with an extremely high degree of resolution, and
modeling of three dimensional systems is finally within reach. Three dimensional
studies of general relativistic systems require, even with existing
supercomputers, codes capable of efficiently utilizing computer memory and
speed. The challenge is then an intensive pursuit of computational optimality as
a function of physical information obtained. Two principal areas will be
investigated: 1. ` ` Numerical Relativity and Black Hole Collisions: Work will
be conducted to obtain initial data using York's original conformal method. The
three dimensional cosmological code developed by Kurki Suonio, Laguna and
Matzner is being adapted to compute black hole evolution. This code will serve
as an arena to investigate implementations of boundary conditions, gauge
conditions and evolution schemes. Numerical evolution of an inhomogeneous,
planar, vacuum cosmology using Ashtekar's new variables will be studied. !` 2. `
` Inhomogeneous Cosmologies and Inflation: The Kurki Suonio/Laguna/Matzner
cosmological code will be used to investigate the onset of inflation under
inhomogeneous matter sources. The COBE satellite has provided observations of
cosmic background radiation anisotropies. Collisionless matter and eventually
hydrodynamical sources will be implemented into the Kurki Suonio/Laguna/Matzner
code to inves tigate anisotropic effects in the cosmic background radiation from
the propagation of microwave photons through evolving density inhomogeneities
(Rees Sciama effect). !` ***
