The proposed planning grant, "Planning a Center for Advancement of Emerging
Technology Applications," presents a plan by six coalition two-year technical
colleges in Tennessee to develop a Center in Tennessee that will serve as a
national model. Research is presented which demonstrates the importance of
coalition building and the need for a timely linkage to take the information
sharing from those engaged in development of new technologies and their
applications to the companies that can actually put the applications into
practice. The goal of the proposed planning grant is to prepare a plan that lays
the groundwork for a Center that will function as a clearinghouse. Through this
clearinghouse, information will be shared statewide and nationally through
conferences, Internet communication and published materials, so that colleges
and universities can provide education for graduates going into the technology
fields.The proposed center will serve as an intermediary between research
organizations and the companies which use the technology. Using research data
from these contacts, the center can summarize ongoing projects and anticipate
the needs of the manufacturing and service sectors in terms of technology
applications. Ultimately, a research-community college-industry alliance will
develop, producing a defined channel and improved process for increasing
productivity.Six Tennessee two-year colleges are forming this coalition to
develop a plan that is producing a framework for identifying and developing
emerging engineering technology programs. Components for linkages with industry,
other colleges and universities and high schools are important in the project.
