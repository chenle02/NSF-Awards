This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop an
optofluidic platform for applications in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that
require enhanced detection sensitivity. In the US, NMR accounts for the largest
share of the molecular spectroscopy market, with an estimated value of $700
million in 2013 and $1 billion in 2018. The compact, portable system that will
result from this work will find applications in existing, emerging, or new
markets connected to areas spanning point-of-care diagnostics, bio-defense,
environmental monitoring, and food safety. This technology will also bring new
opportunities to analytical science, particularly in studies that demand the
high-throughput characterization of varied chemical moieties, as routinely
carried out in the pharmaceutical industry. Further, this work will positively
impact efforts to improve healthcare facilities through the development of
advanced and low-cost diagnostic tools.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to circumvent
multiple limitations of existing nuclear spin polarization technologies through
a robust, low-cost platform that leverages recent experimental findings. The
technology to be developed introduces a new, laser-assisted route to enhancing
the fractional alignment of nuclear spins in a target fluid, thus reducing the
analyte's volume, the acquisition time, and the cost and size of the overall NMR
system. The proposed approach articulates fluidics and photonic technologies to
dynamically polarize fluids exposed to a properly engineered solid-state matrix.
A central goal is to engineer the proposed device and conduct initial
characterizations of its performance using model target fluids; the anticipated
level of polarization is of the order 0.1% to 1% (i.e., orders of magnitude
superior than that possible with commercially available magnets). These
'hyperpolarized' fluids can be used directly for inspection, or as a resource to
post-polarize other (e.g., light-sensitive) fluidic systems.
