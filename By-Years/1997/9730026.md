9712209 Talley This is a collaborative study of the circulation and various
dynamical and water mass features of the Pacific. The contribution of the
present proposal is to provide initial reference level estimates for the inverse
modeling, and to interact with the other investigators as the model is
developed. Specific research interests will be continued and completed in the
course of developing the 3-D circulation model. The project will also produce
atlas of the one-time WHP survey data. There will be two volumes: (1) the
composite vertical sections and property-property plots and (2) selected
isopycnal maps. Each volume will consist of a printed atlas with standard plot
selections, and an online atlas with interactive plotting and data extraction
capability.
