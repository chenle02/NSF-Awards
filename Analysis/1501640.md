This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Graduate Summer School in Modern Harmonic Analysis and Its Applications" that
will be held July 20-August 7, 2015, at the College Park campus of the
University of Maryland. This summer school for graduate students will focus on
modern harmonic analysis and applications, specifically, topics from Fourier and
time-frequency analysis, finite frame theory, sparse transforms, and geometric
and analytic methods for modeling big data. The instruction comprises seven
four-day-long lecture series, including a tutorial, supplemented by computer lab
work. The objectives are to quickly review the fundamentals, focus on the
developments of the last 10 years, and provide a glimpse of the state of current
research and open problems. Most of this information is available only in the
form of original research papers or preprints; the summer school is intended to
make this material accessible to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers,
and other nonspecialists.

This summer school, which is jointly sponsored by the University of Maryland and
the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications (IMA) through the latter's
IMA Participating Institution Graduate Student Summer Program, brings together
some of the leading harmonic analysts in the U.S. to explore topics that lie at
the heart of modern harmonic analysis. The primary topics of the courses (with
the corresponding lecturers) are the following: Fourier analysis (John
Benedetto); frames and time-freqency analysis (Chris Heil); preconditioning of
finite frames (Kasso Okoudjou); nonlinear analysis with frames (Radu Balan);
sparse Fourier transforms (Anna Gilbert); geometric and analytic methods for
modeling data, and their application (Gilad Lerman); and harmonic analysis of
big data (Wojtek Czaja).
