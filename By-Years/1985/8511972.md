This project is to develop additional concepts and methods, as well as extend
existing concepts, for quantitative assessment of seismic structural damage and
reliability, and implementation of damage-limiting aseismic design. The specific
components of the program are as follows: to develop quantitative models for
defining seismic damage of structures, to define damage-related ground motion
intensity, and to develop criteria and suggest associated procedures for
designing damage-limiting earthquake-resistant structures within the framework
of reliability. The research is expanded on the noval damage model already
developed based on the established damage tolerance levels and a newly defined
damage index. Further improvement is necessary to cover various material types
and structural systems. The results would lead to major improvements in seismic
design and provde a means to maintain adequate safety at acceptable costs.
