The Department of Sociology, Queens College, The City University of New York
will develop an undergraduate laboratory using high speed microcomputers and an
ethernet network. The network will be bridged to the Queens College Academic
Computer Center Network and from there to NYSERNET, the CUNY University- wide
Computer and NSFNET. This laboratory will permit the department to significantly
enhance its curriculum at the introductory and advanced level.Three major
objectives of the project are: 1) Infusing the content of lower level methods
and statistics courses with 'hands-on' laboratory exercises, thus upgrading the
quantitative and scientific reasoning skills of students, especially those who
major in sociology. Many of these students are women and many are members of
racial and ethnic minorities. 2) Providing intensive independent research
experiences for students considering scientific careers in sociology, through
small laboratory-based upper level research courses closely supervised by senior
faculty. Many students from the department have gone on to their Ph.D.s at
graduate schools throughout the U.S. 3) Disseminating the results and products
of our experience to other sociology and social science departments throughout
the United States.
