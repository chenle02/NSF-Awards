Concentrated effort is directed toward research in positron emission tomography
(PET) and toward the technical aspects of beginning a new PET center. Current
research includes attenuation correction for PET using reprojection, maximum
likelihood reconstruction, a detailed quality assurance program for PET using
advanced statistical techniques, and noise correlation and specification for
tomographic imaging. Attention is focused on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
imaging, including the development of physiological contrast agents and
optimization of pulse sequences for different imaging requirements.
