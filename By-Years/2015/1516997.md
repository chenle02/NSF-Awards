This program will address constraints on cosmological dark energy and
alternative gravity models using probes of the growth of cosmic structures.
Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, and the use
of cosmologically inspired sculptures as a basis for public outreach aimed at
both science- and art-oriented audiences.

The research will combine galaxy-galaxy lensing with galaxy clustering to
determine the evolution of dark matter clustering. Using a novel method
developed by the PI, the proposal also aims at measuring the geometry and dark
matter distribution at intermediate redshifts via observations of the Lyman-
alpha forest. Finally, the PI proposes to test modified gravity by measuring the
extended mass profile of galaxy clusters.
