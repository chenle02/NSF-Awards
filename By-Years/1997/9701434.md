Florence Thomas, PI This program combines research in biomechanics with an
education component linking public, K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education.
The research addresses how the morphology of the predominate organisms in a
community affects biological processes at the scale of the whole community
rather than the scale of the individual. Rates of nutrient uptake by whole
communities, that vary in flexibility and morphology, will be measured over a
range of water velocity in a research flume. Comparisons of measured uptake
rates with those calculated using empirically derived equations, describing mass
transfer to non-biotic surfaces, will be made to parameterize mass transfer
relationships for biotic surfaces. The results can be applied to other problems
concerning rates of transport within communities, such as feeding, fertilization
success, and the transport of other dissolved compounds such as pollutants. The
education component of the program includes: 1) the development of an
interactive display in a public aquarium to interpret flume experiments for
visitors and K-12 education programs; 2) research fellowships for minority
students; and 3) incorporation of biomechanics/hydrodynamics into undergraduate
courses.
