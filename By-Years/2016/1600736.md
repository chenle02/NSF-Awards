Since hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans regional area has undergone a massive
infrastructure transformation towards technology-driven and knowledge-based
industries. National and local growth predictions for employment in the STEM
fields and biosciences highlight an increasing need for a skilled workforce
ranging from highly qualified technicians to senior research scientists. The
Division of Science and Mathematics faculty at Delgado Community College (DCC)
have initiated a new Science Laboratory Technology (SLT) Program with a
concentration in Biotechnology to support the need for highly qualified
technicians in the biosciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
further enhance the SLT program. DCC faculty will: (1) develop a biofuels
special topics course working in partnership with the Joint BioEnergy Institute
(JBEI), (2) develop a Biotechnology Colloquium featuring speakers from industry
as well as faculty from local institutions, and (3) expand the Summer STEM
Challenges activities to support iGEM team activities. Efforts will also be
initiated to recruit and retain underrepresented students in the SLT program.
Project outcomes will be disseminated via the ATE Center, BioLink, and ATE
Central.
