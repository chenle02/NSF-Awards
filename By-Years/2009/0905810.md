This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan at a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology of underrepresented minorities. The title of the research and training
plan for this fellowship to David Rodriguez is "Population genetics of
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and New World amphibian declines." The host
institution for this research is Cornell University and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Kelly Zamudio.

Amphibians are declining at an unprecedented rate contributing to a decrease in
the earth's biodiversity, resulting in potentially dire consequences for
ecosystems in which those species play critical roles. The chytrid fungus
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)has been implicated in recent global
amphibian declines. This project is investigating the population genetics of Bd
in Central and South America to test two competing hypotheses that possibly
explain the epidemic; namely, the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis and the
spreading pathogen hypothesis.

The training objectives are to further develop expertise in i) bioinformatics,
ii) experimental laboratory techniques for assaying neutral and expressed genes,
and iii) model-based coalescent approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction,
population genetics, and studies of selection on pathogenicity genes. The
broader impacts include generating critical baseline data on the genetic
diversity of a pathogen that is a serious threat to global amphibian
biodiversity. The results contribute to implementing a more dynamic approach to
amphibian conservation that takes into account evolutionary processes in
predictive management efforts and proactive conservation programs. This
fellowship will also increase the participation of underrepresented groups at
the postdoctoral level.
