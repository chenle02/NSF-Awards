This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with modelling and analysis of
switched electronic systems. The systems will be modelled by linear time varying
periodic or quasi-periodic differential equations. Using the theory established
for such systems, predictions of stability, damping and harmonics will be done.
Such information will provide more qualitative information compared with time
domain simulation.
