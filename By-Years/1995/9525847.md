Abstract ATM-9525847 Webster, Peter J. University of Colorado Title: An
Integrated Approach for Examining the Large -Scale Interactions Between the
Atmosphere and Oceans on Intraseasonal Time Scales This is a three year project
to investigate the ocean-atmosphere interaction occurring within the TOGA COARE
(TC) domain and its ramifications for the entire Pacific basin, by an integrated
approach utilizing data, models and theory. Thus this topic in not only highly
relevant to TC objectives but also central to climate understanding and
prediction. The specific goals to be achieved are 1) Assembly of atmospheric,
oceanic and surface flux data sets and conduct diagnostic studies to do detailed
budget studies. 2) conduct ocean modeling studies of the response to different
types and scales of surface forcing especially during westerly wind bursts.
3)Analyze the wave structure of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system by using the
large scale data of the ocean and the atmosphere obtained during TOGA COARE IOP.
