With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the National
Science Foundation, Dr. Caryl Rusbult will continue her research into social
exchange processes. She is exploring the processes by which individuals maintain
stable ongoing relationships. This research is conducted not only in the
interpersonal relationships area but also in organizational behavior. Her
studies emphasize the functional value of adaptations to patterns of
interpendence. This work involves studies of commitment, responses to
dissatisfaction, accomodation processes, and organizational behavior. The
research on commitment will include the study of commitment in abusive
relationships. In studying responses to dissatisfaction, she will try to
identify features of a relationship and of individuals that promote different
responses. Studies in organizational behavior will consider policies that
encourage commitment to the organization. This work has important implications
for organizational maintainance and decay, divorce, interpersonal conflict,
neglect, social reconciliation, and group productivity.
