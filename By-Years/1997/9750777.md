The mathematics department oat College of DuPage proposes to establish two
computer classrooms with eighteen computers in each room for the purposes of
exploring the integration of computing technology into the mathematics
curriculum. fourteen additional copies of the software will be installed in an
open lab for students to use when class is not in session. The department has
some technology for demonstration purposes, but limited technology for student
use in the classroom. The goal of the project team is to achieve the following
six outcomes during the proposed two-year project: Improve mathematics teaching
and learning through the increased use of symbolic algebra and graphing
technology; Provide staff development workshops for secondary and postsecondary
mathematics teachers and faculty, to be conducted by the team of project
investigators, on the use of technology in the classroom; Meet the
recommendations of the Illinois Articulation Initiative of the Illinois Board of
Higher Education to address the quantitative literacy needs of postsecondary
students; and Meet the goals of curriculum reform set forth by the American
Mathematical Association for two-year Colleges and the Mathematics Association
of America; To achieve these outcomes, mathematics faculty and students will
engage in discovery learning to be led by classroom instructors. Classes will be
modeled to enable students to do mathematics as it is done in the workplace.
