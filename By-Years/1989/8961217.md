There exists a need for large scale liposome manufacturing processes which can
meet the growing market demand for liposomal drug delivery and controlled
release vehicles within constraints of stability, sterility and cost. They
propose to develop an improved large scale liposome manufacturing process. They
propose to do so by replacing the organic solvents used in the preparation of
liposomes with near critical or supercritical fluid (SCF) solvents. They also
plan to evaluate the use of SCFs as a replacement for liposome manufacturing by
high pressure homogenization. The displacement of organic solvents with
supercritical fluid solvents in the liposomal manufacturing process will reduce
the degradation of the phospholipids and encapsulated therapeutics and allow
rapid solvent separation, recovery and reuse. There are several potential
benefits to the proposed processes over existing laboratory and commercial
processes for the preparation of liposomes. The anticipated benefits are: non-
use of organic solvents; terminal sterilization of the manufactured liposomes;
an oxygen free atmosphere; replacement of significant heating effects with
cooling ones; lower pressure requirements when compared to high pressure
homogenization; lower O&amp;M costs; higher speed of processing; the potential
formation of uniform FATMLVs; the ability to operate continuously; and
scalability.
