This grant will fund urgently needed support through the SGER program to
analyze the June 20, 1990, earthquake in northern Iran. The principal
investigator has obtained a unique data set of 33 measurements of peak ground
acceleration recorded within 100 km of the source. This data set is unique
because the flow of technical information from that country is extremely slow
due to restrictions imposed on travel and field investigation in Iran. The
scientific community outside Iran is eager to learn about the behavior of the
ground-motion generated in the near- source region and the lessons to be learned
from this earthquake. The attenuation of peak ground acceleration with distance
and orientation will be analyzed and compared with other regions of the world.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
