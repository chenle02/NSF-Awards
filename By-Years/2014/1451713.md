While there is much discussion on what needs to be changed in engineering
education and how those changes should take place, there is no current venue for
sustaining a meaningful dialog on change and archiving these discussions for the
benefit of the entire engineering community. The proposed workshops will help to
advance knowledge and understanding about the purposes of engineering education
and begin a well-informed and lasting dialog on possible ways to reconceptualize
engineering education for the benefit of all participants. Sustained and
informed dialog is needed to created change in the face of the major disruptions
taking place in higher education and the workplace. To sustain the needed on-
going dialog, these workshops are framed around the organizational structure of
the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). A major goal of this
effort is to ensure broad and diverse participation. The leaders of three ASEE
divisions will coordinate the workshop. The workshops and significant
dissemination effort will broadly impact society by creating a scholarly and
sustainable dialog between multiple stakeholders in engineering education. The
workshops are intended to open up a new venue for dialog that captures a broader
range of voices. The project plan includes participation of the needed diverse
elements of the larger engineering education system. The plan provides resources
for long-term, sustainable dissemination anticipated to be in the form of a
self-sustaining dialog and discussion journal.
