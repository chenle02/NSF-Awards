This award provides NSF support for a planning grant to help Delaware set
priorities for the improvement&lt;br/&gt;of its basic infrastructure in the life
sciences. The main planning activity will be an assessment of existing
&lt;br/&gt;strengths and weaknesses in research, education, and business
development. Partner institutions include the &lt;br/&gt;Delaware Biotechnology
Institute, University of Delaware, Delaware Technical and community College,
Delaware State University, and Wesley College. The planning grant will enable
Delaware to collect data, establish a state committee, and develop a process for
selecting specific focus areas within the life sciences and biotechnology for
future sustainable infrastructure improvements.
