9613772 Nowack This research involves the use of seismic attributes, that is,
wavelet amplitudes, weighted instantaneous frequencies, and phase arrival times,
from seismic wave form data collected in the 1996 3-D Mt. Vesuvius, Italy,
seismic experiment. The experiment was an international cooperative effort of
Purdue University, the University of Naples, Italy, and the University of Nice-
Sophia Antipolis, France. The goal of this grant is to construct a 3-D model of
the seismic velocity and wave attenuation structure under Mt. Vesuvius.
Information from the model will be used to better understand the earthquake
tectonics and the source of magma for this actively erupting volcano that sits
in a region of high population density. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
