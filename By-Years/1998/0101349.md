The investigators propose to study the electrodynamics of the coupled
magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) system in the vicinity of the region-2 shielding
currents that link the inner plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere to the auroral
and subauroral ionosphere. The project will focus on two outstanding physics
questions: (1) the effects of field-aligned potential drops on global electric
field and precipitation patterns, and (2) the physical mechanisms involved in
the generation of Polarization Jet (PJ) events. The principal tool for carrying
out the proposed investigation will be the Rice Convection Model (RCM), an
established computer model that self-consistently follows the time evolution of
electric fields, currents, and plasma flow velocities in the quasi-static
approximation. Improvements in the numerical machinery and algorithms of the RCM
will be implemented, as needed, to investigate these phenomena. Model results
will be archived and visualization tools provided to facilitate comparisons with
data from incoherent scatter radars and polar-orbiting spacecraft, and with
empirically derived patterns of electric fields developed within the context of
the NSF CEDAR initiative. Comparisons with observational data will be carried
out in collaboration with Utah State University and as part of the GEM
Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling Campaign.
