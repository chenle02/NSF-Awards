The proposed team introduces a new paradigm for the design and manufacture of
pharmaceutical dosage forms. The new platform technology, 3D Integrated
Pharmaceuticals (3D IP), is inspired after the impressive progress realized by
the 3D IC (3D Integrated Circuits) model. The underlying concept of the proposed
approach, novel to the pharmaceutical industry, consists in looking at
pharmaceutical products as integrated systems. With 3D IP, dosage forms are
assembled from pre-fabricated working components, according to a pre-established
blueprint instead of by blending and compressing powders. The result is a
comparatively simple means of making pharmaceutical products with customized
shape, physical dimensions, and most importantly, drug release profile.

3D IP is a novel platform that has focused on producing pharmaceutical oral
dosage forms. Analogous to the design of 3D integrated circuits, built by the 3D
layer stacking of multiple functional components, 3D IP dosage forms are
assembled by stacking pre-fabricated functional components such as active
ingredient carrier, solubilizing function, ID/anti-counterfeiting, and tamper
prevention. The 3D IP technology has applications in areas where customizable
release for a target or active compound is needed, which extend beyond oral
pharmaceuticals, into transdermal markets, smart patches, agrochemicals,
nutraceuticals and personal care products.
