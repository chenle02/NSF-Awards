This project will evaluate data in support of the existence of a large island
in northernmost Sonora during the Mesozoic. Preliminary data suggests that the
island was surrounded by relatively deep marine environments, rather than the
shallow marine and fluvial environments postulated by previous workers. The data
will delineate the disposition of land masses along the southwestern margin of
North America during the Cretaceous. The results will have important tectonic
implications for the evolution of southwestern North America.
