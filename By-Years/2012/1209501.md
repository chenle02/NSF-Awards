This action funds Kimberlee Marcellus of Drexel University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Applying GIS to manage construction and demolition (C&D)
waste distribution in urban environments," during the summer of 2012 at Nagoya
University in Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi. The host scientist is Dr.
Hiroki Tanikawa.

The Intellectual Merit of the research is to advance a successful tracking
system to provide a uniform methodology to disclose C&D waste flows and
synthesize new and existing data to develop a centralized approach with a
geospatial component while answering the question: where do these waste flows
occur the most and in what time frame are they expected to enter secondary
markets?

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
