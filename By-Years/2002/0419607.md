This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
biosensor for the rapid detection of infectious agents such as pathogenic
bacteria. The key technology in the proposed work is the use of magnetostrictive
materials, which when exposed to a time varying magnetic field, can be made to
resonant at a characteristic frequency. The resultant oscillation amplitudes can
be monitored by a pick up coil.

The commercial application of this project will be in a number of areas,
including the detection of biological warfare agents, bacterial infections in
hospitals, and contaminations in food and water supplies.
