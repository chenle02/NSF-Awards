The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program will be supporting the research of Dr.
Steven M. Weinreb of the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State
University. Dr. Weinreb will be developing new methods of synthesizing
heterocyles, an important type of chemical structure found in many complex
structures. These are found in many of the substances used in modern agriculture
and medicine. Synthetic methodology and natural product total synthesis based
upon N-sulfinyl dienophile Diels-Alder cycloadditions will be pursued. The
methodology will specifically be applied to synthesis of the Nuphar alkaloid
7-epi-anhydronupharidine. In addition, an intramolecular version of the
procedure will be utilized for the stereoselective synthesis of vicinal diamines
in a new total synthesis of capreomycidine. This is a component of the
antibiotics capreomycine and the tuberactinomycidines, and will be used in an
efficient synthesis of streptolidine, which is a member of the streptothricin
antibiotics. A stereoselective synthesis of the vitamin biotin will also be
developed using this Diels-Alder based methodology. A new procedure for
synthesis of vicinal diamines will be investigated via metallation of cyclic
bis-imines. A novel variation of the Heck reaction will be studied in order to
efficiently synthesize saturated nitrogen heterocycles. Moreover, nickel
metallacycles derived from alkynes and carbon dioxide will be investigated in
order to develop some generally useful synthetic methodology. These
metallacycles will be utilized as beta-acylvinyl anions and their reactions with
several types of electrophiles will be tested.
