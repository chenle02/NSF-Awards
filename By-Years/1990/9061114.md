This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This is a Phase I project. The PI is developing a video
protocol for ISDN, to provide the foundation for all the real-time video
teleconferencing implementations likely to derive from the ISDN and image
compression technologies in the near future. The protocol is directed toward
personal computers, converting them to video telephones for the application. The
open architecture of personal computers will most likely be the platform of
choice for personal video telephones, which should be the boom market that will
cause the general public to finally embrace the ISDN standard. The principal
objective of this protocol is to provide support for personal video
teleconferencing over basic access ISDN, and corporate video teleconferencing,
with larger and higher resolution images, over primary access ISDN. Thus, one
protocol could support video teleconferencing in a variety of ISDN
configurations.
