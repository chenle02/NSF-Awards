The proposed work involves purchase of ten (10), new model, high-temperature
(high-T), deepsea hydrothermal vent fluid loggers for use in short- and long-
term deployments by scientists in the US oceanographic community involved in
Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI), International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP),
National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) and NSF-EAR research programs. These
vent fluid loggers have been developed and improved upon over the past 25 years
by the PI and WHOI engineers through the WHOI-MISO Facility
(http://www.whoi.edu/miso). These instruments have provided the longest time
series records of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) hydrothermal vent fluid temperatures,
and key information that enhances understanding of hydrothermal fluid flow
processes, linkages to magmatism and tectonism at mid-ocean ridge study sites,
and shallow ocean crustal permeability. The new model MISO high-T loggers are
now manufactured by EP Oceanographic, LLC (EPO), an oceanographic
instrumentation company in Pocasset, MA (USA), as part of a collaborative effort
to develop small-business innovation and transfer new technologies and ideas
needed for oceanographic research to the private sector.
