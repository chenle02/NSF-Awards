Abstract: Professor Canary proposes to study deformation spaces of hyperbolic
3-manifolds. In his first project, he will will study the global topology of the
space AH(M) of hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to a fixed compact
3-manifold M. The components of its interior are enumerated by topological data
and each component is parameterized by analytic data. In the case that M has
incompressible boundary, Anderson, Canary and McCullough have given a complete
characterization of when two components of the interior have intersecting
closures. Canary proposes to further investigate the topology of the
intersection locus and thus develop a better understanding of the space. This
study of AH(M) is analogous, via the Sullivan dictionary, to the study of the
Mandelbrot set in complex dynamics. Canary also proposes to study boundaries of
quasiconformal deformation spaces of geometrically finite hyperbolic
3-manifolds, as well as the structure of arbitrary geometric limits of surface
groups.

Canary studies the relationship between the topology and the geometry of a
3-manifold. A 3-manifold is a mathematical space such that about any point there
is a region which looks like a region in 3-dimensional space. A Riemannian
metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in a 3-manifold. Once one has
a Riemannian metric on a manifold one can talk about its geometry. For example,
the world we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. A hyperbolic
metric is an especially nice type of Riemannian metric, which has been
extensively studied by topologists and geometers since it was first discovered
in the nineteenth century. Recently, physicists have been discussing models for
the geometry of our universe which have hyperbolic metrics. The choice of metric
for one's model of the universe is related to the issue of whether our universe
is expanding or contracting. Much of Canary's research involves the study of
spaces of different hyperbolic metrics on the same topological manifold.
