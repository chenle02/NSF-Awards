Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is implementing
online homework for lower division mathematics courses (Intermediate and College
Algebra, College Mathematics, Finite Mathematics, Precalculus, Business Math I
&amp; II, and Brief Calculus) using WeBWork, a program developed at the
University of Rochester. These courses service on average over 6500 students
each semester. The primary objective of instituting online homework is to
increase student learning in these courses. Additionally, student attitudes
about their introductory mathematics courses are being improved by use of this
system and by giving students an initial exposure to technology in their college
education. To implement WeBWork, the project is developing libraries of problems
for courses and training instructional personnel to use the system and to
produce their own problems. A distinctive feature of the problem libraries is
the inclusion of more extensive feedback for students when compared with most
existing WeBWork problems. Dissemination is taking place through local workshops
held for other educators and conference presentations. Assessment of student
performance and attitudes is integrated into the entire project.
