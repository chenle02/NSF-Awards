This research deals with an investigation of a relatively new method of
polymerization, discovered a few years ago in Japan. The propagating species in
the polymerization is a so-called zwitterion, i.e., a molecule having both an
electrically negative and a positive charge. The polymerization has considerable
potential for the preparation of entirely new types of polymers. A major
limitation has been the low molecular mass that previous workers have obtained.
This research aims to understand better the individual steps in the
polymerization process to control them in such a way as to increase the mass,
and hence utility, of the products. Efforts are underway to increase the size of
the polymers and to study the kinetics and mechanisms of polymerization in some
carefully chosen chemical systems. Attention will also be paid to the possible
influence of the crystal structure and dimensions of zwitterions.
