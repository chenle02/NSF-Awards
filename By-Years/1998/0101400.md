This project provides opportunities for high school and two-year college
students to gain workplace readiness and safety skills in a chemistry context
through integrated learning experiences based on national science standards. The
project aims to: (1) create standards-based college and high school resource
materials that provide contextual integration of chemistry content with
workplace readiness and safety skills and that are aligned with the National
Science Education standards; (2) provide professional development courses for
college and high school educators that enhance their knowledge of industrial
uses of chemistry and standard operating practices used in the chemistry-based
workplace; and (3) create an infrastructure of local and national support for
developing and sustaining new local partnerships among high school chemistry
teachers, two-year college chemistry and chemical technology faculty, and
workplace specialists (technicians, process operators, scientists, and
management). The following outcomes are anticipated: chemical technology courses
and supporting materials; high school lessons which are to be developed,
piloted, field-tested, and disseminated; professional development courses for
high school chemistry and college chemistry and chemical technology educators;
improvements in high school and two-year college student learning as documented
by appropriate assessment protocols; and improvement in students' critical
thinking skills.
