In complex research environments such as networks of research networks,
attention to process can be crucial to ensuring steady progress toward project
objectives. The Toolbox Dialogue Initiative (TDI) will organize and deliver a
meeting in Washington DC for newly funded members of international network-to-
network collaborations, providing an early, focused opportunity to develop key
components of their projects. TDI will stay engaged with awardees after the
meeting to help facilitate the development of ideas generated through team
reflection and social learning. One outcome of the meeting will be the fostering
of a community of practice. The meeting will also expand abilities to enhance
complex research communication and collaboration among broadly distributed
network communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is to provide newly
funded project members the opportunity to engage in activities designed to
increase their collaborative and communicative capacity, learn from one another
and members of the prior cohort, hear from experts, and interact with NSF
officials. Workshop participants will represent the second cohort of funded
projects in the Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network
Collaboration (AccelNet) program. Building on the previous AccelNet project
meeting, the workshop will include structured team reflection and social
learning on planning for network coordination, professional development, and
evaluation. The TDI team will produce reports for the participating teams and
follow-up webinars designed to support the development of the teamsâ€™ plans and a
community of practice involving members of the cohort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
