The Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) at
the Urban Institute (UI) proposes a RAPID proposal to address an urgent
Congressional request for information on successful STEM schools. Specifically,
the Center, through the access it has to longitudinal state databases from a US
Department of Education award, will conduct a preliminary analysis of how to
create a survey using current state data and will query the data for what
constitutes successful STEM schools. Through the use of hierarchical linear
modeling (HLM) methods, the project will identify school-level residual effects
of STEM fields, holding prior student achievement constant. This work should
contribute substantially to an approach for measuring efficacy across diverse
programs.
