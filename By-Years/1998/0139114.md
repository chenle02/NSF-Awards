This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site that will host a total of seven students during eleven weeks of
summer research. The REU program is based on the theory that mentoring and
networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a
profession and for training young researchers. Students will be working with
researchers at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center, located in
Walpole, ME. Students will also participate in a series of seminars and
workshops exploring issues related to hypothesis formation and testing,
statistics, experimental design, scientific writing and data presentation, and
career options. The program recruits juniors and senior undergraduate students
nationwide. These students are able to pursue research in a broad range of
marine science and environmental science. They will also be encouraged to attend
a regional or national meeting to present their results. The program will
advance students' awareness concerning important environmental issues. Students
selected for participation in this program gain a significant appreciation for
the scientific process and often pursue a career in a scientific field.
