Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research
programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is
expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research
capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home
institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The
award to Central State University investigates a cluster of problems in complex
function theory aimed at understanding the structure of spectra for composition
operators. The project is carried out in collaboration with the University of
Toledo and involves undergraduate students in research in a meaningful way.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the spectra and numerical ranges of
composition operators acting on the spaces of holomorphic functions defined on
the complex unit disc. Spectra and numerical ranges of these operators depend on
locations and nature of the fixed points of the underlying symbol and space on
which the operators are defined. Initially, the focus will be on non-automorphic
symbols that fix a point in the complex unit disc. The main goals of the project
are to: characterize the spectra of these operators defined on certain Banach
and Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions; investigate the general structure
of the spectra of classes of composition operators acting on the Hardy space;
and describe the numerical ranges and numerical radius of the composition
operators acting on the Hardy space. The study will employ techniques that use
the tools including essential spectrum, essential angular derivatives, Dejoy-
Wolff points, Navalinna Counting functions, Carleson measure, Harmonic measure,
and complex interpolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
