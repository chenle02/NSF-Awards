This award will enable Dr. Philip D. Laird of the NASA Ames Research Center to
conduct collaborative research for six months with Dr. Taisuke Sato of the
Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) Tsukuba, Japan. They will conduct research in
the area of machine learning. In artificial intelligence applications,
analytical learning algorithms are meant to find ways to avoid unproductive
steps by assessing the performance of a machine program as it runs. This project
will experimentally evaluate problem-specific analytical learning algorithms.
Techniques for implementing the analytical learning component will be explored.
A model for designing the utility component of the learning element, so that the
changes proposed by the analytical learning algorithms can be evaluated and
intergrated into the program, will be developed. Research in the area of
analytical learning remains largely theoretical. Dr. Sato's research group at
ETL, working on logical inference and knowledge representation and acquisition,
will be able to provide effective testbeds for concepts developed by the P.I.
