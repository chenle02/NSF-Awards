This research program has the objective of achieving a deeper understanding of
the magnetic and infrared properties of the technologically important two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in high quality, modulation-doped semiconductor
heterojunctions. Experiments at low temperatures and high magnetic fields will
be employed to probe the physics of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE).
The far infrared (FIR) properties of the inter- subband transitions will be
studied via prism coupling both with and without an external magnetic field. It
is hoped to answer fundamental questions about the coupling between intersubband
and cyclotron resonance transitions due to a parallel magnetic field. A second
thrust involves magneto-transport studies of the many body nature of the unique
FQHE effect and the effect of the parallel magnetic field component on the FQHE
state. These detailed investigations will be compared with sophisticated
theories of the FQHE.
