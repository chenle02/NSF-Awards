GNU Radio is an open source software radio project used extensively in industry,
academia, and government for research, development, rapid prototyping, and
deployment of wireless services. As an open source project, it has a wide-spread
and disparate community of developers and users. Bringing members of this
community together for a yearly conference helps to build a strong cohesion of
ideas and identify and define the goals of the project. This conference also
addresses the issues of increasing the development community of the project by
getting to know potential developers and educating them on structure, style, and
etiquette of a large, world-wide project used by thousands of people.
