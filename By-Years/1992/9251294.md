The Department of Chemistry is designing and implementing of a series of
spectrochemical analysis experiments that uses instrumentation modules including
sources, sampling devices, and detectors that may be incorporated
interchangeably into six different types of spectral arrangements. These modular
experiments offer the advantage of cost effectiveness, low maintenance
requirements and a high degree of flexibility. An example of this approach is
the analysis of the concentration of a metal by flame emission. The student
assembles the instrument from an air/acetylene flame unit, a monochromomter and
a photomultiplier tube detector. The latter two modules are used by students
wishing to assemble a fluoresence spectrometer or a uv/vis spectrometer for
differing analyses.
