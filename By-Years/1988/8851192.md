This project supports the enhancement of an existing Artificial Intelligence
course and the introduction of a new Natural Language Processing course at this
institution. The equipment funded by this award builds on an already existing
lab and includes: Sun 3/60/M-8 workstations and Zenith PCs interconnected (with
existing equipment) via Ethernet. Using this laboratory, undergraduate students
in Computer Science study not only theoretical issues of artificial intelligence
and natural language processing, but also practical issues related to
programming in these areas. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
