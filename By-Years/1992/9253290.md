The Geological Society of America (GSA) will organize a conference in order to
design an innovative teacher enhancement paln that will augment K-12 teachers'
interaction with earth scientists. Specifically, the goal of the project is to
write a proposal that combines a mechanism that creates long-term professional
relationships between K-12 educators and the earth science community, with a
regional center which will provide continuing in-service and support for
teachers. Attendance at the conference is invitational, and will be held
sometime in the fall or winter of 1992-1993. Cost share of the project is 16.4%.
