This project seeks to illuminate the role that implicit speech processes play
in silent reading. Although subvocal activity has long been known to occur
during reading, its significance and the conditions controlling it are not well
understood. There is disagreement about whether this speech activity is
functional or merely a by-product of no significance. The central assumption of
the theory underlying this project, automatic activation theory, is that
identification of printed words routinely causes activation of speech segments
associated with letters and with the words themselves. This contrasts with the
view ("dual route" theory) that printed words are sometimes "recoded" into
speech and at other times identified directly through the "visual route." A
second assumption of automatic activation theory is that the speech code, once
activated, remains part of the mental representation of a sentence until certain
comprehension processes have been completed. The two assumptions of automatic
activation theory will be tested in two types of experiments: One type will use
backward visual masking, an experimental procedure in which a word is flashed on
the screen for a very short period of time, followed by a brief flash of a
"mask", a visual display that may or may not share specific characteristics of
the word it follows. Recent research has found that the degree of disruption
caused by a mask depends both on the degree to which the mask shares speech
segments and also on the degree to which the mask shares letters with the word
it masks. The masking experiments will vary characteristics of the word being
masked that usually affect the speed at which it is identified; this will
provide a situation in which the automatic activation and the dual route
theories make different predictions. The second kind of experiment will focus on
the role of speech in reading by examining the visual tongue-twister effect: The
time for silent reading of sentences that repeat speech segments, e.g., "Peter
Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers..", is longer than for normal sentences.
The experiments will address whether such effects occur in extended text reading
and whether they are diminished when the reader has a goal of gist comprehension
rather than detailed understanding, situations for which the two theories make
different predictions. This research has implications for the nature of reading
disability. According to available evidence, it is quite likely that some kinds
of reading disability are linked to defective use of speech segments in learning
to read and in memory for linguistic input. To the extent that this project
sheds some light on normal reading processes, it may help in understanding the
nature of the speech-related defect in some cases of disability.
