The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will initiate a combined nine- month
(correspondence) and three-week (residential) Young Scholars project in
Mathematics for more than 350 (corresponding) and 30 (residing) students in
grades 10-12. The USA Mathematical Talent Search (USAMTS) will provide a year-
long, nationwide, problem-solving competition among high school students which
encourages scientific endeavor as an on-going activity. The Summer Program will
allow thirty of the strongest performers in the USAMTS opportunities to improve
their problem-solving skills, to explore coherent, axiomatic bodies of
mathematics, and to investigate mathematical, scientific and engineering
disciplines as potential career choices.
