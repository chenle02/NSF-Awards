In this project the principal investigator will pursue two complementary areas
in numerical analysis and approximation theory, namely, multivariate spline
approximation and multivariate polynomial interpolation. With regard to the
first area, the principal investigator will continue his study of multivariate
splines on regular and irregular meshes. He will also look into the connections
between splines and radial basis functions and wavelets. With regard to the
second area, the principal investigator will further expand his recent discovery
of a simple and general method of choosing, for a given finite set of points in
s variables, a "good" polynomial space for interpolation at those points. Many
problems in differential equations and approximation theory require the use of
numerical algorithms to construct accurate representations of functions. Many of
these algorithms have developed out of theoretical work on the kinds of basis
functions that can be used to represent functions at a set of discrete points.
Basis functions are in a very real sense the "building blocks" out of which
continuous functions are created. In this project the principal investigator
will study basis functions called "splines" that are very useful for solving
problems in a number of applied areas.
