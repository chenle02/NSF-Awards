The conference "Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems" will take place at the
Centre de Recerca Matematica , Barcelona,Spain on July 3-7, 2017. The goal of
the conference is to bring together leading experts in the field, along with
researchers in the early stage of career and graduate students, in order to
survey recent progress in the field of finite dimensional integrable systems, to
present open problems, to outline new directions of research, and to foster new
collaborations. The NSF award will defray the travel expenses of attending the
conference for PhD students, young researchers, and participants from the USA
with no current NSF support, including members of under-represented groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The practitioners in the field use so many different
mathematical tools that sometimes they are not aware of what is happening in
other subfields of the theory of completely integrable systems. This conference
will bring together experts in mathematics and in mathematical physics with the
aim of exchanging information, fostering collaboration, and attracting junior
researchers to the area. The talks will focus on topics such as integrability
criteria and obstructions to integrability (topological, dynamical, and
differential Galois obstructions), integrable geodesic flows and natural
Hamiltonian systems, superintegrability, dynamics of rigid body, nonholonomic
mechanics, quantum integrability and quantization procedures, applications of
finite dimensional integrable systems in mathematical physics and celestial
mechanics, discrete differential geometry and integrability, computational and
experimental methods and others. Additional information on this conference can
