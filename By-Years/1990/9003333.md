The principal investigator will study a method for showing that all closed
3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature are obtained from spherical space
forms by performing connected sums. An analogous problem for 4-manifolds with
positive isotropic curvature will be analyzed. Other parts of the project
include investigations into the four-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture, as well
as studies of Kaehler and symplectic structures. A closed curve on a sphere,
which does not have any intermediate intersections, separates the plane into two
disks. Analogously, a properly smooth sphere lying in ordinary 3-space bounds
one ball, and bounds a second ball if infinity is collapsed to a point. The
principal investigator will study a method using heat flow to solve the
analogous problem for three- dimensional smooth spheres lying in four-
dimensional space.
