The proposed research is in the field of membrane-based bionanotechnology with
a focus on prestin, a protein found on outer hair cell membrane and responsible
for hair cell electromobility and non-linear capacitance. The objective of the
proposed project is to characterize the electromechanical characteristics of
membranes containing prestin and to lay the foundation for bionanotechnological
devices based on prestin.
