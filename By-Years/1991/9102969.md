In this project the principal investigators will collect and interpret high-
quality and high-resolution Conductivity/ Temperature/Depth (CTD), oxygen and
nutrient data in the North Central Pacific Ocean, along a line designated as
P-14N by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Specific topics to be
addressed with the data include: 1. Vertical structure of the subpolar and
subtropical gyres and of mid-latitude zonal flow, 2. The role of the Kuroshio
Extension and the Alaska Stream in Central Pacific circulation, and, 3. The
relation of large scale circulation to thermo-haline and nutrient frontal zones,
water mass transformation, and the deep circulation in the equatorial zone.
