This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is for the design and
construction of a sideband-separating Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor
mixer receiver for the 380 to 500 GHz band. The receiver, whose design will
mimic that used for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 210
to 275 GHz receiver developed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, would
be deployed on the Arizona Radio Observatory's Sub-Millimeter Telescope on Mt.
Graham, Arizona. The receiver would be used to study known molecular spectral
lines in this region, as well as likely discover many new ones. The advantage of
this design over the ALMA design is that the balanced system allows the use of
much lower local oscillator power, which can be important in some instances
(such as array feeds, for example) where sufficient local oscillator power is
difficult to achieve.
