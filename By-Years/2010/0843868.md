With National Science Foundation support, Michael Diercks and Paul Portner are
conducting research on the syntax (i.e. sentence structure) of Bukusu, a Bantu
language spoken in western Kenya. This research focuses on the several
interesting properties of subjects in Bukusu (as opposed to non-subjects such as
objects, or indirect objects). In English, for example, a question about an
object uses the word 'do': "Who do you like?" A question about a subject,
however, does not use 'do': "Who likes you?" The job of the linguist is to
identify what causes asymmetries like these, and why they exist in human
language. The Bukusu language is helpful to this end, as it has a number of
prefixes related to subjecthood which are typologically rare, and looking at the
properties of these prefixes helps illuminate the properties of subjecthood. In
addition, a number of sentence types which use these prefixes are problematic
for existing linguistic theory, making them an interesting topic of
investigation. In this way this project has a dual purpose: to discover new
language data from the Bukusu language, and to explore how those data contribute
to the theory of the human faculty of language.
