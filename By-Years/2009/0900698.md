Photoassociation, which occurs in an ultracold gas when one of the atoms in a
colliding pair absorbs a photon of laser light, will be studied, utilizing
methods previously developed when one of the atoms in a colliding pair undergoes
a spin flip in the presence of a background magnetic field chosen to be
resonant. Leftover atoms will be strongly entangled, allowing ultracold quantum
computing. It will be examined whether the associated molecules and leftover
atoms can associate into triatomic molecules. The work will utilize a few-level
framework and the machinery of quantum optics and laser spectroscopy.

This quantum-matter-optics approach is simple and accessible, facilitating the
involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students in advancing discovery
and understanding. In particular, graduate students will mentor the
undergraduates, and mentoring directly impacts retention for both the mentor and
those being mentored.
