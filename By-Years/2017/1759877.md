The 25th International Domain Decomposition Conference (DD25) will be held at
the Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada,
during July 23-27, 2018. The conference website is
http://dd25.math.mun.ca/index.html . The conference will be comprised of mini-
symposia and contributed talks, along with thirteen invited
talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Domain decomposition methods are fundamental to
large scale high performance computing in the sciences and engineering. The
International Domain Decomposition Conference, which has been held approximately
every eighteen months since 1987, is the preeminent conference in domain
decomposition methods that brings together mathematicians, engineers, and
scientists to exchange information and ideas on the latest cutting-edge
developments in the field. This funding will provide travel costs for young US
participants, graduate students, and recent Ph.D. recipients, to learn about
recent developments in domain decomposition and to interact with renowned
international experts in computational engineering and computational sciences.
