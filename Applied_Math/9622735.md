9622735 Renardy The proposer will study a number of issues in fluid dynamics,
which lead to mathematical problems in partial differential equations, dynamical
systems, asymptotic analysis and numerical analysis. Specific topics include the
study of corner singularities and high Weissenberg number asymptotics in
viscoelastic flows, the development of a basic existence theory for degenerate
parabolic-hyperbolic systems arising in surfactant spreading, instabilities in
ocean currents, the numerical treatment of outflow boundaries, and Takens-
Bodganov bifurcations with symmetry which arise in double layer convection. %%%
Part of the work is motivated by problems which are encountered in the numerical
simulation of flows of polymeric fluids. Such simulations are important in
predicting fluid behavior in industrial processes and in evaluating theories of
material behavior. Geometries with corners are frequently encountered, and the
singular behavior arising from such corners has led to considerable difficulties
in numerical simulation, which have not been adequately resolved. Another
numerical difficulty has arisen from the formation of sharp boundary layers in
highly elastic flows. In both cases, progress hinges crucially on clarifying the
analytical nature of the solution, and the proposed research aims at doing that.
Another important topic in numerical simulation of fluid flows is the truncation
of the flow domain for numerical purposes. Here, the proposed research is
concerned with providing the reasons why certain procedures work. Surfactant
spreading on thin films is important in biological and medical problems.
Mathematically, it leads into a new type of partial differential equations,
which does not seem to have analyzed previously. The proposed research aims at
understanding fundamental issues related to these equations. Fluid dynamics is
rife with instabilities and formation of new flow patterns. Flows with a high
degree of symmetry, such as conv ection between parallel plates, are known to
allow a rich variety of patterns. The inclusion of a second fluid layer leads to
additional possibilities, which the proposed research will explore. ***
