Understanding how animals choose mates is both a theoretical and a
methodological challenge. Many studies on diverse organisms have shown that
females choose mates and that this choice is based on variation among males in
physical and behavioral traits. However, little is known about how the choice is
made and how it is affected by genetic and environmental factmrs. Drs. Kodric-
Brown and Nicoletto will develop and apply a video- imaging technique that will
allow assessment of the relative importance of courtship displays and color
patterns of male guppies in attracting females. Advantages of using such an
imaging technique are: (a) precise control of male color patterns and courtship
behavior, (b) high degree of repeatability, because the same male images are
presented to females, (c) ability to manipulate individual behavioral and
morphological components independently of each other and in combination, which
will allow assessment of their relative importance in female choice, and (d)
ability to present exactly the same choices to different females in the
population or to the same female at different stages of her life or experience.
The research should yield answers to such important questions as: (a) How much
variation is there in mate preferences among females within and between
populations? (b) How consistent are the preferences of individuals. and do they
change with age or experience? (c) How do different traits combine to produce
attractive courtship signals? Results of this project will also be relevant to
other areas of behavior, such as the use of signals in communication systems.
