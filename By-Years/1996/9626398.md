The principal investigator and his graduate students study martingales and
related classes of stochastic processes, estimates on the size of stochastic
integrals, the behavior of Fourier series in spaces of high dimension, and the
relation of diffusions and curvature on manifolds. The focus is on concrete
problems whose solutions are applicable in statistical and mathematical analysis
of the kind arising in some parts of economics, the physical and natural
sciences, and in technology. At the same time, the principal investigator is
developing general methods that may help to solve some of the concrete problems
not yet foreseen.
