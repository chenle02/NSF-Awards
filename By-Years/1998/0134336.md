&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a great demand for technologies that enable
neuroscientists and clinicians to observe the simultaneous activity of large
numbers of neurons in the brain. The monitoring of these groups or "neural
ensembles" allows researchers to begin to understand the cooperative mechanisms
used by neurons to encode and process information. Recent advances in MEMS
technology have produced small arrays of microelectrodes containing as many as
100 recording sites. "Next generation" neural recording systems must be capable
of observing 100-1000 neurons simultaneously, in a fully-implanted
unit.&lt;br/&gt;While integrated electronics have been developed for small-scale
amplification of the weak extracellular neural signals (&lt;100 electrodes),
existing circuits have high levels of noise and consume too much power to be
fully implanted in larger quantities. We propose to develop low-power, low-noise
analog and mixed-signal VLSI systems allowing fully implantable recording of
100-1000 neurons.&lt;br/&gt;A fully implanted multichannel neural recording
system must use an RF or inductive-link transmitter for transcutaneous
telemetry. We will investigate techniques for on-chip data reduction (e.g.,
spike thresholding, feature detection) to assist in spike sorting and reduce the
required bandwidth (and hence power) of such a transmitter.&lt;br/&gt;The
educational component of the proposed work involves the improvement of the VLSI
curriculum in the PI's department. This improvement will consist of three main
thrusts: (1) Development of a laboratory component of a course in analog
integrated circuit design taught by the PI. The construction of "class chips"
will allow students to measure VLSI circuits in modern submicron fabrication
technologies. (2) Development of a new advanced analog VLSI course. (3)
Enlisting industrial partners to evaluate our VLSI curriculum. In addition to
this curriculum development, the PI will also mentor a graduate student who will
perform research related to the proposal.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
