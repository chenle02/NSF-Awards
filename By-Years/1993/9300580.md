This project will bring ten undergraduates per summer to the University of
Kansas campus to work with the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering. The projects will be conducted in a ten week period in the summers
of 1993, 1994, 1995. No more than two of the student participants per summer
will be from the University of Kansas. The students will be working on existing
research teams within the program. Special emphasis in the program is in the
areas of microwave remote sensing, computer architecture, digital signal
processing, artificial intelligence, telecommunications and networking, and
very-large-scale- integration circuit design.
