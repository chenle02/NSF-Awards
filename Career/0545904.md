The investigator studies the use of p-adic analytic techniques in several
aspects of arithmetic geometry. One focus is on the p-adic cohomology of
algebraic varieties over finite fields, including theoretical questions like the
stability of coefficient objects under cohomological operations, and
computational problems like the determination of zeta functions of specific
curves and surfaces. Another focus is the classification of Galois
representations over local fields (p-adic Hodge theory); goals of this include
gaining insight into proposed Langlands-style correspondences between Galois
representations and representations of p-adic Lie groups, as well as unifying
the treatment of Hodge theory in the complex and p-adic settings. These foci
share common (and recently developed) technical elements from the theory of
p-adic differential equations, which again have strong complex-analytic
analogues.

The use of p-adic analytic methods in arithmetic geometry, as in the
investigator's work, has great significance within mathematics; for instance, it
is currently being used to pursue generalizations of the techniques underlying
the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But it also has surprising practical
significance due to the appearance of systems of polynomial equations over
finite fields (such as the integers modulo a prime number) in combinatorics and
computer science. For instance, elliptic curve-based cryptography has been
adopted by NIST as a standard for secure communications thanks to its balance of
efficiency versus security; p-adic methods can be used to select curves suitable
for this construction. Geometry over finite fields also appears in the
construction of many error-correcting codes; p-adic methods can be deployed to
search for codes which correct transmission errors without carrying too much
overhead. So far these applications rely on proven statements in the theory of
p-adic cohomology, but the theory is somewhat unfinished and it seems likely
that future applications will rely for their provable correctness on statements
not yet proved. It is thus important to pursue theoretical and practical aspects
in parallel.
