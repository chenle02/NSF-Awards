This project seeks to sponsor electrical engineering students to attend the 25th
Annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS) to be held on October 11-12, l993
at Howard University in Washington, DC. The annual meeting is sponsored by the
IEEE and is hosted by a local university this year, Howard University.
Opportunities for student attendees will be advertized nationwide, and women,
minorities and disabled students will be especially encouraged for sponsorship.
Typically in the past, from 35% to 50% of the attendee supported by such grants
have been women and minorities. Howard University is subsidizing the event as
much as possible but the local costs in Washington are high an additional
support from NSF is essential.
