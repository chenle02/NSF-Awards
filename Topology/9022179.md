This project is concerned with applications of controlled topology to the
theory of manifolds and stratified spaces. Of particular significance is a
program for discovering the geometric structure of stratified spaces. The
problem is to understand the neighborhood of the singular set. It is conjectured
that such a neighborhood has "teardrop structure." A positive solution to this
conjecture would enable one to extend to stratified spaces many fundamental
results previously known only for manifolds or for especially rigid
stratifications. Other applications include generalized Novikov conjectures,
groups acting topologically on manifolds, and the improvement of maps between
manifolds. The central tool to be used in this research is the theory of
manifold approximate fibrations, previously classified by the principal
investigator and his collaborators. One aspect of this project is to extend that
work to the stratified setting. Manifolds are the main object of study in
topology. They are the spaces which are locally euclidean spaces. The ultimate
goal is to classify manifolds and their symmetries. Controlled topology has
become the most powerful new technique in the study of high- dimensional
manifolds since the development of surgery theory. Even more dramatically,
controlled topology is showing its full force in the study of manifolds with
singularities. These stratified spaces include polyhedra, complex algebraic
varieties, orbit spaces of group actions on manifolds, and certain limits of
Riemannian manifolds.
