Tissue culture techniques will be introduced in a new course in Immunology, a
rapidly growing and increasingly important field of biology. To supplement
equipment already at hand, two laminar- flow hoods, a water-jacketed CO2
incubator, a shaker/water bath, three more inverted-stage microscopes, and
flourescence illumination for the hase-contrast compound microscope will be
purchased. These will enable students to perform immunology experiments without
problems of contamination. The tissue culture facilities will also be used in
the Developmental Biology course and in the introductory course in order to
study growth and differentiation of living cells. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
