Engineering-Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project creates a website that provides
writing samples, heuristics, and prompts to teach writing to engineering
students. The web-based tool introduces engineering students to the process of
writing widely-used classroom and work-place documents such as lab reports,
project reports and memos. The tool, called "The Coach," guides students through
basic writing activities such as prewriting, drafting, revising, and editing and
prompts students to consider genre-specific details of audience, purpose, and
message. The plan is to include The Coach within some of the writing requirement
courses for engineering students at the partner institutions of the University
of Alabama, the University of Texas at Tyler, and Bevill State Community
College.
