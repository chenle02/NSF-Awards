Conduction in multilayer materials is currently of great interest, but is
neither well understood nor has it been exhaustively investigated. Measurement
of conduction processes is fundamental in material science, and because it is
relatively straightforward it is ideal for upper-level students at undergraduate
institutions. In this project, a low-temperature cryostat is integrated into an
existing resistivity and Hall effect apparatus and used to study the temperature
dependence of the electronic transport properties of multilayer materials. The
apparatus has been under development and is now used in a junior- level advanced
laboratory course to study metal and semiconductor systems. The cryostat greatly
increases the experimental capabilities in the junior-level laboratory course
and in independent study and senior-level thesis projects. New projects focus on
the temperature, magnetic field, current direction, and layer spacing
dependencies of the magnetoresistance and Hall voltage in multilayer systems.
Low- temperature capabilities allow the transport properties to be characterized
over a temperature range broad enough to study the nature of the electronic
scattering mechanisms. Initial systems of study are C/Ge and W/Si multilayers,
with layer thicknesses ranging from 5 to 50 Angstroms. Fabrication and
structural studies of these multilayers are performed in collaboration with
another research group. This project should increase the presence of material
science education and research at undergraduate institutions.
