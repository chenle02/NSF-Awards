This research addresses automated tools for design and verification of finite-
state concurrent systems and the theoretical underpinnings of formal analysis of
concurrent systems. Application of the tool to verification of communications
protocols and to other real-world concurrent systems are examined. The
theoretical investigations provide insight into reasoning about real-time and
probabilistic behavior of systems.
