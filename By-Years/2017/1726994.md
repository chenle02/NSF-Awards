This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Jacob Ciszek from
Loyola University of Chicago and colleagues have acquired a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. A
SEM/EDS focuses a beam of electrons at a sample. The electrons interact with
sample surfaces to produce a visual image of the material and analyze its
chemical elements. These images reveal details of a material's structure such as
the size and shape of nanoparticles, proteins or organisms. Such images can help
understand the material's properties. This acquisition enhances the training of
graduate and undergraduate students in research at three North Chicago
institutions: Loyola University, DePaul University and Columbia College.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This electron microscope enhances research and education
at all levels. It impacts research areas which are as diverse as the
determination of the spacial location of reaction loci on organic semiconductor
surfaces and the analysis of the microarchitecture of lizard toe pads. The
instrument is also used in characterizing the diversity of phages, analyzing
spatial location of heavy metal environmental bioaccumulation in the retina, and
characterizing the small features associated with pharyngeal jaw evolution of
goby fish in the Great Lakes. The SEM/EDS capabilities benefits the analysis of
self-assembled supramolecular polymers and identification and quantification of
carbon fractions from meteorites. The microscope is used in analyzing the
morphology of changes associated with thin-films spin coated from electrodes,
imaging the mesoscale morphological features of photovoltaic devices, and
measuring taxonomic characters used to identify small snails.
