The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important tool available to
organic and inorganic chemists for structure determination and it is becoming a
significantly useful technique for analytical chemists and biochemists. This
award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at Miami University acquire a high field NMR. The NMR will be used
in the following research topics: l. NMR Detection and Characterization of
Labile Hydrolysis Reaction Products 2. Acyclic Stereocontrol by Double
Asymmetric Synthesis 3. Development and Utilization of Chromogenic and
Fluorogenic Crown Ethers 4. New Organogermanium, Organotin, and Organolead
Hydride Reagents 5. Characterization of Heparin "Esters"
