The goal of this research project is to develop a miniature source of energetic
electrons, an electron gun, for producing high quality, high energy electron
beams. High energy electron beams have found widespread use by biologists,
chemists and physicists investigating ultra-fast science through x-ray and
electron diffraction; physicians performing medical imaging and radiation
therapy; scientists exploring high energy physics; and for cargo screening at
ports of entry across the country. These electron beams are generated in
particle accelerators which manipulate the energy, density and timing of charged
particles. The first building block of a particle accelerator is the electron
gun, where electrons are emitted into a vacuum and interact with intense
electric fields to be accelerated. The performance of the electron gun is
critical because it sets the fundamental limits on the ability to control
electron beams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop an ultra-
compact, high-gradient electron gun operating in the Terahertz (THz) frequency
range which demonstrates GeV/m accelerating gradients with unprecedented
brightness and temporal control of the electron beam. An electron gun only a few
millimeters in size but capable of producing MeV electrons will be designed,
built and tested at high power. The group will explore the physics of electron
field-emission and photo-emission in GV/m THz fields, THz gun electron beam
dynamics, non-relativistic accelerating structures and electron beam generation
on femtosecond timescales. This resulting increase in performance, compactness
and efficiency will open new frontiers in accelerator science and its many
applications.
