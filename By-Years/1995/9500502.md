9500502 Gimbel This seminar is organized by the Sub-Saharan Africa Program of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in cooperation with the
Consortium of Affiliates for International programs. It brings five
knowledgeable South African scientists/ policy makers to brief interested
members of the USG, academic, technical and NGO communities, and representatives
of bilateral and multilateral and private donor agencies on the changing
environment for research and development in South Africa and to explore issues
and opportunities for fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation. In addition to
their presentations, the South African visitors will also meet with
representatives of key organizations in the Washington area to explore specific
possibilities of cooperation in more detail. The demise of apartheid has
presented South Africa with enormous challenges of national reconstruction and
development. Science and engineering capacity is one of South Africa's
strengths. The establishment of links between the governments of South Africa
and United States, and between their respective scientific and academic
institutions, will help to end the isolation of South Africa and permit it to
begin to develop its human resource base and utilize its scientific capabilities
for the benefit of the entire population of the country as well as for the rest
of southern Africa. Any such scientific and technological cooperation will have
a prominent role in the new relationship between the governments of South Africa
and the United States. ***
