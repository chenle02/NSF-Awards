It is hypothesized that a significant inverse relationship exists between the
13C/12C of particulate organic matter (POM) and the ambient concentration of
molecular CO2 in surface seawater. This hypothesis will be tested by sampling
and isotopically analyzing suspended POM in concert with NOAA- sponsored
measurements of pCO2 and TCO2 i) at seasonally sampled stations near Hawaii and
Bermuda, and ii) during cruise transects in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The
results of this research will have significant implications for the use of such
isotopic measurements as a proxy for time-integrated ocean/atmospheric CO2
concentrations in the present ocean. This research will also aid in the
reconstruction of past changes in global CO2 concentrations via isotopic
variations in the marine sedimentary record. In addition, the concentrations of
surface water particulate organic carbon and nitrogen will be determined, and
together with the isotopic determinations will complement NOAA- supported
investigations of marine carbon biogeochemistry.
