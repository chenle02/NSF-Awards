This applicant will study the development of transplanted immature neurons
(nerve cells) in rodents. During development of the central nervous system,
neurons must migrate from the site where they are formed to the appropriate
place in the brain, and establish very precise connections to other neurons both
within and outside the immediate vicinity. Specifically, she plans to study the
integration of donor neurons into host brains that have been made neuron-
deficient. This work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey
Macklis at Harvard University.
