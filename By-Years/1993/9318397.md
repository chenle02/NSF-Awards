9318397 Hardee This project will involve investigation of magnetohydrodynamic
flows that are of interest in astrophysical systems. This project will continue
the present study of the dynamics of collimated outflows such as those observed
in many extragalactic radio sources, and will extend the study to the dynamics
of collimated outflows such as those observed in many extragalactic radio
sources, and will extend the study to the dynamics of collimated outflows in
Seyfert Galaxies, and protostellar systems. The investigation involves
comparison between analytical analysis of the time dependent magnetohydrodynamic
fluid equations and linearized time dependent magnetohydrodynamic fluid
equations, and numerical simulations and numerical modeling of collimated
outflows. A major objective of this project is to perform fully three
dimensional numerical simulations and compare results with analytically
developed theory. A second objective is to use the results to learn how outflow
morphology is influenced by the external environment, by the presence of
dynamically significant magnetic fields, and by radiative cooling. A third
objective is to model the emission from collimated outflows and model selected
objects. The objectives can be achieved by performing a combination of two
dimensional and fully three dimensional fluid and MHD simulations of
extragalactic light continuum jets, and protostellar and other radiatively
cooled heavy jets. The analytical theory is used to establish model dependence
on parameters and for its predictive abilities. ***
