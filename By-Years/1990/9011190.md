ABSTRACT The research is part of an ongoing project investigating word order
among the languages of the world. The goals of the project are: (1) to establish
a large cross-linguistic data base on word order that will be made available to
other linguists; (2) to investigate the ways in which word order characteristics
correlate with each other; (3) to test universal hypotheses about word order;
(4) to examine possible explanations for word order correlations and universals;
and (5) to investigate the geographical and genetic distribution of word order
characteristics. In the earlier phases of the project, data has been collected
for a variety of word order parameters, morpheme position parameters, and a few
other typological parameters from a total of 603 languages. The primary goal of
this phase is to attempt to fill in a variety of different gaps in the data
base, to collect data on a number of additional parameters, and to produce a
book that describes the basic results of the project and makes the data base
available for the use of other linguists.
