Ads/CFT, D-branes and Cosmology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most promising theories
of quantum gravity are string theory and M-theory. These fascinating theories
are still not well understood. This research program is aimed at understanding
M-theory and string theory by analyzing the physics of D-branes, which are
solitonic objects in string theory. The research is concerned with constructing
and understanding D-branes in novel string backgrounds that do not have a
geometrical description (e.g. group manifolds, orientifolds). These branes can
be used as probes of these backgrounds, and this opens up the possibility of
constructing the geometry of non-geometrical spaces! The second aspect of this
proposal focuses on the overlap of cosmology and particle physics. The PI and
his collaborators have come up with a new candidate for dark matter, which has
radically different implications from earlier proposals. He is currently
exploring the implications of this new dark matter model for supersymmetric
theories.
