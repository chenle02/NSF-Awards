Detailed field and lab studies of processes of chemical weathering will be
carried out to evaluate formation of laterites and bauxites in sub-tropical
regions. The current science plan will focus only on field studies in W. Africa
to characterize the role of dust in metal enrichment and chemical dispersal.
This work will be augmented by similar studies of W. Australia samples. Trace
metal mass balance studies will also be used to quantify hydrothermal vs.
mechanical transport mechanisms, and theoretical modelling will be used to
simulate weathering processes.
