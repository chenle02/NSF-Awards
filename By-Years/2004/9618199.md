Green 96-18199 The PI requests supplemental NSF funding for a Gordon Research
Conference on Rock Deformation at Colby-Sawyer College, New Hampshire on August
10-15, 1997. Dr. Harry Green is chair and Dr. Brian Evans co-chair of the
conference. The conference is being held to bring together an interdisciplinary
group of experts to discuss the interaction between deformation and mineral
reactions, a crucial aspect in research into metamorphic and partially melted
rocks that is often ignored because the work crosses strongly developed
disciplinary boundaries. Funds will be used to cover travel and accommodation
for students, post docs, and speakers. It is expected that a broad and
interdisciplinary cross-section of researchers from academia, government labs,
and the industrial sector will participate in the conference. ***
