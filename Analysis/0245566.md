This award is for partial support for two graduate students doing thesis
research under the PIs supervision. There are two topics under consideration.
One centers on the development of new and efficient separation algorithms to
identify components in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain data. The
second concerns a new algorithm for inverse problems with a sparcity constraint.
