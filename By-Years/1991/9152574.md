The goal of this project is to enhance the laboratory experiences of advanced
undergraduate majors in the Biology and Biochemistry programs by supporting the
development of an undergraduate laboratory with two bioreactor workstations, and
IBM- compatible computers and data translation boards to support them. The
purchase of generic A/D acquisition boards and software allow the computers to
be interfaced with other laboratory instruments such as chromatographs and
spectrophotometers. The equipment is also used in independent undergraduate
research projects.
