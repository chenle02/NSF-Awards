0912420&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will investigate the feasibility of achieving, by means of precision
measurement and software corrections, sub-1nm feature-size control and 1nm
feature-placement precision using its maskless-lithography tool based on zone-
plate-array lithography&lt;br/&gt;(ZPAL). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several
components of the semiconductor industry currently require nanometer-level
patterning fidelity, in particular imprint templates, photonic devices and
photonic intrachip communication. Future nanotechnology applications will also
require such fidelity. By incorporating absorbance-modulation optical
lithography into ZPAL, lithographic resolution below 20 nm should be achieved,
enabling ZPAL to outperform electron-beam lithography in the important metrics
of: throughput, resolution, overlay, feature-size control, feature-placement
accuracy and size of field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
