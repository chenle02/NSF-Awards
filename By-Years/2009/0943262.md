Trust plays a key role in innovation, efficiency and thus effectiveness during
collaborations, more so in virtual teams (VT) when members are unlikely to meet
face-to-face. Establishing trust in virtual teams can increase effectiveness as
team members will be less likely to spend time cross-checking others work. This
research has three principle objectives: 1) develop a deeper understanding of
trust in VT, 2) establish design rationale for automated monitoring and
management of trust in VT, and 3) develop prototypes to monitor and manage trust
in VT. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will fill a gap in the
literature by conducting a field study of trust in distributed software
engineering teams. The prototype tool will provide insights into software
support for trust in VT. Further, this study fits into a long-term successful
program of research in analyzing and developing software support for
collaborative software engineering in virtual organizations, giving a unique
perspective and the opportunity to integrate findings with larger cross-cutting
themes. The broader impacts include increasing the effectiveness of
collaborations in teams, both for students enrolled in software engineering
courses and ultimately practitioners working distributed software engineering.
Moreover, enabling trust can encourage innovation, thus increasing the
advantages of diverse teams by increasing confidence in collaboration while
reducing transaction costs.&lt;br/&gt;
