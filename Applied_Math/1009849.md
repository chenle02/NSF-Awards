Possible applications of graphene -- a sheet of bonded carbon atoms -- entail
understanding and controlling the coupling between the mechanical deformation
and electronic structure and transport properties. This coupling is not fully
understood, in part because the basic mechanical response of interacting
graphene sheets is not yet adequately described. Important for predicting this
response are the nonlocal van der Waals forces between layers of graphene and
between graphene and a supporting substrate. The aim of the project is to
develop and investigate continuum models of graphene structures that incorporate
van der Waals forces in a rigorous way, accounting for long-range ordering of
atoms. Derived via a multiscale analysis, the continuum models are formulated
within nonlinear rod and shell theories. Equilibrium configurations of various
graphene structures -- involving multiple layers and different substrates --
under external loads are analyzed using the tools of bifurcation theory. Also,
the thermal properties of nanotube composites are investigated within the
framework of a network model taking into account the influence of van der Waals
forces.

Interest in macromolecules composed of carbon atoms has stimulated a great deal
of recent research in materials science and physics. Much of this work has
focused on carbon nanotubes and, more recently, on the basic structural element
of a nanotube -- graphene. Graphene is a single-atom-thick sheet of bonded
carbon atoms. Despite many decades of effort, only within the last six years
have scientists discovered methods for producing isolated individual graphene
sheets. This discovery has stimulated a flurry of experimental and theoretical
work on the exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties of
graphene. Exploiting these properties could lead to significant advances in many
technologies and yield, for example, more efficient solar cells, faster
microprocessors, or lighter, stronger composite materials. The principal goal of
this project is to employ mathematical modeling to gain a better fundamental
understanding of how atomic-scale forces between layers of a carbon
nanostructure influence its mechanical and thermal characteristics. The project
investigators are developing and analyzing comprehensive multiscale models of
interacting graphene layers by utilizing ideas at the forefront of existing
theories as well as by introducing new mathematical tools.
