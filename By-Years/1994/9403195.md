9403195 Bernstein A workshop on "Chiral Dynamics: Theory and Experiment" has
been organized for the week of July 25-29, 1994, at MIT. The main objectives
are: 1) to critically review the present status of approximation techniques to
QCD at low energies; 2) to review the experimental tests of these predictions;
and 3) to discuss further experimental and theoretical opportunities. The
emphasis will be on the properties of the pion (the almost Goldstone boson of
QCD) and its interactions. ***
