This investigation will contribute to better understanding of the metamorphic
and geologic history of a portion of the Appalachian Piedmont region in the
Baltimore area. Pressures and temperatures will be estimated for metamorphosed
sedimentary rocks using well-calibrated mineral equilibria reactions and these
results applied to determine the burial and subsequent uplift history of these
rocks. The results will elucidate the tectonic history of the area. In addition
varied mineral assemblages in rocks having the same metamorphic history attest
to the operation of other factors, namely differential compositions of fluids
percolating through these rocks. The role of fluid and bulk rock compositions
controlling the observed mineral assemblages will be determined, again using
appropriate thermochemical computations.
