9706393 Comfort This award is for a research symposium on the impact of
information technology on disaster mitigation and management. The symposium will
examine the current state of information technology in disaster management
practice and identify possible ways to improve or increase interorganizational
and interjurisdictional performance through appropriate uses an new applications
of such technology. Specific objectives of the symposium include a demonstration
of the application of a prototype distributed, intelligent, spatial information
system to a set of simulated problems in disaster mitigation and response, and
the development of a set of recommendations for action regarding the integration
of information technology into disaster mitigation and management practice.
Symposium participants will include both researchers and practitioners. ***
