This award provides funds to the department of Biochemistry at the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville to give undergraduate majors in Biochemistry, Chemistry
and Biology hands-on experience in state-of-the-art biochemical techniques.
Emphasis will be placed on methods used in the analysis of the structure and
function of proteins in experiments that also illustrate some current principles
in regulatory biology. Specific methods will deal with protein and peptide
purification; physical, chemical and immunochemical analyses of proteins; and
molecular cloning and recombinant DNA techniques. Major instruments to be
purchased in support of the project will include: 1. A high performance liquid
chromatography and data analysis system for protein chemistry experiments; 2.
Recording spectrophotometers for protein spectral and enzyme kinetics
experiments; 3. A plate reader for enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays; 4.
Electrophoresis equipment for structural land immunochemical analyses of
purified proteins and for recombinant DNA experiments; 5. Preparative centrifuge
rotors for DNA and protein experiments; 6. Additional general equipment for the
analyses described above. The acquisition of the instruments will allow the
students to participate in experiments that are not commonly done in
undergraduate biochemistry laboratories, and will provide a sound foundation for
future work in research and education. The grantee is matching the award from
non-Federal sources.
