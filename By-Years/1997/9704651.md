9704651 Mojzsis2 The P.I. will examine a sample of the aqueous alteration
lithologies of the ALH 84001 meteorite (McKay et al., 1996) and determine the
phosphate mineralogy and inclusion compositions contained within it. The other
martian meteorite containing obvious aqueous mineral assemblages, the EET79001
meteorite (Gooding et al., 1988), was affected by chemically active aqueous
solutions. Geological evidence derived from remotely sensed data pointing to
abundant liquid water in the past on Mars include large-scale remnant hydrologic
features such as outflow channels, valley networks, drainage systems, lake
deposits, possible ancient seas, and even glaciated terrain. Carbonates and
other salts could have precipitated out of water at the surface in equilibrium
with an ancient atmosphere on Mars before climatic conditions fell below the
stability field of liquid water. Low temperature mineral assemblages contain
direct information about their medium of precipitation, and aqueous mineral
formation may have contained at depth or in a hydrothermal regime on Mars until
heat from volcanism ceased; the pressure and temperature conditions would tend
in these cases to satisfy the stability of liquid water.
