0349759&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research project
will develop an integrated fire modeling software package for use in building
design and accident analysis. This will increase public safety by providing
widespread access to state-of-the-art fire simulation. Modeling fires using a
rigorous scientific approach makes it possible to predict the course of an
evolving fire and its impact on the building occupants, contents, and structure.
The software will help designers implement new fire safety codes and standards
that allow the use of Performance-Based design as an alternative to Rule-Based
design. &lt;br/&gt;Performance-based design and post-accident analysis offer the
potential to reduce injury, loss of life, property damage, and the overall cost
of constructing and maintaining buildings through advanced technology.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will accelerate the introduction of new fire
simulation technology into the fire safety industry. In the United States, the
total cost of fires is over $100 billion annually, with a loss of more than
4,000 lives. Driven by the availability of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)
from NIST and new performance-based fire safety standards, the fire safety
industry is responding to these costs by adopting greater use of fire
simulation. As a result, there is an emerging market for fire simulation
software that is powerful, yet easy to use. The potential market includes fire
safety engineers (design), companies involved in accident review and litigation,
Authorities Having Jurisdiction (regulation), and fire service personnel
(suppression and investigation). &lt;br/&gt;
