9526803 Glazner The Independence Dike Swarm is an important marker feature in
California that crosses several important lithospheric and structural
boundaries. Until recently its age was accepted as latest Jurassic, however many
of the dikes have been shown to be cretaceous, and thus were emplaced during
sinistral shear deformation in the Sierra Nevada rather than prior to that
deformation. This project will address the ages of the dikes in the swarm and
attempt to understand the kinematic role they played in the synchronous
deformation event. Results should help clarify the age and tectonic conditions
of their origins, thus improving their utility as regional markers.
