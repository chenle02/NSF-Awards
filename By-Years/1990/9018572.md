The main objective of this proposed research is to develop and test optical
fiber strain and stress sensor systems for on-line, accurate, and real-time
monitoring of critical components of structural systems under service load
conditions. In this proposed research the combined resources of Rutgers' Civil
Engineering Department and those of its center for Fiber Optic Material Research
Program (FOMRP) will be devoted for development and implementation of both
discrete and continuous optical fiber strain / stress sensors for detection and
warning of imminent structural failures for both concrete, and steel structures.
In the case of concrete structural components, the sensor system will be
evaluated under both embedded (internal) and exposed (external) condition; where
the latter is attached to existing structures and the former is embedded in the
structure during its construction.
