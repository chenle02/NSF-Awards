It is the premise of this project that students become more interested in
learning, and retain more, in courses that rely on active rather than passive
teaching methods. If active learning techniques are to be incorporated into
science curricula efficiently, they need to be developed and made available
nationally to undergraduate institutions. The goal of required undergraduate
science courses is to produce scientifically literate individuals. Cooperative
learning activities can be used to strengthen the skills associated with a
scientifically literate citizen. Cooperative learning within a small peer group
necessitates an active effort on the part of each group member. Astronomy is
often the choice of undergraduate non-science majors to satisfy a science
requirement. This project is developing a variety of cooperative learning
activities which can be easily incorporated into introductory astronomy courses
nationally. An activities sourcebook offered nationally has the potential to
impact a large number of undergraduates and to provide faculty with teaching
materials.
