This project will measure the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMBR) at several wavelengths and angular scales using radio
telescopes placed at South Pole Station, Antarctica. The wavelengths measured
will be 3 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm, wavelengths that are absorbed by water vapor in
the atmosphere, and because South Pole is one of the driest inhabited places on
Earth, it is an excellent observing site. The CMBR is radiation that was
produced very early in the formation of the universe, and its distribution
provides the best information that can be obtained at the present time about how
the universe was created. To date, all CMBR observations have shown the
radiation to be isotropic, that is, the waves arrive at Earth with equal
intensity from all directions. It is certain that at some level the radiation is
anisotropic, and the level and angular scale at which the radiation loses its
isotropy is very important for differentiating between various cosmological
theories. This investigator has already made measurements from South Pole that
are the most sensitive ever made anywhere, and the results are very close to
ruling out one of the standard cosmologies, the so-called "cold dark matter"
model.
