9317881 Wiley The acanthomorph fishes are the largest group of vertebrate
animals (13,290) species). This group includes some of the most important
commercial and sports fishes such as tunas, basses, founders, cods, and
billfishes. Unfortunately, little is known, or agreed upon, concerning the
relationships among the more than 13 orders and numerous suborders of
acanthomorphs. This hampers our ability to understand many aspects of the
biology of these fishes. Some of these aspects will undoubtedly have commercial
as well as purely scientific consequences. We propose to use morphological data
and molecular data derived from DNA sequencing to study the relationships among
acantrhomorph fishes. Morphological data used by previous investigators to
arrive at conflicting hypotheses of relationships will be re-evaluated and new
data will be collected. A pilot study is presented that demonstrates the
feasibility for using DNA sequence data to further resolve these relationships
