AST-0302055 Sokoloski, Jennifer

Dr. Sokoloski is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. She will address the creation of
astrophysical jets, which are found on many different size scales in the
universe. The cause of these highly focused outflows are thought to be accretion
disks around central objects, but are not well understood. Dr. Sokoloski will
conduct a detailed study of accretion disks around symbiotic stars, in which a
white dwarf star accretes gas from the stellar wind of a red giant. The three
facets of the research project will be (1) an archival spectroscopic survey for
jets in symbiotic stars, plus complementary radio, optical, and X-ray imaging
observations; (2) an exploration of the disk-jet connection in symbiotic stars,
including interferometric observations that could possibly produce the first
image of a tidally distorted star; and (3) a detailed examination of the jet-
producing inner-disk region in selected white-dwarf accretors. The goal is to
use the symbiotic stars to distinguish between competing jet models, both for
these systems and for astrophysical jets generally.

Dr. Sokoloski will also work towards increasing the participation of women and
girls in science. She will continue to participate in the "Eyes to the Future"
science mentorship program for middle-school girls, and focus on recruiting
colleagues to participate as well. In addition, she will work on disseminating
the results of the International Conference on Women in Physics to different
groups in the Boston area, both giving talks and collecting feedback. She will
also lead discussions in preparation for a follow-up meeting, tentatively
scheduled for 2006. ***
