A team led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh is reviewing and
analyzing policy documents and studies related to Algebra I learning and
teaching, in order to (1) gain a better understanding of algebra education in
the United States; and (2) conduct an accounting of research questions that have
and have not been taken up by policy documents to date (i.e., what we know and
what we need to know). The results are to be disseminated to both the
mathematics education research community and to the education policy community.
Further discussion and dissemination is planned through an invitational
conference in Washington, DC. The findings will also be used to set a research
agenda for algebra learning and teaching.
