9308527 Hu This project is to develop a method of creating a defined path for
cell migration and tissue development in three dimensional structures such as
gels. The results of this research would be very important to tissue engineering
and developmental biology. One application of tissue engineering would be the
production of artificial tissue, eg. artificial liver or pancreas tissue.
Photoactivated reactions are to be used to covalently couple extracellular
matrix or other cell adhesion molecules to a three dimensional substratum to
define the path for cell migration or development. The position of the covalent
coupling is defined by the cross point of two laser beams. The size, geometry,
and trajectory of molecular deposition can be generated by controlling the
scanning path of each laser beam. ***
