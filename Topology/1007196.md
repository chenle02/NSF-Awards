Knots in 3-space are called concordant if they cobound an embedded annulus in
the product of 3-space with a closed interval. The set of concordance classes
forms an abelian group; this project investigates the structure of this
concordance group. There are three major facets to the project: (1) Developing a
better understanding of known concordance invariants and discovering new
invariants, (2) Applying these invariants to classify important families of
knots, and (3) Using these results to unravel the underlying structure of the
concordance group.

The perspective of classical physics is three-dimensional, focusing on the three
spatial dimensions in which we live. Modern physics has a higher-dimensional
perspective, for instance including time to create a four-dimensional model of
the universe. In the 1960s it was recognized that four-dimensional spaces can be
built by gluing together simpler pieces; the way these pieces are glued together
can be represented by knots, with the complexity of the resulting space
reflected in the complexity of the knots that occur. This proposal is focused on
understanding knotting from a four-dimensional perspective. In particular, new
tools will be developed, and these will be applied to complete our four-
dimensional analysis of low- crossing number knots.
