A long debated scientific problem in the area of climate dynamics is the
instability of polar ice caps. This work focuses on investigating the stability
of seasonal snow lines using an energy balance model (EBM) and a dynamic ice
sheet model. The EBM would be used to study the interaction of geography
variations and a seasonally varying snow line. This problem is important because
of its possible relevance to the initiation of ice sheets during the onset of an
ice age. In addition, the EBM would be compared to a dynamic ice sheet to
simulate conditions leading to sudden growth decay of the ice sheet, thereby
reproducing a long term model climate behavior that can be compared to the
observed climate over the geologic time scale.
