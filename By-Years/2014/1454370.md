Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael Neidig of the University of
Rochester is developing detailed molecular level insight into the active species
and mechanisms of catalysis in iron- and cobalt-catalyzed direct C-H
functionalizations. While catalysts based on inexpensive, earth abundant metals
offer tremendous potential for these transformations, the development of
fundamental insight into structure, bonding and mechanism in iron- and cobalt-
catalyzed direct C-H functionalization is critical to inspire and facilitate the
rational design and development of systems with improved catalytic performance.
The project combines multiple inorganic spectroscopies (magnetic circular
dichroism, Mossbauer, electron paramagnetic resonance, resonance Raman), density
functional theory, synthesis and kinetic and reaction studies to elucidate
detailed insight into the active catalyst species and the mechanisms involved in
direct C-H functionalization by iron and cobalt catalysts. Reactions being
investigated include C(sp2)-H and C(sp3)-H alkylations and arylations as well as
C(sp2)-H aminations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work
include the potential for fundamental insight into active catalyst speciation
and mechanism to inspire and facilitate the development of improved catalyst
systems based on less toxic, earth abundant metals for applications in
alternative energy, pharmaceuticals and materials science. The research provides
a training ground for students in physical-inorganic chemistry and catalysis. In
addition, an outreach program developed by Professor Neidig provides research
opportunities for underrepresented high school students from the Rochester City
School District as well as Monroe Community College undergraduates and faculty.
