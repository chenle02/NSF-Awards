9404872 Means A common problem in tectonic fabric analysis is to relate with
confidence observable fabric features to particular tectonic processes. This
problem is made more difficult by the high temperatures and sluggish kinematics
that are typical for silicate minerals. This work follows considerable prior
research using analog materials that are near the melting point at room
temperature. The deformational behavior of solid frameworks of crystalline
grains with intercrystalline melt present will be modeled by a mixture of three
crystalline ammonium compounds. Similarly, the growth of prophyroblasts over
existing fabrics will be investigated. Results will provide unique insights into
the formation of deformation fabrics.
