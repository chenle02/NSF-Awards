9529564 Petraitis The goal of this proposal is to determine the ecological
mechanisms that maintain stands of algae and beds of mussels and barnacles in
the Gulf of Maine as distinct, self-sustaining communities. Mussels, barnacles,
and macroalgae are the most common species on the rocky intertidal shores of
sheltered bays. As the major structural components of the natural communities
that line the shore, these species are the home for many species of fish and
invertebrates. Stands of rockweed and beds of mussels and barnacles are distinct
and rarely overlap even though they occupy very similar places on the shore.
Currently, it is thought that local site-specific differences in ecological
processes such as predation, competition, and recruitment, control the species
composition of these two communities. This research project will test the idea
that the origins of algal stands and mussel-barnacle beds are historical events
and that once established, the two distinctive communities are maintained by
positive-feedback mechanisms within each. Thus local site- specific differences
are the result of positive-feedbacks and not the cause of community differences.
In ecology, this idea is generally known as "alternative stable states." This
project will be the first large-scale test of this idea in a coastal marine
ecosystem.
