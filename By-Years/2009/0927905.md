ABSTRACT HRD 0927905

Winston Salem State University is implementing, Raising Achievement in
Mathematics and Science (RAMS) Program, to engage students in research on and
off campus throughout their undergraduate career at the university, and to
increase the number of STEM majors graduating from WSSU, strengthen
undergraduate research education and capacity at WSSU, and increase the number
of STEM graduates who matriculate into graduate programs. This effort builds on
the successes achieved under previous HBCU-UP funding.

The activities are based on a strong needs assessment by the HBCU-UP advisory
committee with input from all stakeholders on campus, institutional data, and
the university community involved in supporting students at WSSU. The goals and
objectives of the project are based on clear and specific interventions, and the
strategies are adapted from best practices described in the literature and
previous institutional experiences. The strategies involve engaging STEM UG
students early through ?active learning pedagogy? and ?learning through
conducting research? in order to increase retention and graduation rates.
Student engagement in research on and off campus is a cornerstone of this
project. With the availability of financial support and through extensive
collaboration, the project will impact high school students, community college
students, and students on the WSSU campus. Program activities such as university
research day, curricula changes and GRE preparation workshops have a large
impact campus wide. Improved graduation and retention rates serve as a marketing
tool for recruiting well-prepared high school students into STEM programs at
WSSU. Collectively, this leads to a larger pool of STEM students graduating from
WSSU and matriculating into graduate programs at research intensive
universities.
