This grant provides support for a research program by a faculty member of Ball
State University to examine the effects of superdeformation on neutron
multiplicity in heavy ion nuclear reactions. The research will involve the
participation of undergraduates (RUI) and will use facilities at Rochester
University and other accelerator laboratories.
