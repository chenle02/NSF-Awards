An instrument is being assembled that consists of a custom-made calorimeter with
a response time of less than thirty seconds (compared with five minutes or so
for commercial microcalorimeters) and capability for simultaneous investigation
of the sample withattenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. The
rapidresponse time will permit determination of the heat of a process such as
adsorption before subsequent slower processes obscure the measurement, while
simultaneous infrared spectroscopy allows identification of the site of the
process in cases where more than one possibility exists. Among systems to be
studied with this new technique are nitric oxide on metal oxides or on metal
zeolites and pyridine or ammonia on zeolites.
