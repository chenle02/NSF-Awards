ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Smith, Karen
E.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0810844 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University
of Michigan Ann Arbor &lt;br/&gt;Title: Commutative Algebra and its
Interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for a conference
that will take place at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, July 31--August
5, 2008. The conference will focus on recent advances in commutative algebra,
centered around areas which have been greatly influenced by the contributions of
Mel Hochster. These include tight closure, singularities and multiplier ideals,
the homological conjectures, invariant theory, local cohomology, the structure
of free resolutions, and combinatorial commutative algebra. Hochster's research
has had a transforming impact on the field, and there are several highly active
areas which rely on his past and present work. We hope to bring together these
areas for fruitful interaction. Commutative algebra is the study of equations:
to paraphrase Hochster, "...algebra, after all, has to do with solving
equations. Abstract algebra is the daughter of the theory of equations (in the
broadest sense) and perhaps its best theorems still deal with that subject."
Striking developments in the last few decades in commutative algebra have
reinforced this view of commutative algebra. These developments include
solutions to classical problems, as well as strengthened connections with
diverse areas including algebraic topology, group cohomology, algebraic
combinatorics, representation theory, invariant theory, and algebraic and
arithmetic geometry. The invited speakers include experts in different areas, as
well as several young researchers. The conference will provide an opportunity to
present key results and recent advances. A special effort will be made to
support the expenses of young researchers, women and minorities, graduate
students, and those without alternative means of support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
