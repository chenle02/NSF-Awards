This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
autonomous underwater animal tracker, an underwater robot that can follow a crab
or fish for weeks to months at a time. Satellite tracking has allowed huge,
rapid advances in understanding behaviors and requirements&lt;br/&gt;of large
animals. The opportunity to extend tracking to a wider range of marine life
using an autonomous underwater animal tracker is expected to yield similar
advances. To produce this robot we will modify an underwater glider, making it
capable of detecting, localizing and tracking a marine animal that has an
acoustic transmitter attached to, or embedded in, its body. With
over&lt;br/&gt;a dozen large tracking studies currently underway worldwide and
more planned, there is tremendous commercial potential for a service-oriented
business model to prosper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project is a much more detailed understanding of the behavior
of the world?s fish that travel our oceans. As the world population grows, we
continue to place greater strain on our planet?s resources. There is a need to
gain more definitive answers regarding the impact humans are having on marine
life, but collecting data from animals is a highly complex and expensive
proposition. As an example, consider the recent Census of Marine Life, a global
network of researchers in more than 80 nations engaged in a 10-year scientific
initiative to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abundance of
life in the oceans. Unfortunately, much of our knowledge regarding the
distributions and migrations of our marine populations is based on independent
samples often taken once per year, such as trawl sampling, or using stationary
data collection nodes such as those deployed by the Census of Marine Life?s
Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking joint effort.
