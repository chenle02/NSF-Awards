Dr. Eshleman will use the radar capabilities of the telescope at the Arecibo
Observatory to conduct detailed studies of the surfaces of Europa, Ganymede, and
Callisto (large, ice-clad moons of Jupiter). The data will be compared to
theoretical predictions from models of the surfaces of these moons. The emphasis
will be on the geophysical significance of the results. Ice and icy surfaces are
ubiquitous in the outer Solar System. One potentially important source of
information about these surfaces is from radar experiments. Radar echoes have
been obtained from Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, from the particles in
Saturn's rings, from several dozen asteroids, and from five comets. The icy
moons are the best studied of these, and they have radar echoes profoundly
different from the well-understood returns of the rocky planets and our Moon.
Dr. Eshleman will obtain new radar observations of the icy moons of Jupiter to
better understand reasons for the anomalous radar characteristics of these
objects.
