This award is to provide travel support for young scientists to attend the
International Conference on Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide. Calcitonin gene-
related peptide is 37-amino acid biologically active hormone discovered in 1983
by molecular techniques. This neuropeptide has profound effects on the neural,
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems and may act as a neuromodulator
and/or tropic factor. The format of this meeting reflects the interdisciplinary
nature of the research. Topics include the characterization and distribution of
the receptors in the nervous system, the molecular and biochemical processing of
the peptide, its biological actions and a session to address new perspectives.
Indeed, this meeting brings together, for the first time, leading experts and
young scientists from around the world that use wide variety of approaches to
share information about calcitonin gene-related peptide. This cross-pollination
of the disciplines will accelerate process in understanding the role of
calcitonin gene- related peptide in intercellular signalling and intracellular
processing in the brain which could have implications for clinical applications.
