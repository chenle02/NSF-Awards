The absence of central political authorities at the international level implies
that problems of global environmental change can be resolved only if national
governments and other relevant organizations find some way to cooperate with
each other. Researchers on common pool resources (CPRs) and international
regimes, although working separately and for the most part without awareness of
each other, have identified remarkably similar design principles underlying
successful self-organized cooperative solutions to problems of collective
action. In this project, the investigators will examine the relevance of these
same theoretical principles to global cooperation on environmental change by
convening a multidisciplinary conference in which prominent researchers in the
fields of common pool resources and international regimes, along with political
scientists who have worked on global environmental problems, will present papers
and engage in intensive discussion. The investigators are interested in
environmental protection and environmental change for policy as well as
scientific reasons. Their analysis may assist practitioners in designing more
effective institutions to protect ecological values. Thus, this project fits
well under the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Initiative.
