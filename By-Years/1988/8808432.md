The Center for Science and Technology of Advanced Cement-Based Materials at
Northwestern University is a collaborative interdisciplinary effort involving
research groups from Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at
Champaign- Urbana, Purdue University, the University of Michigan, and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST--formerly NBS). The
director of the Center will be Professor Surendra P. Shah of Northwestern
University. There are two basic complementary objectives to the research plan of
the Center. The first is to provide a more complete understanding of the
cementitious materials that are currently available, thus fostering more
effective and efficient use. The second is to provide a comprehensive basis for
the design of new materials with greatly improved properties. The plan of
research includes: 1) the chemistry and physics of cementitious materials
(rheology and setting processes, chemistry of silicate and aluminate cements,
solid-solution interface chemistry, new cement chemistries, and polymer-cement
composites); 2) processing science (prehardening processing, rheological
processes, influence of temperature and pressure, influence of microstructure
and reinforcement geometries, and novel processing techniques); 3)
microstructural analysis (properties of reaction products, pore structure,
solid-solid interfaces, and component distributions); 4) material properties
(fracture processes and mechanisms, diffusion and transport phenomena, long-term
deformation, environmental and thermal stability); and 5) fiber reinforcement
(fiber geometry and distribution, fiber-matrix interactions, and
micromechanics). These areas are interdependent and each will be augmented by
mathematical modelling of reactions, processes and properties. The models
generated will be used for predictive performance analyses and as a tool to
develop new materials, processes, and systems. They will serve as a basis for
introducing changes in the way cement-based materials are designed, fabricated
and used. Outreach activities planned by the Center include publications and
presentations, conferences, an industrial affiliates program, university-
industry research projects and short courses.
