Protists are a diverse and poorly understood aggregation of microbes, often
considered to include fungi, certain algae, protozoans, and other unicellular
groups. Dr. John Corliss has embarked on a long.term effort to coordinate the
nomenclature and taxonomy of these disparate groups, leading eventually to a
clearer understanding of their evolutionary relationships. He proposes to lead a
delegation of American researchers to an international biological meeting in
Australia for the purpose of helping to revise the international systems of
nomenclature, and to plan activities for the Protozoology Congress that will be
held in Japan in 1989. Dr. Corliss' efforts to create an integrated approach to
protistology have wide implications. The international cooperation and
collaboration that will result from these meetings will affect generations of
microbial research. The meetings that he is coordinating will take place over
the next five years, and will lead to an unprecedented view of protistan
evolution.
