The Engaging Youth in Engineering (EYE) Module Study is developing, pilot
testing, and field testing two engineering modules for middle school science and
mathematics classes: Bioengineering the Future with a focus on seventh grade
life science; and Engineering Clean Energy targeting eighth grade physical
science. Each module addresses an engineering design challenge of relevance to
industries in the region and fosters the development of engineering habits of
mind. The approach integrates technology and other resources to engage and meet
the diverse needs of children in a large, urban school district, and deepens
student understanding of selected middle grades mathematics and science content.
The theoretical foundations for the module development are grounded in
contemporary learning research. Instructional design of the materials emphasizes
contextual learning, collaboration, content integration, and embedded
assessments within the framework of the backward design
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher professional development materials are
being developed and participating mathematics and science teachers from the
collaborating middle schools engage in at least one week of professional
development each summer. An EYE Coach assists with professional development and
supports the teachers on site during the implementation of the modules. The
field testing sites offer opportunities to assess the impact of the
instructional materials in across diverse groups of
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the workability of
incorporating engineering design experiences into standards-based courses to
move toward an integrated STEM middle school curriculum in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics. This approach has potential to strengthen middle
school STEM programs through the integration of engineering experiences.
