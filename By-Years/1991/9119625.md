In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry , Prof. Strauss (U.C.
Berkeley) will use infrared spectroscopy to study intermolecular interactions in
condensed phases. Spectral hole-burning will be used to study the flow of
vibrational energy in solids at low temperatures. Prototype rotational processes
and conformational changes occuring on a slow time scale will be studied
theoretically as well as experimentally. Systems to be studied include
selectively deuterated ammonium ions,amorphous films of hydrocarbons and
perfluorinated hydrocarbons, and hydrogen/ice inclusion compounds. %%% Hydrogen
dissolved in water ice is thought to be a constituent of cold planets and their
moons. By studying the properties of this and similar systems in the laboratory,
Prof. Strauss (UC Berkeley) will add to our chemical knowledge in a highly cost
effective manner. Information obtained by his spectroscopic studies will aid in
interpreting chemical data sent from planetary space probes.
