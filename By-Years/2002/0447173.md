0447173&lt;br/&gt;Ammon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of the
Penn State Seismological Computing Facility. The upgrade will entail purchase of
an Apple Macintosh Xserve file server, four Macintosh dual 2.5 GHz G5 CPU
workstations, each with 1 GB RAM, a linear tape drive backup system, and a 1.75
Tb RAID Apple Xserve mass store. The upgrade will foster a transition from an
aging Sun file server/workstation network to an Apple MAC OS X based compute
environment that will greatly simplify system administration tasks and increase
by a factor of nearly four the compute power currently available to PI's Ammon,
Richardson, Nyblade, and their students. Compute intensive research that will
immediately be impacted by this upgrade include studies of the seismic structure
of the crust and upper mantle beneath West Africa and the East-West Antarctic
boundary, surface wave inversions, studies of mining induced seismicity,
earthquake relocations, and nuclear explosion
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
