This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to apply
knowledge developed from a laboratory astrophysics experiment to the challenge
of purification of aluminum. Aluminum more readily oxidizes than any metallic
impurities such as iron, which makes purifying aluminum cost prohibitive. This
project began as an investigation in liquid metal of angular momentum transport
mechanisms responsible for evolution of astrophysical accretion disks. By
tailoring the flow properties of the liquid metal, separation of solid
impurities entrained in the metal was observed. This project will extend those
initial observations to determine the efficiency of impurity separation over a
variety of flow parameters. These observations will be used to design an
apparatus to demonstrate impurity separation with molten aluminum.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is to improve the efficiency of aluminum recycling and reduce the energy
intensity of aluminum refining. Recycling aluminum requires only 5-8% of the
energy required to refine, but accumulates tramp elements which cannot cost
effectively be removed. Currently, recycled aluminum is "down cycled" into lower
valued products, or diluted with primary aluminum. By developing a cost-
effective means of removing impurities, the present project will enable
recyclers to produce higher value aluminum alloys with less use of primary
aluminum. Primary production of aluminum from alumina uses roughly 1% of global
electrical energy, and produces 2.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
Alternative refining processes which would dramatically reduce both electricity
needs and emissions are not yet commercially viable, in part due to a need for
cost effectively purifying the finished aluminum. As an enabling technology,
this project may contribute to the commercialization of alternative refining
processes leading to billions of dollars in savings over present production
means.
