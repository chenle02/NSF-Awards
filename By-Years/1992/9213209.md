This Research in Undergraduate Institutions award (RUI) provides support for a
study of three major ideological movements in the contemporary Middle East. The
first is Islamic modernism, which became the dominant political tendency within
Islam in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The second is the ebb
of Islam and the rise of various secular ideologies such as nationalism and
liberalism in the early to mid-twentieth century. The third is the rise of
fundamentalist Islam as the dominant tendency within the opposition movements
largely in the sixties and thereafter. The study will use archival materials for
Egypt, Iran, India, Pakistan and Syria to examine the causes of the rise of
these ideological movements, and to examine the connection between macro
socioeconomic and political changes and the rise or decline in ideological
movements in the Middle East. This study will provide a scientific understanding
of Islamic and other movements in the Middle Eastern countries, and by doing so
it may overcome some of the misconceptions that exists in Western cultures on
the nature of contemporary Middle Eastern societies and the nature of Islamic
movements in general.
