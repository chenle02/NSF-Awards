The most critical outcome from this workshop will be the start of a wholly new
formulation of an interdisciplinary agenda for research at the intersection of
communications and building engineering technologies. The workshop and its
report will identify near, medium, and long term research opportunities at the
intersection of these two disciplines. Furthermore, this applications arena,
though somewhat specific in its choice of technologies, scale, and where
applications are apt to be deployed, yields a problem rich testbed for more
general information infrastructure concepts and technologies. Ideally, effective
research in this area would generate a new set of design principles and
requirements for future buildings, thus change in the practice of how buildings
are designed and constructed to include from their initial conception the
communication and emerging work needs of future workers.
