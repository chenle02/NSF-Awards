The primary objective of this Dissertation Improvement award is to analyze
reproductive strategies in a species of Malagasy prosimians, Propithecus
diadema. The student will investigate the relationship between sex differences
in feeding behavior, reproductive condition and environmental seasonality and
female access to food. Sex differences in these behaviors are particularly
interesting as the Malagasy lemurs, unlike most other primates evidence female
feeding priority and female dominance over males. This research will provide the
first tests of hypotheses concerning sex differences in feeding behavior in a
forest dwelling lemur.
