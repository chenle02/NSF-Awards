The 30th Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics (AFW) will take
place March 7-10, 2016 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina. The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on
topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent
breakthroughs in mathematics. Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW
will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide
range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically,
about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and
about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue
to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging
ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time in at least a
dozen years that the workshop -- which attracts participants from across the US
as well as internationally -- will meet on the east coast, home to many experts
on automorphic forms and closely related topics. Thus, in addition to attracting
speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new
attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the
workshop. In addition to the research talks, the AFW will - like in past years -
have two professional development panels on topics such as starting a tenure
track job, forming collaborations, and transitioning from one career stage to
the next. The organizers of the workshop, which has an international reputation
for providing a supportive atmosphere for junior researchers, are committed to
continuing to facilitate a supportive, inclusive, vertically integrated
environment.

Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related
areas. One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and
collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning
automorphic forms. Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of
developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and
p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions.
Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics,
including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's
Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger),
the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris,
and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre
Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the
Fields Medal). The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include
elliptic, Siegel, Hilbert, and Bianchi modular forms, elliptic curves and
abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions
and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular
forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.
