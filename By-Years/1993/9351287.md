This project recommends a two-phase plan focusing on the development of
instructional and laboratory techniques to deliver training in computer
networks. The first phase was designed to identify courses for the program of
study and to introduce basic networking experiments into the curricula. Trident
is requesting NSF funding for the second phase to expand the laboratory
capability to include experiments in most of the networking techniques used in
manufacturing and business distributed computing. The College proposes to
utilize NSF funds for the purchase of hardware and software technology that
enhances the hands-on approach, and expands networking competencies in the
program of study. Steps for Phase II include purchasing and installing hardware
and software requested in this grant application; integrating networking
concepts and laboratory exercises into second year courses in the second year of
the curriculum, assuring students have basic networking competency; develop and
implement laboratory exercises in the certificate and associate degree programs
in Information Systems; and conduct an ongoing evaluation.
