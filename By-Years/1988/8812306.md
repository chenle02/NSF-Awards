Dr. Pilbeam and his collaborators will continue their research into the origins
of higher primates, including hominids (humans). In particular, they will focus
on the earlier less well known time period which extends from ca. 15 - 7 million
years ago. It was during this mid to late Miocene period that the human line
likely emerged and that modern genera of anthropoid apes first appear.
Unfortunately, the fossil record is very scanty, and Dr. Pilbeam's research is
helping to fill this gap. With past NSF support, Dr. Pilbeam has led field
projects in Pakistan and Kenya which have recovered extremely significant finds.
Dr. Pilbeam will continue fieldwork in Pakistan and will analyze materials
recovered both there and in Kenya. Years of search have produced extensive
fossil assemblages and the team will work to elucidate patterns of development
in both primates and other mammalian groups. They will reconstruct the structure
of faunal communities and trace their change through time. This research is
important because it traces the development of the human species. To understand
ourselves as we are today, it is important to trace our long-term history and to
elucidate the processes which are reflected therein.
