This research is to utilize the high-quality tsunami tide-gauge records for
earthquakes as far back as 1850 to extend earthquake history for active seismic
zones near continents backwards beyond the time of good modern seismic records,
only about 30 years. Among the outstanding problems in seismology are temporal
variation of seismic activity and its effects on global changes in strain,
variable rupture mode of great earthquakes, slip distribution on a fault plane,
especially beneath the accretionary wedge in subduction zones, and anomalous
tsunamigenic earthquakes of presumably non-fault origin. This research proposes
to conduct quantitative analysis of tsunami data to improve our knowledge of
these processes. This work has direct application to the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program.
