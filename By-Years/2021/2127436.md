The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be the development of a platform technology for creating rapid
virus diagnostics that directly recognizes the virus surface protein pattern
from a patient sample and generates accurate results within minutes. Current
standards for high-fidelity viral pathogen diagnostics require complex
instruments, technical expertise to run the instruments, and hours to produce
and interpret results. The proposed platform creates a virus-specific biosensor
that selectively binds to the target virus and produces visible results without
time-consuming pre-processing or expensive instruments. Lower cost tests and
faster sample-to-result turnovers could result in more effective control of
disease spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop a highly
functional, sensitive, and specific diagnostic for the detection of coronavirus.
This technology is based on the company’s Pattern-Recognition Enhanced Sensing
and Therapeutics (PEST) concept. The solution is a first-in-class diagnostics
that uses algorithmically-designed structural DNA to form a trap that may detect
and selectively bind a signature pattern of the pathogen. This recognition and
binding may generate visual signals without the need of DNA/RNA preprocessing or
amplification associated with the current generation of molecular tests
(polymerase chain reactions, PCRs). This project will involve building a
preclinical prototype of PEST-enabled lateral flow based COVID-19 rapid
diagnostics with a goal of providing results for each sample within 5 minutes.
This fast test result will be followed by preclinical validation to determine
the test’s specificity, limits of detection, and implement mechanism to improve
the assay specificity and to avoid cross-reaction to other virus
types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
