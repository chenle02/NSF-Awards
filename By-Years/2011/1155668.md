The objective of this research is to develop a new conceptual framework together
with an effective analytical approach for survey sampling. The new framework
centers on explicitly linking survey sampling to missing data problems.
Conceptually, inference from a survey sample is similar to that in a missing
data problem: study variables are observed for subjects in the sample, but are
missing for those outside the sample. This researcher will develop efficient
estimation, by first constructing efficient estimators, for example, based on
nonparametric maximum likelihood for missing data problems with independent and
identically distributed data and then extending those estimators to survey
sampling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Survey sampling is widely used for information
gathering and analysis in various settings, including government agencies,
academic institutions, and industries. This research will help to draw more
accurate inferences than before from survey data. This will improve the cost-
effectiveness of surveys and lead to better informed policy analysis and
scientific investigation. Computer programs for implementing the methods will be
made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;
