Intellectual merit of the awarded scientific project is the development and
characterization of practical aspects of quantum computing with ultracold polar
molecules and highly-magnetic atoms. Exquisite control over their internal and
external degrees of freedom should enable regular arrays of these atoms or
molecules to form a scalable quantum information processor.

The broader impact is that ultracold atoms and molecules open opportunities for
the development of new tools for precision measurement such as optical atomic
and molecular clocks, enabling to search for new theories of physics beyond the
Standard Model, and improved understanding of condensed matter phenomena such as
colossal magnetoresistance (for improved data storage and processing) and
superconductivity (for perfectly efficient electric power transmission).
