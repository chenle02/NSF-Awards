9724240 Davis Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) equipment will be acquired by the
California Institute of Technology. The equipment includes 200 MHz, 300 MHz, and
400 MHz NMR spectrometers. The instruments will support research projects in
materials chemistry and materials physics, including synthetic and catalytic
studies of molecular sieves, order and dynamics in polymers, and the development
of high sensitivity NMR methods. %%% The instrumentation will be part of a
unique multi-user, solid state NMR facility, accessible to users within the Los
Angeles basin. Students will be trained in the technique and in the use of the
instruments, both through individual sessions and through a formal course. ***
