This proposal seeks to understand the manner in which communication evolves in
infancy. The importance of this concern is clear, since parent-infant
communication is a major factor in the cognitive and social development of the
child. The PI has rigorously developed a set of hypotheses which hold early
communicative acts involve the use of actions whose functions were not
originally tied to communication. The study will help to isolate how these
originally non-communicative actions are reorganized into an operative
communicative system between parent and infant. In learning about the basic
building blocks of communication, the PI will help to identify patterns of
behavior that lead to more, or less, effective socialization of the infant.
