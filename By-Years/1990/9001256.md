This project is to establish a U.S. national panel on structural control
research for seismic and wind resistant design. The objective is to establish a
sound knowledge basis for research, to develop a national R&amp;D program for
the active control of structures, and to conduct a collaborative planning study
project with a counterpart panel in Japan established by the Japan Science
Agency. A plan of action will be developed which consists of possible multi-
national efforts involving collaborative projects, exchange of personnel,
jointly organized experiments, and exchange of data and technical information,
etc. The activities will involve researchers from academic field, industry, and
government laboratories. The programs will be carried out under the general
auspices of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). The
effort will bring about accelerated implementation of an emerging technology in
active structural control which holds great promise for reducing structural
damages for seismic and wind loadings.
