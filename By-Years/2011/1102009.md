The solar wind is the primary driver for space weather phenomena at the Earth.
Unfortunately, the observations of the solar wind are plagued by gaps in the
data. Modeling of the dynamics of the magnetosphere and ionosphere generally
require time-continuous information about the solar wind density, velocity and
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). This project will utilize singular spectrum
analysis (SSA) techniques to fill in the gaps in the solar wind data by using
data from a variety of ground-based observations where continuous data are
available. The SSA analysis will be applied to the historical solar wind data
from 1963 to the present.

The resulting dataset will be used for studies of the radiaton belts. The
dataset will also be made available to the research community through the
Virtual Radiation Belt Observatory (ViRBO). The continuous solar wind and IMF
data that will be produced will be useful in a variety of research projects
concerning space weather and the work therefore will have societal benefits. The
project also has educational benefits through the participation of a graduate
student.
