The objective of this Gordon Research Conference is to foster the interaction of
scientists from various disciplines on temperature stresses. The program
includes sessions on: role of membranes, biology of cell surface, cryobiology,
temperature responses of pollen and seeds, high temperature plant responses,
functions of heat shock proteins, ice nucleation, and biotechnology and
molecular genetics. A unique feature of the Gordon Research Conference is the
free and uninhibited exchange of information between scientists of many
disciplines. Two previous Gordon Conferences on this topic were highly
successful in fostering communication and promoting cooperative
interdisciplinary research among scientists in industry, academic institutions
and federal agencies. At present there is no comparable forum for the intensive,
wide ranging and productive interdisciplinary exchange of relevant information
and ideas. The area of temperature stress in plants represents one of the most
important factors affecting crops world wide. It is also one of the most
advanced areas in plant biotechnology. Thus, this conference addresses not only
one of the most important aspects affecting plant growth and agriculture, but
also an area where scientific advances are at the forefront of biology. This
conference is the only one on this topic that is held regularly.
