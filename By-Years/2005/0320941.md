0320941&lt;br/&gt;Long&lt;br/&gt;This MRI project will provide state-of-the-art
instrumentation to conduct watershed and drinking water supply research. The EVE
group will house this instrumentation in new research laboratories that are part
of the 60,000 square foot Engineering Phase II building currently under
construction on the UMass Amherst campus and scheduled for occupancy in 2004.
The instrumentation to be purchased as part of this project include an
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP/MS), a total nitrogen/total
organic carbon (TN/TOC) analyzer with an autosampler, a gas chromatograph (GC)
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF/MS), a Watershed Molecular
Pathogen/Indicator Monitoring Laboratory, particle characterization
instrumentation, and computational capabilities.
