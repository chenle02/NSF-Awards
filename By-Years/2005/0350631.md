Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Protein Adsorption and
Transport in Chromatographic Bioprocessing&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0350631&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Abraham
Lenhoff&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
project is to determine the mechanisms of adsorption and transport in
chromatographic separations of proteins. One goal is to develop quantitative
relationships between structural properties of the protein and the stationary
phase. Chromatographic performance will be characterized in terms of linear
retention, capacity, and intraparticle transport. These measures are related to
the underlying physical, chemical and structural properties of the stationary
phase, the protein, and the eluent. Research will focus on two modes of
chromatography: ion exchange chromatography (IEC) and hydrophobic interaction
chromatography (HIC). Protein adsorption kinetics will also be determined. In
terms of the broader impacts, chromatography is widely used in downstream
purification in bioprocessing. The proposed studies can provide quantitative
mechanistic models that can be used to guide separation processes. Student
training will span a spectrum from modern experimental tools such as confocal
microscopy to the practice of chromatography in bioprocessing.&lt;br/&gt;
