This award provides funds to support a Workshop entitled Making Sense of the
multi-model decadal prediction experiments from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This Workshop will bring together researchers,
primarily from the high-end climate modeling centers, with an objective to
devise an analysis and evaluation methodology for the suite of decadal
simulations. The Aspen Global Change Institute will also document the entire
proceedings (e.g. power point presentations, background papers and supplementary
references) at its website www.agci.org &lt;br/&gt;Methodologies essential for
quantifying the reliability and credibility of decadal simulations will be
developed, thus the intellectual merit is high. The Workshop will facilitate
collaboration and analysis of the decadal prediction model output produced thus
far and scientific results will be synthesized in a timely manner for inclusion
in the IPCC AR5. One of the deliverables from this Workshop will be a peer-
reviewed journal article that will be assessed as part of the forthcoming report
of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC AR5). Thus the broader
impacts of the activity is also high.
