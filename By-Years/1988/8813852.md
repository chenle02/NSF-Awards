A program of braodly-based theoretical research into superconductivity is
proposed, ranging from the microscopic description of the superconductive
mechanism in high-Tc superconductors to the investigation of flux-pinning in
high- field Niobium-Titanium superconducting magnets. In the microscopic work,
the approach is to construct variational wavefunctions for the ground and
excited states of the two- dimensional Hubbard model. The investigator has
recently found an expression for the excited states, building on earlier work
for the ground state. The energy and other properties of these can be evaluated
using a numerical technic previously developed by the investigator and others.
They also propose to continue to develop the analytic theory of this model to
finite temperatures, using a recently discovered mapping of the entropy into a
well- understood statistical mechanical problem. Further work aimed at
determining the microscopic phase of UPt3 using experimental neutron-scattering
data as input will be pursued. Collaboration with experimental groups at
Wisconsin will also continue. The model of granular superconductivity to explain
properties of weakly-connected superconductors will be explored by numerical
methods. Numerical solutions of the Ginsburg-Landau equations for different
flux-pinning morphologies (experimentally determined) will be obtained.. These
last two projects will help to optimize the properties of oxide and Niobium-
Titanium magnets.
