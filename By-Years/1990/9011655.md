This study of photosynthetic pigments is directed at understanding the
processes that control biological and chemical variability in the upper water
column. Observations will continue to be made on the distribution,
transformation and degradation of photosynthetic pigments in the oceans.
Research has emphasized: 1) pigments as chemotaxonomic markers, 2) physical-
chemical-biological interactions in frontal areas, 3) photo-adaptation
strategies of marine phytoplankton, and 4) grazing by zooplankton. High
performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) techniques have been used to quantify
porphyrin and carotenoid distributions, zooplankton feeding selectivity, and
differential rates of photosynthetic pigment synthesis. These studies will
continue in cooperation with investigators at WHOI, U Miami, UCSB and at
laboratories in the Soviet Union. The results of this research will have direct
applications to issues in the U. S. JGOFS.
