Chaudhary This project explores a new scheme for achieving load balancing in a
heterogeneous distributed computing system. With the advent of optical links it
is now feasible to migrate tasks from one computer to a remote computer. This
scheme is being implemented and tested using real-world problems in a real
heterogeneous distributed computing environment. A salient feature of the scheme
is its semi-distributed, adaptive nature, i.e., the parameters taken into
consideration and the algorithm for load balancing itself change during run
time. The algorithm is stable, i.e., no processes are allowed to migrate without
making any progress. No assumptions are made about the dependency relations of
the various tasks. Various job classes with precedence constraints are allowed.
Other important real- world constraints such as the inability of a process to
execute on particular computers, a process needing more than one computer
simultaneously for its execution, a set of processes needing to be executed on a
particular subset of computers, etc., are also incorporated into the scheme. The
scheme starts with an initial static load balance and then evolves into an
adaptive algorithm.
