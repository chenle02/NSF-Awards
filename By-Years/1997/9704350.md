Run-time monitoring provides an effective means for aiding in the difficult
tasks of developing, testing and maintaining distributed computations. However,
monitoring activities introduce intrusion, which can potentially alter the
behavior of the computation being monitored. This project is investigating
techniques to accommodate the effects of monitoring intrusion such that a
computation will exhibit the same behavior while being monitored as it would
have exhibited in the absence of monitoring. This project focuses on a variety
of approaches, which encompass processor scheduling, communication protocols,
time maintenance and process synchronization. The techniques developed will be
incorporated into a system for the on- line monitoring of distributed
computations, for experimentation and evaluation. This project is conducted
jointly by Rajiv Gupta of University of Pittsburgh and Madalene Spezialetti of
Trinity College, CT under grant CCR 9704332.
