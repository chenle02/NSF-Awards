Salt domes are being used in both the United States and elsewhere for the
storage of fluids other than water. Concerns exist about the rate at which
stored gases diffuse through the salt and escape. Such gaseous movement can
result in significant economic losses and can also pose dangers to the
environment. Analyses used to predict the escape rates involve massive amount of
computer time and have proved excessively expensive and time consuming for
practical use. This grant is to provide the principal investigator with two
mini- computers (workstations) which will be dedicated to research on diffusion
rates of gases in solids, and will allow the principal investigators and his
students to develop highly efficient and practical numerical schemes for
analysis of these problems.
