There is a world-wide interest in the seismic resistance of masonry components
and buildings. A coordinated research program on the seismic resistance of
masonry structures and building is being conducted in the U.S. as a part of the
U.S. - Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry Building Research. This research
program will provide for the travel expenses for Dr. M.J.N. Priestley, of the
University of Cantorbury, Christchurch, N.Z. to meet with members of the U.S. -
Japan Technical Coordinating Committee on Masonry Research, (TCCMAR) in Los
Angeles, San Diego, and Boulder.
