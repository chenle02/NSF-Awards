This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have
emerged as a promising alternative in&lt;br/&gt;the transition of the computing
industry to mainstream parallel computing.&lt;br/&gt;Enabling applications to
benefit from their potential requires that GPU programming be made accessible to
the average programmer. This research focuses on the challenges making GPU
programming easier through new high-level programming models, and enabling
efficient GPU execution through compilation frameworks for these
models.&lt;br/&gt;Two complementary GPU programming models are proposed ---
OpenMP, which is widely used for shared-memory parallel programming, and
Parallel Operator Data-Flow Graphs (PO-DFGs), which naturally represent
algorithms in a wide range of current and emerging application domains. Various
optimization techniques are developed for programs written to these models,
including partitioning the program between the host CPU and GPUs, stream
optimizations that render the program's memory access characteristics to be more
amenable to the GPU's memory system, minimizing data transfer between the host
and GPU memory, and GPU architecture-specific optimizations. The research
contributes to the evolution of GPGPU programming from manual ports of
applications using low-level APIs, to the use of high-level parallel programming
models.
