Regional magnetic anomaly data from both satellites and aeromagnetic surveys
have provided substantial impetus for studies of the magnetic structure of the
lower crust and upper mantle. The interpretation of these anomalies has remained
a puzzle, requiring strongly magnetic source rocks that are thicker, more
extensive, and perhaps deeper-seated than previously thought. A rock magnetic
phenomenon has been called upon to explain the necessary intense magnetization
of these deeper rock units: 'thermally enhanced' viscous remanent magnetization
(VRM). The PI will test this hypothesis, with a suite of laboratory experiments
to characterize the magnetic changes associated with VRM acquisition. Further,
he will conduct these VRM experiments as a function of temperature, pressure,
grain size and composition of the magnetic minerals, as well as the previous
magnetic history of the samples, in an attempt to put closer limits on models of
possible deep crustal magnetic sources.
