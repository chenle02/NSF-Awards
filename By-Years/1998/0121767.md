&lt;br/&gt;0121767&lt;br/&gt;Reible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American
Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the
Department of Energy (DOE), will consist of an intense two-week training course
on many aspects of environmental contamination. The goal of the course is to
familiarize young and mid-career professionals in the field of remediation of
contaminated sites with the latest research on in-sites assessment and clean up
methods. Organized by Dr. Danny D. Reible of Louisiana State University, the
course will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 15-27, 2002 and will involve
approximately 50 students and 12 leaders in the field. Publications of the
lectures and supporting information will be made available in audio-linked web
format for the use of others unable to attend and participate in the PASI.
