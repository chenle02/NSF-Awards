A central question in economics is how markets coordinate the behavior of
anonymous decision makers in a many person decentralized economy. Economic
theory has progressed using the equilibrium method. For abstract games, an
equilibrium is defined as an assignment to each player of a strategy that is
best for him when the others use the strategies assigned to them. However, the
relevance of this abstract mutual consistency requirement for economic modeling
is an open question. This project will focus on two related problems. First, the
mutual consistency requirement of an equilibrium assignment is not an
implication of individual rationality, because individual rationality does not
restrict the subjective beliefs a player may hold. Rather, individual
rationality means internal consistency and internally consistent beliefs and
actions of different players may not be mutually consistent. Second there is
often more than one equilibrium assignment. Consequently, understanding the
origin of mutually consistent behavior is an essential complement to the theory
of equilibrium points. This project will utilize experimental methods in order
to determine how people actually use the strategic details of their environment.
The ultimate goal is to develop an empirical foundation for a convincing
explanation of the origin of mutually consistent behavior in observable games,
that is, how people learn equilibrium behavior.
