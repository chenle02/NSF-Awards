Dark matter and dark energy make up 95% of the Universe, yet the physics
governing these components is not well understood. Weak lensing, the bending of
light as it passes by mass in the Universe, is one of the most powerful tools
for studying dark matter and dark energy. Weak lensing measurements from the
recent Universe have been found to be discrepant with cosmic microwave
background measurements from the early Universe, which may indicate that our
understanding of cosmology is incomplete. The investigators will assemble an
independent weak lensing data set using public observations covering a new area
of sky comparable to the largest state-of-the-art weak lensing surveys. These
data will be used to perform an independent analysis and directly address the
tension between measurements of the Universe at early and recent times. This
program will be part of the education for a diverse group of students. It will
also include outreach efforts that share cosmology with the public by combining
art and science in collaboration with Adler Planetarium and the Space Explorers
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use public data from the
Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the NSFâ€™s Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
to generate a new weak lensing shear catalog containing approximately 80 million
galaxies. This new catalog will be used to perform an independent cosmic shear
analysis, which connects weak lensing measurements to cosmological model
parameters. The dataset will cover 5,000 sq. deg. of sky outside of the
footprint of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). This investigation will provide a
statistically independent cross-check of recent cosmic shear analyses from DES
and other surveys. Furthermore, when combined with DES, this program will
provide a shear catalog that covers 10,000 sq. deg. of sky, giving access to
cosmological scales that have not been explored by current weak lensing surveys.
The public release of processed DECam data will increase scientific
accessibility for amateur and professional astronomers. In particular, it will
help the community prepare for early data from the NSF-funded Vera C. Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
