The Electron Microscopy course is being upgraded to include preparation
techniques for biological specimen imaging through the purchase of a critical
point dryer, sputter coater, and stereoscopic zoom microscope. Students in cell
and molecular biology can benefit from an expanded opprtunity to study surface
topology. Students in general biology and botany receive a closely supervised
first hand experience on the SEM, including the taking of scanning electron
micrographs, which will serve as the lab material for the study of intricate
structure. The project upgrades graduate school preparation and employment
possibilities for graduating students since scanning electron microscopy and
transmission electron microscopy are skills that are highly sought after in
industry. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
