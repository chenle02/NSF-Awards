The Salish Kootenai College, a tribally controlled two-year college on the
Flathead Indian Reservation, is improving chemistry and natural resources
courses. Improvements are being made in student preparation for natural resource
field courses and chemistry by utilizing interactive audiovisual manuals, hand-
held field computers which allow for some analysis of data in the field, and
PC's in the chemistry lab with data acquisition interfaces which display
chemical and physical changes graphically as the student performs the
experiment. The program is especially significant because it matches state-of-
the-art technologies with the learning styles of Native American students. The
college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
