AST-9615608 Michael A'Hearn Drs. A'Hearn and Lisse at the University of Maryland
will carry out a very comprehensive multi-wavelength program of observation of
comet Hale-Bopp. The primary goal is to gain a better understanding of the
cometary formation environments. In particular, an investigation of the sulfur
chemistry in the comet has the goal of understanding the relevance of sulfur in
terms of the primordial nature of cometary materials. This award is supported
jointly by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences at NSF. ===========================================
