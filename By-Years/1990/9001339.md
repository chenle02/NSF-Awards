Graduate student Jose Villasenor under the guidance of Dr. Tom Elias of Rancho
Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the Mexican and Guatemalan species of
Senecio section Mulgedifolii, a poorly known group of tropical montane sunflower
relatives. He plans a broad survey of features of morphology, chromosome
composition, and analysis of variation in chloroplast DNA. The goals include
evaluation of morphological characters that provide stable, reliable guides to
the identification of species; mapping of the geographic distributions of the
estimated 15 or so species throughout Mesoamerica; and inference of the
evolutionary relationships among these species and with closely related groups
of Senecio. Villasenor has published a number of papers on the plant resources
of Mexico, and has conducted field work in several regions of the country. The
broad approach he is taking to the study of plant biodiversity, encompassing
both traditional morphological investigation and laboratory analysis of genetic
and genomic variation, will bring increased understanding of tropical plant
resources in the Americas, and in turn the research will contribute to training
of the next generation of plant scientists.
