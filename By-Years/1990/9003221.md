In the vascular systems of the body (blood and lymphatic) it is the smallest
muscular vessels that play the greatest role in physiological regulation. It has
been extremely difficult in the past to make quantitative studies of the
behavior of these vessels because they are too small to allow the attachment of
mechanical devices to measure their contractions. It is possible to measure
their movement by computer image processing, but this approach has not been
exploited because of the previous high cost of the equipment and the lack of
suitable software. Now that appropriate computer equipment is no longer
prohibitively expensive, we will use a novel algorithm of our design to
implement software that will (1) monitor diameter in several separate regions of
a vascular tree and (2) monitor diameter change as a function of length along a
region of a single vessel. The algorithm we now use can be applied to vessels in
isolated preparations that do not contain blood. In response to our own needs
and to requests from other groups, we have developed another algorithm for
vessels that contain blood, and we shall develop a second set of programs using
this algorithm. These systems will advance the technical capabilities in basic
research in the fields of blood and lymphatic microcirculation.
