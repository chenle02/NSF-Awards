This MRI award provides for the purchase of two ultrafast laser systems that
will serve as the backbone for a two-component high-intensity pulsed laser
facility in the J. R. Macdonald (JRM) Laboratory in the Physics Department of
Kansas State University. The program that the equipment will enable represents a
marriage of intense laser technology with the ion-beam and momentum-imaging
expertise and capabilities existing presently in the JRM Laboratory. Taken
together, the two capabilities will allow the study of the mechanisms whereby
electrons are removed from charged and neutral targets by intense laser pulses
and the study the interaction of (multiply) charged ions with targets "dressed"
by intense radiation fields. The equipment will be available to all users of the
JRM facility, including graduate and undergraduate students, post-docs, faculty,
and outside users.
