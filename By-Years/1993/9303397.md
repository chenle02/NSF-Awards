9303397 Hagman The proposed research is to measure the duration of tunneling or
barrier transversal in quantum tunneling. Laser/STM experiments will be based
upon modulation of the barrier height by the electric field of light rather than
by current rectification as used in earlier studies. A novel STM with decreased
noise and increased stability has been designed for this work. Numerical
modeling based on energy fluctuations will be used to support the experimental
work. ***
