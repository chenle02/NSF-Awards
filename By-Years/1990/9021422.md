Funds are being provided by the Developmental Biology, Theoretical Chemistry
and Materials Theory programs for support for this interdisciplinary workshop at
Les Houches, February 19-28, 1991. Dynamical processes at interfaces, surfaces
and membranes play an essential role in a great variety of fundamental phenomena
and at the same time exhibit specific features of reduced dimensionality. The
study of such phenomena is of great current interest in physics, chemistry and
biology. It is more and more evident that studies made in these disciplines
share many common features and could be carried out in a more productive way if
there were more communication among researchers. This winter school will make a
significant contribution to this effort.
