This project, having long-term technological relevance, is supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, and focusses on the study of
heterogeneous reaction dynamics. Professor Andrew B. Bocarsly and his students
at Princeton University will use molecular beams, surface spectroscopic and
microscopic methods, and flow reactor studies to characterize the reactions so
that models for these processes can be developed. Catalytic decomposition and
oxidation reactions will be studied in detail. Many technologically important
processes occur between gas and liquid phase reactants and solid surfaces. These
heterogeneous reactions can increase the efficiency of important industrial
processes and be used to limit amounts of undesirable constituents present in
effluents from many common processes. Professor Bocarsly and his students at
Princeton University will study reactions involving carbon monoxide and nitrogen
oxides as well as processes for preparing solid surfaces that have desired
catalytic properties.
