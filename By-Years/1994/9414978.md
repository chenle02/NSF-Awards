NSF and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will jointly fund the renovation
of a portion of Lapham Hall for research and research training in Conservation
Biology. The research integrates both theoretical and applied aspects of
ecology, evolution, systematics and ecosystems research. The program stresses a
solid foundation in conceptual approaches and extensive experiences in
laboratory and field methods. The current laboratory space, originally
constructed in 1959-1960 as a teaching facility, has limited the program's
ability to conduct experimental research activities. With the support of NSF,
the researchers will rectify serious environmental problems in the aquarium
facility including the upgrade of the dechlorination system, improved water
temperature control, installation of controlled lighting, and provision of
adequate ventilation. In addition, award monies will be utilized to install
three new growth chambers and renovate a fourth. Three of the existing units are
28 years old and deteriorated beyond repair. Emergency power will be supplied to
both the aquarium room and the growth chambers as part of the renovation effort.
