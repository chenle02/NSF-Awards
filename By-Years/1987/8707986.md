This project will investigate the structural and earthquake rupture
characteristics of transtensional faulting in Yunnan Province, China and will
compare and contrast the characteristics of faulting in Yunnan with extensional
faulting in the Basin- Range qnd Rocky Mountain Provinces of the United States.
The work will be done in conjunction with Chinese collegues from the Geological
Institute of the State Seismological Bureau, Beijing, China. The bjectives of
this research are (1) to establish a regional kinematic model of tectonics in
the Jinchuan--Eryuan extensional zone, (2) construct structural-mechanical
models of selected fault zones, (3) interpret these models in terms of
seismogenic rupture characteristics, and (4) compare the predicted behavior with
that observed in the historical and paleo-seismological record. The work in
Yunnan will be integrated wtih similar studies of active fault zones in the
Basin-Range and Rocky Moutain regions of the western U.S. in an effort to
further understanding of the relations between geologic structure and crustal
seismogenics in general.
