*** 9660699 Morford This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to
be carried out by Automated Functions, Inc. seeks to use innovative computer
technology, Versatile Economic Speech Technology (VEST), to serve as a low-cost
platform for products with speech and large-character displays to be used by
blind and visually impaired people in education, employment, and daily living.
The core of the innovative technology is a Central Processing Unit (CPU) called
a Program Interface Chip (PIC). A PIC differs from general purpose computer
processors in that it is low cost and has a smaller number of functions. The
Phase I feasibility activity will consist of the development and testing a
scientific calculator for blind and visually impaired students. VEST products
have the potential of assisting thousands of visually impaired students and
business professionals through the world enabling them to have low cost access
to technology that increases their independence, productivity, and qualifty of
life. Potential products include a large print and talking scientific
calculator, large print and talking restaurant menus, large print and talking
pocket organizer, and many more. These products will be converted to speak
different foreign languages. ***
