Digital watermarking is being investigated as an underlying technology for
digital rights management systems (which provide content authentication, copy
and access control, or proof of ownership). This proposal aims to develop a
complexity-theoretic foundation that allows rigorous and quantitative studies of
security, transparency, efficiency and capacity of digital image watermarking
systems. Unlike previous works on modeling watermarking, two fundamental
constraints on the insertion and extraction algorithms are taken into account,
namely, they must be fast and also preserve the perceptual fidelity of their
inputs. A key effort of this research will be to obtain formal characterizations
of the class of algorithms which preserve perceptual fidelity of input images
under various distortion metrics based on current theories of vision. Another
goal is to settle the current debate as to whether computationally secure
digital image watermarking systems exist, and if so, how to design them. Other
planned activities include characterizations of tradeoff relationships between
transparency, security, and capacity; applications to approximate data matching
problems and indexing/querying multimedia databases and libraries; and
development of an undergraduate-level course in digital watermarking at Santa
Clara University.
