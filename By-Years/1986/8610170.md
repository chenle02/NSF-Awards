This effort deals with the use of non-linear materials to switch and control
light. The measurements seek to answer the question as to how rapidly such
devices can be expected to respond to quick changes in the optical beam and to
provide data by which appropriate materials can be chose. A variety of
semiconductor materials and phenomena in these materials which can be used for
this manipulation of light beams will be examined.
