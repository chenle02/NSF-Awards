Closely related species often resemble each other for many characteristics.
Statistical analyses of cross-species (comparative) data sets cannot assume that
species data points are statistically independent or drawn from a common
underlying distribution. The former leads to uncertainties about degrees of
freedom for hypothesis testing; the latter may lead to problems of estimation.
Several authors have proposed analytical methods that attempt to solve these
problems by mapping characters of ecological or physiological interest on a
"known" phylogeny, estimated from independent information (e.g., DNA sequences).
Computer simulation techniques will be used to investigate the statistical
properties of several such methods. First, the Type I error rates, power, and
estimation abilities of two new methods for analyzing correlated evolution of
continuous traits, one based on autocorrelation models (Cheverud et al., 1985;
Gittleman and Kot, 1990) and the other on pedigree models from quantitative
genetics (Lynch, 1991), will be compared to those previously studied (non-
phylogenetic, independent contrasts, minimum evolution). Second, a simulation
approach to phylogenetic analysis of covariance will be developed. Third,
computer programs will be developed that (1) simulate data phylogenetically
under alternative models of evolutionary change, (2) perform analysis of
covariance on the simulated data to obtain null distributions of F-statistics,
and (3) allow graphically-based data entry and transformation of tree structure
and character data. %%% Comparative analyses of phylogentic relationships is an
important interdisciplinary approach linking studies in phylogency with ecology,
behavior and physiology. This proposal focuses on statistical techniques of
comparative analysis and will validate and further develop comparative methods
essential to this approach.
