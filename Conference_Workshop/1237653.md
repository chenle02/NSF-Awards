This is a proposal to provide funding for the conference "Geometry and Topology
in Samos" to be held in Samos, Greece during June 11-16, 2012. The focus of this
conference is the classification of manifolds, including both topological and
geometric aspects. The central rigidity conjecture is the Farrell-Jones
Conjecture, which generalizes both the Novikov and Borel rigidity conjectures.
The conference will bring together researchers who use geometric methods to
study topological problems with researchers who use topological methods to study
geometric problems. Examples of the former are high-dimensional topologists and
examples of the latter are geometric group theorists and differential geometers.

Topology is often described as "rubber geometry": spaces are considered the same
if one can be deformed into another via stretching and compressing (but without
tearing or puncturing). A basic problem is to decide whether two spaces can be
deformed into each other. The primary method for doing this is to develop ways
to assign computable invariants to the space: if two spaces can be deformed into
each other, then the associated invariants have to coincide. And conversely, if
two spaces have different invariants, then they cannot be deformed into each
other. An example of such invariants are the homotopy groups of a space. One can
then ask whether the homotopy groups are good enough invariants to determine
spaces. In other words, if if we have two spaces whose homotopy groups are the
same, can they be deformed into each other? One of the central conjectures in
topology is the Borel Conjecture, which predicts that for a certain class of
spaces, the answer to the previous question is "yes". This problem has been
central to high-dimensional topology, and work on it has involved sophisticated
techniques from areas as diverse as algebra, geometry, and dynamics. The
conference plans on bringing together international experts whose work touches
upon the Borel conjecture (and related questions), with a view towards charting
the course of future research on these topics.
