This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
site in Physics at the University of Chicago. The award will support ten
students per year for ten weeks of summer research. The core of the program for
each student is a well-defined 10- week summer research project under
supervision of a University of Chicago faculty member. Projects are distributed
among: high-energy, cosmic-ray and astrophysics, general relativity, condensed-
matter physics, non-linear dynamics and biophysics. A series of lectures
presented by faculty provides an overview of some of the most important research
topics currently pursued in these areas of physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interns will learn to communicate science by submitting a written report and
making an oral presentation on their work. The program provides students with
exposure to the breadth and unity of physics. It brings the REU students into
contact with one another. This creates the peer interactions among students that
increase the program's excitement and vitality, and helps prepare them for
future careers in Physics and in STEM fields in general.
