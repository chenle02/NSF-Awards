The Internet has grown rapidly along several dimensions over the past decade.
Yet, the core transport mechanisms used in its operation have not changed much.
It is difficult to believe that the assumptions on which network designs were
based a decade ago are valid even today. Unfortunately, due to the in-
feasibility of collecting sufficient statistics in the past, answers to several
fundamental questions related to the transport protocols performance in today's
Internet are unknown: "Is there any congestion in today's Internet? Are
transport mechanisms of the past working well for current applications? If not,
how can they be redesigned?" This project addresses these questions
through:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (1) extensive measurements and analysis to
develop a fundamental understanding of transport performance of networks and
validate legacy assumptions;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (2) investigation of the
impact of invalid assumptions on the design, analysis, and evaluation of
existing transport mechanisms; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (3) design of new
mechanisms and analysis techniques based on the
findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once completed, this project will help
scientifically re-assess the principle and assumptions used in the design of
Internet transport protocols in the past and will also benefit several
communities. First, experience in measurements and analysis is invaluable to
federal, commercial, and academic institutions that are involved in mining for
information in large data-sets. Second, the use of measurement tools in Computer
Science education will help train graduate and undergraduate students with
important skill set and help develop new pedagogical techniques. Third, the
design of transport protocols that scale with technological advancement will
impact the use of the Internet for scientific research and distributed
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
