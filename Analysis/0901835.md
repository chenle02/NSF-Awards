This proposal is concerned with two subjects within the ergodic theory of
nonamenable group actions: entropy and pointwise ergodic theorems. Dynamical
entropy theory began with the work of Kolmogorov (1958) who used it to study
actions of the group of integers. In the seventies and eighties, entropy theory
was extended first to actions of the integer lattice, and then to actions of
amenable groups. Until winter 2007-2008, none of the basic results of entropy
theory had been extended to any non-amenable group. Then, the PI discovered a
generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of
groups is not widely known, but it contains many familiar and interesting
groups, including all amenable groups and all linear groups. This was used to
solve a long-standing open problem: the classication of Bernoulli shifts over a
free group up to measure-conjugacy. After Kolmogorov's initial work, the next
major development was Ornstein's creation of a powerful machine, based on
entropy, for determining whether two given actions of the integers are
measurably-conjugate. This was extended to amenable groups (Ornstein-Weiss) but
no comparable theory exists for nonamenable groups. A major research goal of
this proposal is to fill this gap by taking advantage of the new entropy theory.
In the special case of free group actions, there are close connections to
probabilistic combinatorics (especially random regular graphs) and statistical
physics models that the PI intends to exploit for the benefit of all three
subjects.

The PI plans to hold a workshop at the University of Hawai'i, MAanoa focussed
around classication problems in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. This
workshop will support the intellectual goals of this proposal, disseminate the
most current research ideas in the field and introduce these topics to young
researchers and students. It also provides an excellent opportunity for the
mathematical community to encourage the diverse student population of the
university, especially the native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders. This proposal
provides directly for the training of a graduate student. It should be
particularly easy to attract one because the new entropy theory requires very
little background and provides ample unexplored open problems that could have
signicant impact in ergodic theory and other areas.
