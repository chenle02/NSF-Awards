9500827 Law Ions in solution frequently form electrical double layers at
surfaces which modify the surface phenomena of wetting and adsorption. These
surface effects are important in many physical, chemical, and biological
processes such as lubrication, catalysis, and fluid flow through biological
membranes and porous media. This project will use the techniques of
elllipsometry and neutron reflectometry to study wetting and adsorption in
critical ionic mixtures. These mixtures are known to exhibit either mean field
or Ising behavior in the bulk depending upon the dielectric properties of the
solvent. This bulk behavior is still not understood from a theoretical point of
view. The liquid/liquid and liquid/substrate surface properties of such mixtures
have never been studied before and this project should enhance our understanding
of the complex interaction between bulk and surface ionic processes %%% Ions in
solution frequently adsorb at surfaces and modify the physical characteristics
of the surface. This effect can be important in many physical, chemical, and
biological membrane processes such as lubrication catalysis and fluid flow
through biological membranes and porous media. The adsorption of ions is
determined by the underlying properties of the bulk liquid solution. In this
project, the surface properties of critical ionic mixtures will be studied,
using light reflection and neutron reflection techniques, near the critical
temperature where the bulk properties of these solutions vary rapidly with
temperature. This proposal will enhance our understanding of the complex
interplay between bulk and surface ionic processes. ***
