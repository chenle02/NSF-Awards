9523627 Converse The overall objective of this project is to use new
experimental techniques to study the fall-off in the hydrolysis rate of
cellulose as the hydrolysis proceeds. Two new hypotheses are to be tested to
partially explain this fall-off. One is referred to as the chain-end hypothesis,
where production of excess cellulose chain ends by pretreatment leads to a more
rapid hydrolysis of these ends by cellobiohydrolase (CBH) than formation of new
ends by endogluconase. The other hypothesis is called the tethering hypothesis,
where once adsorbed, CBH has a limited number of cellulose ends available to it,
and becomes inactive until it desorbs and readsorbs at a fresh site. ***
