PROPOSAL NO: AST 0307534 PI: Verne Smith INSTITUTION: University of Texas,
Austin

In this collaborative project with Matthew Shetrone of the University of Texas,
Austin (AST-0306884), Dr. Smith will study the chemical evolution in different
galactic environments by determining the chemical composition of stars in a
number of nearby galaxies. The PIs will obtain high-resolution, high signal-to-
noise spectra of evolved stars in a sample of galaxies that includes dwarf
spheroidals, irregulars, and spirals. Their detailed abundance analysis, using
the latest model atmospheres and up-to-date atomic and molecular data and
spectral analysis codes, will yield abundances of up to 25 elements. Because
these elements are generated in stars of different types and lifetimes, the
trends in relative abundances provide insight into the details of star formation
and the timescales of chemical evolution in a variety of galactic environments.

The work will have significant impact on the understanding of the chemical
evolution of the universe. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be
involved in the research.
