This proposal seeks support for US researchers participation in a
workshop/conference to be held in association with the Third International
Conference on Remote Sensing Archaeology (http://www.spacetimeplace2009.org).
The proposed symposium aims to take stock of the emerging trends in Remote
Sensing and also explore promising new research pathways as related to multi-
diciplinary interaction in emerging topical areas made possible by large scale
geospacial and temporal data stores. The agenda is being designed by the The
Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) (www.ecai.org), a research unit of
International and Area Studies at the University of California, Berkeley . In
the last twelve years, ECAI and other scholarly groups have pursued the
capabilities in remote sensing and digital application in archaeology. Concepts
like space, place, landscape, time and "context" plus technological inputs in
mapping and management of heritage are becoming conceptual frameworks in recent
trends in the field of archaeology and related areas. The study is inherently
international in scope and such conferences as this are integral in moving
scholarship forward.
