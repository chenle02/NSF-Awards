John Ross of the Chemistry Department of Stanford University is funded by the
Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study new approaches to
complex reaction mechanisms. In this research information theoretic methods will
be used to determine the mechanisms of oscillating and possibly chaotic
equations. Genetic algorithms are also proposed for selective inductive
construction of a reaction mechanism by optimization of the fit to experiments.
These techniques will be used to study the role of calcium oscillations in cell
replication (mitosis). This research will improve our understanding on the
mechanism of oscillating reactions and how they affect important biological
processes.
