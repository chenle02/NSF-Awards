The single cells of Phycomyces blakesleeanus have been studied by many
scientists during the past four decades. These large plant cells, which can grow
up to twenty centimeters in length, can detect and respond to many different
environmental and sensory stimuli (such as light, gravity, mechanical
stretching, and wind) with a change in growth rate (which is relatively easy to
measure). Some scientists hope that these studies will provide a better
understanding of how the environmental and sensory stimuli are processed by the
cell (sensory transduction), and how the plant cell regulates its growth rate.
The goal of the present work is to establish equations which describe the growth
rate of these plant cells, so that a more detailed, comprehensive, and
quantitative understanding of growth rate regulation is obtained. These
equations may also provide the framework by which the biochemical events, which
occur in sensory transduction, may be related to the measurable changes in the
growth rate of the plant cell.
