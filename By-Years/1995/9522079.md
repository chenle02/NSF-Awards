9522079 Giguette This award provides support for a comprehensive program that
will make substantial infrastructure changes to the computer science and related
disciplines at Xavier University. The goals of the program are 1) to increase
the number of majors in CISE disciplines by 50%, 2) to increase the number of
CISE majors who go to graduate school by 100%, and 3) to expand the research
activities of all of the CISE students and faculty. These goals will be
addressed by revising and significantly expanding the current summer outreach
programs, expanding the undergraduate research and mentoring programs, and
establishing new teaching and research laboratories. This project builds on the
very successful similar efforts in the health sciences at Xavier. It is
anticipated that comparable results can be achieved in the computing disciplines
as well and that the model developed in this project has the potential to become
a national model for minority student success at other similar institutions. ***
