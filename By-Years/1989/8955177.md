The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) offers a three-year
program to enhance the mathematics and science knowledge base as well as the
teaching strategies of teachers of American Indian students in grades three
through five. As a minority among minorities, American Indians are underserved
in mathematics and science education and thus underrepresented in the science
professions. Effective instructional strategies, responsive to the learning
style and cultural values of Indian students, need to be implemented. This
project will provide a large step toward accomplishing that objective. Twenty
four elementary teachers from eight schools will be selectively recruited from
regions of northern New Mexico and northern Arizona that serve Indian students.
Three elementary teachers per school plus one high school mentor, well trained
in science and/or mathematics, from the same district, will participate, as a
team, in a four-tiered enhancement project which includes a three-week summer
workshop per year, monthly inservice sessions during the academic year at each
of the eight participating schools, a joint two-day Leadership Seminar each
academic year and program staff visits to the classrooms of the participating
teachers to ensure implementation of the curricular material and new teaching
strategies. The workshops are based on a previously successful model which
brings students in during the mornings of weeks two and three. The communities
are committed to the education of its students and are bearing all the costs for
the students' activities. The workshop topics integrate science, mathematics and
writing in a culturally appropriate context. AISES has produced, with NSF
funding, the Hands On, Minds On materials that will be used as the basis for the
science activities. The staff for the project draws heavily on American Indian
scientists, mathematicians and educators, thus providing role models for both
teachers and their students. Cost-sharing from the communities being served is
equivalent to 6% of the NSF request. ***//
