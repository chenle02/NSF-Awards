Dr. Michael Bowers is the Research Coordinator at the University of Virginia's
Blandy Experimental Farm, and he requests support for an upgrade of the Farm's
meteorological station and on-site microcomputers for data processing. Research
at this field station includes old field succession studies, plant physiology,
plant/animal interactions, and ground water hydrology. Improved environmental
data would benefit research in all of these areas. The new weather station would
include automatic data logging equipment that would increase the accuracy and
reliability of the data records. A new microcomputer would increase access to
and analyses of the station's weather data and other environmental databases
(digital maps, annual soil surveys, ground water levels) and records (maps,
aerial photographs, plant specimens in the Arboretum).
