This research will use asymptotic analysis to design efficient numerical
methods for some singularly perturbed convection-reaction-diffusion equations.
The approach allows for asymptotic preconditioning and informed domain
decomposition in problems involving multiple scales. This work should contribute
to improved computational capabilities for problems in chemistry and chemical
engineering. Applications of these equations include reacting fluids with low
viscosity.
