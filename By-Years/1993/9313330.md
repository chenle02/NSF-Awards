9313330 Kota This project introduces a novel class of mechanical systems called
compliant mechanisms for micro applications. Compliant mechanisms are single-
piece flexible structures that deliver the desired motion by undergoing elastic
deformation as opposed to the rigid body motions of conventional mechanisms.
Thus, the principal objective of the project is to explore the possibility of
using compliant mechanisms in the micro realm to meet the atypical design
challenges posed by Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The study of MEMS is
a fast growing area of research that has an immense potential to help accomplish
useful tasks in numerous applications that involve mechanical manipulation at
the micro level. This project addresses the design aspects of such systems. Many
researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of their microfabrication
technologies by building a variety of micromechanical elements. They include
rotary motors, linear actuators and resonators, springs, grippers and gears all
of which are in the size range of few tens of microns to few hundreds of
microns. The limited capabilities of the micromachining techniques give way to
new exigencies in fabrication and design at micro level that are nonexistent in
the macro machinery.
