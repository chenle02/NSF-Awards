Theoretical and experimental efforts aimed at determining both the rate of
adsorption and adsorption isotherms of proteins to gas-liquid interfaces are
outlined. This research will determine the rate of adsorption of a single
protein to a liquid surface and the effects of pH and ionic strength on the
kinetics of this process, measure the equilibrium isotherm for a single protein
to gas-liquid interfaces, and its dependence on pH and ionic strength, describe
the influence of other proteins and biological molecules on the rate of
adsorption and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm for a given protein, and
characterize the relationship between surface tension and the amount of adsorbed
solute at the interface.
