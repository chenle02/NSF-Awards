The proposal is to investigate methods for building self-timed circuit modules
in a gallium arsenide (GaAs) process that are suitable for assembling into
larger systems that also exhibit self- timed behavior. Gallium arsenide holds
great promise for implementing extremely high performance integrated circuits
but this speed also makes system design difficult. Systems designed using these
modules can be faster, more robust, and easier to design than their globally
clocked counterparts. Since self-timed techniques also allow subsystems of
widely varying speeds to work together, such systems may be improved
incrementally by directly replacing slower CMOS parts with faster GaAs parts. As
a first step towards the goal of building fast self-timed GaAs systems a set of
circuit modules are built with the PPL tool suite developed at the University of
Utah. PPL can hide many of the complicated problems with GaAs circuit design and
allow the designer to focus on the functionality of the system. Combined with
the benefits self-timing this should provide an attractive methodology for
designing extremely fast systems and exploring aspects of concurrent systems in
gallium arsenide.
