The major objective of this work is to identify the protein domain that allows
vacuolar proteins to be targeted to the vacuoles of plant cells, and to identify
the receptor(s) with which they interact. The work will concentrate on three
vacuolar proteins present in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seeds,
phytohemagglutinin, phaseolin, and cx-amylase inhibitor and will use two
different transgenic systems, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and tobacco
(Nicotiana tabacum). In addition, we will attempt to transform bean with
Agrobacterium tumefaciens to be in a position to study transport to the vacuole.
The work will utilize translational fusions between portions of these three
proteins and the yeast invertase gene (a secreted protein) to delineate the
targeting domain. Mutagenesis will be used together with computer-based sequence
comparisons to identify the critical residues. Identification of the receptor
will rely on affinity studies (either columns or gel/blot binding procedures)
using the targeting domains of these proteins and solubilized membrane
fractions. Once the receptor has been isolated, we will attempt to clone the
gene and carry out immunocytochemical work to study its subcellular
distribution. This project will provide important basic information relevant to
our understanding of how cellular proteins get to their specific functional
sites within the cell. It will also provide important information concerning how
seed storage proteins get to the sites of storage within the cell, which is of
practical value in terms of genetic engineering of nutritionally "improved"
seeds and grains.
