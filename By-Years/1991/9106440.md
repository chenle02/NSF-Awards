The investigators plan to develop HAILFINDER, a knowledge-based system for
forecasting severe weather in Northeastern Colorado. Until recently most
knowledge-based systems have been based on production rules, frames, or various
non-standard logics. A fourth approach is now emerging which uses hierarchical
Bayesian inference and other related techniques to perform diagnoses, draw
conclusions, answer questions, and produce forecasts. HAILFINDER will be the
first such system designed for a natural science domain. Its purpose will be to
compare the performance of normatively designed knowledge-based systems with
that of rule-based systems and with expert performance. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will collect and provide extensive weather
information and supply the experts for a competition among systems for
forecasting severe weather that it will conduct in the summer of 1992.
HAILFINDER's research team is comprised of four investigators who embody a
variety of skills that are well suited to meeting the needs of this task. The
project has the potential of using the specific weather application to yield
results of substantial scientific significance. Even if only partially
successful, it promises to provide a more solid footing for the use of
probabilistic expert systems as practical tools.
