Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Sepctroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterized specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of
the Illinois State University, to acquire, operate and maintain a high-field NMR
spectrometer. The acquisition of the instrument will enhance the ability of the
Department to prepare undergraduate and graduate students for possible careers
in chemistry and will enhance research in the following areas: 1. studies of
geochemical compounds; 2. studies of the effect of neutrons on electron transfer
reactions; 3. studies of synthetic methods using a one carbon reactant; 4.
studies on organo-metallic compounds.
