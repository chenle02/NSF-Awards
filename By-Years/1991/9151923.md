This project is used in several undergraduate laboratory courses in
metallurgy/materials engineering in experiments providing meaningful data
generation, acquisition and analysis of the thermal properties of polymers,
ceramics and metals. The experiments that the system exposes the students to the
thermodynamic properties of materials in relation to their structure and
properties.
