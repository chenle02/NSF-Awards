Two fundamental phenomenons in probability theory are typical behaviors such as
expected values and laws of large numbers, and rare events such as extremely big
or small values. This research centers on developing Gaussian methods for the
study of both typical behaviors and rare events of the type that positive random
quantities take smaller values. The major objective is to extend the
understanding of related topics and build a general theory based on systematic
study of various techniques and applications. The isoperimetric type Gaussian
inequalities provide comparisons between dependent (complected) structure and
independent (simpler) one which becomes an equality in certain (possibility
limiting) cases. They have been used as basic tools in various problems and
played a crucial role in deeper understanding of random phenomenon. The recent
development of several new techniques for Gaussian and closely related random
processes broadened our understanding of small deviation probabilities and their
connections with related topics of probability such as Gaussian random matrices,
non-intersection exponents and random assignments. In turn, it suggests many
further questions connected to applications in probability theory and geometric
functional analysis. The very successful applications to lower tail
probabilities, the Brownian pursuit models and the first exit times will be
expanded to a detailed study of real zeros of random polynomials and Gaussian
chaos.

This research has a broader impact on diverse areas of probability, which is
both a fundamental way of viewing the world and a core mathematical discipline.
The theory of Gaussian processes is of fundamental importance in probability.
Its development is centered on applications of the existing methods to a variety
of fields and new techniques and problems motivated by current interests of
advancing knowledge. The proposed research is a key step in the investigator's
long term research plan of systematically developing new Gaussian methods geared
for applications to closely related random processes. This research should
improve our understanding of important random events and provide basic tools for
the study of our random environment.
