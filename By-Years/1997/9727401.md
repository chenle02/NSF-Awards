9727401 Kaplan The objective of this project is to gain new insights into the
interactions between the primary sequence of a protein and the influence of the
surrounding environment on protein conformation and self-assembly. The
manipulation of interfacial chemistry, coupled with the control of the primary
sequence of fibrous proteins, may provide new information on the key factors
responsible for the formation of secondary and higher order structures in
proteins. Recent results indicate that the conformation and higher order
structures generated by the fibrous protein, silk fibroin, can be significantly
influenced by the surrounding environment, self-assembling into crystal
structures and oriented textures as well as mesophases, depending on the
environment imposed. The potential implications from this project are
significant in areas of protein patterning, the use of proteins as templates for
secondary nucleation of other proteins or for inorganic materials, and in the
control of macroscopic materials properties such as permeation and other
transport phenomena. ***
