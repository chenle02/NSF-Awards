This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Robert Damrauer at the University of Colorado at Denver, who is investigating
the reactions of organosilicon species. This comparative study of carbon and
silicon compounds will afford a better fundamental understanding of the chemical
properties that allow silicon compounds to be widely used in organic synthesis.
The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Damrauer will focus on two areas.
First, condensed-phase studies of silicon cage compounds and silacyclobutanes
will probe the reactivity of silicon placed in extreme molecular environments.
Second, gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry will be used to prepare and study
silicon anions along with their corresponding neutral species. The latter
studies will be carried out using tandem flowing-afterglow techniques, and they
will afford direct information about thermochemistry, reactivities, and
substituent effects in organosilicon compounds.
