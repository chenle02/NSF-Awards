This project improves the curriculum of the Chemistry Department of Macalester
College through the addition of an instructional component on GC/MS. Within
recent years this technique has become a standard method for analysis and
structure determination-one widely used in graduate school and industrial
laboratories. A number of specific experiments using they are carried out by a
substantial number of students. Advanced training in GC/MS are provided in the
Senior Studies (instrumental analysis) course. In addition, the equipment is
used in the analysis of industrial wastes and biological fluids. The equipment
is also employed in research courses and faculty- student research projects.
This equipment and the associated curricular innovations help insure that the
Macalester Chemistry students are fully qualified to employ the powerful
technique in their scientific careers. The institution is matching the NSF grant
with an equal amount of funds.
