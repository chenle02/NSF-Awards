This award to the American Physical Society supports the Conferences for
Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP), held annually since 2006. The
conferences have two overarching goals: 1) to give undergraduate women the
resources, motivation, and confidence to apply to graduate school and to
successfully complete a Ph.D. in physics or a related discipline; and 2) to
increase awareness by undergraduate women in physics of the wide range of career
opportunities available to them. Regional conferences are held simultaneously to
maximize student attendance by minimizing travel, to increase the excitement of
the participants in a joint national venture, and to allow the interactive
simulcast of a keynote address.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project looks to
evaluate self-efficacy beliefs, physics identity and outcome expectations of the
participants. Through this research and the project evaluation, there is
potential to gain new knowledge about the issues facing undergraduate women in
physics, as well as how effective activities like these are. The project will
advance our understanding of factors that impact the ability of female students
to pursue undergraduate degrees in physics and have a positive impact on a
population that remains underrepresented in physics.
