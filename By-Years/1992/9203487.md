Design is the key technology for industries that wish to increase their
competitive advantage in the international marketplace. This advantage comes
from the ability to identify customer demands and quickly translate these into
new products. The application of methodologies which can shorten the lead-time
in product development and be applied as a general tool for design in many
fields will be essential for the future competitiveness of the United States
industry. The purpose of the workshop is to explore how the axiomatic approach
to design can be applied to satisfy the industrial needs and be further
developed to provide the fundamental basis for design. The workshop will examine
the design needs and problem in the areas of product and process design,
software design and organizational design. The needs of the industry will be
examined in terms of fundamental design methodologies. The constraints and
requirements imposed by industrial practice to the automotive, construction,
material, electronic and software industries will be discussed.***//
