A Symposium is to be held at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, on the
subject of Radiative Corrections to the Standard Model. Attendance will be drawn
from the worldwide community of expert experimental and theoretical
practitioners as well as graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The
Symposium will be 4-1/2 days in duration, with a format of half- hour long
invited talks. Topics to be covered include those of near-term interest, physics
at the Z for example, and future concerns to be addressed at LHC (formerly at
SSC). Attendance is planned for about 150 participants, by invitation only.
