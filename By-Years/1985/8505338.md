The nation's highway pavements are deteriorating at a fast rate and techniques
are needed to assist engineers in developing rehabilitation strategies. This
project will develop an automated computer program which will systematically
formalize the process by which pavement engineers interpret limited and
uncertain data concerning the condition of the pavement for resurfacing,
restoration, rehabilitation, and/or replacement. The results will be beneficial
to Federal, state, and county engineers who are responsible for the condition of
the highway pavements.
