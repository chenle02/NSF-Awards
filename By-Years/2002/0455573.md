With prior NSF support, an inquiry-oriented science content course was developed
for use in a teacher-training program at Northeastern State University. The
current proposal seeks to assess the effectiveness of this course by examining
the use of inquiry strategies by teachers who graduated before and after the
couse was redesigned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study the
effectiveness of science courses reformed to include inquiry strategies, and the
impact of school context on teaching practice. The purpose is to document the
knowledge and skills of Expert Teachers who effectively use inquiry-based
instruction. This research will compare the effectiveness of in-service teachers
who have taken the reformed science content course to teachers who took the non-
reformed course in earlier years. Both groups will be compared to selected
expert teachers.
