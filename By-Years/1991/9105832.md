This research examines the problem of maximizing the total information transfer
when data are transmitted through a series of noisy channels. This is a common
situation in communication networks. The key information-theoretic fact is that
the overall capacity is strongly dependent on the order in which the individual
channels are arranged. A number of interesting and tractable problems are
formulated and investigated; some counter-intuitive results are suggested and
will be evaluated.
