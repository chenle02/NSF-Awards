Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty-two academically talented
low-income students majoring in computer science or mathematics fields are
receiving scholarships enabling them to complete the degree requirements in a
timely fashion. In addition to the scholarships they receive enhanced faculty
mentoring, increased availability of no cost tutoring, cooperative study groups,
and monthly gatherings combining discipline and social activities. Limited funds
are also available to support student attendance at professional meetings for
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
