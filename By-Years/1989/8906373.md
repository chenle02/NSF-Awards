This award will allow acquisition of a chemical vapor deposition system for use
in low temperature deposition of thin coatings of refractory metal carbide and
nitride films. The friction and wear behavior of these films, as well as their
resistance to particle erosion, will be studied as functions of deposition
parameters and film composition.
