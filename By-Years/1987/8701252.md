The synthesis of complex molecules found in natural systems places increasing
demands on the synthetic organic chemist. The transition metals offer the fine
chemical control needed for the development of new methods for a range of
molecules found in medicine and agriculture. The overall objective of this grant
in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is to develop new synthetic
methods using transition metal complexes to permit new modes of reactivity for
organic functional groups. This will be achieved by careful study of the
fundamental chemistry of the metal- organic species involved, to permit the
development of useful, new synthetic transformations. The newly developed
processes will be applied to the synthesis of complex molecules when possible.
The scientific significance of the proposed research is that new chemical
transformations of general use for organic synthesis will be developed, that new
organic compounds with interesting physical, biological, and chemical properties
will be produced. Thus beta-lactams will be synthesized by Pd(II) assisted
aminocarbonylatin of olefins or vinyl carbamates. A variety of carbocyclic
systems - including medium sized fused bicyclic systems will be synthesized from
simple diene starting materials by an unusual "1,3" cycloaddition of
electrophilic olefins and alkynes to pi-allylpalladium complexes followed by
reductive elimination. A newly discovered photogeneration of aminoketenes and
enaminoketenes from Group (VI) metal carbene complexes will be developed to
provide an array of unusual organic compounds, including unnatural alpha-amino
acids and peptides containing unnatural amino acids. These unusual metal-bound
ketenes are expected to have broad utility in organic synthesis. Finally, new,
practical, synthetic approaches to organometallic carbene and nitrene complexes
will be developed and their utility in organic synthesis will be assessed.
