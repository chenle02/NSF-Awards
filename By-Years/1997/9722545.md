9722545 Sohn This award supports a two-year collaborative research project
between Dr. Andrew Sohn of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Dr.
Dongseung Kim of Korea University in Seoul, Korea on "Modeling and Analyzing
Communication Behavior of Parallel Programs on Distributed-Memory
Multiprocessors." The objective of the project are to 1) model the capabilities
of hardware and software for overlapping communication with computation, and 2)
compare the overlapping capabilities of distributed-memory multiprocessors on
selected benchmark problems. Distributed-memory multiprocessors are known to
have the architecture needed for increasing the machine's capability by simply
adding more processor to the system. Programming distributed-memory machines,
however, is often difficult due to many practical issues including algorithm
design, data distribution, and workload distribution. When a large number of
processors work together to solve a single problem, communication between
processors becomes key to determining the performance of large scale distributed
memory machines. This project will combine the expertise and facilities of the
U.S. and Korea research groups in addressing this important problem in computer
science. ***
