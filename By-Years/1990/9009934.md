This proposal is to develop a novel approach to the eventual design of a hand
prosthesis. The PIs will first develop a formal model of grasping behavior based
upon experiments on humans. They will then formulate a minimal set of control
inputs that is necessary to control grasping movements. Finally, both neural
network and knowledge-based approaches will be investigated as possible methods
of implementing intelligent control mechanisms for an already developed hand
prosthesis. The proposed work should lead to better ways of controlling
artificial hands; it also may have an impact on the design of robotic
manipulators.
