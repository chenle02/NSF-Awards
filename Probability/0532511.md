The 3rd Northeast Probability Seminar will be held on November 17-18, 2005 in
New York City at the Courant Institute of the New York University. This
conference intends to draw researchers and graduate students in the Northeast
and provide a forum for young investigators to interact sceintifically with
specialists. The sicentific emphasis will be on Brownian motion, local times,
Markov chains and processes, random structures and algorithms, random fields,
isoperimetric inequalities, large deviations, and stochastic analysis.
