This award is the first step in assisting Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) with
the establishment of a Materials Science department. Funds have been requested
to renovate Doherty Hall, into a Materials Research Facility for the TAMU
Materials Science and Engineering Program which will be devoted to research and
graduate instruction. Currently, the materials program is centered around
ongoing interdisciplinary research involving seven departments and six divisions
in which there is no laboratory space on TAMU's campus designed specifically for
collaborative projects. Renovations to Doherty Hall will provide centralized
facilities which will include four materials characterization laboratories, a
Physical Electron Microscopy Center, a Surface Science facility, a X-ray
diffraction laboratory and an Analytical Characterization laboratory. The
renovated facility will provide space for new instrumentation in each of the
laboratories and will house the components of the Polymers Program for
Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, and components from
the Advanced Electronics Program, including crystal growth, ion implantation and
electron beam lithography. This facility will provide state-of-the-art materials
research laboratories, encouraging interdisciplinary interactions between
scientists and engineers and provide new research opportunities for students.
