The objective of this program is to achieve strength and reliability
improvements in structural ceramics through ion implantation. The approach is to
produce precipitable phases by high dose ion implantation and subsequent
annealing. The strength increase is expected from the localized volume expansion
of the implanted region due to the presence of these precipitates resulting in
the generation of compressive surface stresses. If thermodynamically stable
precipitates are formed, then a temperature independent increase in strength and
reliability is expected. If the precipitate phase is harder than the matrix, a
surface hardening should result. In Phase I, it is proposed to co-implant
silicon and carbon, and titanium and carbon into silicon nitride to study the
formation of silicon carbide and titanium carbide precipitates. Characterization
is performed by using transmission electron microscopy. Four-point-bend testing
provides strength and reliability data.
