This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak
and&lt;br/&gt;strong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and
nucleons&lt;br/&gt;(particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their interactions
at low&lt;br/&gt;energies. The strong and weak interactions are responsible for
the&lt;br/&gt;structure of matter at the smallest known scale, a femtometer or
less. &lt;br/&gt;The research is motivated by the fact that the present
comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;theory--the Standard Model (SM)--is known to be
incomplete. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the SM becomes unworkable for strong
interactions at low&lt;br/&gt;energies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rare beta decay
of the pi-meson (pion), occurring once in about 100&lt;br/&gt;million ordinary
pion decays, provides a theoretically clean window to&lt;br/&gt;certain possible
extensions of the SM. The PIBETA&lt;br/&gt;experiment, mounted at the Paul
Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an&lt;br/&gt;international collaboration of
seven institutions led by the University&lt;br/&gt;of Virginia (UVa) group, has
already improved the accuracy of the pion&lt;br/&gt;beta decay rate five-fold,
from 4% to 0.8% in a series of measurements&lt;br/&gt;from 1999 through 2001.
Further improvement in precision, down to about&lt;br/&gt;0.5%, is forthcoming
in the next year or two through improved data&lt;br/&gt;analysis. All other rare
decay channels of the pion and the muon have&lt;br/&gt;been similarly improved
in precision. An important anomaly was&lt;br/&gt;discovered in our pion
radiative decay data, prompting a new, dedicated&lt;br/&gt;measurement of this
decay in 2004. After that, we plan to design a new&lt;br/&gt;precise measurement
of the Pi -&gt; e nu decay, a process of profound&lt;br/&gt;significance in
determining whether or not nature treats the familiar&lt;br/&gt;electron and its
more massive cousin, the muon, in precisely the same&lt;br/&gt;way. Even a small
departure would signal new physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past five
years this program has resulted in two doctoral&lt;br/&gt;degrees at UVa plus
three more at collaborating universities stemming&lt;br/&gt;from the PIBETA
project alone. Four more UVa Ph.D. degrees are expected&lt;br/&gt;in the next
two years. Each year typically one to two undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students are
engaged in research on this project, thus gaining practical&lt;br/&gt;laboratory
experience.&lt;br/&gt;
