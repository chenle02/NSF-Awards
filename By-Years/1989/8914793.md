This XII International Conference on Particles and Nuclei will be hosted by the
MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science and the MIT/Bates Linear Accelerator Center.
The conference goal is to share a wide range of interdisciplinary information
and knowledge in particle and nuclear physics. The conference scientific topics
range from tests of QCD, to extreme states of nuclear matter, to electromagnetic
interactions, to tests of fundamental symmetries, to cosmology, and to a
description of new facilities. The scale of the meeting is such that 600-1000
attendees are expected. The conference will be held at MIT, in Cambridge, MA,
from June 25-29, 1989.
