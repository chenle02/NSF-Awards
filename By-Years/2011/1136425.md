The Robert Noyce/ Mathematics and Science Teacher Institute (MSTI) at Xavier
University of Louisiana goals are to: (1) educate and train Master Teacher
Fellows (MTF) to achieve National Board for Professional Teaching Certification
in mathematics or science and (2) introduce Teacher Fellows (TF) to the field of
mathematics /science education and support their efforts in the high-needs
school districts in New Orleans area. Partners include New Orleans Parish School
Districts, ExxonMobil Foundation, the local Audubon Zoo and Aquarium, National
Science Teachers Association' and National Mathematics Teachers Association.

MSTI is recruiting and supporting 10 STEM professionals and/or recent STEM
graduates as Teacher Fellows to enroll in the MAT Program and receive licensure
and recruiting a cohort of 10 Master Teaching Fellows to participate in
professional development seminars with the collaborative partners.

Intellectual Merit: Noyce/MSTI is increasing the pool of STEM teachers in New
Orleans by working with the collaborative partners to provide training and
support and giving direct, supervised, organized teaching experiences to both TF
and MTF cohorts.

Broader Impact: This proposal is increasing the number of STEM teachers in the
high-need New Orleans area.
