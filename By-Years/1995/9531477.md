Abstract IBN 95-31477 This action funds a research starter grant to a former NSF
Minority Postdoctoral Fellow. The research supported here continues a molecular
and genetic analysis of root-hair development in the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. Two root hair defective mutants are being analyzed to determine if
they have impaired membrane transport properties. Preliminary results suggest
that the mutations may be in genes of the Tonoplast Instrinsic Protein family.
If so, they could be useful tools in the study of differentiation and cell
growth in this important plant model system.
