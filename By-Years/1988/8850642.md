This project will develop and implement an exemplary secondary school science
teacher preparation program which features inquiry-oriented, interdisciplinary
science. The instructional practices to be introduced into the new and newly
modified courses will stem from the research on cognitive structure and
conceptual change. Three new courses will be included in that program: a three
credit upper-division inquiry based interdisciplinary Science/Technology/Society
course required of all liberal arts majors and all prospective science teachers;
a one credit seminar in cognitive structure and teaching practices which foster
conceptual change; and a nine credit teaching practicum, which will involve
preservice teachers in planning, conducting, and evaluating selected model
lessons and inquiry laboratories. The teaching practicum course development team
will include four high school science teachers. Thus the project will be a
collaborative venture between the Colleges of Education and Science at Utah
State University and secondary school science teachers from selected school
districts. The cost sharing for the project will be 30 percent of the NSF
portion.
