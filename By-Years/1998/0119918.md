The Oklahoma Teacher Education Collaborative (O-TEC) has developed a systemic
approach to the recruitment, training, and retention of science and mathematics
teachers in Oklahoma. In this follow-on project, a long term summative
evaluation is being conducted that is 1) documenting the effectiveness of the
original grant activities, and 2) contributing to the CORE evaluation project
that is serving all projects funded in the NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in
Teacher Preparation Program. The evaluation is guided by the CORE research
questions and use instruments and protocols developed by that project. As
triangulation, the evaluation is employing several tests and measures specific
to Oklahoma students that have been part of previous evaluations and are closely
associated with educational advancement and curriculum reform. Four higher
education institutions will sevre as evaluation sites to facilitate data
collection.&lt;br/&gt;
