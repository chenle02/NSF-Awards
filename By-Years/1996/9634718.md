9634718 McMahon It is proposed to carry out an experimental study of the
mechanisms of diffusion-controlled intergranular brittle fracture in model iron-
and copper-based alloys using bicrystals with symmetrical tilt boundaries.
Previous research has been carried out on polycrystalline materials, and these
suffer from limitations that preclude a quantitative test of the model proposed
for this phenomenon, which we believe is a unique and generic form of brittle
fracture. The reasons for using bicrystals are the following: First, the
cracking rate should be proportional to the grain-boundary diffusivity of the
embrittling element (which is hypothesized to diffuse in from a free surface
under the influence of an applied stress, as in diffusion creep). In a bicrystal
the diffusivity can be held constant in a given direction, and the diffusion
direction can be varied so as to obtain a fixed and measurable ratio of
diffusivities, and therefore crack-growth rates. Second, the fractured bicrystal
will present a large flat fracture surface on which high-resolution scanning
electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy measurements can be made of the
intervals of cracking in what is likely a step- wise process. Third, the crack-
tip stress field should be constant along the crack tip and along the crack
path, at least in the central portion of the specimen; it is this stress field
that is postulated to drive the diffusion and therefore the crack extension by
decohesion. %%% These research will establish in a fundamental way the
mechanisms of diffusion-controlled intergranular brittle fracture, which could
be a common, but unrecognized form of failure in engineering materials. ***
