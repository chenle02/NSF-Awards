This is a study of the "ligand effect" in bimetallic catalysts. This is the
influence of the local (atomic) environment on the behavior of a catalytic atom.
It is difficult to study because of other effects which might occur to mask it
and because determination of atomic environments in alloys stretches the limits
of surface analysis. As part of this work, a new technqiue for determining such
environments will be developed using small-angle x-ray scattering from a
synchrotron source.
