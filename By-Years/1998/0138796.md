The Delaware Science Coalition is a systemic partnership consisting of higher
education, businesses, the Delaware Department of Education (DOE) and local
districts. With this proposal they are continuing their collaboration to expand
their prior K-8 efforts into high schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilot
proposal will initially be limited to a focus on improving the science program
in the 9th and 10th grades. Ten schools (45 teachers) representing the statewide
range of geographic distribution, demographic characteristics and size of
student body will be active participants in the process of developing models of
successful classroom practice. These schools will be charged with the
responsibility of designing an educational system that recognizes their
particular characteristics and needs. Common features of models for the
selection of instructional materials and teacher professional development are
anticipated and lessons learned from this pilot will serve to scale up the
project to inform the future development of a comprehensive statewide
LSC.&lt;br/&gt;
