This research involves the development of a feedback design methodology for
nonlinear systems, based on a nonlinear enhancement of classical root-locus
theory. This proposed nonlinear "frequency domain" methodology, for example, is
capable of designing, in a systematic way, stabilizing "lead-lag" compensators,
nonlinear PD controllers for set-point control, feedback strategies for
disturbance decoupling with closed-loop stability or perhaps even asymptotic
tracking and disturbance rejection for a broad class of nonlinear systems, based
on nonlinear analogues of classical control concepts such as relative degree or
nonlinear "minimum phase" properties. This methodology has been successfully
employed for stabilization in the large of scalar, affine (in the control)
"minimum phase" nonlinear systems under certain regularity conditions. However,
many applications of interest are multivariable, sometimes not affine, and very
often have singularities. This work will systematically develop and extend this
design methodology so as to include such systems, drawing where necessary on
techniques in geometric control, dynamical systems and classical control.
