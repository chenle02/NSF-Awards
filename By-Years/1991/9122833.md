A series of experiments will be conducted to investigate the apparent
suppressive effect of incorporated crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.)
residue on the growth of lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) in a corn (Zea
mays L.) cropping system. Measurements of above and below ground plant parts
will document specific effects of a crimson clover nitrogen source on the
growth, development, and nitrogen uptake of sweet corn and lambsquarters, grown
in pure and mixed cultures. Companion growth chamber and field studies will
examine emergence and time to emergence of both species under a regime of
clover-derived nitrogen. Is low nitrogen availability responsible for previously
observed suppressive effects on emergence? A field study will test for
interactive effects of crimson clover residue and ammonium nitrate addition on
lambsquarters growth and nitrogen uptake after emergence. The results of these
studies will aid in the effective management of legumes in cropping systems and
provide insight on how temporal availability of resources affects patterns of
consumption and growth and, ultimately, outcomes of competitive interactions
between plants.
