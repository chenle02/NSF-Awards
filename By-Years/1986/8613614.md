This project focuses modern developments in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
on the problems of predicting and interpreting transport properties (such as
viscosity, diffusion coefficients, and thermal conductivity) of molecular fluids
and their mixtures. The aim of the research is to apply these algorithms to
fluids of engineering interest (such as water, methane, carbon dioxide, and
liquid metals) as well as non-ideal model mixtures (polar-polar and polar-
nonpolar) to probe the capability of pair potential models developed for
thermodynamic properties to predict transport properties accurately and to
develop a deeper fundamental understanding of transport phenomena in such
fluids.
