This project focuses on systems that allow one weak light pulse to control
another weak light pulse. The motivation for these systems ranges from practical
applications (such as low-power "switches" that route light pulses through
optical communication networks), to fundamental issues in quantum physics. The
experimental research is based on a promising new platform comprised of small-
scale devices (waveguides) that steer tiny beams of light through atomic vapors.
The knowledge created from this research will impact a number of different areas
in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and the project centers on training
the next generation of scientists through extensive graduate and undergraduate
student involvement in the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific systems
being pursued involve the use of sub-wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers
surrounded by atomic vapors, and small hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers
filled with atomic vapors. In both cases, strong nonlinearities are enabled by
waveguiding a tightly confined optical mode over a long distance through the
atomic medium. The use of metastable xenon (an inert noble gas) as the atomic
vapor overcomes major limitations imposed by the earlier use of rubidium (a
reactive alkali atom). The enhanced nonlinearities in these xenon-based
waveguide systems will allow the realization of new types of research on quantum
entanglement and non-classical state generation.
