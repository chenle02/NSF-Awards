Star formation and the evolution of recently formed stars toward the main
sequence (i.e., stars characterized by core hydrogen burning) is an area of
great current interest in astronomy. Particular topics of star formation are the
study of young clusters of stars, the frequency of occurrence of binary systems
among recently formed stars, the existence of accretion disks during the star
forming process, and the cause and nature of eruptions of T Tauri stars (which
are pre-main sequence stars). The Principal Investigator, who has a long and
distinguished history in the study of star formation, proposes to address these
issues in his research.
