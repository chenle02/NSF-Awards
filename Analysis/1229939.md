In many natural topological and geometric problems, one is led to study spaces
that are very badly behaved from a classical point of view, such as the space of
unitary representations of an infinite, non-abelian discrete group. Such spaces
are quite often described well by noncommutative operator algebras: in
particular, the Baum-Connes and coarse Baum-Connes conjectures predict that a
good connection between the classical and noncommutative worlds is provided by
higher index theory. These conjectures have many applications to geometry and
topology, such as to the Novikov conjecture, and to the existence of positive
scalar curvature metrics. It has recently become apparent, however, that coarse
geometric properties associated to certain quotients of discrete groups and
expanding graphs are obstructions to these conjectures: the investigator intends
a systematic investigation of the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties
associated to these obstructions, and the phenomena thus allowed to exist. He
also intends to apply realted ideas of coarse geometry and noncommuative
geometry to prove classical index theorems associated to elliptic operators on
symmetric spaces (with suitable boundary conditions).

Many natural spaces occurring in geometry have very bad properties from the
point of view of classical mathematics. Inspired by quantum mechanics, one tries
to describe these spaces using noncommutative mathematical structures - here
'noncommutative' means that the order in which one performs operations matters.
If such a 'noncommutative description' is accurate in some precise sense, then a
great deal of information about geometric spaces becomes available. It is known,
however, that aspects of these descriptions fail for spaces called expanding
graphs - for essentially the same reasons that make expanding graphs useful in
computer science and the theory of networks. The investigator plans both to
study, and to use, 'noncommutative descriptions' in borderline cases,
particularly for spaces related to expanding graphs and the discrete groups that
can be used to construct them. A better understanding of exotic properties of
discrete groups, and thus of their connections to other areas of mathematics and
computer science, is also a central goal.
