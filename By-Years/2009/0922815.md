This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Eriks
Rozners and colleagues Susan Bane, Wayne E. Jones, Changhong Ke and Omowunmi
Sadik from SUNY-Binghamton will acquire a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer to support
chemical research of the major users which includes: 1) studies of DNA and RNA
analogues; 2) studies of flexible polyamic acid-silicone copolymers; 3)
investigations of DNA/RNA-carbon nanotube hybrid structures; 4) the electron-
and energy-transfer dynamics in hybrid metal organic polymers; 5) the structures
and mechanisms of action of microtubule effectors; and 6) the study of advanced
materials for lithium batteries. The instrumentation will also be used by
additional researchers at SUNY Binghamton in the departments of biology,
chemistry and geology as well as by researchers at neighboring academic
institutions (Hartwick, Marist and Sage Colleges) and a researcher at a local
company (Endicott Interconnect Technologies).

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and
biochemistry.
