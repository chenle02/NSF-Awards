This award will provide Phase I SBIR funding for demonstration of the
feasibility of speech recognition on a VLSI neurocomputer. The speech
recognition system will perform speaker-independent recognition of spoken
English letters. The current implementation of the system, now running in the
context of a directory assistance application on a Sun4 workstation, classifies
isolated letters of the English alphabet at 96% accuracy - the best reported
performance of any system on this difficult task. The high level of accuracy is
obtained by training neural networks to make the important classification
decisions at each level of the system. Neural networks are used to track pitch,
to locate speech boundaries, and to classify letters. The goal of the Phase I
research is to implement a complete recognition system in which neural network
classification is performed in real time on the Adaptive Solutions board. The
research consists of: (a) experiments needed to modify the current recognition
system to meet the computational requirements of the board; (b) implementing the
classification modules on the neurocomputer; and (c) training the neural
classifiers.***
