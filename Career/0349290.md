The program of studying discrete groups via the quasi-isometric geometry of
their Cayley graphs was suggested by Gromov in his address at the 1982
International Congress of Mathematicians. This program has two complementary
parts: finding invariants to show that different groups are not quasi-isometric,
and constructing quasi-isometries to show that similar groups are quasi-
isometric. The PI has made several contributions to this program in the past,
including a recent proof of quasi-isometric rigidity for the group of integral
affine transformations and the group of automorphisms of a surface group (the
latter in joint work with Lee Mosher). The PI proposes significant extensions of
these results in the context of the development of the subject of large scale
dynamics. In addition to rigidity phenomena, the proposed research includes a
detailed study of less rigid groups, which should help to clarify questions
about quasi-isometric invariance of many algebraic and combinatorial properties
of groups.

Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is the study of geometric
properties of objects "seen from far away". From this perspective, any bounded
object is indistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is
indistinguishable from a solid line. This sort of geometry has been influential
recently in many areas of mathematics, notably group theory, topology, and
geometric analysis. This research will explore the large scale geometry of
several classes of mathematical objects, both classical geometric spaces and
objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner. There has been a tremendous
amount of interest in this area of study recently, with many of the experts in
the field located at one of the universities in the Chicago area. The proposal
includes a variety of programs to develop interaction between mathematicians,
and especially their graduate students, within this community.
