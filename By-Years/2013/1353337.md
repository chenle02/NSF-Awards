This award provides funding for a workshop to bring together thought leaders
from a variety of disciplines to outline an agenda for scientific and
engineering research in service innovation. Solving service problems has
enormous practical consequences for the economy and society because (a) more
than 80% of jobs in the US are in the service sector, with most Science
Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates working in service; (b)
many complex service problems resist traditional optimization solutions; and (c)
private investment in service research is low because of low margins in non-
technology-intensive service businesses, and the US lags in public investment
behind countries such as Japan, China, Finland, and Germany. Simply put, the
search for service innovation requires new theories and new methods to address
problems unique to services, and what little students are being taught about the
service sector has not kept up with the rapid growth of STEM jobs in service or
with modern entrepreneurial opportunities. Effective understanding of complex
services and innovation in services requires a new approach that combines
multiple methods, for example, drawing from industrial engineering and
operations research, social and behavioral sciences, information systems, and
computer science and computational modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, this workshop will develop a roadmap for future service research and
education for NSF and industry partners by (a) laying out the societal context
for service research, (b) identifying technology needs and knowledge gaps for
service innovation, and (c) developing basic science and engineering questions
to be addressed to satisfy the needs and fill the gaps. Anticipated outcomes
also include new collaborations and increased capacity in the research community
for advancing interdisciplinary studies of service. In addition, some focus on
education in service from science, technology, engineering, and math fields are
expected to result in plans for cross-disciplinary, cross-institution programs.
