This work will develop an expert system for assisting and controlling high
resolution diode laser spectroscopic measurements, integrating data acquisition,
numeric processing and graphics capability of a laboratory micro-computer to
provide rapid feedback to a spectroscopist on experimental conditions.
Successful extensions of this work will accelerate the transfer of newly
developed measurement technologies from research laboratories to industry.
