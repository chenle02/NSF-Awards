This project will conduct research on the development of students' conceptions
of exponential functions. These Principal Investigators have selected
exponential functions, a particularly rich and useful set of concepts, because
of its propensity for misconceptions and its widespread and significant,
applications in mathematics, the sciences and engineering. Through, the use of
clinical interviews and the teaching experiment, these investigators will
examine students' conceptions, the relationships between their informal and
formal knowledge, their interjections and use of concepts across a variety of
contexts and the development of metacognitive strategies in the application of
these concepts. The project will explore the design and use of a multi-
representatival (Laser Disc) instructional systems, to explore options for using
its vast memory storage for tracking student problem-solving strategies and
student control of instruction. Thus, these investigators hope to significantly
advance our understanding of the development of student concepts and create a
prototype unit in exponential functions for a precalculus course for high school
and college students.
