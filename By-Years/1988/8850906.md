The objective of this project is to provide educational policy makers with a
consensus of the views of working scientists, engineers and educators on topics
and issues that should be addressed in charting a national effort to improve the
nature and quality of undergraduate science, engineering and mathematics
education. A principal element of this effort is a report prepared by a National
Advisory Group that includes representatives of Sigma Xi chapters and clubs. The
grantee is obtaining funds from other sources for this project that are greater
than the funds provided by the NSF award.
