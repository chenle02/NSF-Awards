The project focuses on sensing, and proposes to develop new ways for fast shape
and appearance sensing, 3D tracking, recognition, and compression. The sensing
approach proposed is based on dynamic active triangulation, with structured
light illumination swept across the scene., allowing 100-200 range maps per
second.
