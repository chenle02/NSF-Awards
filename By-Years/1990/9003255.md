The research concerns the topic of multivariate statistical distributions with
given marginals. Frechet bounds for the distribution functions will be improved
through the imposition of additional constraints such as a specific value for
the correlation or the requirement that the joint distributions have symmetry or
unimodality. Various orderings and measures for the distributions will be
studied and, in particular, alternative orderings to invariance under strictly
increasing marginal transformations. The suitability of approximations to
complicated multivariate distributions by relatively tractable multivariate
distributions will be examined. Some of the methods of extending univariate
distributions to higher dimensions that will be studied are independent bases,
characterizations, sampling from Bernoulli or Urn models, shock models and
mixtures.
