Somasundaran 9316228 SGER: Polymer/Surfactant and Protein/Lipid Interactions at
Aqueous Interfaces This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) applies
recently developed methods in air/water surface micromanometry to obtain the
thermodynamic parameters for selected polymers and proteins referenced to near-
ideal monolayer states at very low surface pressures and densities. These
experiments should lead to the entropies and other thermodynamic functions for
dense non-ideal conditions. The exploratory results will be used to adapt the
surface micromanometry method to the measurement of interactions of polymers and
proteins with surfactants. The results are expected to give information on
polymer confirmations and the energetics of polymer-amphiphiles complexes at the
fluid interfaces and to assist progress in several technologies, including the
preparation of molecular assemblies on the nano scale, characterization and use
of chiral complexes, aspects of the mechanisms of drug action related to
membranes, wettability and foam and emulsion control. The grant provides for the
transfer of equipment from British Petroleum ***
