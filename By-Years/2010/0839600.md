This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project is to develop,
fabricate, and characterize a new type of cost effective high performance
vibration energy harvester. The use of piezoelectric benders for vibration
energy harvesters has been limited due to their low energy output, high
vibrational frequency requirement, and narrow frequency bandwidth. Several
configurations of these energy harvesters will be fabricated that are predicted
to offer up to 1.45 times higher voltage and up to 9.6 times higher current
output capability over conventional monolithic and composite energy harvesters.
In addition, these new harvesters offer up to 5 times lower resonance frequency
and up to 10 times wider bandwidth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
harvesters are projected to satisfy the powering requirements for ubiquitously
deployed transportation and industrial sensor networks and mobile electronics,
eliminating the need for battery recharging, replacement, and disposal. For
wireless sensor networks, the proposed energy harvester will eliminate power
consumption from the mains power, data cable and power cable installation and
maintenance, and battery cost, replacement, and disposal. In addition, sensor
data can be used to facilitate structural health monitoring and condition based
maintenance of transportation infrastructure, power generation structures, and
air, water, and ground transportation vehicles, which can result in multi-
billion dollar savings by avoiding catastrophic failures, eliminating
unnecessary scheduled maintenance, and reducing maintenance costs.&lt;br/&gt;
