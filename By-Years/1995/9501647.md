Dr. Richard D. Broene, Chemistry Department, Bowdoin College, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Advancement Award for research
into the synthesis of chiral cyclopentadienyl complexes of lanthanide metals and
for restructuring Bowdoin College's chemistry laboratory courses in order to
provide cross-boundary training for chemistry students. The research
concentrates on a series of C-2 symmetric lanthanocene complexes, which will be
prepared by selectively varying the substituents on tethered cyclopentadiene
ligands. The ability of these compound to stereoselectively catalyze
cyclizations and polymerizations of ketimine-olefin substrates will be
evaluated. Within the educational portion of the project the introductory
organic chemistry laboratory will be redesigned and a junior level comprehensive
laboratory will be instituted in order to incorporate more active student
participation and to provide students with a more realistic outlook on modern
chemistry. An outreach program will be instituted in order to develop an
interest in chemistry among precollege students. A goal in modern industrial and
laboratory chemistry is the design of compounds which will effect very
efficient, very specific chemical transformations. In this project a new series
of complexes will be prepared. The shape of these compounds will be carefully
designed so that they will induce the coupling or polymerization of small
organic molecules in a fashion where one possible `mirror image` product is
formed to the exclusion of the other. The educational portion of the project
aims at providing a more realistic and visual introduction to various chemical
concepts at the precollege, the lower, and the upper undergraduate levels.
