The Mathematics Department is committed to increasing the use of new and modern
technology in the classroom and curriculum. The introduction of mandatory
mathematics laboratories as an integral part of selected courses is viewed as
one significant way to increase the success and retention rate of developmental
mathematics students. The purpose of this project is to integrate a graphical,
numerical, and analytical approach in teaching selected developmental
mathematics courses taught at the college. For this purpose, the project's
specific objectives are to adapt and synthesize methods from other successful
reform efforts in teaching of developmental mathematics; modify these methods to
meet the needs of a diverse student population; and utilize various commercial
and locally available or developed software to support the delivery of
mathematics instruction. This project secures the necessary laboratory equipment
to expand and modernize the old laboratory so as to permit the incorporation of
mandatory mathematics laboratories into the Basic Mathematics course and the
Introduction to Algebra and Geometry course; provides faculty development
activities to all instructors and laboratory assistants on the use of the new
equipment, software, and instructional methods; provides additional mathematics
instruction (an added 2 laboratory hours per week), in a laboratory environment,
for our students which emphasizes graphical and numerical techniques, as well as
more traditional methods. With this project, the number of computers in the
mathematics laboratory increases from 24 workstations to 78 workstations
connected to a network supported by three servers. The expanded laboratory has
the capacity to support approximately 1,300 students who enroll in these two
developmental courses each semester, and is available to another 3,000 enrolled
in other mathematics courses.
