The goal of this workshop is to explore the new emerging view that the mind
must be viewed in its social and physical context. In this view, the processes
and representations of the internal cognitive system are tightly coupled with
processes and representations in the external world. In other words, cognition
is not about the mind in isolation, but the mind tightly coupled with the
external world that consists of the natural environment, designed artifacts, the
social environment, the organizational environment, and the cultural
environment. The workshop will convene representatives of a number of specific
lines of work that converge on this view, including situated action, distributed
cognition, cultural psychology, everyday cognition, activity views of the mind,
the study of errors, and studies of applications like human-computer interaction
and computer-supported cooperative work. Such disciplines as artificial
intelligence, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy are all
active in these debates. The outcome will include a report for the National
Science Foundation's planning for a Cognitive Science Initiative.
