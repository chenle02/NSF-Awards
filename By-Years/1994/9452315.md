9452315 Peterson This project is to equip the University of Connecticut's
observatories with a CCD camera and data processing system to bring them to a
state-of-the art facility. Ancillary apparatus has been acquired for on site
image acquisition, preliminary data processing, subsequent data reduction,
storage, printing. Several experiments are being developed for advanced
students, as well as CCD cluster investigations for the beginning level. In
addition to serving as basic training for future astronomers, the laboratory
also serves the large number of introductory students interested in astronomy
and their peers who are physics majors. A second major item is a Proxima Desk
Top Projector which facilitates planetarium discussions of solar system
configurations and planetary motions that were not possible before with the
simple Spitz planetarium. It is also used in demonstrations in the lecture hall
and for travelling presentations in libraries and schools. Both major items have
the additional attraction that they are making astronomy at the University of
Connecticut accessible to handicapped students for whom the planetarium and
observatories were previously user-unfriendly and inaccessible, respectively.
