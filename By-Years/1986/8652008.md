This project enables 20 junior high and senior high teachers to participate in a
research project with scientists or engineers. Teachers and research-mentors
with similar interests will work together. For eight weeks in the summer of 1987
each teacher will review the literature, tools, and techniques needed to be
involved in a research project. During the academic year of 1987-88 the teacher
will continue the research project after school or on weekends. At least one
meeting per month will be held with the mentor-scientists. A major focus during
this period will be discussions of how the knowledge and skills learned can be
incorporated into the teaching strategies of the classroom. For eight weeks
during the summer of 1988 the teachers will again be in the laboratories of
mentor-scientists. At the end of the second summer each participant will prepare
a written report.
