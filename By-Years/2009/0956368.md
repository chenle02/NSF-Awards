This award funds ongoing curatorial activities at the Marine Geological Samples
Laboratory (MGSL) of the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), University of
Rhode Island. This facility serves as the central repository for marine
geological samples collected by faculty, staff, and students of the GSO. The
present collection consists of 1805 deep sea cores, 715 dredge samples, and 767
coastal and deep sea grab samples. Activities include curation of new core and
dredge rock samples, further description of existing samples, enhancement of the
MGSL website, submittal of sample information to the NGDC curators' database,
routine logging for new core acquisitions, and the registering of all repository
samples with the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR). The repository is
involved in a variety of education and outreach activities, including laboratory
tours, sample loans, and hands-on exercises for K-12 students.
