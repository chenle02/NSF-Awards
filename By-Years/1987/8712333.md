The research is an introductory investigation on the possibility of the
presence of acoustic gravity waves at ionospheric heights at low latitudes. It
consists of analysis of ionosonde, night airglow and polarimiter data obtained
in recent years at southern hemIsphere low latitude stations. Gravity waves are
generated in the lower atmosphere by storms, or winds encountering topographic
barriers, and carry energy and momentum to the upper atmosphere. Their study is
part of a current worldwide coordinated effort. The PI is at a small
undergraduate institution and this research grant will encourage more research
there, as part of the RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program. He
has a good background in the field, and a number of publications from his
previous work.
