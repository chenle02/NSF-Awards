This project will support the development of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry
(AMS) applications in the earth sciences at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory of
the University of Rochester. Improvements in the sensitivity of the AMS
technique for analyzing the isotopes chlorine-36, iodine-129, calcium-41 and
osmium-186/187 will be a major focus of the project. Another product of the
project will be the synthesis, in collaboration with the National Bureau of
Standards, of accurate isotope concentration standards for chlorine and iodine.
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry has developed into an important technique because
it is in many cases the only method sensitive enough for the measurement of rare
isotopes that can be used to date the age of geological events and to trace the
transfer of matter within the Earth.
