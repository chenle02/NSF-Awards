This award supports the research of Jeffrey Fox (joint with Peter Haskell of
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) on equivariant KK-
theory. Equivariant K-theory and the K-theory of crossed product algebras have
played an important role in the solution of geometric and topological problems
associated with group actions and with fundamental groups of manifolds. Examples
of such problems include many cases of the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture on
the existence of metrics with positive scalar curvature and many cases of the
Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of higher signatures. Kasparov's
representation ring KK(G)(C,C) and its distinguished idempotent have played a
fundamental role in this program. This research will apply the Kasparov
representation theory with the intention for contributing to the geometric
understanding of the K-theory of crossed product C(*)-algebras. This work in
'modern analysis' blends sophisticated research in algebra, geometry, and
analysis to examine the underlying theory of manifolds or surfaces. This
analysis is by way of the action of the transformation groups of a space on a
surface or geometric object in that space.
