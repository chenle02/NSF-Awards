This grant provides funding for the acquisition of shipboard instrumentation in
support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard small,
coastal, non-UNOLS vessels, such as the R/V ARGO-MAINE, owned by U. of Maine,
and R/V GULF CHALLENGER, owned by U. of New Hampshire. Instrumentation requested
includes a portable winch and a carousel water sampling system. The equipment is
requested for support of NSF-funded research and will enhance the scientific
capability of the approx. 24 institutions that are part of the Regional
Association for Research on the Gulf of Maine (RARGOM). Availability of the
instruments will be advertised in the RARGOM quarterly newsletter. ??
