Prof. George McLendon of the Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of
the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on
developing a general protocol to synthesize de novo proteins of optimal
stability. Kinetically inert metal/ligand systems will be used that allow
stepwise resynthesis of the target assembly, and investigate the design by
measuring thermodynamic folding parameters and by macromolecular structural
analysis. The approach will be extended to select proteins that lend themselves
to in vivo expression. Results from this study will lead to a greater
understanding of the protein structure and folding through development of a
novel technology, which will allow the design and expression of proteins of
predictable function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this study will have a
broad societal impact in such areas as catalysis in industrial processes and
synthesis of drugs. Students and post-doctoral research associates will receive
excellent training in a novel developing area of bioinorganic chemistry.
