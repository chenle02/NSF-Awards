Drs. Atkinson, Hunten, and Lunine at the University of Arizona will use a
broadly applicable laboratory spectroscopy technique to study the detailed
characteristics of several absorption bands of methane and molecules of ammonia
and hydrogen, and to perform low resolution broadband measurements of the 619
nanometer and 725 nanometer bands of methane, which have been studied with prior
NSF support. Study of planetary atmospheres relies heavily on spectroscopic
measurements of molecular absorption lines such as those of methane, ammonia,
and hydrogen. Among the necessary data are molecular line intensities and
collisional broadening ceofficients, particularly at low temperatures. Over the
past two years Dr. Atkinson and colleagues have developed and validated an
intracavity laser spectroscopy (ILS) technique which was used to measure line
intensities and pressure broadening coefficients of narrow lines in the 619
nanometer band of methane. They also developed a technique for using ILS to make
broadband, low resolution, measurements necessary for interpreting filter
photometry. With the current grant these scientists will expand these ILS
measurements to other wavelength bands and molecular species of interest in
planetary sciences.
