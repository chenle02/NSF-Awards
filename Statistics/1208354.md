This project will develop computationally efficient estimation methods with
accompanying theory for the problem of identifying low-dimensional structure in
point-cloud data, both low and high dimensional. A canonical example is a noisy
sample from a manifold. The investigators will develop minimax lower bounds for
the estimation problem and construct estimators that achieve these lower bounds.
They will then implement these methods in a practically useful form nd apply
them to several important scientific problems.

Datasets sometimes contain hidden, low-dimensional structure such as clusters,
filaments and low dimensional surfaces. The goal of this project to develop
rigorously justified, computationally efficient methods for extracting such
structure from data. The developed methods will be applied to a diverse set of
problems in astrophysics,seismology, biology, and neuroscience. The project will
advance knowledge in several fields including computational geometry, machine
learning, and statistics.
