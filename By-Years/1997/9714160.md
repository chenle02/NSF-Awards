The small flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of the mustard
family, has become a model system for plant biology. Its unique features allow
it to be applied to a wide variety of research problems, including plant
physiology, the molecular genetic study of organ development, and plant-
pathogen interactions. Arabidopsis has established itself in this role for
several reasons: its small size; short life cycle; small genome size; low amount
of repetitive DNA sequences; and the relative ease with which it is manipulated
by molecular and genetic methods. The importance of Arabidopsis to plant biology
is increasing with the international development of germplasm and DNA stock
resource centers, genetic and physical maps and their techniques, plus
expression sequence tag (EST, single pass cDNA sequences) and genomic sequencing
projects. Furthermore, because flowering plants evolved recently, characterizing
a gene in Arabidopsis often simplifies the isolation of a corresponding gene in
another flowering plant. This project will provide an electronic database
containing the genomic information for Arabidopsis thaliana including convenient
and correlated access to all published and otherwise publicly available
information about genes, their products, their positions on the genetic and
physical maps, and their DNA sequences. Furthermore, this resource will
accommodate a diverse group of users, ranging from Arabidopsis molecular
biologists to other biologists whose own research problems can take advantage of
work conducted using Arabidopsis. This database project will provide an
information resource on the Internet using the World Wide Web using client and
server software developed specifically for genomic information presentation and
analysis. The primary mission of this project is to develop a scientific
database using object-relational database technologies as well as to develop an
appropriate interface through the WWW to the information needed by the worldwide
plant molecular biological community. The major product of this project will be
the creation of a database environment which will validate and store information
about physical and genetic maps, DNA sequences and their features, plus cross-
references to the literature and detailed primary data. Collaborations with the
Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI), an international group of scientists
working to determine the complete DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis genome by the
year 2004 have been developed to provide the plant biology community with a easy
access to the maps and sequence being created around the world.
