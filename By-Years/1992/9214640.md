This proposal requests fund for renovation of laboratory facilities in Krieger
Hall, a primary research laboratory building. The renovation and remodeling will
provide the resources to locate more members of the Department of Biomedical
Engineering in proximity to other engineering departments with a greater
opportunity for joint research in areas including biomedical sensors,
biomaterial and biomedical imaging systems. Funds will also be used for
renovating an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental microfabrication facility for
researchers in the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering. The development of such
a facility will require major renovation or replacement of an existing clean
room to add exhaust systems for safe use of chemicals and gases needed in
microfabrication, and an improved air filtration systems to reduce particle
counts. The facility will be used by faculty throughout the engineering school
including faculty in biomedical, electrical, chemical engineering, and materials
science in the conduct of sponsored research. Ongoing projects in diverse areas
such as microfabricated biomedical sensors, compound semiconductors lasers,
microwave devices, analog integrated circuits, electoractive polymers, porous
silicon studies, barrier properties of polyamide layers, would benefit from this
facility. Use of this common facility by the participants and their trainees
(postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students) will improve the
interdisciplinary interactions in this technical area.
