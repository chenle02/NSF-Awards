North-central Nevada contains one of the largest gold- producing districts in
the world Sixty million ounces of gold (Knutsen and Wilson, 1990) have been
identified in "Carlin-Type "deposits in the Carlin trend, one of several
mineralized trends in the district. The fundamental relationships between
igneous and tectonic activity in this region have yet to be fully understood. An
important consequence of crustal processes active in this region is the massive
concentration of gold. By resolving those processes responsible for gold
concentration we can formulate models describing ore genesis in Carlin-type
deposits and improve our understanding of geological processes active along this
ancient continental margin. This research proposal outlines a detailed fluid
inclusion study to determine the pressure-temperature conditions during gold
precipitation at the Getchell deposit, a typical Carlin-Type system, and to
document the physical and chemical nature of fluids that transported and
precipitated gold mineralization.
