This award supports cooperative research in the physics of atomic collisions
between Walter Meyerhof of Stanford University and E.C. Montenegro of the
Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They will study the charge
capture and loss by electron transfer during the ionic bombardment of gaseous
atomic targets. The total and differential charge changing cross-sections will
be measured at both laboratories to investigate the transition region from low
to intermediate velocities. Stanford has a Tandem accelerator which can provide
projectile energies from 6 to 40 MeV while the Van de Graaff accelerator at the
Catholic University yields 1 to 4 MeV. Both facilities are currently being
improved but they cover a wider energy range than either alone. Therefore the
two groups, both through the facilities and their experience, complement each
other. The Brazilians have expertise in atomic theory helpful to Stanford with
its expertise in the higher energy, heavy-ion regime. This effort will continue
a recent collaboration which has produced three papers in 16 months.
