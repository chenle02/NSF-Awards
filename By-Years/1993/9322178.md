9322178 Alexander This Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is based
on the premise that the ideal place to supplement the basic education of
bioengineers with practical experience and expose them to "real- life"
situations of the sort that will characterize their future careers is in the
intense medical environment of a teaching hospital. Such experience is critical
to the education of engineers and scientists who will create new concepts and
develop, design, and manufacture medical devices. Such training is necessary to
maintain and expand the competitive edge enjoyed by the U.S. medical device
industry, whose products are recognized as being the world's best. The program's
projects, chosen from ongoing Departmental research activities with independent
funding sources, will involve ligament and cartilage repair, spinal fixation,
fracture repair, physical chemistry of biomineralization, mechanical and
electronmagnetic effects on tissue growth, and total joint design. ***
