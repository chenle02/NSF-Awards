The spring 2013 semester of the Centre des Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) theme
year "Moduli Spaces, Extremality and Global Invariants" is organized around five
sets of focused activities staged between April 30 and July 12, 2013 at the CRM
on the campus of the Universite de Montreal: 1) J-holomorphic Curves in
Symplectic Geometry, Topology and Dynamics, April 30-May 11, 2013: workshop, two
mini-courses, Aisenstadt Chair lectures given by Helmut Hofer (IAS); 2) The
Topology of 3-dimensional Manifolds, May 6-17, 2013: workshop, three mini-
courses given by Ian Agol (Berkeley), Tao Li (Boston College), and Juan Souto
(University of British Columbia)), Aisenstadt Chair lectures given by David
Gabai (Princeton); 3) Extremal Kahler Metrics, May 26-June 1, 2013: workshop,
Aisenstadt Chair lectures Gang Tian (Princeton and Peking); 4) Moduli Spaces and
their Invariants in Mathematical Physics, June 3-14, 2013: workshop; 5) Low-
dimensional Topology after Floer, July 8-12, 2013: workshop.

The semester will present the state of the art in a number of currently active
areas of research in geometry and topology. Beyond providing a vehicle for
communicating the most significant new research results, one of the principal
objectives is to stimulate new ideas through cross-fertilization between the
different domains represented. We will also focus our energies on providing an
environment in which young researchers can immerse themselves in contemporary
research trends. The junior participants will interact with not only the leaders
in their fields, but also with the brightest students, postdoctoral fellows and
junior faculty worldwide. Information on registration, accommodations, financial
support, and scheduling can be found at
