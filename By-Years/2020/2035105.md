The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network, or SuperDARN, is an international
collaborative experiment for observations of plasma motions in Earthâ€™s upper
atmosphere where, by observing ionospheric plasma convection, a multitude of
geophysical processes can be studied. These processes range from the ionospheric
E-layer plasma instabilities to the relationships between auroral luminosity and
ionospheric electric fields, as well as from the global-scale ionospheric
convective response to changes in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic
field. Each of these areas of study contributes to the overall goals of the
space physics research - understanding of the coupling of solar wind energy into
Earth's upper atmosphere and its effects on manmade, distributed systems such as
communication networks, electrical grids, and pipelines build for various
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support operation of, and
research using data from, the SuperDARN radars installed at McMurdo Station
(MCM) and Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (SPS), Antarctica. The latter radar
will also be enhanced to enable polarimetric observations because no SuperDARN
radars currently have this ability to characterize polarization of their
received signals. Providing this capability to SuperDARN radars will open up
entirely new research areas for SuperDARN. The physical location of the SPS
radar atop the polar ice cap provides a unique opportunity for polarization
observations at the frequencies of operation of the SuperDARN radars. While
polarization measurements would be possible elsewhere, the absence of ground
reflections at South Pole significantly simplifies the signal interpretation and
enables investigations exploiting the magneto-ionic effect (known as Faraday
rotation) to characterize the electron density along the high-frequency signal
ray paths. As part of the global SuperDARN network, this cooperative scientific
effort fosters broad societal impacts as training students and young researchers
with "both hands" on the engineering projects and data
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
