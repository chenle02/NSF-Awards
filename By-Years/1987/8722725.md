Federal bureaucracies operate in an environment of competing forces - political,
economic and organizational - at every level from federal to local. This
research addresses the question of how and to what extent the enforcement
actions of federal bureaucracies respond to the local environment in which
enforcement actions take place. Through her doctoral dissertation, under the
direction of Dr. Scholz, Ms. Headrick will examine safety enforcement by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administrtaion (OSHA). The study extends existing
work on enforcement bureaucracies by analyzing the interaction of city politics
and federal agency behavior, using detailed local level measures not available
at other levels of analysis to map more explicitly the mechanisms linking
variables already studied. It analyzes hypotheses from three literatures -
implementation, regulation and urban politics - at the city level. Using both
quantitative and qualitative analysis, hypotheses tested reveal how these forces
affect the incentives of "street-level" enforcers - OSHA inspectors - that
increase or reduce the enforcement level. The project holds substantial promise
of advancing our understanding of how bureaucratic actions respond to internal
and external pressures. The resulting effects on bureaucratric accountability,
and in this case, the process of legal enforcement, also will be elucidated.
