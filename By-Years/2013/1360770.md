Rengmitca is a highly endangered Tibeto-Burman language currently spoken by
fewer than fifty individuals along a tributary of the Matamuhuri river in
Southeastern Bangladesh. Study of the language is crucial because its core
vocabulary exhibits a number of conservative features for a Tibeto-Burman
language: Rengmitca retains not only consonants that the Tibeto-Burman parent
language had at the ends of its words, but also prefixal elements which most
modern languages have lost. Rengmitca may thus act as an independent source for
verifying hypotheses about the parent language. The relationship through contact
of the language to a second language, Mru, which all Rengmitca speakers have as
their primary language, is also of particular theoretical interest. This project
will collect as much data as possible for the language before it disappears.
Project members will gather a corpus of texts representing different genres from
the remaining speakers. Using collected text material and other investigative
methods, a lexicon of essential Rengmitca items will be assembled. The project
will attempt to provide a detailed phonology and sketch grammar for the
language. The project will archive documentary materials for the language at
Dartmouth College and with The Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources
in Endangered Cultures.
