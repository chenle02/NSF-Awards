This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project is designed to address
the problem of managing and simulating extended enterprise systems as specified
in The Extended Enterprise/C.2. As networks and enterprise systems have grown in
complexity, it has become increasingly difficult to determine the most cost
effective way to deploy hardware to maximize system availability and network
performance. Poor resource planning decreases the effectiveness of information
technology organizations, resulting in increased labor costs and decreased
company wide productivity. New tools are required to increase productivity. This
proposal is for research to produce a modeling and forecasting software system
that use combination of neural net and rules based algorithms to simulate
enterprise systems. Individual components of the enterprise system will be
modeled with appropriate neural nets trained by constructive techniques. The
enterprise system will be modeled by connecting these component neural nets with
data pipe rule-based software. Such software would be able to forecast strains
on the system and identify bottlenecks in the network. The completed modeling
and forecasting software will become a cornerstone technology for a tool that
will diagnose, troubleshoot and predict IT issues. The project will be developed
in Linux with C, C++ or FORTRAN, as appropriate.

This research could help in making the management of enterprise systems and
networks more efficient therefore making them more affordable to teaching and
service institutions.

The result of this endeavor will assist enterprise systems and network managers
to manage the tasks in faster and more economically manner.
