This planning and assessment award to the National Academy of Sciences Board on
Atmospheric Science and Climate (BASC) will be conducted by an ad hoc committee
of twelve members of diverse and representative backgrounds in the atmospheric
and related sciences. Through a series of meetings and consultations, this
committee will identify the most effective mechanisms and approaches for NSF-ATM
to use to achieve its overall mission of advancing knowledge and understanding
in the atmospheric and related sciences. This assessment will survey how NSF
should best achieve balance among the funding mechanisms it employs for research
and educational activities, and the modes of support for the atmospheric
sciences best suited to advance scientific and education goals, and their
service to society. The study will also seek to describe how best to provide an
effective balance between centralized and distributed community infrastructure
support, and explore how NSF-ATM can encourage the broad participation and
involvement of atmospheric researchers at a variety of research and educational
institutions. The committee's final report is intended to inform both NSF and
the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, and will be disseminated to the broader
atmospheric science community.&lt;br/&gt;
