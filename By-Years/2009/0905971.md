This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled " A mathematical model
of hippocampal neurogenesis to explain the computational influence of adult-born
neurons on brain function" for Anthony DeCostanzo. The host institution for this
research the Columbia University and the sponsoring scientist is Fusi Stefano.

This research employs a biologically realistic mathematical model of hippocampal
neurogenesis to explain what adult-born neurons do for the function of the
brain. First, behavioral and physiological data from mice are being used to make
the model as realistic as possible. Second, the model is being validated using a
combined approach: data from genetically modified mice that have altered
neurogenesis are being collected while the model is altered to mirror the
genetic change in the mice. Then the model is used to predict how these mice
should behave as a result of their altered genetics. Using this combination of a
genetic strategy in mice with a computational model we can determine how changes
in neurogenesis affect the computations of a neural circuit, and how these
computations in turn lead to behavior changes, gaining insight into the benefits
that neurogenesis offers to the function of the brain.

This work fits with the Fellow's overall scientific goal of pursuing a
mathematical understanding of how the brain generates and stores ideas and
representations of the world, and how these neural processes underlie
creativity, insight, intuition and problem-solving. This understanding may one
day allow us to understand the very nature of creativity itself, and to build
computers that have yet greater creative faculties than the human brain. The
results from the current research project are presented annually at the Society
for Neuroscience and COSYNE meetings and published in peer-reviewed academic
journals. The Fellows will also produce general interest writing on
computational neuroscience through a devoted website as well as other media.
