The relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in structuring the
littoral zone community in northern Wisconsin lakes will be evaluated. The
proposed work builds on 5 years of collaborative research examining the major
forces controlling the structure and function of the nearshore community. The
approach is comprehensive. It evaluates complex interactions, direct and
indirect interactions among predators and their prey, and the cascade
hypothesis. They have all been recently applied to the pelagia of lakes, but are
largely untested in the structurally- complex environment of the benthic,
littoral cummunity. The centerpiece for this effort is a mesocosm experiment in
which densities of fish predators of crayfish and crayfish are treatment
variables. Treatments in which the fish predators of crayfish are reduced to
mimic the impact of winterkill on the top trophic level will be used. The
mesocosms represent a scale intermediate between laboratory and whole-lake
experiments. The approach is tractable, realistic, and absolutely required to
make progress toward understanding those forces structuring the littoral
community.
