The Economics Department was awarded a grant from the National Science
Foundation in 1989 to put together a PC lab for the students. The purpose was to
assist students to understand basic economic concepts and relationships; develop
their modeling skills; and retrieve, evaluate, and use current and historical
economic data in their courses. The lab has been extremely successful in
achieving the first two goals but less so in the third. In addition, it has done
little in teaching students to present the results of their investigations in an
interesting, coherent, and professional manner. New hardware and software makes
achievement of all four goals much easier. In order to prepare students for
graduate school and employment, the department is implementing a 30-station
computer lab that runs the current software. The Windows 95 current version of
Quattro Pro makes mastery of spreadsheets easier, freeing students to explore
the meaning of economic models more quickly and in more depth. Access to the
Internet, which the current equipment cannot provide in a practical manner,
enables students to retrieve data quickly and easily from many different
sources, making their use of this data much more practical. Power Point helps
students to present their arguments easily and persuasively. This is
particularly important in the Economics in the Classroom course, a course for
future teachers. Using current hardware and software, the project can build upon
its success in the past and provide the students with skills that it has
previously been unable to provide. The Economics Department has demonstrated its
ability to use the latest technology to prepare students for life after college
and continues to do so.
