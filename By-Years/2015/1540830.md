With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship program, the Teaching for Equity in Appalachia in Mathematics and
Science, TEAMS, is recruiting undergraduate majors in mathematics, biology,
chemistry, geology, or physics or mathematics or science professionals and
preparing them to become grades 9-12 Mathematics or Science teachers. The
project is funding 20-30 teachers over 4 years. In this project, Appalachian
State University is collaborating with members of the Appalachian Public School
Partnership, including Alleghany, Alexander, and Avery County Schools. Specific
to the project is a focus on preparing teachers for the cultural contexts of
teaching mathematics and science content in rural schools and development of
leadership capacity among Noyce teachers through mentoring and course
experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on the work of Shulman
Pedagogical Content Knowledge developed in 1987 as further defined by Ball and
Bass in their work of 2002, Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching, and the UTeach
model developed and practiced at the University of Texas at Austin. In addition
to their Bachelor's degree in a science or math major, the Scholars will earn a
Graduate Certificate in Secondary Teaching and a licensure for secondary
teaching in the appropriate area. Special attention will be paid to the
formation of teacher cohorts in acknowledgement of the isolation often felt by
teachers in the small rural schools typical of the area they will serve.
Research concerning effective means of recruiting and retaining teachers in
these small rural areas will be done using a mixed methods (quantitative and
qualitative data collection) approach.
