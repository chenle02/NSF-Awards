9728756 Akins Learning, which is a change in behavior due to experience, is
perhaps the most widespread and important behavioral characteristic of the
animal kingdom. Indeed, the nature of the physical-chemical changes underlying
the learning in the brain is an important fundamental question. Since the time
of Pavlov's dog, classical conditioning has been used as a model to examine the
learning process. Classical conditioning involves the pairing of a stimulus
that, when followed often enough by an unconditioned stimulus, produces a
response similar to that automatically triggered by the unconditioned response.
Dr. Akins is interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying learning and
reproductive behavior. She will utilize this classical learning paradigm to
integrate these two lines of research. Employing a variety of pharmacological
and behavioral tools, Dr. Akins will examine the role of the dopaminergic system
in the control of the unconditioned consummatory reproductive behavior as well
as on the acquisition and expression of behavioral conditioning. The outcome of
these studies will provide fundamental new information as to the neural
mechanisms underlying learning and reproduction.
