The goal of this research project is to develop accurate and efficient numerical
methods to solve strongly nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations
(PDEs). Nonlinear problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering and arise
naturally from materials science, nonlinear elasticity, fluid dynamics and image
processing. This proposal studies the analysis and design of efficient numerical
algorithms which preserve essential properties of nonlinear PDEs. The project
will provide efficient numerical algorithms for researchers in liquid crystal
materials and shape design. In addition to the design of efficient algorithms,
the project will also analyze the stability and rates of convergence of the
methods. Compared with the vast literature on linear problems, the work on
numerical analysis for strongly nonlinear elliptic problems are relatively few.
The success of the project will provide insight in future development of
numerical methods in studying nonlinear phenomena.

The project splits into three different parts, namely, numerical approximation
of the Landau-De Gennes model of nematic liquid crystals, numerical
approximation of the Monge Ampere PDEs, numerical optimal transportation
problem. The specific goal of the project includes (i) construction of novel
numerical methods based on piecewise linear or nodewise functions to preserve
discrete maximum principle, an essential property of these problems, (ii)
combination of robust lower order method with accurate higher order methods and
development of a posteriori error estimation and adaptivity to improve the
accuracy and efficiency of the methods, (iii) analysis of these methods based on
discrete version of nonlinear PDE tools, such as Gamma convergence and discrete
Alexandroff maximum principle, (iv) applying these methods in simulating liquid
crystal materials and antenna design.
