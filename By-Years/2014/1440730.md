This planning grant supports Carroll University's efforts to develop a plan to
improve its campus network infrastructure aligning with the goals described in
NSF's Campus Cyberinfrastructure-Infrastructure, Innovation and Engineering
(CC*IIE) Program. The 12-month planning period includes the following
activities: evaluate existing IT infrastructure against STEM research and
education needs on campus, identify unmet needs, and define a plan to address
them; develop a campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) plan aligned with Carroll's
strategic planning; and study and develop a science DMZ approach to re-
architecting the campus border. Planning for network improvements at Carroll is
especially timely to achieve maximum leverage in enabling research and education
activities across lab facilities. The work also impacts the institution's
existing emphasis on undergraduate research.
