This project will develop a new digital receiver for medium frequency (MF) radio
emissions that are present in the Earth's auroral zones. A study of the
feasibility of moving the MF Interferometer from Sondrestrom, Greenland to a
site an auroral site in Alaska where complementary data from optical images
would be available. In addition to the instrument development and planning, the
project will investigate the theoretical aspects of auroral MF radio emissions.
These studies will make use of data being collected at several auroral sites in
Canada, Greenland, and Alaska.
