A simple testing procedure for the analysis of small strain and dynamic/cyclic
large strain behavior of soils will be developed. The procedure will consist of
a single slightly modified static direct simple shear test. In comparison with
the current practice of small strain testing by resonant column device and
separate large strain cyclic testing by triaxial, simple shear, torsional shear
or similar device, the new method will represent a more convenient and
economical alternative for the dynamic/cyclic characterization of soils over the
entire range of strains.//
