9707649 Stratton The fundamental niche of an organism can be quantified by a
performance curve, relating fitness to underlying resource gradients. This
project will measure genetic variation in parameters of fitness reaction norms
of Arabidopsis thaliana over gradients of light, water, and nutrients.
Components of genetic variance for the shape of those reaction norms will be
estimated to test the hypotheses that 1) there is more genetic variation for
niche position than niche width. 2) that there are negative genetic correlations
between the breadth of performance curves and maximum fitness (the jack of all
trades is master of none hypothesis) and 3) that such tradeoffs are most
apparent in comparisons among populations rather than within. Although the
standing genetic variance governs the short-term response to selection, long
term constraints depend on pleiotropic effects of individual loci. Thus,
quantitative trait loci affecting the shape of fitness reaction norms will be
mapped using a recombinant inbred population of Arabidopsis to test the
hypothesis 4) that loci which affect fitness at one end of the resource gradient
have negative pleiotropic effects maximal fitness or on performance at the other
extreme. Populations can respond to changes in the environment by shifting their
niche position or by increasing niche breadth. Despite a long history of
theoretical work, predicting the response of real populations is an empirical
problem which depends on the amount and pattern of genetic variation in
parameters of the fitness reaction norm. Tradeoffs between maximal fitness and
breadth of adaptation are often assumed but rarely documented. Moreover, the
possibility that independent loci affect performance at different ends of the
resource gradient means that populations may be able to expand their niche
without detrimental effects on performance in other environments.
