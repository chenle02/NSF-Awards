Rationally connected varieties form a class of varieties that
&lt;br/&gt;coincides with rational and unirational varieties for curves
&lt;br/&gt;and surfaces, but represents a very different (and better
&lt;br/&gt;behaved) class in higher dimensions. The investigator studies
&lt;br/&gt;aspects of rational connectivity; in particular, the relation
&lt;br/&gt;between rational connectivity and unirationality and the
&lt;br/&gt;implications of rational connectivity for existence of points
&lt;br/&gt;on varieties over non-algebraically closed fields. In relation
&lt;br/&gt;to the latter, the investigator studies the geometry of
&lt;br/&gt;parameter spaces for rational curves on a rationally connected
&lt;br/&gt;variety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of algebraic geometry
is to learn more about &lt;br/&gt;the solutions of polynomial equations by
studying geometric &lt;br/&gt;objects, called varieties, associated to them. For
example, &lt;br/&gt;if an ellipse is given to us by a polynomial in two
variables, &lt;br/&gt;we might ask how the shape of an ellipse affects the
solutions &lt;br/&gt;of the polynomial. Recently, algebraic geometers have
introduced &lt;br/&gt;a new property of varieties, called rational connectivity,
and &lt;br/&gt;results to far indicate a strong connection between the algebra
&lt;br/&gt;of a system of polynomial equations and the rational connectivity
&lt;br/&gt;of the variety they define. The investigator studies this
&lt;br/&gt;connection further.&lt;br/&gt;
