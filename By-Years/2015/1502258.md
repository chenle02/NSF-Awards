There is a need for highly precise, real time, fine grained spatiotemporal
sampling of the ocean environment, which forms the vast majority of the surface
area of our planet, but yet is 90% unexplored. Current methods such as remote
telemetry and sequential local sensing cannot satisfy current requirements, let
alone future ones. The notion of an underwater network is relatively new due to
the lack of maturity of underwater acoustic communications. And yet, networks
are critical in order to achieve the monitoring goals noted above. The Ninth ACM
International Conference on Underwater Networks &amp; Systems (WUWNet?14), to be
held in Rome, Italy, is a leading conference showcasing research in this area,
and features a rich technical program, including technical sessions, keynote
speeches as well as poster and demo sessions. This award will promote student
participation in WUWNet'14 by supporting their travel and registration costs to
the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of
the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially
those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this
project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students
themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other
researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations
that may be related to their research areas. The research community also
benefits by training the next generation of researchers.
