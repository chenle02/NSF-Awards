This proposal is for support of five separate but inter- related projects. The
projects are: (1) Research on the iterative redesign model applied to parametric
design of components: Modifying and extending an existing system to include the
Taguchi philosophy of parametric design, and to include tolerance selection; (2)
research on the iterative respecification model applied to parametric design of
assemblies: Developing a first domain-independent version of the model,
including tolerance selection; (3) research on features and designing with
features for components: Extension of the current architecture and
representation to deal with the more complexity, including tolerances, curved
surfaces, feature combinations, user-defined features, and (possibly) functional
intent; (4) research on a feature-based computer environment for conceptual
design of mechanical assemblies: Extension of the current multiple level of
abstraction representation to include multiple functional viewpoints; (5)
research on extending the iterative redesign model to configuration and to
conceptual design: Using features and concepts to assist evaluation and redesign
of configuration and embodiments.
