9403136 Leighton Dr. James L. Leighton has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Leighton received his doctoral degree form
Harvard University under the supervision of Professor David Evans. Dr. Leighton
will continue research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor
Eric Jacobsen. His postdoctoral research will focus on the development of
methodology for the rapid and efficient evaluation of ligands for asymmetric
catalytic processes, specifically the (salen) Mn(III)- catalyzed epoxidation of
olefins. Longer term he plans to apply his expertise in asymmetric catalysis to
stereoselective rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation processes. The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
