This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II research project
proposes to develop a prototype product for an innovative parallel program
development and execution technology, which can run parallel programs
asynchronously in multiprocessors and supercomputers up to 100 times faster than
what is currently possible, without using Message Passing Interfaces (MPI). For
more than thirty years it had been assumed that the only way to efficiently
compile and execute parallel programs was through MPI. Even though it had been
recognized that parallel programs would run faster if executed asynchronously on
the basis of data availability, technology needed to do that efficiently was not
available, until Technology for Integrated Computation and Communication (TICC)
came along. This tuning technology eliminates the need for dynamic checking of
temporal coordination, and makes it possible to execute control signal exchange
protocols in parallel with computations. More than 40 million messages may be
exchanged per second. This eliminates communication bottleneck and allows
asynchronous execution of parallel programs based on data availability without
using MPI. TICC defines the semantics of causal statements and provides a very
efficient implementation for them.

TICC brings the following additional facilities: (1) Component based parallel
program development environment, (2) Dynamic debugging of parallel programs (3)
Dynamic monitoring and changing of messages and message traffic, (4) Dynamic
repair and failure recovery, (5) Dynamic reconfiguration, and (5) Dynamic
evolution parallel software systems. These have the consequent benefit of
reducing parallel program development and maintenance costs, making them more
easily and widely available. This, together with decreasing costs of
multiprocessors, has the potential to usher in a new era of desktop
supercomputing by 2007, with profound impact on science, technology, industry,
education, theories of computation and communication, and society in general.
