This award is for support for a two year program of ice sheet modeling to
contribute to the site selection for deep drilling at the inland site for the
West Antarctic ice cores (WAISCORES) program. Ice flow calculations will be
performed to provide time- scale and layer thickness estimates, and to identify
source regions of deep ice. The research will focus on finding sites where the
climate record should be best preserved throughout its long ice dynamics
history. Using existing radar data and ice dynamical models sites will be
identified that optimize age resolution and avoid potentially disturbed basal
ice. The work will be closely coordinated with the ice coring community and
other investigators who are trying to identify areas with good depositional
environments and firn preservation. The project is a collaboration between the
University of Texas Institute for Geophysics and the University of Washington
Geophysics program.
