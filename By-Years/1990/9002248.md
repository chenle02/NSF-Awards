In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program the effects of applied electric fields on the absorption and emission
spectra of a wide range of molecules, and on the rates of electron transfer
reactions, will be examined. The results are expected to deepen our
understanding of the factors which govern the rates and specificity of transfer
of electrons within and between molecules. Experimental and theoretical methods
which have been developed for studying the effects of electric fields in
photosynthetic systems will be extended to non-biological systems. These
approaches will be used to measure (1) the degree of charge separation in metal-
to-ligand charge transfer and intervalence transitions in transition metal
complexes, (2) the effects of applied electric fields on the electronic coupling
between the donor and acceptor, (3) the degree of charge-transfer character in
the excited states of donor-acceptor compounds which undergo electron transfer
but whose absorption spectra are unaffected by the presence of the acceptor, (4)
the effects of electric fields on the rates of electron transfer reactions or
competing luminescence, and (5) the magnitude of the internal field correction
for various polymeric matrices.
