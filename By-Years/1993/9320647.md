9320647 Toole The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue an
instrument development program to design, construct and test a moored
instrumentation profiling system that can repeatedly transport a suite of
scientific sensors or an instrument package vertically through the water column
to full ocean depths. Initial prototype evaluations were successful in testing
the feasibility of a building a profiling system designed to repeatedly profile
to depths of 6000 meters and to obtain a time series temperature, salinity,
current velocity, or other measurements. Such a system will provide valuable
data at relatively low cost compared to current shipboard data acquisition
systems. The system could also be deployed in remote locations that are seldom
traversed by oceanographic research vessels.
