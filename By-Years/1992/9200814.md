The demographic and social relevance of young adult contraceptive use and
fertility in developing countries is clear, yet most research attention in this
area has been focused on advanced-industrial societies. This doctoral
dissertation project will investigate sexual and reproductive transitions among
15-24 year-old women in 21 African and Latin American countries for which
Demographic and Health Survey data are currently available. The patterns of
sexual activity, contraceptive use, and fertility will be documented, and
analyses of their determinants will be performed an an individual micro-level
and at a cross-national, multilevel, which will test hypotheses regarding how
the micro-level effects are attenuated, magnified, or reversed depending on
nation-state and ethnic group contexts. This project will contribute to our
understanding of intra- national as well as of cross-national differences in
sexual and reproductive transitions. It also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
