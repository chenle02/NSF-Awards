We will study basic decision processes in a patient group known to suffer from
the inability to integrate thoughts and feelings when considering the long-term
consequences of their decisions. This dysfunction has been tied to lesions in a
specific neural circuitry within the brain. This patient population is thus
ideal for studying the operation and integration of cognition and emotion in
decision making. The logic is as follows: if we can characterize these patients
by their inability to integrate thoughts and feelings, and if we can show that
these patients are less sensitive than controls to selected variables such as
risk level, then we will better understand the factors that play a key role in
integrating thoughts and feelings for informed decision making. Controls will
include a group of non-patients and a group of patients with lesions in other
parts of the brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our interdisciplinary research team has
the background and experience to work with the target patient group to determine
the neurological underpinnings of their decision making deficits and to create
controlled tasks for isolating variables and response systems that differentiate
between "informed" and "uninformed" decision making. For example, if our new
studies show that the target patients are less responsive to changing risk
levels than are controls, then we can assert that distorted perceptions of risk
level are a key marker of uninformed decision making. We believe that the
broader impact of this work will include: (1) demonstrating to future
researchers the usefulness of combining traditional behavioral decision theory
approaches with analyses of neural circuitries in the brain; (2) developing a
more complete description of factors that differentiate "normal" and "abnormal"
decision making; and (3) finding ways to understand and counsel groups with
demonstrated deficits in making decisions that serve their best
interests.&lt;br/&gt;
