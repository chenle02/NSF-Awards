This project is concerned with deriving certain invariants associated with the
finite presentation of metabelian and solvable groups. These invariants have
been shown to have many connections with number theory, algebraic geometry and
topology. The invariants enable one to describe locally the property of having a
finite Eilenberg.MacLane space up to a fixed dimension. In this proposal the
principal investigator will study these invariants using equivariant homology.
This approach will unify this theory as it appears in commutative algebra and in
topology, as well as, provide a better understanding of the theory.
