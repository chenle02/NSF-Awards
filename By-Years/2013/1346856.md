To address scientific challenges resulting from a rapidly changing environment
and complex scientific questions, many scientists have formed formal or informal
networks comprised of experts across a range of pertinent disciplines. Despite
the rapidly increasing number of these networks, there has been little
systematic examination of this approach to answering large-scale science
questions. Funds are provided for a workshop to examine the common challenges
facing emerging grass roots networks such as identifying compelling scientific
questions as well as leadership, coordination, governance, communication, social
interactions, data access and management, authorship, and long-term
organizational sustainability. The workshop will provide a forum to identify
critical aspects of the creation and operation of these networks, as well as the
kinds of scientific inferences that have been made by grassroots networks. The
workshop and resulting activities will enhance capacity of the scientific
workforce by assembling a diverse (gender, career stage, institution type) set
of participants that include leaders of individual grassroots networks as well
as experts in the newly emerging discipline of the science of team science.
