This research investigation exploits a target of opportunity by providing
partial support to defray funding of data collection in France. The research
involves a collaborative study of presidential selection in France and the
United States in the 1988 elections in each country. The investigators have
gained the cooperation of SOFRES, the leading public opinion polling
organization in France, for conducting a post-election French national sample
survey. The survey instrument to be employed in France is based on the survey
instruments that have been used in U. S. National Election Studies in the past
and that will be used again in the November, 1988, election. The possibility of
collaborating with the French presents an unprecedented opportunity due to the
fact that it has been exceedingly difficult, in the past, to organize
collaborative work with French scholars in political science. The SOFRES group
will underwrite forty percent of the total costs associated with the project and
has agreed with the request made by the Principal Investigators to make the data
available to the larger scholarly community. The data will be made available
publicly within one year of the completion of this project and will afford
numerous scholars the opportunity to undertake independent analyses of it.
