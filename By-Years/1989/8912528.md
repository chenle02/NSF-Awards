This award will support collaborative research in biological oceanography
between Dr. Robert Feller, University of South Carolina and two British
scientists: Dr. Richard Warwick, Plymouth Marine Laboratory and Dr. Peter Boyle,
University of Aberdeen. This joint effort addresses the solution of common
problems encountered in the visual (microscope-aided) analysis of marine food
webs involving bottom-dwelling predators which grind, chew, or rapidly digest
their prey. Immunochemical methods have been developed to help solve this
problem of how to identify "invisible", but energetically important, prey in the
stomach contents of scavenging predators. Polyclonal antibodies are used as
probes to identify solubilized proteins from such prey as nematodes, copepods
and soft-bodied worms. Immunoassays of shrimp and juvenile fishes have shown
that these quickly digested prey can often, but incorrectly, be relegated to
inconsequential status compared with less rapidly digested prey. Research
collaborators in the U.K. offer expertise in the ecology and energetics of
nearshore food webs involving bottom-dwelling organisms (Dr. R.M. Warwick,
Plymouth) and in the quantitative immunological analysis of marine food chains
(Dr. P. R. Boyle, Aberdeen). Dr. Feller has expertise in ecological applications
of immunology and trophic dynamics of bottom-dwelling crustaceans. The
investigators will examine the stomach contents of juvenile shore crabs and sand
shrimp important to fisheries of the U.K. to see if previously published diet
descriptions are biased towards digestion-resistent prey. They have also
designed an additional comparative study of the effectiveness of several
antibody probes developed independently to identify proteins from similar prey
organisms. Both studies will prove the utility of immunological methods for
solving these otherwise intractable trophic analysis problems.
