Multiprocessor systems are more susceptible to failure than conventional
uniprocessor machines. Thus the design of schemes that enhance the fault
tolerance capabilities of the algorithmic aspects of several problems that arise
in conjunction with the design of such schemes will be done. The main thrust of
this investigation is on some recently proposed on-line techniques that
accomplish fault detection concurrently with normal computation. The main goals
of this research are to develop practical and efficient schemes for fault
detection and location and to obtain a better understanding of the issues
involved in the design of fault tolerance schemes for multiprocessor systems.
