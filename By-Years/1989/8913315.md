This project by Paul Young of the University of Illinois, Chicago, is within the
Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed at a study of the reactions of organic
compounds containing tricoordinate (i.e., three bonds) sulfur atoms. The
detailed pathway by which these compounds react with negatively charged species
will be investigated with special attention given to the competition between
single and multiple step routes. This work should allow chemists to better
predict and control complex reactions involving sulfur atoms. There is a
significant body of data suggesting that, under certain conditions, alkyl
transfer reactions from simple sulfonium salts may occur through a ligand
coupling mechanism involving reductive elimination from an intermediate
tetracoordinate sulfurane. This suggestion is easily testable by monitoring the
product distribution and stereochemistry of selected reactions. A series of
chiral S-methyl-S-(substituted alpha-methylbenzyl)-S-(substituted
phenyl)sulfonium salts with known chirality around the benzyl group will be
synthesized, and reacted with the following nucleophiles: (1) substituted ethyl
alcohols (solvolysis conditions will be utilized and the progress of the
reaction followed by NMR), (2) substituted pyridines and primary, secondary and
tertiary amines in aprotic solvents and protic solvents found to support minimal
solvolysis activity, (3) strong nucleophiles including phosphines and
carbanions, (4) high concentrations of substituted acetates and benzoates under
conditions where a second-order dependence on nucleophile concentration is
observed, and (5) bifunctional nucleophiles including alpha- pyridones and
alpha-pyridinethiones. For each class of nucleophile, product distributions will
be obtained with special emphasis on the chirality of the transferred benzyl
group. For each of the observed pathways, the effects of structure on reactivity
will be investigated using classical Hammett and Bronsted correlations.
Secondary deuterium isotope effects and C-13 isotope effects on the nucleophilic
rate constants will be determined for comparison with isotope effects observed
for methyl transfers catalyzed by the enzyme, catechol-O-methyltransferase. The
effect of nucleophile strength on the partitioning pathways will be
investigated, both within a given series (Bronsted correlations) and across the
array of nucleophiles investigated (N+-type correlations). These data, taken as
a complete set, will define the limits of the "ligand coupling" pathway in
substitution reactions occurring at tricoordinate sulfur and will allow a more
complete understanding of the role of nucleophile structure on each of the
potential pathways for the alkyl transfer process.
