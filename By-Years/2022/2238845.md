An award is made to Duke University to perform research and create associated
educational material surrounding novel digital optical microscopes. This project
will specifically develop microscopic imaging technologies that can capture and
rapidly process 3D video at high speeds over large volumes. Building upon
research within data-driven optimization methods, this project will also create
new software to rapidly display 3D videos at high resolution. Educational
material in the form of online and hands-on lessons about the operation and
application of 3D digital microscopes will be created and disseminated through
outreach programs and within curriculum, with the aim of raising the scientific
literacy of high-school and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will specifically focus on the development of computational microscopes
that are comprised of multi-scale optical arrays. Such systems use a series of
micro-cameras to capture dozens of unique perspectives of dynamic specimens of
interest across a 1 cm3 volume at cellular-scale resolution. Co-optimized
software then fuses the acquired data into composite 3D video frames for
subsequent interpretation and analysis. This project aims to showcase its new
technology by experimentally monitoring the natural 3D locomotion of model
organisms at cellular resolution, while recording whole-brain fluorescence
neural activity during such free movement. Such novel capabilities will likely
accelerate model organism-based research within the fields of neuroscience, and
the mapping of cellular networks within macroscopic cleared tissue
volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
