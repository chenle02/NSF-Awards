The project is concerned with optimal control of multi-dimensional dynamic
stochastic systems with risk aversion. Two approaches to risk aversion are
considered: dynamic risk measures and stochastic orders. The investigators seek
to advance their work on risk-averse discrete-time models and to develop general
methodology for incorporating risk models into continuous-time optimal control
problems of Markov structure. Three major challenges are associated with this
project. First, the investigators develop proper mathematical tools for
measuring risk in a time-consistent manner that would be suitable for
continuous-time Markov systems. Second, the investigators develop optimality
theory for control problems involving time-consistent dynamic models of risk.
This includes the analysis of the structure of the control models, existence of
solutions, and properties of the solutions. When developing risk-averse control
models the third challenge has to be taken into account: the possibility to
solve the problems numerically in an efficient way.

Decision and control problems under uncertainty arise in many areas: energy
production and distribution, telecommunication, insurance and finance,
logistics, medicine, security and military applications. In most cases decisions
have to be made over time: decisions, as well as the random environment,
influence evolution of a system, which creates the need to make new decisions,
etc. Therefore, a policy has to be designed that incorporates rules for
responding to future states of the system. So far, most theoretical models of
such control processes have been based on average performance criteria. The
investigators propose to take into account risk, that is, the possibility of
occurrence of highly undesirable scenarios. The project develops mathematical
models for quantifying risk in dynamical systems that evolve in a continuous
way. It also provides methods to determine the best policy, when risk aversion
is essential.
