With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the
research of Professor Jiong Yang of Texas A&M University. Professor Yang will
develop efficient synthetic approaches to zoanthamines, a family of complex
polycyclic marine alkaloids possessing biological properties that are valuable
for therapeutic applications. First, a transannular Michael reaction cascade
will be systematically explored to elucidate its scope and stereochemical
outcome for synthesis of polycyclic molecular structures. Second, the total
synthesis of norzoanthamine, an anti-osteoporotic member of natural products of
the zoanthamine family, will be completed. The transannular Michael reaction
cascade will be employed to synthesize its stereochemically complex and highly
functionalized ABC ring system. Other cascade reactions will also be developed
for efficient assembly of the complex polycyclic molecular skeleton of
zoanthamines. For the final objective, a synthetic route to
28-deoxyzoanthenamine will be developed based on a proposed biosynthetic scheme.

Professor Yang will also initiate educational projects that interweave research
and teaching. The first project involves an outreach program targeting local
high school science educators by providing opportunities for professional
development through discovery-based research in his laboratory. The second
initiative involves outreach to K-12 students through a Chemistry Laboratory
Open House program to share the excitement of scientific research/discoveries
and encourage these students to consider exploring STEM fields.
