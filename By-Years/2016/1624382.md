Put coins flat on a table and push them together. Recording the pairs of coins
gives a "contact graph." The simple abstraction of a "graph" as recording
connections between objects is surprisingly powerful: computers on the internet,
tournament brackets, social networks, and PERT charts are all usefully viewed as
graphs. Graphs that have geometric realizations as contacting or intersecting
objects in two or more dimensions have special properties (e.g. it has been
known for 80 or 40 years that graphs that can be drawn with no crossings can be
realized as contact graphs of coins.) This project considers what types of
graphs can be contact graphs or intersections graphs of various geometric
objects in 2, 3 or higher dimensions, and how properties of these graphs can be
exploited by computer algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported
by NSF Computing and Communication Foundations division and the Office of
International Science and Engineering, provides matching funds for a Humboldt
fellow from Germany, T. Ueckerdt, to spend a postdoctoral year working with Dr.
Kobourov and his students at U of Arizona.
