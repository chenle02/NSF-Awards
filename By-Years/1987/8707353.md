The role of organic matter in processes of ore deposition has been the subject
of many recent meetings and symposia. For most deposits it is still unknown
whether organic matter plays an active or passive part in determining the site
and mechanism of precipitation of ore minerals. The proposed research is
designed to determine the influence of organic matter on the geochemical
evolution of the sediment-hosted gold deposit at Alligator Ridge is the only
large deposit of this type but Alligator Ridge is the only large deposit where
heating has not obliterated the original organic record. Preliminary analyses
using "Rock-Eval" and aliphatic hydrocarbon extracts demonstrate that organic
matter was not inert but was oxidized by mineralizing solutions. Numerous
oxidation reactions are possible (to CO2, ether, carbonyl, or other groups),
however, and preliminary thermo- dynamic calculations show that they occur over
a wide range of oxidation-reduction conditions. It is proposed to determine the
nature of oxidation and mineralizing reactions by (1) extract and Infrared
analyses of kerogen to identify oxidized compounds; and (2) thermodynamic
calculations to compare the redox state of organic matter to that of ore and
alteration mineralization. Successful completion of the proposed research will
lead to deeper insight into the influence of organic matter on the site and
mechanism of gold deposition and may lead to more cost- effective schemes for
discovering new deposits.
