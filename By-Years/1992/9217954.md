A reanalysis of the extensive helioseismic data set from Big Bear Solar
Observatory will be undertaken to extract all the information which it contains.
A search will also be made for variation of the solar oscillations with the
solar cycle since the data covers the entire interval from solar minimum to
maximum. New precise radial velocity data will be obtained for bright solar type
stars to attempt to detect individual p-mode oscillations analogous to those in
the sun.
