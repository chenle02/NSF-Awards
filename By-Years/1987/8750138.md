This Biology Department is implementing a curricular change which is designed to
provide Biology majors and other Science students with experience in using a
modern, quantitative approach in their laboratory studies rather than the more
descriptive approach of former years. Most changes involve the Molecular-
Cellular Biology course which is being expanded into a two-semester format.
There is a parallel upgrading of its laboratories under way. New, significantly
improved laboratory exercises are being made possible through the acquisition of
a gas chromatograph, a UV-visible spectrophotometer and a liquid scintillation
counter. Further improvements in the program are being made by extending the
Department's new analytical capabilities to other courses, and by supplementing
such work in the introductory laboratories for Science majors.
