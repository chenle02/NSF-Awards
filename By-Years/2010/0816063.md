How do individual differences in children's brain mechanism for number abilities
relate to gains during first grade mathematics, and how might first grade
instruction drive changes in such brain mechanisms? These questions are
addressed using a battery of brain imaging measures including brain structure
(MRI,DTI), bloodflow changes (fMRI), and electrical responses (ERP). Pre-post
brain measures track changes over the course of a school year within two groups
segregated by a "school's cutoff date" into young first graders and old
kindergarteners. This group contrast allows the impact of first grade
instruction to be differentiated from maturation and school attendance.
