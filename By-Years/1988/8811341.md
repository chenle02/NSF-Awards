Funds are requested to make final improvements and design changes needed to
establish the SIO water-tunnel respirometer, the "elasmotunatron," as a highly
functional national facility. This facility, built almost entirely from funds
provided by NSF DMB 85-00261, is the largest recirculating water tunnel ever
constructed for biological studies, and has been designed in such a manner to
allow its use at sea for research on open-water pelagic fishes such as tunas,
jacks, and certain sharks that cannot be kept in healthy condition in laboratory
aquaria. The instrument is now fully functional; however, our work with it has
revealed design and performance limitations that can be rectified to permit
superior performance. Funds required to complete modification of the basic
structure and operational features are requested.
