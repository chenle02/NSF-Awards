Dr. Jo Handelsman is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor in the
Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University.
Research in the Handelsman lab focuses on understanding the structure and
function of microbial communities. She has served as a highly effective mentor
of undergraduates and graduate students in her research lab, launching many
faculty careers from among her students. Beyond her own research lab, Handelsman
has mentored many women and minority faculty and students nationally and
internationally. Dr. Handelsman's goals are to produce students who bring
confidence, rigor, and ethical values to the range of scientific activities -
experimental design, analysis, and communication. Dr. Handelsman co-founded the
Women in Science and Engineering Leadership Institute (WISELI), an NSF-funded
initiative to study and address the barriers to advancement of women in science.
In this role, she developed programs that have strong mentoring components that
have led to campus-wide changes. While at the University of Wisconsin, Dr.
Handelsman developed a mentoring course and an accompanying book that are used
to teach mentoring at more than 64 universities in the United States. The
Wisconsin Mentoring Seminar is an 8-session course intended to help mentors
improve their skills through reading, discussion, brainstorming, and mutual
support with other mentors. She extended this work to women in Arab countries
through a State Department initiative to advance women in science in Islamic
countries. Her work on the "science of mentoring" has been used as the basis for
mentoring programs for women and minorities at all levels of academic science.
She continues to be a hands-on mentor while extending her mentoring hand to a
global community of women and other underrepresented groups.
