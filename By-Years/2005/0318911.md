This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new UV sparker remediation process that is low cost, has no envelope
to clean, and offers the potential to eliminate the need for chemical additives.
Most UV commercial water remediation processes utilize mercury lamps, which have
safety concerns associated with mercury and are significant cost components, due
both to their cost and to the need for periodic cleaning of the lamp envelope.
Also, chemical additives such as peroxide are a significant cost and have safety
concerns. The proposed sparker UV remediation system employs pulsed high power
electric discharge in water that produces UV light and OH radicals in the water,
which combine to provide enhanced remediation of organic contaminants. The
research objective is to demonstrate the commercial viability of UV sparker
water remediation through the optimization of a sparker with high UV efficiency
and remediation testing of key organic contaminants.

The commercial application of this project will be in the treatment of municipal
water streams and plant waste effluents to remove organic contaminants
