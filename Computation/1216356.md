This project focuses on numerical approximation of wave propagation phenomena in
transient cases, with an emphasis on techniques based on the use of boundary
integral methods. As a set of physically motivated applications, the
investigator will concentrate on different models of scattering of acoustic
waves in two and three dimensions and in wave-structure interaction. The
proposal includes numerical analysis and implementation of three kinds of
schemes: (1) Galerkin and delta-based space semi-discretization with Convolution
Quadrature for time domain boundary integral equations; (2) coupling of Finite
and Boundary Elements with Convolution Quadrature in time, for models that
combine the acoustic wave equation on non-homogeneous media with time domain
boundary integral equations; (3) Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods for
complex wave propagation problems, with an emphasis on wave-structure
interaction in the time domain. At the analytical level, the investigator and
his collaborators will work on the development of new mathematical tools for
time domain boundary integral equations, using time domain techniques instead of
the usual Laplace domain tools.

Computer simulation is an indispensable part of modern science and technology,
often showing the path in design of new devices and predicting the behavior of
complicated physical models that are expensive to experiment with. Through deep
mathematical understanding, numerical analysis gives not only certainty in the
ability of the computational simulations to yield the right answers, but also
shows the expected quality of these results, and proposes new techniques to
handle problems of increasing difficulty. The investigator and his team will
work on the development of algorithmic and mathematical tools to study transient
phenomena. The proposed work deals with propagation of sound and the interaction
of mechanical vibrations with fluid motion, with potential applications in the
simulation of propagation of noise inside vibrating structures (vehicles, for
instance). The techniques that the investigator and his team will develop are
general in scope and can be potentially applied to other wave propagation
problems, including seismic and electromagnetic waves.
