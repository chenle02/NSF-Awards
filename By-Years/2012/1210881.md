Local adaptation occurs when individuals have higher fitness in their native
habitats compared to individuals from other habitats. Yet, often the exact
factors leading to this are unclear. By utilizing lake and stream populations of
a freshwater fish species, the blackstripe topminnow (Fundulus notatus), this
work will enhance our understanding of local adaptation to these two habitats
and add to our understanding of how body size and shape may reflect local
adaptation. It will also examine the effects of changes in flow regime on
contemporary evolution in fish, as many Illinois rivers have been impounded to
create lakes for recreational fishing. Just as importantly, this work will
benefit the local community through providing research opportunities for several
college undergraduates and educating citizenry about native Illinois fishes
through outreach events.
