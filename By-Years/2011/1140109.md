North Carolina A&amp;T State University is transforming a traditional laboratory
course to incorporate real world sustainable topics and case studies. By using
guided-inquiry methods, this project is creating a collection of portable case
study and Problem Based Learning (PBL) modules that can be used by STEM
instructors to increase students' interest in and retention of course material
related to environmental engineering, as well as to enhance students' critical
thinking skills. The case studies are short, realistic scenarios that provide
relevant detail about an environmental problem, while the PBL modules use real
world problems that are assigned as large projects to student teams. The goal is
to determine if these methods improve student learning about the ideas,
principles, and practices for sustainable practices and design. A community of
faculty is working toward promoting the use of these methods in undergraduate
laboratory courses by recruiting other faculty to test the sustainability
modules and develop additional guided-inquiry based STEM labs. The case studies
and PBL modules are available for faculty and teachers to use in courses to
introduce hands-on activities in college level courses, middle to high school
courses, and for outreach activities focusing on real-world cases in
sustainability. Assessment includes collecting and analyzing qualitative and
quantitative data concerning student and faculty attitudes toward sustainability
and student engagement and comprehension of the material.
