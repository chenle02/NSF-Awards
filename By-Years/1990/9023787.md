Ferns are ideal for evolutionary and developmental studies. Molecular studies
tracing fern evolution are especially important because there is a paucity of
morphological characters for use in systematic studies and taxonomists disagree
about the unity of some traits. In this research, the investigator will study
the organization of the genomes in several fern families. Genome rearrangements
are valuable for determining linkage at higher orders of taxonomic
classification where comparisons of restriction site mutations are precluded
because the genetic distance is too great. It is likely that one could trace the
evolution of the rearrangements by finding representatives that are immediate
between the primitive fern >Osmunda> and the higher ferns. The investigator will
collect and analyze the old world tree ferns for chloroplast DNA mutations and
compare these results to data on new world tree ferns. One current hypothesis,
which has some support from angiosperm studies, is that species from the old and
new worlds that look alike differ more than different species which are in close
proximity to each other. The study described would address this issue. Ferns
also offer several potentially valuable features for studying gene regulation.
The haploid generation is a small, fully independent plant that grows from a
single cell (the spore) and can be bisexual. Unlike flowering plants, self
fertilization produces a diploid plant that is 100% homozygous in one
generation. Transformation of the spore will allow the investigator to generate
plants homozygous for the introduced trait. The particular genes that will be
examined are male determining genes. Spores of certain species that are sown in
the presence of the hormone antheridiogen germinate to produce a male haploid
plant. This suggests that a different gene(s) is activated in response to this
hormone than when the spore is sown without the hormone and in isolation from
other gametophytes. Subtraction hybridization will be used to enrich for
specific messages related to these two different developmental pathways.
