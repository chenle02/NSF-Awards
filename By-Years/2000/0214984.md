This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a
fundamentally different approach to digital magnetic sensors. The traditional
approach combines a sensor having an analog output with an electronic analog-to-
digital converter. In the proposed magnetic field sensor, the analog-to-digital
conversion occurs in the physical mechanism of the sensor itself. With this
approach only inexpensive digital electronic circuits are needed to complete the
sensor system, resulting in a robust, and economically manufacturable
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being based on standard integrated circuit
processing techniques, the new digital magnetometer will be easily mass-
produced. The new products will be smaller, cheaper and use less power than
existing sensors in a range of applications including: digital compasses,
geomaganetic surveying equipment, and vehicle sensors for traffic control and
intrusion detection. The very small size of the sensor will also enable new
applications using high-density sensor arrays for example in currency and
document validation or portable biomedical assay devices.
