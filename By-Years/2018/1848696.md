This project seeks to investigate a framework that reassesses admissions
criteria to deemphasize standardized tests by considering a holistic perspective
of a student's academic experience. Research shows that putting too much weight
on standardized tests results in a misrepresentation of a student's actual
potential for academic success. Students, particularly students of color and
women, are often negatively impacted by stereotype threat which has been shown
to result in lower test scores. Therefore, test scores do not accurately reflect
a student's ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To broaden participation in
engineering, the College of Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is
broadening the admission review process to deemphasize standardized test scores
and include a wider array of academic and social indicators. The changing
demographics of Nebraska's high school graduates, and in particular the growth
of the Hispanic/Latino/a population, make University of Nebraska-Lincoln an
ideal place to study the impact of these changes on retention and graduation and
the efficacy of subsequent student support programs for these
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
