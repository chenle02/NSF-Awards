Abstract ATM-9527071 Robert G. Fovell University of California Los Angles
Upgrade of UCLA's UNIDATA Node Funds will upgrade the Internet Data Distribution
(IDD) node at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of
California at Los Angles (UCLA). Upgrading the computer power and memory will
allow better support of existing and future sites with minimum impact on
activities locally at UCLA. UCLA will serve as a short term data archive sight
to provide the community with data in the event of services interrupted at other
sights.
