9310564 Ryan With this Research Planning Grant, Dr. Ryan will study the various
techniques necessary to improve the hydrocode that is used to model impact
events. A major process affecting the growth and evolution of planetary bodies
is hypervelocity impact. Although some of the basic principles of impact
phenomena are moderately well understood, how material fragments near the impact
site and how initial conditions affect that fragmentation have been difficult to
quantify.
