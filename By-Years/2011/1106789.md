The main goal of this research project is to develop efficient statistical
techniques for regression analysis of time-to-event data with complex censoring
such as current status data or interval-censored data. Specifically, the
investigator will study three types of problems that often occur in medical and
public health researches. One is to develop efficient score function-based
estimation procedures for univariate current status or interval-censored data
that apply to more general situations and give practitioners more flexibilities
in analyzing these data. The second is to develop efficient score function-based
estimation procedures for bivariate current status or interval-censored data and
the third is to develop efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedures
for bivariate current status or interval-censored data. The second and the third
parts will investigate the same problem but employ different modeling and
inference strategy to allow one to focus on different aspects of the data
analysis or different questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study
will advance not only the theoretical research in statistics pertaining to
survival analysis but also provide statistical methods for data analysis in a
wide range of scientific disciplines including public health, medicine,
demographics, economics and psychology.
