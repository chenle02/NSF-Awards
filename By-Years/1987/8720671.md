The objective of this project is to integrate methods of chaos theory and
nonlinear dynamics now used in the natural and physical sciences with
econometrics. The project does this in a way that develops useful new tools for
macroeconomics and finance. The strategy for building tools is to stay close to
the realities of actual data, actual econometric practice, and the
applications-- giving up abstract generality in the process. The specific
projects consist of the following: (1) turn the residual diagnostic for
deterministic chaos into a "residual test" for deterministic chaos. (2) Work out
statistical distribution theory for dimension, Kolmogorov entropy, and Lyapunov
exponents. Compare and contrast the size and power characteristics of a test
developed by Brock of the null hypothesis of independence with other tests such
as characteristic function tests, distribution function tests, and Cramer/ Von
Mises forms of the tests. (4) Build a general test for nonlinearity and compare
its size and power characteristics to other nonlinearity tests such as the
bispectral skewness test, tests for bilinearity, tests for ARCH and GARCH, and
semi- nonparametric tests for nonlinearity. (5) Apply these tests to data in
macroeconomics and finance. (6) Build macro economic models and equilibrium
asset pricing models that explain the pattern of nonlinearity found.
