9220855 Varaiya The electric power industry is being significantly restructured
in order to improve performance by reducing capital expenditures through better
equipment utilization, by reducing fuel cost through better inter-firm
coordination, and by offering differentiated services that better match customer
needs. The realization of these performance gains will require a vastly expanded
capability to monitor and control the entire power network. It is proposed to
design and implement a laboratory- scale Distribution Network Management System
(DNMS). Logically, the DNMS will be organized into three layers:the
communication facility which permits management stations to exchange monitoring
and control information will remote physical elements such as distribution
capacitors and customer meters; the application facility which permits
implementation of algorithms for particular functions such as adjusting
capacitors to minimize losses; and the interpretation facility which hides from
the other facilities the heterogeneity of the physical elements. The DNMS system
will be designed and tested on simulators of the bulk power and distribution
systems. The research will build a recent work on distribution automation and
power utility communication architecture, and on recent work on
telecommunications network management. ***
