The research involves the study of the geometry of quaternionic orbifolds and
Einstein metrics of positive scalar curvature. The latter includes the
construction of metrics on torus bundles over Kaehler-Einstein orbifolds. These
have applications to recent advances in supergravity and the non- linear sigma
model in particle physics.
