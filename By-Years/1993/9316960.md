9316960 Pospichal PIs will examine magnitude, mode and nature of extinctions
across the K/T boundary for calcareous nannofossils by conducting a global
synthesis. They will 1) address issues of magnitude and synchroneity, reworking
and survivorship; 2) quantitatively analyze assemblages to address changes
before the boundary and issues of differing geographic response; 3) conduct
stable isotope analysis of Thoracosphaera to assess impact on bulk analyses of
isotopes.
