This is a collaborative structural, geochronologic and paleomagnetic study of
late Cenozoic tectonics in the NE Mojave desert. The major faults in this region
are sinistral and east- trending, unlike in the rest of the Mojave where NW-
trending, dextral, strike-slip faulting prevails. This study will determine the
relative importance and timing of the two fault systems. The results will
provide information on the interaction between deformation in the Mojave block
and that in the Basin and Range province, and will provide important constraints
on the mechanical processes that occur along plate boundary zones.
