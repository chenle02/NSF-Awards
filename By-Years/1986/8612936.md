This proposal seeks to study: l) The growth and product formation kinetics of
plant cell biofilms grown on inert support materials. A mathematical model is to
be formulated and tested which describes film growth and secondary metabolite
formation by plant cells with and without substrate diffusion limitations. 2)
The influence of biofilm thickness and micro-environmental conditions within the
film on cell differentiation and secondary metabolite formation. The plant
Catharanthus roseus and its secondary metabolite, ajmalicine (a pharmaceutical
used to treat blood circulation problems), has been selected as a model system
for this study. The proposed use of plant cell biofilm cultures is new and
unique and may overcome the problems of cell-cell contact and control of the
micro-environmental conditions thought to be necessary for maintaining cell
differentiation and the hyothesized higher product yields. It is suggested that
the proposed novel culturing technique could result in a better culturing
technique for other types of plant cells. The Principal Investigator is
considered to be wall qualified to carry out the proposed research and I
recommend funding of this proposal for two years in accordance with the
submitted budget.
