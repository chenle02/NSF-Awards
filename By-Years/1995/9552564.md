9552564 Maurer The Science Museum of Minnesota will prepare and circulate a 2500
sq. ft. traveling exhibit of the physical science activities from their
successful "Experiment Gallery" exhibit, previously supported by NSF. Visitors
studies indicate this gallery is the most popular and most visited of the
museum's science halls. The activities cover five areas of physics; sound and
saves, light, mechanics, weather, and electricity. It will include more than 25
activities and will go to a minimum of eighteen mid-sized and smaller museums
over a six year period. Complementary activities include the development of a
recipe book describing eleven volunteer-mediated science experiment activities
developed by Experiment Gallery staff. The tour will be managed by the Science
Museum's Touring Exhibits Department.
