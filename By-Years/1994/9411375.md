9411375 Jones This is an award to enable a group of United States researchers in
simulation to attend a conference on simulation to be held at Waseda University,
in Tokyo, Japan. The objective of the conference is to bring together
researchers from the United States and Japan to focus on the current state of
research and new directions in simulation as applied to manufacturing and
communications. The conference is sponsored by the Special Interest Group on
Systems Simulation, The Operations Research Society of Japan, and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology. The conference provides an opportunity
for US researchers to meet and discuss critical research issues with their
counterparts in Japan and other Far Eastern countries. The limited focus on
manufacturing and communication provides an opportunity for an in- depth
analysis to assess the current state of application of simulation technology in
manufacturing and identify any major obstacles present that must be overcome to
move the technology forward. Simulation as a tool has been widely used in
modeling and analyzing many engineering problems, especially complex
manufacturing systems.
