The objective of this research is to explore the use of automatic learning
techniques to enhance the performance of scheduling algorithms. The work
combines operations research and artificial intelligence methodologies to
exploit the structure of the scheduling problem and the morphology of the data.
The expected results are fundamental advances in the science base of planning
and scheduling problems and the development of strategies for the efficient
solution of practical batch scheduling problems.
