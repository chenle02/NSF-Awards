Boron phosphide (BP) is a semiconductor with a wide band gap, and exceptional
physical properties, including a melting point greater than 3,000oC, high
temperature oxidation resistance, chemical stability, high thermal conductivity
and extreme hardness. These attributes make it attractive for use in harsh
environments. Unfortunately, these same physical properties make it extremely
difficult to synthesize by conventional methods. The objective of this project
is to synthesize single crystal epitaxial BP layers on &lt;100&gt; silicon
substrates using electrocrystallization. Electrocrystallization from molten salt
melts allows the growth of single crystal layers at low temperatures
(700-1000oC). Because the crystallization process is driven electrically instead
of thermally, extraordinary fine control can be exercised over the deposition
rate and composition. Also, the process can be readily scaled up to produce
large wafers or boules.
