It is proposed to develop a new reactor, the so-called two- impinging-jets
crystallizer. By impinging two streams in countercurrent in a small volume, a
high level of mixing is achievable. The proposed reactor can be used to yield
micrometer size crystals. Oscillatory motion of fluid particles near the jet
interaction zone should insure good mixing and a controlled residence time. An
experimental study will be undertaken to establish the feasibility and
performance of this reactor. The turbulent mixing at the impinging zone will be
hydrodynamically simulated by using a continuum approach. The proposed reactor
has potential to improve the process of crystal growth for producing silica,
various metal alkoxides sols, pharmaceutical and photographic materials.
