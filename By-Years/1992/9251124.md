Fundamentals of Plant Physiology, and other allied courses that use plant
physiology instrumentation, now feature modern equipment used to encourage
inquiry based learning. The Plant Physiology course is designed for a mixture of
non-majors, majors, and pre-service teachers. Computer interfaced equipment
includes oxygen electrodes, a gas chromatograph, and photometers, leaf area
meters and spectroradiometers. The class analyzes the effects of various
parameters on gas exchange and photosynthesis, photobiology, nitrogen metabolism
and respiration.
