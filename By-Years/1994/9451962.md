9451962 Kelly Money is requested to purchase twelve microcomputers and six
printers to be installed in our General Inorganic Chemistry laboratory.
Interfacing experiments will be developed for that laboratory in the inquiry
(discovery) mode of laboratory instruction using some of the special features of
the Lotus 123 spreadsheet. Also, laboratory exercises using a database of the
properties of the elements and a molecular modeling program will be developed.
