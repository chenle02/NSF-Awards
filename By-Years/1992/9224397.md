In avian cooperative breeding systems, one or more nonbreeding individuals help
the breeding pair to rear their young. In the Florida scrub jay, most of these
nonbreeding individuals help by feeding nestlings and fledglings. The doctoral-
dissertation research of Mr. Stephen Schoech will examine the hormonal
mechanisms underlying the delay of breeding and the provisioning of non-
descendant young. Mr. Schoech will compare the hormonal profiles of breeders and
nonbreeders throughout the breeding season. Additional comparison between
nonbreeders of different ages and relatedness to breeders will illuminate the
importance of these factors. Mr. Schoech will also examine the importance of
body condition and the availability of potential mates, and will manipulate
hormone levels experimentally by giving individuals hormone implants. The
combination of correlational and experimental methods should greatly augment our
understanding of how seemingly mature individuals delay breeding and exhibit
isolated parent-like behaviors.
