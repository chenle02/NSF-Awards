The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are important
cell recognition molecules for the immune system. They are characterized by a
very high degree of polymorphism within a species. Because the T cells of the
immune system depend upon the MHC polymorphisms for the discrimination of self
and nonself, it is important to understand how the observed polymorphisms relate
to the function of the MHC molecules. In previous studies this laboratory has
shown that one of the four polymorphic regions in the class II A-beta
polypeptide specifies the epitopes recognized by antibodies. A model of the
three-dimensional structure of the class II molecule has been proposed based on
the recently determined x-ray crystal structure of the HLA A2 class I molecule.
In this model the region that has been determined to specify the antibody
epitopes is a series of residues between two conserved alpha-helices. The
structure of this region has not been predicted, but its position in the
molecule suggests that it would be accessible to solvent and thus to antibody
molecules and potentially also to the T cell receptor. Of the other three
polymorphic regions in the beta 1 domain, two are likely to be inaccessible,
while the other is likely to be accessible. In the studies now proposed, the
role of each of the polymorphic regions in determining the epitopes recognized
by T cells will be analyzed. The naive T cell responses to a panel of cell lines
expressing limited and defined alterations in the class II I-A molecule will be
quantitated by limiting dilution analysis of responder cell frequencies. The set
of cell lines expressing variant I-A molecules has been produced by site-
directed mutagenesis and DNA-mediated gene transfer. These studies should
indicate which of the polymorphic regions of the MHC class II molecule determine
epitopes recognized by T cells. The detailed information on the functional
protions of the class II molecule that will be obtained in these studies can
then be correlated with the details of the structure of the molecule as they
become available.
