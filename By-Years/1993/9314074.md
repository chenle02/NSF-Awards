9314074 Davis In this project, the Principal Investigator will deploy mid-depth
floats referred to as ALACE (Autonomous LAgrangian Circulation Explorer) floats
at about 1000 meters depth in the Indian Ocean as part of the Indian Ocean
Expedition for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). These floats
surface about every 25 days, to report position and, in the case of 120 of them,
a temperature profile. This proposal is part of the WOCE program to map the
multi-year average absolute velocity on a single level over the entire world's
ocean. ***
