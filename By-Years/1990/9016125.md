The proposed instrumentation will be used primarily in research on the
distribution of power in exchange networks. The central question of this
research tradition is how position in a network of exchange relations confers
relative advantage or disadvantage in obtaining favorable rates of exchange with
partners. The instrumentation will be used to configure a network of PCs, all
linked to each other through a main file server. Experimenters will be able to
realize any communication network design by blocking communication channels
between any two subject PCs and thus investigate the effect of network shape on
the distribution of power among subjects. The instrumentation makes possible the
systematic manipulation of additional "parameters of exchange" beyond network
configuration. Finally, the particular combination of hardware and software
provides ideal capabilities for online data records of all significant events in
the exchange process.
