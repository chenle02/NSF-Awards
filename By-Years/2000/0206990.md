This project is developing a reliable and valid statics assessment instrument to
evaluate student learning. In the first step we are working to define the core
concepts in statics. Our second step is to create an appropriate instrument, a
set of questions that tests students' basic knowledge of statics as well as
their depth of comprehension and application skills. This development process is
based on the success of the widely accepted Force Concepts Inventory in Physics.
In the third step we are undertaking extensive field-testing to assure the
validity and reliability of this instrument. The fourth step, following the
development and validation of the instrument, is to initiate national
dissemination of the Statics Knowledge Inventory instrument. To help in this
effort we have created a national board of mechanics faculty. This instrument
will find wide application because many engineering programs require their
majors to study statics. Our project is providing faculty with a validated
instrument for formative assessing as they develop and refine their individual
courses to enhance student learning. We are also working with a commercial
publisher to disseminate and publish this work.
