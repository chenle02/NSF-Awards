Pinsonneault, Marc AST-9731621 Drs. Pinsonneault and Terndrup will study
stellar rotation and mixing in low mass stars, by developing theoretical models
that incorporate new input physics and model angular momentum transport and
mixing, which are constrained by observed data on stellar abundances and
rotation. They will begin with models appropriate to main-sequence stars, with
application of mixing scenarios to the problem of light element (especially
Lithium) abundances as a function of age, rotation, and composition. A key goal
is to construct a physically self-consistent model which simultaneously explains
both mixing and the evolution of angular momentum. Successful main-sequence
models will then become the starting point for models of evolved red giant
stars, which will test the theory with observations of abundance anomalies and
horizontal branch rotation. ***
