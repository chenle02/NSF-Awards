The tribological behavior of Al-SiC metal matrix composites sliding against
hardened steel will be studied. The wear behavior of the composites and of the
steel counterface will be determined and related to microstructure. The results
will be used to validate a statistical model to be developed for the wear rate.
The model will be based on a theory of random clumping of the hard particles in
the aluminum matrix and on the assumption that the wear of the steel is abrasive
in nature and caused by the hard phase in the composite.
