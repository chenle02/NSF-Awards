The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Valerie Walters of
Lafayette College in her research studies on the triplet states of halogenated
porphyrins using phosphorescence, triplet-triplet absorption and transient
resonance Raman spectroscopies. The overall goal of these studies is to
investigate the effect of various halogen substituents in the beta-pyrrole and
phenyl ring positions on triplet state geometry, electronic structure and
lifetime. Semiempirical calculations will also be carried out to aid in the
spectral analysis. Porphyrins have long been used as catalysts in oxidation and
photooxidation reactions. Recent work has found that halogen (chlorine, bromine,
fluorine, iodine) substituents substantially increase the stability of porphyrin
catalysts. Thus, much experimental and computational work has been performed to
investigate the effect of halogens on the properties of the porphyrin electron
ground state. However, very little work has been carried out on the excited
(triplet) state properties, despite the fact that porphyrins are widely used
triplet state photosensitizers for singlet oxygen. These studies will make a
significant contribution to our understanding of the energetics of this
increasingly important class of molecules.
