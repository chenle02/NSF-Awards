This project is an investigation of how molecules, the smallest particles of a
substance, respond to very intense pulses of laser light. This is done to reveal
the structure of molecules, and to understand how to actively force important
molecules through processes that nature would normally not allow. The
investigations will make use of a unique device, in which the number of
molecules and the intensity of the light are precisely controlled. This
innovative approach will allow the study of molecules in a reliable, exact, and
accurate way --- beyond anything seen before in this
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecules that are investigated are important
building blocks of larger molecules. Such molecules are found, for instance, in
the pharmaceutical industry, in biology, in environmental research, and also in
outer space. On the human resources level, this project gives students in
various phases of their education unique opportunities to work in a modern and
professional research lab. They will work with state-of-the-art and highly
specialized scientific equipment. Promoting scientific research, this gives
students first hand experience which can help them decide whether a career in
science or technology would be right for them.
