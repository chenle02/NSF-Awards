9310936, PI-Shapiro: With this project, the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology
will improve its seawater system. The facility has undergone a recent expansion,
resulting in a doubling of resident faculty. The number of active research
programs has tripled, and an additional new faculty position will begin in
September 1993. The expansion has also resulted in an increased use of the
present seawater system, along with increased need for reliability in support of
funded research programs. Specifically, the plan is to improve the seawater
intake system, construct a second pumping system to be placed in parallel with
the existing system, duplicate the piping from pump to storage tanks, provide a
back up air compressor system, and provide a monitoring and alarm system. The
improvements were designed with redundancy, serviceability, and performance as
prime criteria, and should result in a much increased level of security for on
going research programs. The workplan is excellent. The facility is growing at a
rapid rate in terms of productive research use. Research projects supported by
the facility are significant to modern understanding and management of marine
resources as well as to fields of basic biology.
