Abstract

0409420 Genda Chen Univ Missouri/ Rolla

The objective of this project is to develop a network distributed sensing system
for real-time failure detection of civil infrastructures. Electromagnetic wave
guide sensors will be used. Testing of coaxial crack and strain sensors has
proved the proposed concept. Potential of transmission-line cable sensing will
be fully exploited in this study.

This project will initiate a new sensing technology with three novel distributed
sensors. The design of such sensors, their calibration, measurement in real-
world civil systems and modeling of M-E property conversion, signal attenuation,
detection, etc will be investigated. In addition, structure-sensor interaction
will be modeled and optimized.

An award in the modest amount of $100,000 for three years is recommended.
