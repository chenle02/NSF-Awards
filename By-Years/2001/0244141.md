Virginia Tech continues operation of a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site. The theme of the REU site is adhesives and adhesion science. Twelve
undergraduate students are recruited every year nationwide for a twelve-week
summer research experience, with specific recruitment efforts at Historically
Black Colleges and Universities in the Southeast. Undergraduate students
participate in science and engineering research projects in the areas of
nanomaterial reinforcement and testing of adhesive bonds, and chemical
modification of surfaces and films for improved adhesion. In addition, REU
participants attend a weekly seminar on oral and written communication skills,
and professional development sessions
