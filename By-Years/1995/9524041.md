9524041 Li Trace Gas Emissions and Soil Carbon Sequestration in Agricultural
Lands in the US and China Agricultural ecosystems are perhaps the most dynamic
of terrestrial ecosystems on our planet. There is a very strong linkage between
carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics and agricultural management practices (e.g.
fertilization, tillage, manure amendment, and irrigation). In both China and the
US, efforts are underway to modify agricultural management to enhance soil
fertility and reduce soil degradation and environmental pollution. Impacts of
agricultural management on soil C and N dynamics will depend on climate, soil
properties, and agricultural practices. A process-oriented model will be used
for prediction of the influence of climate, soil conditions and cropping
practices on soil C and N storage and trace gas fluxes. This study will generate
estimates of (1) current soil organic C and N pools, (2) emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and
ammonia (NH3) from agricultural lands, (3) trends of changes in soil organic C,
and (4) impacts of changing agricultural management practices on trace gas
fluxes and soil C sequestration in the US and China. ??
