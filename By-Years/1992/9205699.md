The principal investigator will experimentally study aspects of fluids and melts
in a reduced mantle. In particular, he will work on application of the sulfide
oxybarometer to mantle phase assemblages, the determination of moissanite
stability, the determination of CO solubility and speciation in sodium silicate
melt, and the determination of the solubility of certain mineral assemblages in
methane-bearing fluid at mantle pressures. All these studies have bearing on the
redox state of the mantle at present and in the past, and on the development of
the Earth as a whole over time.
