For the sake of simplicity and convenience, topologists often focus on compact
spaces. Nevertheless, non-compact spaces---with all of their associated
complications---are frequently unavoidable. For example, the complement of a
compact subset of a closed manifold is not compact. Hence, a topologist studying
embeddings is quickly forced to consider non-compact manifolds. In fact, much of
the foundational work in the area of non-compact manifold topology was motivated
by questions about embeddings. While non-compact manifolds and complexes
continue to play a central role in topology, an important new source of examples
has entered the picture. Increasingly, the examples of widespread interest arise
as covering spaces of compact manifolds and cell complexes. In fact, progress on
some of the most fundamental questions in geometric topology and geometric group
theory demand a better understanding of these types of spaces---most of which
are non-compact. With these examples in mind, this project aims to generalize
and expand our understanding of non-compact manifolds and cell complexes. Of
particular interest are Z-compactifications, structure theorems for ends of non-
compact manifolds, and existence and uniqueness questions for boundaries of
groups.

Many objects encountered in geometry and topology---like the real line and the
Euclidean plane---are "unbounded" or "open" in nature. These spaces are
fundamentally different from bounded or "compact" spaces, such as a line
segment, a circle, or the surface of the earth. The extra flexibility permitted
by unboundedness opens the door to exotic behavior "near infinity". There are
many examples of unbounded spaces that---although they are constructed from
simple bounded pieces---have quite complicated geometry and topology near
infinity. One strategy for investigating such a space is to "compactify" it by
adding a boundary at infinity---much as an artist mentally creates a horizon of
vanishing points to help him draw in perspective. When this is possible,
properties of the boundary can reveal important characteristics of the original
space. In some sense, the boundary represents a crystallization of the "topology
at infinity". Another strategy for studying an unbounded space involves breaking
it into a manageable collection of bounded pieces. Ideally, one would like to
choose pieces that capture key properties of the space, thus allowing one to
study the non-compact space---one compact piece at a time.
