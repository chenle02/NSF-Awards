9702079 Torczon This project will set up, advertise, and award support for
around 19 selected faculty members to attend the Programming Language Design and
Implementation conference (PLDI'97) in Las Vegas, June 15-18, 1997. In addition,
SIGPLAN will sponsor an educational tutorial track and waive the tutorial fees
and conference registration fees for the selected participants. The topics of
the tutorials are chosen to improve the effectiveness of faculty members
teaching undergraduate courses in the area of programming and programming
languages. The selection will be based on a competitive process with several
criteria, the most significant being that the person be a teaching faculty
member at an undergraduate institution with a large minority enrollment or a
women's college. They will also be asked to demonstrate that they lack
independent institutional support to attend without such funding. This activity
follows the lines of similar activities sponsored for PLDI in 1994 and 1996. It
is expected that this opportunity for faculty directly involved in the teaching
of undergraduate minority and women students will assist these students in
entering successful careers in computer or related sciences. ***
