9353501 Mansfield The Southeastern Regional Education Service Center (SERESC) of
New Hampshire addresses the needs of twelve school districts that include 20
elementary and 10 middle schools, representing 25% of the states total K-12
enrollment. With guidance from the SERESC staff, these districts have studied
their needs and created action plans for the implementation of hands-on inquiry-
based science instruction in elementary and middle schools throughout the
region. SERESC is now planning to coordinate an important reform effort within
each district and to create a regional network of collaborating reformers. Two
teachers and a principal from each of these schools will receive training as
instructional leaders for science and agents of systemic change in their
districts. Teachers will receive content instruction, evaluate instructional
material (e.g., EDC Insights, BSCS, TIMS, Microcosmos, Kids Net), construct
grade-level instructional plans, develop strategies for curriculum integration,
and design assessment vehicles. The proposed project has the potential for
substantial impact throughout the region of southeastern New Hampshire, and it
can serve as a model for other regional consortia of small school districts.
Cost sharing amounts to 42% of the NSF contribution. ***
