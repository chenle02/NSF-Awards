The aim of the researchers is to study multiple stochastic integrals and
multilinear random forms. A general stochastic integral of functions of multiple
variables with respect to multidimensional stochastic processes is a random
variable. The major goals of the research are to find the class of integrable
functions and to study the distributional properties of the integral. A major
technique in studying these integrals is the decoupling inequality. The
investigators have already done work in this area. They will continue to extend
the known decoupling techniques. They will also study the applicability of the
hyper- contraction principle and resulting comparison theorems.
