Recent trends in the relative improvements in speeds between the Central
Processing Unit (CPU) and Input/Output (I/O system components suggest that the
I/O system could become a bottleneck in computer systems. If this happens, many
applications could become so I/O-limited that increases in CPU speeds would no
longer be helpful. High performance I/O systems are needed to address this
imbalance. For many applications such as database systems, I/O threaten to be a
bottleneck limiting performance. The proposed research will investigate two
issues related to I/O performance databases. First, we will focus on developing
and verifying algorithms that improve the efficiency of random small writes.
This type of workload dominates many on-line transactions processing (OLTP)
applications. Second, we will characterize I/O performance in very large
databases and develop a data management model for improved I/O performance.
Applications such as brokerage houses, retail chains and mail order houses are
increasingly making use of very large databases for advanced OLTP applications.
The research will be simulation based. Commercial I/O traces and I/O traces from
VAX 8800 machines at the Florida International University will be used as
workloads for the study.
