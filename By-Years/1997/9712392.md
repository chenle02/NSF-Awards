ABSTRACT EEC-9712392 SCOTT This proposal requests continued direct funding, for
an additional two year period, of a Center Evaluator at two Industry/University
Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRCs). The two centers are the Center for
Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of Washington (UW) and the
Center for the Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC), a multi-
site center, headquartered at the Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman,
Washington. Four additional universities are involved in CDADIC as satellite
research centers. These additional CDADIC sites are located at: the University
of Washington (UW) in Seattle, Washington, Opegon State University (OSU) in
Corvallis, Oregon-, The State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, New
York, and, a probable additional site to be affiliated in 1997 it has 1996-97
planning grant is Tuskegee University (TU) in Tuskegee, Alabama. The evaluator
will continue to be responsible for implementation of the I/UCRC Center
Assessment Program at both centers. This is a series of three related studies
designed to identify the factors that have been shown to contribute to and/or
inhibit attainment of each center's goals and outcomes. Included among the three
basic studies are: a) developing comparative descriptions and conducting
analyses of each center's developmental history in the form of annual historical
profile updates; b) conducting intermediate and long-term studies of each
center's organizational effectiveness using faculty and sponsor outcome
instruments, and; c) conducting exit interviews of industrial sponsors that
terminate their affiliation with either center.
