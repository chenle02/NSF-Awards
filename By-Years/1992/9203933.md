Moy will continue his joint work with Barbasch investigating the unitary dual
of a reductive p-adic group and will investigate with Hales certain ways to
establish what is called a uniform germ expansion for orbital integrals. The
research in unitarity, with a goal of classifying all unitary representations,
will be to investigate certain basic representations called unipotent
representations. The investigations in uniform germ expansions will be to find a
way for determining whether two spaces of distributions are equal. The theory of
Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been
one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical
vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation
theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself,
particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,
especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
