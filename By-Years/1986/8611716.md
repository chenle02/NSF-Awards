By far the common method of producing ceramic powders is by comminution. Laser
and plasma arc methods are also being investigated to produce fine ceramic
powder. A novel method of producing ultrafine ceramic powder (20-2000A) is
proposed. The method is known as Reactive Electrode Submerged Arc (RESA) process
and it involves striking an arc under a fluid, using metal electrodes of a metal
which will react with the fluid being used. Thus, aluminum electrodes in water
would form A1203, Si electrodes in NH3, Si3N4 will be developed for this
process.
