The science departments at the University of Oregon propose a two week residence
summer program to cultivate an interest in science and to promote science as a
career choice for selected high school students who are ready to enter their
junior or senior year. Approximately thirty-five faculty members from Chemistry,
Biology, Geology, Physics, and Computer and Information Science will be
selectively recruited to participate in the program. Initial response by the
faculty to this proposal has been positive. The Summer Science Experience will
focus on the theme Frontiers in Research that leads to laboratory exploration at
a level at which high school students can gain from the experience. Some of the
topics to be included in the program include questions of ethics, career
choices, superconductivity, DNA recombination, synchrotron radiation,
photoelectron microscopy, artificial intelligence, plate tectonics, and topics
in neuroscience. The existing program which has been successful in introducing
high school students to many aspects of scientific research, has been self-
supporting and therefore expensive students. Funding by the NSF will strengthen
the existing project by broadening participation to previously underrepresented
groups and by insuring a more balanced program between girls and boys.
