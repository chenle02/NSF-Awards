Dr. Andrew L. Feig has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Feig received his doctoral degree from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor Stephen Lippard. Dr.
Feig will continue research at the University of Colorado at Boulder under the
sponsorship of Professor Olke Uhlenbeck. His postdoctoral research will target
understanding the interactions between metal ions and hammerhead ribozymes. The
goal is to understand how metal ions catalyze hydrolysis reactions while bound
to small RNAs and to develop methodologies to differentiate structural versus
catalytic metal centers. The work underpins a long term study of the reaction
mechanism of peptide transfer based on a metallo-RNA active site. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
