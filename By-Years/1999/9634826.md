9634826 Carroll Plastics fibers are widely used for reinforcing concretes.
Fiber-reinforced concrete is more valuable than plain concrete since it is more
durable and less susceptible to cracking. However, the processing of the fiber-
reinforced converting recycled plastics into fibers for low cost processing of
reinforcing concrete. Currently this process is not well understood in
determining the optimize process parameters. This research project will develop
mathematical models for the process and demonstrate the parameters effects on
the properties of the fibers produced experimentally. The experiments will be
conducted using a laboratory scale machine to process the recycled fibers. This
project has a balance between theory and experiment. The outcome of the research
project has potential to make the low cost processing of fiber reinforced
concrete feasible.
