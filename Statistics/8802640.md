This research is on the construction of factorial experimental designs which
are robust against time trends and where errors are more generally correlated.
The problems include (i) optimal and efficient block and row-column designs for
comparing treatments when the observations are autocorrelated, (ii) optimal and
efficient designs for estimating or predicting a response surface over a region
for correlated errors and (iii) systematic methods of generating fractional
factorial designs to meet specific experimental needs with as few runs as
possible. This research is in a subfield of statistics called experimental
design which involves the development of plans for allocating resources
efficiently. This work will extend the current theory on experimental design to
more appropriately accommodate experiments in which data is collected over a
period of time, rather than all at the same time.
