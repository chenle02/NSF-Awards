Sexually dimorphic communication signals evolve rapidly and are among the most
widespread, diverse, and conspicuous behaviors that animals produce. This
project will combine evolutionary and physiological approaches to study how
sexual differentiation of the brain evolves in relation to sex differences in
behavior. The project will address this question by comparatively studying
mechanisms that regulate sexual dimorphic signals in a species-rich family of
South American electric fish. These animals generate weak electrical signals to
communicate information about species, sex, social rank, and motivation. The
magnitude and direction of sex differences in electric communication signals
vary across species. Sex differences in these signals are regulated by hormones
like testosterone and estrogens and by neuromodulators like serotonin. The brain
circuit that controls electric communication signals is well-characterized and
relatively simple. These features facilitate investigations of how hormone-
brain-behavior interactions evolved to produce species diversity in sexual
dimorphic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;The project has four goals: (1) to compare sex
differences in signals across species and investigate the coevolution of sex
differences in different signal components; (2) to determine whether species
diversity in sexual dimorphic behavior evolves through changes in the hormonal
sensitivity of behavior; (3) to determine whether sex differences in behavior
evolve through changes in neuromodulation in brain regions that control
communication signals; and (4) to determine whether sex differences in behavior
evolve through changes in the intrinsic physiology of brain
cells.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will help collect and analyze data and will be
trained and encouraged to pursue scientific careers. The project will maintain a
robust international collaboration between Indiana University and the National
Institute of Amazon Research in Brazil. The project will generate recordings of
electric communication signals that will be deposited in a public database and
provide resources for research and teaching on animal communication, sex
differences, biodiversity, sensory biology, and biophysics.
