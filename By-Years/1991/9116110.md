Many problems of applied mathematics and scientific computing involve non-
normal matrices or operators. Recently Trefethen and his collaborators have
developed a new way of looking at such problems based on avoiding techniques
involving eigenvalues or more generally spectra, which can be ineffective or
misleading, and utilizing instead the sets known as pseudospectra. This research
project will involve further research in this direction. Numerical analysis is
an area of mathematics that continues to be important, increasingly so as more
scientific problems and areas involve more sophisticated techniques in
computation and computational technologies.//
