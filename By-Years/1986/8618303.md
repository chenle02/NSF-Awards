The research to be undertaken on this project is in the general area of
alicyclic chemistry. Two areas of research will be pursued. First, organic
synthesis at high pressure (15 kbar, 1.5 GPa) will be studied to develop
reaction processes which can be run under mild temperature conditions with
hindered substrates. New studies will be undertaken to evaluate the effect of
pressures up to 1,000 kbar under varying temperature and time conditions. New
varieties of compounds will be prepared which will be of structural and/or
biological importance. Second, the total synthesis of alicyclic natural products
will be pursued. Particular attention will be given to biologically active
materials with interesting structures, such compounds as large ring cembranoids
from insects and the ophiobolin sesterterpenes from pathogenic fungus. This
project is directed towards the development of new synthetic methods, which will
permit the preparation of new materials of biological and theoretical interest.
