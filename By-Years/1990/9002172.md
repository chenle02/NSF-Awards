This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Robin Staffin of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct collaborative research for 12
months with Dr. Toshihisa Tomie of the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba,
Japan. They will investigate the physics of plasma x-ray lasers, with a goal of
scaling to shorter wavelengths to enable holographic imaging of live biological
specimens. Since the demonstration five years ago of a laboratory x-ray laser,
there has been a world-wide pursuit to extend lasing to higher powers, shorter
wavelengths, and smaller divergence. This research will investigate the physics
of plasma x-ray lasers via physical and numerical modeling, calculations of
laser gain, trapping and propagation, and analysis of the conditions and
requirements for x-ray laser coherence. The Krf excimer laser at the
Electrotechnical Laboratory is well suited to these studies, and is complemented
by the availability of Cray and Fujitsu supercomputers, which are necessary for
the modeling studies. The collaboration between Dr. Tomie, an experimentalist,
and Dr. Staffin, a theoretical modeler, should prove synergistic.
