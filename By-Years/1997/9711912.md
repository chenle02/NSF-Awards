9711912 Pirmez Meandering channels of large submarine fans have a planiform
expression that is similar to subaerial meanders but cross- sectional shape
differs. Levees are more prominent and asymetrical in the submarine channels.
Pis will delineate the connection between channelized sediment-driven flows on
the submarine fans and the evolution of submarine channel meandering. They will
also develop a numerical model for the submarine meanders, where their vast
experience in subaerial meanders, channels and floodplains will be very useful.
The study will lead to a better understanding of these little known
morphological features offshore major river systems.
