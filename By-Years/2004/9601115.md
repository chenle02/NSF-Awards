An international conference on string theory, which pictures the elementary
particles as the excited states of extremely tiny strings and attempts to unify
all the forces of nature, will be held at the University of California at Santa
Barbara July 15-20, 1996. String theory is currently a particularly active and
promising area of theoretical physics, due to recent developments such as
`duality` relations which state that theories previously thought to be unrelated
alternative descriptions of nature are actually equivalent theories. The
conference in Santa Barbara will bring together some of the leading workers in
the field to engage in a very important exchange of ideas.
