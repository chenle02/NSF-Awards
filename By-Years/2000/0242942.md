0242942&lt;br/&gt;Pratt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports
the participation of ten US scientists at a US-India workshop in radiation
physics entitled New Directions in the Study of the Interaction of Energetic
Photons with Matter. The organizers, Richard Pratt, University of Pittsburgh and
Swapan Kumar Sen Gupta, North Bengal University, plan to convene the workshop at
North Bengal in October 2003. The primary objective is to identify and initiate
joint activities, responding to the opportunities of the new synchrotron
facilities and other technologies, which are of fundamental interest and
importance. The workshop will consider the processes of photoabsorption, photon
scattering, x-ray and pair production, from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives, and in each case consider which new and fundamental insights can
be anticipated. This activity is cofunded with the NSF/MPS Division of Physics.
