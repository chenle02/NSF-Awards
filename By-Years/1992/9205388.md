This fifth annual "Mouse Molecular Genetics" meeting will be held at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratories in Long Island, N.Y., on August 26-30. The emphasis of the
meeting will be on the mouse as an organism and will cover such areas as:
regulation of gene expression in development, pattern formation in development,
roles of receptors and their signals, and molecular analysis of mutations. This
has been an increasingly successful meeting over the last four years, fulfilling
a very important role in facilitation of communication between various
disciplines in the use of mice to study fundamental problems in biology.
