9721374 Weidner This project establishes a summer program which will allow
undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the excitement of working in a
premier science laboratory. The goal of the program is to recruit students from
the physical sciences with the hope that they will be stimulated to the point of
pursuing a research career in the Earth Sciences. Students in this program will
work with faculty members of the Mineral Physics Institute on projects which
probe the physical and chemical properties of materials with a particular
emphasis on the use of high pressure. Working closely with members of the MPI,
students will pursue their own projects and discuss their progress during weekly
seminar sessions. During the program, students will visit other laboratories and
institutions affiliated with the Mineral Physics Institute. ***
