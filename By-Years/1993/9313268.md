9313268 Adamowicz This U.S.-Mexico award will support a collaboration between
Professor Ludwik Adamowicz of the University of Arizona and Professor Ivan
Ortega Blake of the Institute of Physics of the National Autonomous University
of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The collaborators intend to work on the
hydrolysis of phosphate esters using a combination of ab initio quantum theory,
molecular dynamics, and molecular modeling. The goal of the study is to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms as well as determine the most effective
mediators which enhance or inhibit phosphate bond hydrolysis. The importance of
the phosphate bond can hardly be overestimated. Its critical role in biological
systems in constantly upgraded: it is not only relevant to the process of ATP
synthesis and hydrolysis, but also there is increasing evidence of it being
involved in all sorts of processes through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation,
and as a trigger mechanism in multiple second phenomena. The proposed work will
be conducted as a collaborative effort through mutual contacts, visits, a
student exchange program, and electronic communication. The long term goal of
the project is to advance our understanding of a crucial biological process as a
source of bioenergy. ***
