This award will pay for travel for the PI to attend the Fifth International
Conference on Fluid Properties and Equilibria. The development of useful
expressions for the thermodynamic properties of biological molecules is crucial
to developing an engineering base for commercialization of biotechnology. One
promising approach is to apply techniques developed for simpler systems to
biological molecules. The Fifth International Conference on Fluid Properties and
Equilibria will expose the awardee to current leading work in this area at the
start of his own research program.
