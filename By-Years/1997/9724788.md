This is a Career Advancement Award for Women to support a research-oriented
sabbatical leave to Australia and the Netherlands. It supplements a continuing
grant for the study of many of the unsolved problems in chiral Potts or
generalized chiral clock models. The goal of this research is to obtain a deeper
understanding of incommensurate states, combining exact analytical methods with
various numerical techniques, such as Monte-Carlo analysis and series analysis.
The visits to Melbourne, Canberra and Amsterdam will greatly benefit current
collaborations with some of the leading experts in the various fields and enable
serious consultations with other specialists.
