Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has great
benefits to society, from supporting new technological developments that benefit
humanity to preparing a 21st century workforce. As societal needs change, our
nation?s education system needs to adapt by developing new educational content
that stays abreast of changing technology, new ways of teaching that engage
computer-literate students, and building on our increasing knowledge of how
effective learning occurs. The workshop funded in this proposal will better
allow the engineering education researchers who discover how to improve STEM
education to effectively communicate the latest discoveries to those who help
devise and implement education policy. Such communication is critical if the
United States education system is to continue to effectively adapt to 21st
century challenges. To help build robust communication channels, the workshop
brings together leaders and emerging leaders in engineering education, policy
makers in both the public and private sectors, and representatives of
organizations that impact policy decisions using chain-referral sampling. The
workshop uses a framework designed to develop value propositions that can
resonate with the diverse entities that make up the engineering education
ecosystem; these entities are represented at the workshop. In-depth evaluation
will capture actionable lessons that can inform related efforts in other
communities. The workshop has potentially broad impact since it builds capacity
for more effectively implementing findings from research into the educational
policy decisions that affect large numbers of current and future students.
Participation of the needed diverse elements of the larger engineering education
system is addressed.
