Chemical Separations: Refocusing Chemical Engineering

This award supports partially the participation by 30 American faculty in the
Engineering Foundation Conference, "Chemical Separations: Refocusing Chemical
Engineering", to be held in Barga, Italy, from May 27 to June 1, 2001. This
conference is the successor to earlier conferences on chemical separations. This
particular meeting will explore the changing nature of the chemical industry and
the implications for chemical-engineering research and education. Case studies
will be used to seek new ways of organizing the field, both in education and
research, in order to meet emerging needs.

Funding is provided to support partially participation by ten invited speakers
and twenty junior faculty from the U.S. Both academic and industrial researchers
will participate in sessions on Process Intensification, Chemical Products, and
New Paradigms.
