Abstract

DMS-0104087 Yorke

This project concerns the theory of chaotic dynamical systems. The research
explores mathematical phenomena that are relevant to the modeling of nonlinear
physical systems and the analysis of experimental data. We consider the method
commonly used by scientists to "reconstruct" the dynamics of a nonlinear
physical system from experimental data, and we study the mathematical
relationship between the reconstructed dynamics and the true dynamics. We will
also develop methods for forecasting the behavior of spatiotemporally chaotic
systems, such as the Earth's weather, given limited measurements of the state of
the system. Further, we will study fractal measures that arise in chaotic fluid
flow and their application to problems of mixing and magnetic field generation.

Chaotic dynamics has been observed in many aspects of nature; in weather, it has
been called the "butterfly effect." Chaos can be an obstacle in some cases
(limiting the predictability of the weather) and an asset in others (such as
industrial mixing applications). Our research concerns the mathematics behind
the methods scientists use to model and forecast chaotic systems. Our intent is
both to examine the validity of apparently useful but unproven methods, and to
develop new and improved methods. Long-term benefits may range from better
weather forecasts to more efficient procedures for mixing chemicals.
