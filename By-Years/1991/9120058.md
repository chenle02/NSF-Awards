This project is to develop and convene the Sixth North American Masonry
Conference (6NAMC) in June 1993. The three day meeting will provide a forum for
the exchange of information and ideas on topics related to masonry behavior,
design, and construction. Participation at the conference will be open to
researchers as well as educators, practicing engineers, architects,
manufacturers and contractors. This conference will also provide a unique
opportunity to exchange information related to masonry with international
researchers and design professionals.
