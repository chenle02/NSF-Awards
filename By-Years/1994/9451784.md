9451784 Saulnier This project completes the final phase in a four step plan to
upgrade and enhance the laboratory component of the physics major at Gustavus
Adolphus College. The project addresses a serious deficiency in the optics
curriculum within the physics department. This project will establish a modern
optics laboratory course and complete the equipping of a recently constructed
teaching laboratory. The aim of the project is to improve the physics curriculum
by initiating a laboratory-based course centered on modern optical devices and
techniques, with signal detection and processing. The project is significant in
that it provides an important next step in an intentional plan to improve the
physics program and utilize the interests, commitment, and expertise of new
faculty in the department. The project also has the added benefit of encouraging
students to pursue graduate study by exposing them to contemporary topics in
physics. A variety of experiments will be performed with equipment provided for
this project, which include, as major pieces, an optical table and breadboards,
a photon-counter and associated detector, an air-cooled Argon ion laser, diode
laser heads and controllers, an acousto-optic modulator, and a data acquisition
and analysis system. The experiments to be performed include "single photon"
diffraction, optical fiber communication, heterodyne and Mach-Zender
interferometry, coherent back scattering, diode laser characterization, quasi-
elastic light scattering, and optogalvanic spectroscopy. The impact of the
project will also be felt in courses such as Life Science Physics, Classical
Physics II, and Experimental Modern Laboratory, as well as in faculty-student
research. The PI is committed to the successful completion of the project and
the department has an outstanding record on previous NSF ILI grants.
