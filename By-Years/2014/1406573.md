This project is developing and hosting two workshops, one each year of the
project, that are helping build collaborations between regional technical
workforce employers and New Mexico two-year community college faculty. During
these workshops, faculty and regional industry personnel will develop outcome-
based measures of needed engineering technician and engineering skills, industry
sponsored student projects, and topics for short training classes for current
engineering technicians and engineers.

This project leverages New Mexico's rural Native American and Hispanic students'
cultural values of natural resource stewardship in project based work to help
them succeed. The industry sponsored student projects and instructional
activities that are being developed are combining real-world industry problems,
technology, field research, and student project work in transformative ways to
engage rural New Mexico's two-year community college students. This project's
intellectual merit is in making the rigors of technical education relevant to
rural community college students and preparing these students to serve in the
growing regional technical workforce. The establishment of a permanent Industry
Advisory Committee helps maintain a connection between New Mexico State
University (NMSU) Grants, other New Mexico two-year community colleges, and the
regional technical workforce employers in a way that enables continued relevance
and growth of NMSU Grants' and New Mexico's engineering technician and
engineering programs. The broader impacts of this project are being realized
through the distribution of the learning outcomes, materials, and industry
projects and contacts with New Mexico two-year community college faculty and the
broader ATE community through annual conference participation.
