This awards supports the research of Professor D. Morrison to work in algebraic
geometry. He will work on the birational geometry of three dimensional
varieties. In particular, he will study Q-Fano varieties that arise from Mori's
"flip" theorem. The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where
it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries.
Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of
equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
