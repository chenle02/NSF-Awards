It has been claimed by some philosophers of science that scientists give greater
weight (or should give greater weight) to theories that make successful
predictions of previously unknown facts, than to theories that only explain or
deduce facts already known. Professor Brush is examining several historical case
studies in order to find out whether scientists actually follow this rule, and
more generally how the success or failure of predictions affects the reception
of theories. Some possible case studies include Einstein's prediction of the
gravitational bending of light; Alfven's predictions about the behavior of
plasmas and electric and magnetic fields in the magnetosphere and interplanetary
space, the prediction of the positron from Dirac's relativistic quantum
mechanics, electromagnetic waves from Maxwell's theory, the prediction of the
omega-minus particle from Gell- Mann's "eight-fold way" symmetry theory,
Clairaut's prediction of the date when Halley's comet would return, and
Mendeleev's prediction of new chemical elements to fill the gaps in his periodic
table. The results of this research should help to clarify the reasons why
scientists accept or reject theories.
