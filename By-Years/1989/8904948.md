The extent of fluid infiltration accompanying the metamorphism of carbonate
rocks, and its roles in influencing reaction progress, pore fluid compositions,
and thermal budgets during metamorphism, are fundamental but unresolved
questions to metamorphic geologists. Although the importance of fluid infil-
tration has been established with several recent studies, the details of the
process (e.g., amounts and infiltration style, timing, influence on pore fluid
composition, relationships to structures, etc.) are not well constrained and are
controversial. In addition, there have been no detailed studies of the specific
roles of fluid infiltration in convective heat transfer in contact metamorphic
aureoles. A comprehensive petrologic, phase equilibria, isotope, and heat
transfer study is proposed for the contact metamorphosed siliceous dolomites of
the equilibria, isotope, and heat transfer study is proposed for the contact
metamorphosed siliceous dolomites of the Alta Stock thermal aureole in Little
Cottonwood Canyon, Utah. These dolomites have been infiltrated during contact
metamorphism by 180-depleted and water-rich fluids. The objectives of the study
are to use petrological and stable isotope techniques to quantitatively evaluate
the extent of fluid infiltration into the dolomitic marbles, to determine the
sources of the infiltrating fluids, and to define the g eometry and styel (e.g.,
pervasssive or channelized preferentially along structurs or bedding) of
infiltration. These results will constrain numerical modelling of the thermal
consequences of fluid infil- tration to heat transfer in the aureole and to
total heat loss from the Alta Stock.
