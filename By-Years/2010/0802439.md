This partnership project involves the reshaping of Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) Education. ICT Education is changed to become
responsive to the workforce needs of high-growth industries. This Colorado ATE
Partnership (CATEP) project: (1) Strengthens the participating colleges' CIS
introductory curriculum and associated Career and Technical Education (CTE)
courses through the integration of employability skills with technical skills;
(2) Transforms the recruitment, curriculum and pedagogical practices employed in
CIS and CTE courses; (3) Addresses industry needs beyond basic IT skills; (4)
Develops an ongoing evaluation program to ensure students meet the ICT workforce
needs of the region's high-growth industries; and (5) Develops a dissemination
plan to share the resulting ICT workforce education model with the other
community colleges and secondary schools in the region. This project takes
advantage of established relationships between postsecondary partners, industry
representatives, the secondary education systems in the service areas of the
respective community colleges, and pertinent Workforce Development agencies. It
also incorporates best practices generated from research by the National
Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies, the Center for Information
Technology Education, Boston Area Advanced Technological Education Connections
and the South Carolina Advanced Technological Education Center.
