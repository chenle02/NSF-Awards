Quality assurance is a field in which statistical techniques and problem-
solving methods are used in order to achieve and improve quality. In this
project, important topics in quality assurance will be investigated in the
context of Bayesian statistics and decision analysis. The first topic to be
addressed is Statistical Process Control. Control charts based on posterior
distributions and credibility intervals for quality indexes will be defined and
analyzed. The second topic to be explored is the motivation underlying
assessments of probability distributions traditionally adopted in quality
assurance. These models will be derived by analyzing the physics behind the
manufacturing systems. Often, it is necessary to use diagnostic tests in order
to decide whether or not items coming from a production line are conforming to
requirements. The third topic to be studied is the calibration of diagnostic
tests based on censored data. Quality is a key factor leading to success, growth
and enhanced competitive position. There is always a substantial return on
investment from any effective program designed to improve quality. These
programs result in increased market penetration, higher productivity and lower
overall costs of manufacturing and services.
