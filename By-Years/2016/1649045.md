This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US
students attending the 2016 Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval (PIR)
Workshop. The workshop is co-located with the ACM SIGIR Conference on Research
and Development in Information Retrieval in Pisa, Italy. The Student Fellowships
helps cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to
attend the workshop and discuss and disseminate their work. The workshop also
provides an opportunity for them to interact with future national and
international scientific collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIR Workshop
brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in
Information Retrieval, Privacy and Security. Students benefit from not only the
technical paper presentations, but also other activities such as talk from
industry leaders, and panel/breakout sessions which pair information retrieval
and privacy researchers together to discuss about emerging challenges across the
two communities. These sessions provide students with an opportunity to learn
the recent research developments in an emerging interdisciplinary field, while
the informal settings of the breakouts also enable students to get critical yet
encouraging feedback on their work from senior members of the community.
