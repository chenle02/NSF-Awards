Biological Sciences (61) This project is developing, implementing, and assessing
student-driven, hypothesis testing laboratory modules for introductory and upper
level courses in our Environmental Science Program. Our project provides
students with field opportunities to conduct hypothesis testing by revising
current laboratory curriculum and improving field testing instrumentation. The
targeted courses may lack student-driven, field investigation components,
contain limited field investigations due to lack of equipment, or do not offer a
laboratory course due to lack of equipment. Investigative modules are based on
concepts developed by Switzer and Shriner (2000) and Eisen (1998) and successful
models for field site investigations implemented at the Florida Institute of
Technology, Northern Arizona University, and Middlebury College. Our primary
goal is to provide students with active and cooperative learning techniques to
improve their understanding of the hypothesis-testing nature of science. Each
module requires students to generate hypotheses for "environmental risk" at one
of four common study sites. Individual groups within classes are testing
hypotheses on-site, analyziong their data, presenting their results to the
class, and conducting peer assessments of individual student and group work. Our
assessment plan aims to determine if the implemented modules improve student use
of problem-solving skills and the scientific method to test hypotheses. The
project results will be disseminated by presentation at scientific and education
meetings, by web-site, instructor manual supplements, and peer-reviewed
journals, and by two GLOBE summer workshops for high school teachers and UTC
student science teachers.
