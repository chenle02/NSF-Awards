Much of the current uncertainty regarding the nature and mechanisms of forest
succession is a consequence of the paucity of long-term data sets, particularly
those dealing with the patterns of establishment, growth, and mortality of
individual plants. Measurements of long-term data sets in the Duke Forest, North
Carolina will be continued under the aegis of the Long-Term Research in
Environmental Biology (LTREB) program. These data sets include: 1. Permanent
Sample Plots (PSPs). These plots were established between 1931 and 1947 in
stands representing an array of site conditions and successional stages.
Individual trees in these 51 permanent plots have since been censused and
measured at roughly 5-year intervals. These data will be used to examine long-
term changes in tree growth and mortality, 2. Intensive Seedling and Sapling
Plots. In these plots, established in stands representing an array of site and
successional conditions in 1977, mapped individual seedlings have been censused
annually. Monitoring of intensive plots in thinning- and transition-stage pines,
and hardwood stands will continue. The sampling protocol will include sapling
populations. These data will facilitate studies of mechanisms of transition from
even-aged pine to uneven-aged hardwood forests, as well as long-term trends in
seedling and sapling demography, 3. Mapped Forest Plots. Permanent mapped forest
plots representing transition pine- hardwood stands and hardwood stands will be
resampled. These data will be used to address a variety of a questions related
to successional changes in pattern and stand structure.
