In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), an international research
team plans to mobilize and drill a technically complex deep borehole into the
fault zone that generated the devastating May 12, 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan
earthquake. A group led by the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences will drill
the hole. This project will support an upgrade to instrumentation that will be
deployed in the first borehole through the fault. The upgrade will allow rapid
temperature measurements through time as long as the sensors are operational at
depth. This project will enable the investigators to obtain a rare data set that
will be used to investigate fault friction which is the single most important
physical process in an earthquake. The work also represents an important
collaboration between scientists from the U.S. and China.
