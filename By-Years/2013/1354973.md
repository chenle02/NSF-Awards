New generations of multicellular animals arise primarily through the biological
process known as embryonic development. This project addresses fundamental
mechanisms that control animal development. It focuses on the connections
between two kinds of dynamic, molecular networks that define the properties and
behaviors of embryonic cells: 1) networks that are controlled by extrinsic
signals (cell signaling networks) and 2) networks that control programs of gene
expression (gene regulatory networks). Understanding the connections between
such networks is a central problem in the emerging field of systems
developmental biology. This study leverages a well-understood developmental gene
regulatory network - one that controls skeletal development in sea urchin
embryos- and examines the mechanisms and developmental consequences of its
regulation by extracellular cues. The broader impacts of this work include: 1)
continued support for a highly successful program of undergraduate research in
the PI's laboratory, and 2) the maintenance and enhancement of the 'Virtual
Urchin' web project, a unique resource that provides science instructors with
educational tools for teaching students of all levels (elementary school to
college) about early embryonic development.
