This research involves two specific projects designed to investigate the impact
of transfer programs and labor market opportunities on the behavior of low-
income households. The first project investigates the role of part-time work
among female workers. The second focuses on the effect of multiple transfer
programs on household behavior, with a particular emphasis on the dynamic
interaction between in-kind and cash programs. Estimating strategies are
designed to compare the time patterns of multiple transfer use among different
populations. Much of the estimation will focus on differences in the duration of
time spent on single versus multiple programs. The interactive component
includes teaching a graduate course on income distribution and weekly
participation in three ongoing faculty/student seminars: labor economics/public
finance, an interdisciplinary seminar in industrial relations, and one involving
labor market issues. This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1)
to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and
in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to
pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for
women scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
