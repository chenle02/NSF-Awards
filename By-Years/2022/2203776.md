This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the 2022 Workshop
on Symmetries in Graphs, Maps, and Polytopes (SIGMAP) held at the University of
Alaska Fairbanks July 10-16, 2022. Symmetry has motivated many important
questions in mathematics, beginning with the study of the Platonic solids in
antiquity. Symmetric discrete geometric objects, such as polyhedra or graphs,
have a wide variety of applications, from understanding the structure of
crystals and the shapes of viruses, to computer-aided modeling and optimization
in networks. The workshop will bring together researchers from all over the
world to discuss recent advances in the study of symmetries of discrete
geometric objects, explore open problems, form new collaborations, and advance
existing ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major topic to be addressed at the
workshop is the relation of symmetry, both combinatorial and geometric, to the
study of graphs, maps, convex and abstract polytopes, and related algebraic and
geometric structures. Established researchers in these areas will present recent
work to their colleagues, advancing the state of knowledge in the field. The
structure of the workshop will facilitate collaborations between current and new
researchers in the area through active discussion of open problems and work
sessions. Results from the workshop and related research will be disseminated
through a special issue of The Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics focused
on Symmetries of Graphs, Maps, and Polytopes. More information about the
workshop, including pre-registration forms and opportunities for travel support
for US residents, is available at
https://www.alaska.edu/sigmap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
