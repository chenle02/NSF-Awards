The focus of this research is the development of a double annulation strategy
for the preparation of bicyclo(4.n.0)alkanes with multiple functionality and
substitution. The utility of the method, which employs a tandem Michael,
Dieckmann sequence, will be showcased by the preparation of a number of
interesting polyterpenoids. The focus of the educational activities is on course
development featuring the use of web-based, interactive homework and essay
assignments. With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
activities of Dr. Robert B. Grossman of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Kentucky. Professor Grossman will focus his research efforts on
developing synthetic methodology useful in the preparation of organic compounds
having interesting biological properties. The educational component of the award
will stress course development in undergraduate organic chemistry.
