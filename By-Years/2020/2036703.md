The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will result from the development of disruptive technologies that use
drones and artificial intelligence to monitor livestock. Almost 75% of United
States cattle are purchased by taking out bank loans, and lenders need to audit
cattle inventories for collateral verification and appraisal purposes.
Additionally, more than 140,000 ranchers need to monitor their herds and detect
cattle illnesses before infections spread. The proposed technology will leverage
aerial imaging and artificial intelligence to count cattle, characterize cattle
weight, and diagnose cattle illnesses up to one week before clinical symptoms
appear. The ability to count herds regularly will enable ranchers to discover
cattle rustling issues early and provide banks with a reliable way to perform
collateral verification on ranches and feedlots, ensuring that banks can
continue extending livestock operations the loans that they need to survive. The
ability to detect cattle illnesses early is expected to reduce cattle
mortalities, the economic cost of antibiotic use, and possibly antibiotic
resistance in humans. Ultimately, the proposed technology that will be developed
for monitoring cattle promises to also transform the way that land and marine
wildlife, fisheries, and endangered species are
monitored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will provide cattlemen and bankers with an efficient way to
detect and count cattle on pastures and ranches, estimate livestock weight, and
identify ill cows before they spread infection further. Despite daily monitoring
of cattle herds, small discrepancies and losses are undiscoverable, and bovine
illnesses are often left undetected until they spread, infecting more cattle and
requiring large-scale administration of antibiotics. Machine learning and image
processing tools will be developed that (a) automatically analyze natural and
thermal drone images to count cattle on multi-topography ranches and estimate
livestock weight and (b) discriminate between healthy and ill cattle based on
aerial radiometric imaging. The outcomes will be (1) a ready, drone-agnostic
solution for counting cattle and estimating their weight and (2) a pilot-tested
drone-and-software system for monitoring cattle health via radiometric imaging
and notifying cattlemen about cows with suspected illness in real-
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
