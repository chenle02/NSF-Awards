Common core standards across the United States have elevated educational
requirements and demands of teachers. The new curriculum, particularly in
science, includes the engineering design process as a core idea spanning problem
definition, solution generation, and design optimization. Discovery of
scientific principles via ?technology? experiments and the importance of hands-
on, real world projects are stressed. Teachers are struggling to incorporate
engineering design challenges into their classroom as it has been completely
lacking in teacher training programs offered by colleges of education across the
nation and there is a dearth of options being created to fill this gap. This
proposal is partially motivated from multiple requests from school districts
outside of the Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science (CEEMS) targeted
partnership to provide their math and science teachers with training in
challenge-based learning (CBL) and engineering design process (EDP).

The Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science Program has developed and
implemented a successful professional development model to train secondary
teachers to integrate challenge-based learning and the engineering design
process into the teaching of math and science content. The training was
developed in response to new state and national standards. Key components
include: 1) providing teachers multiple opportunities to experience engineering
design challenges, 2) empowering teachers through ongoing coaching support, and
3) engaging students through hands-on activities and allowing choices to project
selection and design. CEEMS is firmly rooted in current research in the fields
of science, mathematics, and engineering education and is based on studies on
how students learn mathematics and science if engineering is used as the
context.
