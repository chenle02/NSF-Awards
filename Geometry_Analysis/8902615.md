The principal investigator will study three projects in the area of several
complex variables. The first concerns imbedding strictly pseudoconvex CR
manifolds in higher-dimensional spheres. In the second project he will
generalize certain theorems about the Kobayashi metric and related notions from
convex domains and CR manifolds. The third project involves the study of
functions satisfying homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equations which have a
prescribed singular behavior along a smooth manifold. How surfaces and their
higher-dimensional analogues, called manifolds, may lie in multi-dimensional
space has been a subject of great interest to mathematicians for many decades.
Certain surfaces, like the Klein bottle, cannot be placed in three- dimensional
space without forcing self intersections. But this surface can be placed into
four-dimensional space without such intersections. The principal investigator
will study deep related questions for manifolds which are based, not on real
multi-dimensional space, but on complex spaces.
