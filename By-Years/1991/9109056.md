It has long been recognized that many workers find jobs through friends and
relatives. A number of area labor-market studies carried out by economists
attest to the importance of social contacts in the hiring process, whereas a
number of studies carried out by sociologists confirm the importance of social
contacts in influencing labor-market outcomes in the form of individuals' wages
and job satisfaction. These lines of research focus on the specific contact used
by a worker to find a job rather than on more general characteristics of the
worker's social network. This project formalizes hypotheses offered by
sociologists about social networks with the aim of facilitating better
interpretation of existing empirical work on labor-market outcomes and processes
and of developing more appropriate testing strategies. It also develops a model
that suggests that equilibrium differences in wage and labor-force participation
between groups may be a byproduct of referral hiring. Beyond reproducing
observed differences in wages and participation, the model also predicts the
greater use of referrals by males and an observed pattern of own- sex referrals.
This research to develop the theoretical underpinnings of social network effects
in the labor market helps fill a gap in labor economics, and it contributes to
the integration of the optimizing and equilibrium methods of economics into
important sociological empirical work in the area of social networks. This
project has important implications for understanding earnings inequality and its
transmission across generations, poverty and the "underclass," and the process
of the job search.
