*** 9634786 Chen This grant provides funding for research on an innovative
approach to rapid modeling of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). The
objectives are: (1) to develop an effective analytical modeling technique
capable of capturing the effect of material handling devices and the impact of
component reliability and maintainability on overall system performance and (2)
to enhance the understanding of interactions among the components of FMS via
rapid approximation of critical system parameters not presently attainable in
existing analytical models. This research, if successful, will have a
significant impact on the manufacturing science base. Its unique features
include (1) elimination of sophisticated simulation modeling and lengthy modeler
training, (2) reduction of project implementation costs, and (3) reduction of
project implementation lead time. This powerful approach to modeling automated
manufacturing systems also has a potential to enhance the functionality of the
emerging manufacturing execution system being pursued by many major US
Corporations. ***
