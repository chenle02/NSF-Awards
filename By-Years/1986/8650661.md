The Department of Computer Science will purchase microprocessor interface
systems, logic designers, robotics systems, and associated hardware to establish
a sequence in computer hardware. A digital laboratory, built around the
microprocessor/microcomputer development system, will be established. This
laboratory will serve as the practicum center for a sequence of three courses,
which are being designed currently: Logic Design, Operating Systems and Computer
Architecture, and Microprocessor-Based Systems. Computer science students who
graduate from the program will have experience in digital logic, computer
interfacing, data acquisition, and computer control. Thus they will be better
prepared for industrial positions in computer science or for graduate school.
