Washington State University continues operating a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site has been in operation since 1999. The
theme of the proposed REU Site is Characterization of Advanced Materials.
Students participate in research projects that use modern characterization
techniques to understand the relationships between the processing, structure and
properties of materials. These projects are done under the supervision of
faculty in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Department of
Chemistry and Department of Civil Engineering. Twelve undergraduate students are
recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience,
including students from community colleges in the region. In addition to
participating in individual research projects, students attend a series of
teaching workshops on the use of various characterization instruments and tools.
