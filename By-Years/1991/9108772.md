The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of South Carolina will enhance the research competitiveness of 59 targeted
faculty working in 8 research areas at Clemson University and the University of
South Carolina. The eight research clusters are concentrated in the areas of
biological sciences, materials science, and computational sciences. They are:
(1) Molecular Genetics, Genome Mapping, and Gene Manipulation; (2) Program in
Molecular and Population Biology; (3) High Speed Digital Neural Networks; (4)
Global Research Change: Integrating Observational and Modeling Approaches; (5)
Fibers and Micromechanics of their Composites; (6) Materials Science at the
University of South Carolina; (7) Innovation Through Chemical Synthesis: Novel
Molecules and Materials; and (8) Industrial Mathematics Initiative. South
Carolina EPSCoR has three major objectives to effect permanent improvements in
the State's education and research environment. They are: faculty development,
human resource development, and bridging of State/Industry/University S&E
interests. Strategies include the addition of ten new faculty, six classified
support staff, support for 40 graduate students per year, and expansion of the
State EPSCoR Committee. The State of South Carolina, its institutions, and its
private sector have contributed over $6 million in non-federal matching funds to
this three year EPSCoR effort.
