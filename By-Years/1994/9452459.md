9452459 Pariser The objective of this project is to provide experimental
apparatus (fiber optic communication's) for the students in the electronic
communication classes. The course Electronic Communication (CM 101), which
teaches analog and digital communications, and the second course which is an
elective course, Modern Communication Systems (CM 102). As the industry moves
toward fiber optics, we have a responsibility to train our students in this
technology. This training would provide a major improvement for our students.
They would now have the opportunity to see experimental verification of the
theory of optical communications.
