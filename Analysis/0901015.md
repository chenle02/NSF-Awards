The proposed activity will lead to research in different classical as well as
modern areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. This research combines
powerful apparatus from theory of partial differential equations, complex
analysis, Floquet theory and others. Considered subjects are at the interfaces
between pure mathematics, theoretical physics and engineering. The proposed
activity covers some old and new questions for periodic structures which have a
lot of applications in physics and engineering. The methods and constructions
are quite intricate and are of great interest for both mathematicians and
physicists. Many theoretical and applied problems lead to periodic partial
differential equations. For instance, quantum mechanics, hydro-dynamics,
elasticity theory, the theory of guided waves, homogenization theory, theory of
quantum networks, direct and inverse scattering, parametric resonance theory,
spectral theory and spectral geometry, theory of photonic crystals and many
others. The proposed research may lead to better understanding of some very
important questions in these areas. To summarize, the intellectual merit of the
proposed activity is in development of several mathematically rich and classical
areas employing original approaches and ideas. The results will likely provide
new links between different fields of mathematics and eventually lead to better
understanding of the fundamental physical nature of some important processes.
The proposed research addresses questions that may clarify many effects and
problems important in science and engineering. The prospective results can
explain or/and predict some effects which appear in experiments. Obtained
improvements of different methods can be applied for investigation of other
mathematical and physical problems. Perhaps, the most interesting possible
application is the theory of quantum networks which provides the mathematical
base for quickly developing engineering of future quantum electronic devices.
