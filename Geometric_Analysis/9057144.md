A Presidential Young Investigator will study geometric partial differential
equations motivated by problems at the boundary between mathematics and physics.
He will continue his investigation of geometric aspects of the Atiyah-Singer
index theorem and the relationship between quantum field theory and low-
dimensional topology. The principal investigator will conduct research in the
emerging field of geometry, topology, and physics. This will involve work
related to the Yang-Mills partial differential equations and the Atiyah-Singer
index theorem.
