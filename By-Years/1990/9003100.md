This award will provide funds to a group of scientists who direct microchemical
facilities that serve large numbers of investigators at their own and other
institutions. The funds will be used to obtain and distribute synthetic peptides
useful for measuring the sensitivity and accuracy of protein sequencing
procedures at these and many similar facilities, and to increase cooperation and
contact between such facilities. The overall aim of the project is to increase
the quality of service provided by the facilities. The use of microchemical
techniques for the sequencing and synthesis of protein and DNA now occupies an
important role in modern biology. Because of the substantial investment in
equipment and personnel required, such work is most often performed in central
facilities that serve a large group of investigators. There are now over a
hundred such facilities in the U.S. This award will help insure that the service
provided by each is of a uniform high quality and is consistent with the state
of the art in protein sequencing.
