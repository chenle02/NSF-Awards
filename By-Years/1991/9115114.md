This grant will allow five astronomers at four primarily undergraduate
institutions to work on a series of problems requiring extensive photometric
observations without requiring neglect of their teaching duties. This will be
accomplished by use of a telescope which operates under computer control without
requiring an observer. This type of telescope is revolutionizing the
observations of certain types of objects which require an extensive series of
observations. These objects have traditionally been neglected since most
astronomers have not had the time required to observe them properly. The schools
involved in the Consortium are The College of Charleston, The Citadel, the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and Villanova University. The projects to be
undertaken include observations of solar type stars, multi-mode variable stars,
chemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence, Ursa Majoris Stream stars,
apsidal motion of eclipsing binaries and Be stars. Additionally observations of
standard stars will be used to improve various standard systems.
