A link is a collection of disjoint circles that may be linked together embedded
in a space of dimension three. One of the main topics in low-dimensional
topology is to study the topological and geometric properties of the link, the
three-dimensional space, and some four-dimensional spaces bounded by the three-
space. This project aims to deepen understanding of these mathematical
structures. The first part of the research concentrates on the study of three-
manifolds obtained from links via the so-called "Dehn surgery" operation and the
family of links appearing in algebraic geometry. Results are anticipated to
advance the understanding of the complexity of three-manifolds and algebraic
singularities in algebraic geometry. It will also provide topics that are
suitable for undergraduate students' research. The second part of the research
focuses on the topology, geometry, and dynamics of hyperbolic manifolds, which
are important examples of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, negatively curved Hadamard
manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-compact type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research consists of four specific projects about links and hyperbolic
manifolds. The first aims to understand the possible obstructions for surgeries
on 2-component links in the three-sphere. It focuses on the possibility of
finding an infinite family of integer homology spheres that cannot be obtained
by surgeries on 2-component links in the three-sphere. The second project is to
understand the link Floer chain complex of algebraic links coming from the
singularities of algebraic curves in the complex plane and provide potential
applications in low dimensional topology. The third project is to study discrete
isometry subgroups acting on hyperbolic spaces with small critical exponents and
generalize the structure theorem for hyperbolic manifolds to negatively curved
Hadamard manifolds. The fourth project concerns a counting question in
hyperbolic manifolds, with the goal of determining whether the classical Bowen-
Margulis measure and the spectral gap converge for a strongly convergent
sequence of hyperbolic manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
