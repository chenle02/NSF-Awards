An examination of the transition states of surface reactions forms the focus of
this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. Professor Gellman and his
students at Carnegie Mellon University are addressing the nature and energetics
of the transition state in various elementary surface reaction processes
including -hydride elimination, alkyl coupling and phenyl coupling reactions on
Cu and Ag surfaces. The transition state is probed by fluorine substitution of
reactants and the monitoring of reaction kinetics and mechanism using
vibrational spectroscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Activation
barriers and energetics obtained experimentally will be compared with
computational investigations of transition state energetics. The use of the
methods of physical organic chemistry to examine transition states in surface
reactions is the subject of this research project. Fluorine substitution is used
to probe the stability and energetics of the transition state for various
hydrogen elimination and coupling reactions occurring on copper and silver
surfaces. This information will provide the thermodynamic background essential
for an understanding of catalytic chemistry on these surfaces, as well as for
similar processes in electrochemical and corrosion environments.
