The console of a multi-user 500 MHz nmr spectrometer will be upgraded. Among
the problems to be investigated using the improved, up-to-date spectrometer are:
structure-function relationships of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2, nmr
spectroscopy of heme proteins, ligand-receptor interactions, conformational
studies of complex polysaccharides, bioactive agents from dryland plants of
Latin America, and glycopeptide conformation and cell-surface glycoproteins.
