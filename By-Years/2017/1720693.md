The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on
reduction of catheter-related infections and associated healthcare costs.
Central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) are extremely dangerous
and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Patients
with catheters are significantly more likely to develop an infection than those
without a catheter. With an average cost of approximately $45k per patient,
CLABSI are the most expensive hospital associated infection to treat. Hospitals
spend an estimated $1.38 billion treating inpatient infections due to central
lines, and Medicare and insurance companies spend an additional $1.7 billion
treating outpatient infections from central line catheters in dialysis patients.
More broadly, market opportunities for the technology include: sterilization of
urinary tract catheters, prevention of catheter based infections in multi-trauma
patients such as military personnel, and wound infection
treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will evaluate the
commercial potential for an antimicrobial wound dressing that exploits the
bactericidal effect of blue light to inactivate bacteria commonly colonizing the
surface of catheters. The light-emitting catheter dressing is designed to be
easily integrated with current standards of care to reduce central line
associated blood stream infections. Blue light activates photosensitizers in
bacteria, which release reactive oxygen species that are highly cytotoxic by
damage of proteins and DNA. Blue light is significantly less harmful to
mammalian cells as compared to ultraviolet irradiation, which is commonly used
for disinfection of medical facilities, medical devices, water and food.
Increasing rates of bacterial resistance indicate the need for infection
treatment methods that do not require the use drugs. This device would be
marketed to hospitals to reduce cost and patient morbidity and mortality.
