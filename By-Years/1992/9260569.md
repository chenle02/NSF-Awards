The research project involves the development of an approach for reducing or
eliminating the problems associated with processing of secondary ferrous metal
and their representative costs. Based on a review of the actual industrial
practice and operation data, improved methods of grading, marking, and
separating will be synthesized. The developed methods will be incorporated into
an expert system that provides the manufacturer with a systematic process
strategy to assist in cost-effective matching of product grade with demand. The
research base should provide an expert system for use by secondary ferrous metal
manufacturers in outgoing quality control and cost reduction. The outcome can be
adapted to non-ferrous metal recycling companies.
