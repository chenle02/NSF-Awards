The proposed U.S.-Brazil planning visit will allow the U.S. PIs Drs. Christopher
Steiner and Keshav C. Das (University of Georgia, UGA) to meet with Brazilian
collaborators at EMBRAPA (Agricultural Research Agency of Brazil) Drs. Wenceslau
Teixeira and Marcos Garcia to plan an interdisciplinary, collaborative research
program in agricultural productivity. Deforestation by the use of fire is a
major environmental concern for both the world and Brazil. An alternative known
as "slash and char" would produce charcoal out of re-growing biomass for soil
amelioration purposes instead of conversion to CO2 by fire (slash and burn). Its
efficiency has been demonstrated in Brazil by EMBRAPA. The use of charcoal as
soil amendment (biochar) would establish a carbon sink and improve
sustainability of tropical agriculture. For the planning visit the UGA team will
bring its expertise in carbon cycling and transformation while EMBRAPA will
provide its ample experience with tropical agriculture and biochar. Because
Brazil is a leader in the area of biomass and alternate energy, both sides will
benefit much from the successful establishment of research collaborations in
agricultural productivity.
