Catalytically stabilized thermal (CST) incineration of chlorinated hydrocarbons
uses catalytic surface reactions to stabilize gas phase reactions. Hot wall
effects and surface- generated reactive intermediates are hypothesized to
improve stabilization of gas phase chlorinated hydrocarbon combustion, enabling
rapid plug flow (low residence time and small combustor size) incineration with
high destruction of toxic organic species, and stable combustion of even very
low BTU mixtures. Work to date has shown that a CST incinerator can stabilize
methyl chloride and methylene chloride combustion sufficiently to enable high
throughput plug flow operation, achieving 99.999% + destruction levels with a
residence time of 15 ms. In Phase I, reaction mechanisms for methyl chloride
destruction in plug flow thermally stabilized and catalytically stabilized
reactors were investigated, through preliminary model development and through
experimental flow tube kinetic studies. This work identified preliminary
parameters and provided a initial basis for further experimental studies and
development of a catalytic plug flow reactor model in Phase II, for use in Phase
III prototype development and system design. First approximation plug flow
thermal reactor model results predicted high destruction levels at moderately
high temperature, and this was confirmed experimentally in a non-catalytic
isothermal reactor. Catalytic isothermal reactor experiments altered the gas
phase reaction mechanisms and significantly lowered required temperature and
residence time for high destruction. The experimental findings advance
fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms affecting chlorinated
hydrocarbon combustion and emissions. Ultra-high destruction effectiveness,
increased safety, small incinerator size and reduced costs will make this
technology attractive to the large and growing thermal incineration market.
