This project uses DNA variation to address the evolutionary history of two
deciduous forest vertebrates, eastern chipmunks and white-footed mice, in the
central US. During glacial maxima large areas of the central US were covered by
an extensive ice sheet. Many species that currently inhabit these once ice-
covered regions must have colonized from areas beyond the the ice. Dr. Kenneth
Paige and Kevin Rowe will address how contemporary populations and communities
in these regions were established. Genetic variation will indicate the number of
population sources and the direction of colonizations. Multiple molecular
markers from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes can test various hypotheses
about the role of selection and population dynamics in shaping genetic
variation.

The contemporary distribution of biological diversity cannot be understood
without knowledge of how organisms responded to the geological and climatic
history of Earth; these are central concerns to ecology and evolutionary
biology. Results from this project will help recover how species have responded
to known climatic changes and how communities are assembled over geological
time.
