Two closely spaced profiles of heat flow measurements will be made across the
forearc of the Tonga-Kermadec arc with the objective to constrain the shear
stress on the thrust fault between Pacific and Australian plates. Variations of
heat flow over short distances will allow the PIs to constrain the extent to
which pore water advection transports heat through the forearc.
