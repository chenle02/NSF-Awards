Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
OISE-0948238&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Robert
Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California,
Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: US-Korea Planning Visit: World Class
University Project in Space Science&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
planning visit will support the PI, four senior scientists, one junior scientist
and three graduate students from the University of California, Berkeley, to
travel to Kyung-Hee University in South Korea, for the purposes of establishing
a strong, long-standing research collaboration in conjunction with the World
Class University Project in Space Science. Part of the US component of the
collaboration is the CINEMA CubeSat Mission. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merits &lt;br/&gt;This project involves the development of new miniaturized
instruments and spacecraft for the next generation of space mission in solar,
heliospheric, magnetospheric physics, as well as in lunar and planetary science.
The collaborators will develop the CINEMA (Cubesat for Ion, Neutral, Electron,
Magnetic field) project, utilizing a magnetometer developed by Imperial College
of London, as part of NSF?s CubeSat program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;UCB/SSL and KHU working together will build up new
experimental space instrumentation capability at KHU, provide training and
hands-on experience in space plasma physics for both UCB and KHU students. UCB
and KHU students will also work with students at ICL. Students from the Inter
American University of Puerto Rico (IAUPR) will also participate in the
development and operation of CINEMA, to broaden participation of
underrepresented students in space systems research and in international
collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;
