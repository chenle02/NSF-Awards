This project establishes electronically instrumented laboratories as part of a
plan to more closely integrate laboratory demonstrations and experiments with
the classroom instruction of engineering mechanics. New and interesting
experiments and demonstrations are incorporated into the curriculum so as to
create an engaging laboratory environment and encourage student interest in
engineering mechanics. Courses are affected in the sophomore, junior and senior
years. The equipment purchased is a computer controlled data acquisition system.
This system enables progressive instruction in methods of modern data
acquisition and culminates in a senior laboratory project in which the students
must plan and implement an electronically instrumented test of a non-traditional
construction material. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
