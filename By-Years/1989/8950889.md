The Physics Department at St. Norbert College will improve substantially the
electromagnetism laboratory portion of (1) the introductory general physics
course taken by majors in physics, pre- engineering, pre-medicine, and chemistry
and (2) the courses Circuit Analysis and Electronics. The project will also make
available equipment of sufficient quality for senior independent study projects.
Students learning basic concepts of physics must directly confront physical
phenomena. Their equipment must be robust, use modern technology, and allow
precise measurement when used with care and patience. There must be enough set-
ups that no more than 2 or 3 students must work together. The major items that
will be purchased are analog and digital oscilloscopes, function generators,
frequency counters, an X-Y recorder, Gauss meters, microwave optics systems, and
Michelson/Fabry-Perot interferometers. The College will match the award with an
equal amount of funds.
