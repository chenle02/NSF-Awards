This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
and build a method and system for integrating sophisticated advertising
capabilities into the Scientific Media Concise Message Routing System. The
technology allows anyone with an internet domain name (individuals, small
businesses, large corporations, or other organizations) to quickly, easily, and
cheaply distribute information via a variety of mobile media, with particular
emphasis on text messaging, or SMS. The technology comprises hardware and
software that route text-message requests and responses between "subscribers"
who access information and "content publishers" who distribute information.

This project seeks to create the system and methods needed to append highly-
targeted advertisements to the content requested from publishers by subscribers.
Scientific Media believes that the system establishes the framework of an
important new method of distributing information via SMS that can be applied in
a variety of settings, including consumer, education, and research settings.
