The project will (1) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in
information technology (IT); (2) identify the organizational and IT management
practices associated with achieving greater value through IT, and (3)
disseminate result in academic, business and policy circles. These issues will
be addressed at firm, industry, and country levels, based on several large,
detailed, longitudinal databases that will be coupled together for more robust
analysis than was heretofore possible. The study will include data on IT in five
to 15 industry sectors in 50 countries from 1980-95, and on 200 large US firms
for the 1990-95 period. Existing databases will be updated annually, and new
databases will be built. The study will shed new light on whether, how, and why
IT makes a difference in effectiveness and efficiency across a global spectrum
of use, helping to clarify our understanding of the well-known "productivity
paradox". It will produce a definitive body of research that uncovers the
potential payoffs from IT investment and illuminates the mechanisms by which
they can be harnessed.
