9600472 Chien A new international collaborative research program on the
magnetic properties of nanostuctured materials between the Johns Hopkins
University and Nanjing University in China is proposed. The studies include both
the magneto- optical effect (Kerr and Faraday effects) and giant magneto-
transport properties on three classes of nanostructured materials: multilayers,
arrays of nanowires,and granular solids, which are exciting fields of
fundamental and technological importance. In parallel to this proposal, the
Chinese scientists are also submitting a proposal to the National Natural
Science Foundation of China for their portions of the research expenses.
Nanostructured materials allow many possibilities for probing fundamental
physical interactions. Future advances in use of such materials will be
important in rapidly expanding industrial sectors such as data recording or
sensors.
