Through this project, the institution acquired a high field Fourier Transform
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer capable of rapid determination of (1)H
and (13)C NMR spectra. The instrument also permits use of most of the newest
techniques such as COSY, NOESY and HETCOR for the determination of structure.
The equipment is used in seven undergraduate courses covering biochemistry,
organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. It is utilized for undergraduate
research, and for a new laboratory course in polymer chemistry. Sophomores,
juniors and seniors study the structure and stereochemical features of a variety
of compounds including materials of biochemical interest. The NMR spectrometer
provided a dual benefit by significantly improving course offerings and updating
instrument holdings. The institution contributed to the project in an amount
$15,000 over the NSF award.
