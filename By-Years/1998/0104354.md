Some profound connections have been developed, over the past few years, between
algebraic geometry and integrable systems, on the one hand, and quantum field
theory and string theory on the other. The aim of this proposal is to suggest
some new links, and to explore and expand the existing ones. The first proposed
project involves a conjectural extension of the Fourier-Mukai transform, or the
spectral construction, to several new situations, including fibrations without
sections, noncommutative geometries, and higher dimensional complex or special
Lagrangian torus fibers. The special Lagrangian case in particular casts new
light on the SYZ approach to mirror symmetry and suggests the existence of an
integrable system structure on the stringy moduli space of Calabi-Yaus. The next
two projects involve applications of the first to two central issues of quantum
field theory and string theory. Specifically, the second project seeks to derive
a fully realistic version of the Standard Model of particle physics, starting
from particular M-theory vacua. This is based on the construction techniques for
vector bundles on genus-1 fibrations discussed in the first project. The third
project studies several aspects of the other major conjectural string duality,
the one between the heterotic string and F-theory. Proposed work includes the
rigorous establishment of the isomorphism on all strata of the geometric
boundary in complete generality, and its extension to the interior in one
important case where it may also be possible to establish the equality of the
superpotentials on both sides.

String theory is generally considered to be the leading candidate for a unified
physical theory which explains everything we know about the physical world, from
the smallest sub-particle scales to the entire universe. Our confidence in the
power of string theory to describe the real world relies to a great extent on
the recent discovery of string dualities and their understanding via geometric
tools. This proposal aims to explore and expand these recent applications of
algebraic geometry to string theory and especially to dualities. It also
includes a range of educational activities, including curriculum development,
the writing of a textbook, and extensive work with undergraduate and graduate
students, aimed at the dissemination of new knowledge concerning the
interactions of mathematics and high energy physics.
