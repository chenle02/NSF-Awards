DMS-0139875&lt;br/&gt;Alan Reid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of constructing
infinitely many number fields of class&lt;br/&gt;number one descends from
Gauss's work on quadratic forms, and remains&lt;br/&gt;one of the major unsolved
problems in algebraic number theory. This&lt;br/&gt;has been the inspiration for
many new ideas and techniques in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic number theory and
arithmetic geometry. The proposers plan a&lt;br/&gt;sustained attack on this
problem using geometric methods based upon&lt;br/&gt;recent advances in the
theory of hyperbolic manifolds coupled with a&lt;br/&gt;natural broadening of
the classical Bianchi- Hurwitz theorem.&lt;br/&gt;Possible important
mathematical by-products include new techniques&lt;br/&gt;for estimating class
numbers and an improvement of the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of properties of the
trace fields of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further
consequences of this work of a somewhat broader impact also&lt;br/&gt;seem
possible. The most obviously relevant applications seem to&lt;br/&gt;come from
the direction of cryptography. The difficulty of factoring&lt;br/&gt;numbers
into primes is the basis for the RSA cryptosystem. The fastest&lt;br/&gt;known
algorithm for factoring large whole numbers into primes is the&lt;br/&gt;so-
called number field sieve, and the techniques from algebraic
number&lt;br/&gt;theory involved in this sieve were developed in part from work
on class&lt;br/&gt;numbers. This project could impact such algorithms and
progress on&lt;br/&gt;factoring problems would have significant implications for
cryptography. &lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the programs in
