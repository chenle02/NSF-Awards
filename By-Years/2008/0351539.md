EAR-0351539&lt;br/&gt;Simpson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very broadband
seismometer is an ultra-low noise sensor with exceptional dynamic range that is
the primary sensor for low-frequency seismology and is installed at all 126
stations of the Global Seismographic Network (GSN). The geoscience community is
aware of significant advances in sensor physics and engineering, and thus is
seems appropriate at this time to consider whether and how such advances might
be applied to the design of a new-generation seismic sensor. This award will
support an two-day interdisciplinary workshop that will bring together people
from the geoscience, engineering, and physics communities involved in sensor
technology, to create both short- and long-term plans for the development of the
next generation of broadband seismic sensors.&lt;br/&gt;
