The Biology Department is improving the quality of its undergraduate education
in the areas of physiology and microbiology through the acquisition of several
pieces of equipment. A microcomputer linked to a microplate reader and a diode
array spectrophotometer involve students in interactive exercises across a
variety of organ systems and metabolic processes. The microplate reader and
accessories provide students with exposure to diagnostic procedures including
monitoring of hormone levels, detection of infectious agents in situ and
determination of levels of specific antibodies. The diode array
spectrophotometer allows students to perform kinetic studies on enzymes, measure
the oxidation-reduction spectrum of hemoglobin, and determine the concentration
of cytochromes in respiratory cells. The combination of experience in these
diagnostic and biochemical methodologies and computer simulations in the
physiology and microbiology courses gives the students the necessary foundation
to excel in a variety of biological careers. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
