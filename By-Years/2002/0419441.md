This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop an integrated microchip system for glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb). The
approach adapts existing protocols for GHb detection using capillary gel
electrophoresis and pulsed amperometric detection.

The commercial application of this project will be to provide an economic
glucose monitoring device for diabetics.
