Hempel and his graduate students are engaged in several related projects
concerning the topology and geometry of manifolds of dimensions two and three.
The ultimate goals of this research are progress towards the classification and
homeomorphism problems for 3-manifolds. The techniques involve a study of the
(immersed and/or embedded) incompressible surfaces in a 3-manifold, a study of
branched covering spaces, and a study of the mapping class group of surfaces.
The projects include: (1) A study of the lattice of all (closed, oriented)
3-manifolds as branched covers of the 3-sphere, branched over some fixed
universal link, e.g., the figure-eight knot. (2) The development of a theory of
complexity for normal subgroups of fundamental groups of surfaces directed
towards questions of existence, reducibility, etc. for Heegaard splittings of
3-manifolds. Three-dimensional manifolds are the next simplest geometric objects
after surfaces (two-dimensional manifolds), but while surfaces have long been
classified up to topological equivalence, the same problem for 3-manifolds is
very much alive and obviously far more complicated.
