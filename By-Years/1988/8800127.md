The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports basic
research in Organometallic Photochemistry. This research supported by the
program is aimed at future efforts in solar conversion and photocatalysis.
Pulsed laser flash photolysis (FP), through which kinetically-labile species in
solution implicated in important thermal reactions of substituted metal
carbonyls and silenes may be generated, will be employed to probe intermediate
reaction steps. Rates of reaction will be investigated by both UV/visible and IR
spectroscopy and as a function of variable high pressure (FP/HP) to 200 MPa. The
FP/IR technique, which employs a line-tuneable IR diode laser analyzing beam, is
under continuing development in the project. It will afford high-resolution
carbonyl stretching spectra through which bonding properties in metal carbonyl
transients can be probed. Successful demonstration of FP/HP which affords
volumes of activation will be particularly useful in the elucidation of
mechanisms of reaction for photochemically-generated metal carbonyl
intermediates where corresponding thermal reactions take place via interchange
pathways. The energetics of specific reactions of photoproduced coordinatively-
unsaturated metal carbonyls with halogenated solvents to form X-to-metal
coordinate bonds, and with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents to form
three-center C-H-to-metal bonds, will be probed. FP/IR will also be employed to
investigate trans-cis isomerization in substituted coordinatively-unsaturated
metal carbonyls and will be extended also to investigations of "trapping"
reactions of silenes in which the Si-H stretching frequencies will be monitored.
