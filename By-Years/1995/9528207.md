9528207 Mathine This proposal is for the development and integration of an
infrared detector that is integrated with CMOS technology for detection of low
light levels with high bit rates. Specifically, this proposal will address, the
detector design, the integration process, and the amplifier design. This
technology will be developed to accommodate detection in the near infrared (=
0.85 um) or (1.3 um - 1.55 um) light. This proposal will perform the prototyping
in the A1GaAs system (= 0.85 um). ***
