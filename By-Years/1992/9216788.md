A series of laboratory experiments in a wave tank will be conducted to study
the non-linear energy transfer to short waves in the presence of long wave to
improve the interpretation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing of
ocean surface waves. The experimental results will be also used to assess the
accuracy of new numerical model of wave interactions as well as standard wave
theory.
