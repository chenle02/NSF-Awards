OBJECTIVES To provide the opportunity for minority students in economics to
routinely use computers for their assignments. To provide a computer laboratory
for economics majors who need to import data and use advanced statistical
methods and quantitative models. To provide the opportunity for non-engineering
or science majors_e.g., architecture and humanities students_taking electives in
economics to use computer applications. To provide computer support for an
undergraduate program being developed in Telecommunications; which will be
supported mainly by Economics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and
Management courses. METHODS TO BE EMPLOYED A dedicated computer facility will be
established in proximity to the Department of Economics office in CCNY's North
Academic Center. This will initially be furnished to accommodate at least 18
students at a time, and be a highly secured and supervised spaced. A separate
secured room within the facility will house the file server computer. The NSF
and matching funds will be used to purchase the following: One file server
computer with a high capacity printer; eighteen terminals; and the required
hardware and software for networking through a LAN and accessing the Internet.
SIGNIFICANCE TO ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION The proposed PC lab will enhance the
quality of existing economics courses that involve the teaching and use of:
economic and managerial modeling, including forecasting and simulation; applied
statistics; empirical data analysis; and what-if (scenario) analyses. It will
also enable the introduction of new courses heavily focused on empirical
application and experimentation. Literature searches and data gathering for
papers will also be greatly facilitated. Most importantly, these capabilities
will be available to a sizable population of minority students.
