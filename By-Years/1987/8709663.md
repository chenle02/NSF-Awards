This proposal requests partial support to defray the cost of organizing the
Fourth International Symposium on Mass Spectrometry. The symposium will be
hosted by the University of Rochester and will feature contributed and invited
oral presentations and a published volume of the contributions. The focus of the
4th symposium is the application of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in areas
such as oceanography, geochemistry, solar-terrestrial physics and hydrology.
Research in these areas is a responsibility of the Geosciences directorate of
NSF, and AMS analysis has made significant contributions by allowing
measurements to be made on much smaller samples than heretofore possible. I
recommend support of the symposium.
