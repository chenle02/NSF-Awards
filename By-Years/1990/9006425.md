This study will examine the potential that an array of molecules with inducing
properties involved in bacterial infection of plants exists, and seeks to
determine the chemistry, specificity, and roles of these molecules in plant-
bacterial interactions. The focus will be identification of signal compounds,
the physiological roles of inducers in the plant that produces them, and to a
limited extent, the receptors for these inducers. It is expected that such
studies at detailed chemical and biological levels will lead to a fuller
understanding of events connected with establishment of, or resistance to,
bacterial infections in a variety of plants, and be of value in broadening the
spectrum of plants that can be transformed by bacteria such as those in the
genus Agrobacterium. How plants, and the bacteria able to infect them,
communicate with each other at the molecular level to determine susceptibility
or resistance to infection is a prime focus of this study. A fuller
understanding of these events may lead to the ability to transform plant systems
that are now recalcitrant to such genetic change. //
