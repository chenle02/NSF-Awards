The goals of this fifteen-month project are to design and implement a curriculum
for the critical first year of calculus at comprehensive universities and two-
year colleges. The program adapts and synthesizes methods from successful
calculus reform efforts and is crafted to meet local needs. The curriculum
stresses and facilitates cooperative learning, develops visual thinking with the
aid of interactive graphing technology, and uses writing to help students learn
and communicate mathematics. These methods are integrated in an environment that
focuses on the central ideas of calculus and provides a progression of problems
and projects to challenge students while improving their confidence and study
skills. The project establishes a collaborative partnership among Sam Houston
State University, North Harris College, San Jacinto College Central, and Tomball
College. Two faculty members from each of these four institutions will serve as
site leaders. All eight site leaders will meet regularly to share ideas,
experiences, and materials. A volume of student assignments will be compiled to
serve as a resource for college faculty across the nation.
