The Mathematics Process Writing Project builds on two previous NSF-supported
teacher enhancement projects at Mount Holyoke College. Each year, 18 teachers
involved in Mount Holyoke's SummerMath for Teachers program will be selected to
write reflective narratives about mathematical teaching and learning processes
in their own classrooms. A semester-long course and a series of workshops will
support this activity. At the same time, project staff will prepare a book of
case studies of teachers who have participated successfully in these inservice
activities. These documents will be piloted in inservice teacher enhancement
programs. Cost sharing is provided by local schools and Mount Holyoke College in
the amount of 42% of the NSF award.
