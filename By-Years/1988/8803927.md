This proposal requests funds to obtain a protein sequencer. The instrumentation
will be used in several investigations described in the proposal. Studies will
be conducted to determine types of leghemoglobins which are present in soybean
root nodules another project will investigate thylakoid protein phosphorylation
in wheat chloroplasts. The structure of the ACTH receptor will be investigated.
The structure and function in the F ATPase of mammalian mitochondria will also
be investigated. Finally, two additional investigations will study virus.host
cell receptor proteins and human growth hormone analogues.
