This research examines the development of conceptual thought in infancy and
early childhood, and the way these developments are reflected in early language.
Until recently, we have had little information about the way infants
conceptualize the world. It has traditionally been thought that infants first
form concepts about concrete objects, such as dogs, chairs, and cars, and only
later develop broader concepts of animals, furniture, and vehicles. However,
research from our laboratory indicates that the broader concepts precede the
more specific ones. Infants first form global and rather diffuse concepts, for
example a general notion of how animate things differ from inanimate ones. With
experience these gradually become differentiated into more adult-like concepts.
In addition our tests of language comprehension indicate that a good deal of
infant vocabulary refers to broader and more diffuse concepts than the meanings
these words have for adults. This research uses several new techniques,
involving the way that infants handle and explore objects. One of these
techniques uses imitation to discover what preverbal children understand from
events. We model events using little objects and then encourage the infants to
imitate what they have seen. Infants and young children will only imitate what
they understand, so by carefully varying the choices of objects available for
them to use for their imitations, we can discover how they have construed the
events that we model, even when they are too young to describe the events in
words. The overall goal of the research is to provide a systematic body of
knowledge about the preverbal foundations of thinking so that we can better
understand what young children need to know in order to learn language. These
studies are also important to provide an assessment of the level of young
children's understanding of the world at the time they start preschool.
