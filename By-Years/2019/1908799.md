This workshop will be held April 12-14, 2019 at the University of Minnesota. The
workshop will focus on forming a community of researchers from underrepresented
communities interested in commutative algebra. The workshop is primarily aimed
at graduate students in their first through third years of a Ph.D. program. The
goals of the workshop are to (a) introduce participants to cutting edge research
topics in commutative algebra, (b) facilitate the formation of mentoring
relationships between participants and faculty in commutative algebra, (c)
strengthen the network of underrepresented researchers in commutative algebra
and surrounding fields, and (d) develop collaborative relationships that cut
across standard topic-collaborations and involve diverse groups of researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will include presentations from prominent
researchers, active group work, opportunities for participants to present their
own research, and community building activities. The workshop will have four
50-minute plenary lectures given by tenured or tenure-track faculty, four
20-minute talks given by senior grad students, and two poster sessions
encouraged for all non-speaker participants. Furthermore, in order to help
participants better understand the techniques and methods presented in the
plenary talks, there will be discussion sessions and problem sessions for active
work. The plenary talks are centered around commutative algebra, but the
intended speakers have interests intersecting representation theory, algebraic
geometry, combinatorics, and computational algebra. The conference website can
