Research on the comparative use of concentration camps is limited, even though
more than 150 such systems were employed across more than 90 countries between
1896 and 2018, including at least 15 after 2001. This project will produce
original new global datasets on concentration camp systems from 1896-2018 that
will be made publicly available. The new datasets will facilitate study of the
causes, conduct, and consequences of concentration camp systems and therefore
will enable new scholarly research that examines the role played by
concentration camp systems in contentious politics, government repression,
forced migration, and political
violence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce
two original datasets on the use of concentration camps globally between 1896
and 2018 in over 90 countries. Camps are defined as bounded and fortified spaces
housing minoritized populations subject to irregular detention, whom camp
administrators purposefully neglect, often force into labor, and sometimes kill
in large numbers. The construction of the datasets will be based on systematic
coding of information from a diverse range of sources. The first dataset will
include details of the approximately 150 systems of concentration camps. The
second dataset will then catalogue details of the thousands of individual camps
of which these systems are collectively comprised. These datasets will advance
understanding of concentration camps by enabling quantitative research and
facilitating comparison of historical and modern cases. The datasets will
therefore significantly advance scientific understanding of the causes, conduct,
and consequences of concentration camps as well comparative patterns of mass
detention inside and outside of war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
