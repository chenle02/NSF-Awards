9505833 Milnor The proposed research covers a wide array of problems in
dynamical systems: real and complex 1- and 2-dimensional systems, Kleinian
groups, Hamiltonian systems, and hyperbolic systems are among the topics to be
pursued. The field of dynamics is an enormous one, with major contributions
having been made by scientists from many different disciplines. This reflects
the fact that it is also a field with important applications to many fields. In
particular, two-dimensional dynamical systems can be used to model ocean
dynamics involving shallow water waves.
