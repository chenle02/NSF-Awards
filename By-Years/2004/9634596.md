9634596 Toner This is a new award for a theoretical project comprised of three
components, all of which involve strongly fluctuating systems with many degrees
of freedom. These components are: (1) the theory of flocking, i.e., collective
motion of large swarms of organisms that attempt to follow their neighbors; (2)
a study of phase transitions in tethered membranes and, in particular, the
transitions from the crumpled phase to the tubule phase and the tubule to the
flat phase; (3) application of hydrodynamics to model the dynamical evolution of
large fluctuations in smectic A liquid crystals as measured by time resolved
x-ray scattering. %%% This theoretical research will study a number of topics in
the physics of soft condensed matter, that is, materials such as polymers and
liquid crystals (used in video displays). The research also involves studies of
flocking. Flocking is the ability of large groups of entities, such as birds, to
almost instantaneously change direction as a group. How can individual birds
know to all move at the same time? This also applies to biological organisms.
