This is a continuation of a project to develop and operate air Cherenkov
telescopes at South Pole Station for the purpose of studying discreet
astrophysical sources of very high energy (VHE) gamma rays. The project is
called Gammas At South Pole (GASP), and this second phase is GASP II. The
primary instrument consists of an array of parabolic mirrors, with
photomultiplier tubes at their foci, which can detect light from VHE
interactions in a small volume of the atmosphere. The experiment will shed light
on the origin of cosmic rays and possibly on sources of exotic radiation, if
such radiation exists. GASP complements the pre-existing South Pole Air Shower
Experiment (SPASE), which is operated by the Bartol Research Institute of the
University of Delaware and Leeds University (UK), and extends downward by two to
three orders of magnitude the energy threshold of SPASE. SPASE can survey most
of the southern sky, and GASP will be able to focus on small regions of
suspected activity. The location at South Pole allows GASP to view a single
object for extended periods (weeks to months) through a constant thickness of
atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations allow only a few hours of viewing at a
time of a given object. The Polar location also means that the very interesting
high declination southern sky is always within view, which gives GASP a great
advantage over any mid- latitude observatory. The project is a collaboration of
the University of Wisconsin, Purdue University, Bartol Research Institute of the
University of Delaware and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. It is jointly
funded by NSF's Divisions of Polar Programs, the Wisconsin Alumni Research
Foundation and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
