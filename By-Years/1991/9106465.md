Proper mapping of processors is a critical component of programming on message-
passing machines. The proposed research focuses on the design and development of
a prototype environment-sensitive mapping tool which allows the programmer to
generate, assess and optimize mappings. The prototype mapping tool will be
integrated with modified tools for parallel debugging, performance monitoring
and program visualization. The resulting new more complete environment will be
targeted to MIMD, message passing multiprocessors.//
