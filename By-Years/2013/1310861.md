This action funds Adrienne George of University of South Florida, College of
Marine Science to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the
summer of 2013 at Chinese Academy of Sciences, South China Sea Institute of
Oceanology in Guangzhou, China. The project title is "Comparing Coral Diseases
and Parasites at Sites with Anthropogenic Stress at Sanya, Hainan Island." The
host scientist is Dr. Kefu Yu.

This project characterizes and compares coral diseases and parasites in China at
three reef sites (Luhuitou, Xiaodonghai and Dadonghai fringing reefs) at Sanya,
Hainan Island. This project identifies coral diseases and parasites in China
through coral health surveys, analysis of carbon requirements of the microbes in
coral mucus, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and histological
examination. This is the first comprehensive study to characterize and identify
the coral diseases of Sanya, Hainan Island, China. Currently, there is very
little information on coral disease and parasitism in China. This study provides
baseline information for researchers that will carry on the work. The results of
this study will give the host country a better understanding of their coral reef
ecosystem.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, a catalogue of coral lesions is being made
freely available on Dr. Yu's Chinese Academy of Sciences web page. This allows
researchers, scientists and the general public to have access to this
information. Additionally, results of the study will be presented at scientific
meetings and we expect at least one peer-reviewed publication.
