This project supports a Doctoral Student Symposium at the Third International
Conference on Design Computing and Cognition. The goals of the main conference
is to describe and discuss (1) state-of-the-art research on computational,
artificial intelligence, and cognitive science theories and models of design,
and (2) cutting-edge intelligent, interactive, and human-centered information
technologies for supporting design. The goal of the interdisciplinary doctoral
student symposium is to encourage, expand and guide the participation of young
researchers starting research in design computing and cognition.
