The investigator will study two different intersection theories
in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry: the arithmetic Chow rings of varieties
defined&lt;br/&gt;over the integers and the quantum cohomology rings of
complex&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The varieties considered are homogeneous spaces
of&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups, and the goal is to understand the arithmetic and
quantum&lt;br/&gt;Schubert calculus. This allows one to effectively compute
numerical&lt;br/&gt;invariants such as heights, on the one hand, and Gromov-
Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants, on the other. A further aim is to answer related
questions&lt;br/&gt;about the combinatorics of modern Schubert calculus and
the&lt;br/&gt;polynomials which represent degeneracy loci of vector
bundles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the symmetries observed in geometric
objects has been a&lt;br/&gt;meeting point of mathematics and physics for a long
time. The many&lt;br/&gt;experiments and computations made in the 19th century
eventually led&lt;br/&gt;to the cohomology and intersection theories of 20th
century mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;which were applied to solve important open
problems in both fields. At&lt;br/&gt;present, we face a similar situation in
modern number theory and string&lt;br/&gt;theory, and computations of concrete
examples are crucial to guide our&lt;br/&gt;intuition and to better understand
the general theories. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies two new intersection
theories, Arakelov theory and quantum&lt;br/&gt;cohomology, in many examples
which are good testing grounds for&lt;br/&gt;both of them. The potential
applications are a better understanding of&lt;br/&gt;Diophantine equations and
approximation, used in coding theory and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science,
and the enumerative geometry of curves,&lt;br/&gt;related to classical algebraic
geometry and quantum field theory in physics.&lt;br/&gt;
