This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is targeted to save
semiconductor wafers from being deeply scratched by unchecked large errant
agglomerates in chemical mechanical planarizing or polishing (CMP) slurries. CMP
has become the method of choice for restoring the surface trueness of wafers at
all stages of integrated circuit manufacture. No method currently exists that
can implement a CMP-safe slurry at the point of use. The proposed novel
technology of Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM) is a means to
constructively control acoustic microcavitation and direct its high intensity
energy implosions at specific particle sites. ACIM will achieve both the
detection and destruction of the stray large particles and render the entire
slurry CMP-safe at the point of use. A high-end wafer scratched at the final
stages of manufacturer results in a large direct loss. Using ACIM to save post-
CMP wafers is therefore a direct savings. The ACIM Wafer Saver, the slurry
monitor-comminuter, would be the first fully in-line, real-time, point of use
device for detecting stray large particles and agglomerates, and for reducing
them to a nano-fine state. The rapidly growing CMP industry presents a well-
developed market for this environmentally friendly ACIM tool.
