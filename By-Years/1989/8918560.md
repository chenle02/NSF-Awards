The fifth World Conference on Computers and Education will be held in Sydney,
Australia, in July 1990. The WCCE 90 is sponsored by IFIP. In concert with WCCE
90, a post conference will be held in Japan. In order to allow qualified
participants from the USA to attend one or both of the conference, AFIPS
requested 31,000 to support the travel of 20 scientist from the USA. Scientist
receiving travel funds were selected on a committee of qualified reviews; the
reviewers were not eligible for the travel funds. The maximum travel award was
$1,500.
