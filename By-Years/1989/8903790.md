This award will provide the funds needed to acquire field equipment so that the
Principal Investigator and colleagues can set up a field camp in northwestern
Montana to carry out their exploration of the St. Mary River and Willow Creek
geological formations as sources of dinosaur fossil bones and eggs. Field work
by the Principal Investigator, in collaboration with J.R. Horner of the Museum
of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana, during 1986-88 has resulted in the discovery
of two new bonebeds, a nesting horizon and various articulated fossil remains of
rare dinosaur species. These and future discoveries offer opportunities for the
study of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fauna and for the analysis of the evolution
and extinction of dinosaurs. The location of the new fossil beds requires
setting up a new campsite for this field work.
