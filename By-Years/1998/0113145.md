TITLE: BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY OF PRAIRIE DOGS&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: JOHN
L. HOOGLAND&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Utah prairie dogs are colonial, burrowing
rodents that are in acute danger of extinction. Research on their ecology and
social behavior at Bryce Canyon National Park will help conservation biologists
to formulate a recovery plan for these rare
animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biologists argue about the details, but they all
agree that individuals should avoid extreme inbreeding. Utah prairie dogs,
however, commonly mate with close kin such as parents, siblings and offspring.
Long-term research will examine the reproductive success of individuals that
engage in extreme inbreeding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although infanticide is
ubiquitous among animals, the frequency is usually low and the victims are
usually genetically unrelated to killers. For Utah prairie dogs, however,
infanticide affects 27% of litters. Further, males frequently kill the offspring
of females with whom they copulated. Research will investigate reasons for these
unusual features of infanticide among Utah prairie
dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA- fingerprints indicate a startling result for
Utah prairie dogs: females commonly rear the offspring of other females.
Research will investigate whether mothers that rear foster offspring increase
the safety of their own offspring from both infanticide and
predation.&lt;br/&gt;
