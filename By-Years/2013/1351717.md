The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is
to investigate the dynamics of complex traffic. Complex traffic is characterized
by heterogeneous vehicle types (e.g. bikes and cars) that vary in size and
performance characteristics but share the same infrastructure, and is often
controlled by humans. These features are increasingly common in the US during
extreme congestion generated by special events, and are pervasive in emerging
economies worldwide. This research postulates that advances in mathematical
models, informed by and validated with large volumes of traffic data, are key
elements to unlock the full understanding of complex traffic. This research
focuses on (i) the development of mathematical models of heterogeneous traffic,
(ii) modeling and analysis of human-directed traffic and (iii) the development
of fast and accurate estimation algorithms to integrate data into city-scale
models. Data to validate the models and estimation algorithms are obtained
through a newly developed traffic sensing technology.

If successful, this work will support the development of next generation traffic
monitoring and management systems. Ultimately, this will help reduce the
multibillion-dollar annual cost of congestion during special events in the US.
Educational and outreach activities are executed to prepare students with the
computing competencies needed to engineer the next generation of computer
enhanced infrastructure. This is achieved through new educational initiatives
for undergraduate and graduate students that emphasize programming and
computational skills applied to problems in civil engineering. Reproducible
computational research initiatives within the transportation community will help
maximize the potential impact of the research and increase likelihood of
adoption by practitioners. Engagement of the broader community on applications
of computing in transportation is achieved through outreach and open courseware
activities.
