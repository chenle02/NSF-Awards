The project team is developing a package of distance learning courses for
technicians in photonics. Remote-controlled laboratory exercises, multimedia
interactive laboratory manuals and courseware, are being developed and used to
train technicians at the PI's institution and at other institutions in the
region. These materials, in conjunction with materials developed on a previous
project, constitute a complete package of photonics courses with laboratories
for remote students. In order to encourage the sharing of facilities nationwide,
the group is developing a database of remote-controlled laboratories, which is
being hosted on their website. They plan to link this site to those of national
organizations, such as SPIE. Evaluation plans include soliciting feedback from
students on the textbooks and laboratory materials, monitoring student
performance, and obtaining feedback from the employers whose employees are
taking the courses. National workshops are being used to disseminate the
materials and to help teams at other locations undertake the development of
similar programs.
