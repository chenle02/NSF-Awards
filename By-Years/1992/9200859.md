Identity and ethnicity are real dimensions of the social world, but their
content and construction are often misunderstood. Elucidation of the
manifestation, if any, and the basis of an individual's identity with a group
can provide understanding of the process by which one becomes aware of one's
ethnicity. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the reality of
Appalachian identity among individuals living in Appalachia and individuals
living in the urban Midwest but originating from the Appalachian region by means
of in-depth interviews beginning with a purposive sample and shifting to a
theoretical sample as information is accrued. The study hypothesizes that
Appalachian identity is based on an individual's awareness of the particular
definitions and devaluation of people from the Central Appalachian region by
mainstream American society. This identity is a response to negative stereotypes
and may also be a response to feelings of being discriminated against on the
basis of regional origin. This project will contribute to the scientific
understanding of social relationships and the link between individual and
society. It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young
scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
