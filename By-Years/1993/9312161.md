9312161 Beatley Management of natural hazards raises many ethical questions.
They arise at all stages from prior mitigation to reconstruction, and with
respect to all kinds of hazards, whether earthquakes or floods. Rarely do those
making management policies and decisions see them explicitly as involving
ethical choices; typically, they view them in technical, political and economic
terms. This project seeks to expand the understanding of the nature of ethical
issues which arise in the area of natural hazards management, and of the variety
of concepts, standards and other ethical tools that could be useful to public
officials in resolving these issues. The research tasks are conceptual and
empirical, involving further review of the relevant literatures and development
of a conceptual framework, fieldwork on a set of hazard case studies which raise
significant ethical questions, and the preparation of casebook and ethical
guidelines. The literature review will cull the hazards and disaster literature
and the applied ethics literature in order to identify central ethical questions
of use in developing a framework of ethical concepts and cases of particular
relevance for the fieldwork portion of the study. Case studies will collect and
compile background materials and conduct telephone and on-site interviews. The
casebook will contain summaries of the case studies, each focusing on ethical
issues and ending with a set of questions highlighting the ethical problems, and
a set of guidelines attempting to facilitate ethical judgment for hazards
management. The book will be widely distributed. ***
