9527034 Bodnar This proposed research will continue to study the distribution of
metals in porphyry systems. Emphasis will be placed on quantification of the
metal contents of inclusions from different paragentic stages and different
vertical and horizontal positions in well characterized porphyry deposits. The
Red Mountain, Arizona, porphyry system, which represents the transition between
deeper classical porphyry mineralization an shallow high-sulfidation enargite-
gold mineralization, will be studied in detail to monitor the behavior of metals
from the deep shallow portions of one system.
