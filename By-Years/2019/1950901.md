This award provides renewed funding for three years for the longstanding
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Northern Arizona
University (NAU), Lowell Observatory, and the USGS Astrogeology Science Center.
Ten student participants per year will be paired with NAU, Lowell, and USGS
scientists to conduct astrophysics research into a wide variety of topics,
including planetary, solar, stellar, and galactic astrophysics. In addition, the
students will attend biweekly seminars to learn more about professional
astrophysics, responsible research conduct, and applying to graduate school. The
Site will also introduce students to cutting-edge telescopes, including Lowell's
Discovery Channel Telescope and the Naval Precision Optical Interferometer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering high-quality research experiences to students
at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to
increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants will
develop the research methods and analytical skills (mathematical, computational,
and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to
remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an
active and highly developed plan to recruit underrepresented minorities into its
program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
