The goal of the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers. To meet this goal, the ADVANCE program has awarded 19
Institutional Transformation grants and 27 Leadership grants to date. Many of
these grant recipients have female engineering faculty as a primary or
significant area of focus. Communication among ADVANCE awardees and
dissemination to the broader engineering community are critical to increasing
the impact of the program. To facilitate sharing the findings among the grantees
and to increase the broader impacts of the program with the engineering
community, a one-day meeting is planned for the Fall, 2004 in Arlington,
Virginia. Participants will included the engineering deans and the principal
investigators of the institutions having ADVANCE Institutional Transformation
and ADVANCE Leadership awards, and engineering deans from other universities.
