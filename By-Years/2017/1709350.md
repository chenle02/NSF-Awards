A conference on "Arithmetic of Function Fields" will take place June 26-30,
2017, at the University of Muenster, Germany. The purpose of this conference is
to bring together international experts in a variety of areas of arithmetic
geometry, automorphic forms, and function field arithmetic. The emphasis of the
conference will be on recent spectacular developments in the theory of Drinfeld
moduli spaces, Drinfeld modular forms, and their applications. It is hoped that
having at the same place and time a large number of researchers with different
viewpoints on function field arithmetic will illuminate previously unnoticed
connections within the area, thus facilitating future progress. The organizers
of the conference will make a strong effort to ensure an active participation of
a large number of junior researchers and underrepresented groups.

Since their emergence in 1970s, Drinfeld moduli spaces had a tremendous impact
on the Langlands program leading to a successful resolution of the global and
local Langlands conjectures over function fields. Over the last few years, there
has been an explosion of activity in function field arithmetic, with many
spectacular results on special values of higher derivatives of L-functions of
automorphic forms, special values of Carlitz-Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld
modular forms. Moreover, new tantalizing connections have been discovered
between different topics of function field arithmetic, such as special values of
characteristic p zeta functions, deformations of Drinfeld modular forms, and
function field analogue of Fontaine's theory. In many of these works, Drinfeld
moduli spaces play a prominent role. These developments, along with possible
future directions of research, will be addressed by the invited speakers of this
conference with the hope to inspire new generations to take part in this
important and very active area of Number Theory.
