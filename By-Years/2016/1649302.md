This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the
opportunity to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more
senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet
potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be
demonstrated by vendors. This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting
the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference
on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), which is one of two major
international robotics conferences co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and
Automation Society. The conference, which in 2016 will be held in Daejeon DCC,
South Korea, attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry
workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.
