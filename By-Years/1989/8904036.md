This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase a computer
workstation system to be installed and maintained in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds required. The workstation and associated hardware
are to be used primarily by the Principal Investigator, Joann Stock, and her
graduate students in their research projects in structural geology and plate
tectonics. The PI's research is focussed on plate reconstructions (including
their uncertainties and their tectonic implications) and on geologic mapping of
structures indicative of plate boundary deformations in the geologic record. The
work requires detailed analysis of large magnetic, bathymetric and geoid data
sets, as well as the compilation and printing of maps, all of which will require
intensive use of the workstation.
