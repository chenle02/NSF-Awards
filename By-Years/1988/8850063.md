The Appalachian Center of the University of Kentucky will offer 20 junior high
level students from this region laboratory, field and classroom experiences in a
multidisciplinary setting. They will study landforms and land use, water
quality, forest management, and energy production and consumption, as they
relate to mountain communities. The goal of the two-week residential program is
to instill and maintain student interest and excitement about science and
mathematics and to provide them with information on the preparation necessary to
pursue a career in one of these disciplines.
