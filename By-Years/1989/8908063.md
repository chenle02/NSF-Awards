This research activity is supported under the Research Opportunities for Women
- - Planning Grant Program. This award will allow the principal investigator to
begin to assess the legislative impact of the women's movement in the United
States. The investigator will develop a plan to evaluate whether political
process theory is a better framework for understanding legislative impact than
resource mobilization theory. The investigator has a solid background for this
type of research and the issues to be addressed are both timely and important.
There is good reason to believe that, consistent with the objectives of the
Research Opportunities for Women Program, this award may result in a successful
follow-up proposal.
