An NYI award will support research on the deposition and properties of thin
films for tribological applications. Ion enhanced physical vapor deposition
using unbalanced magnetrons to improve plasma confinement will be used to
deposit hard coatings, such as various metal nitride, carbide and oxide
compositions, as well as superlattice and nanophase materials. Deposition
mechanisms will be studied and the mechanical, tribological and other relevant
properties of the coatings will be evaluated and related to microstructure and
processing parameters.
