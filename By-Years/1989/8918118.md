It is recognized nationally that major steps must be taken to attract minority
students to scientific careers. This is especially true for the marine sciences.
A program to increase the participation of minority undergraduates in marine
science will be initiated. The specific activities will include: 1) setting up a
planning office for the newly formed Minority Institution Marine Science
Association (MIMSA); 2) establishing a communication network for use by members
of the Southern Association of Marine Labs (SAML) and MIMSA; 3) gathering and
disseminating information on minority undergraduates interested in marine
science and activities at marine science institutions that would be of interest
to these students and HMCU faculty members; 4) developing a list of minority
scientists who could act as seminar speakers and role models for the minority
students; and 5) providing funds for other activities for minority
undergraduates, such as, summer internships, travel to participate in cruises or
field trips.
