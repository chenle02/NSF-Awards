This is a program to provide small research grants to sociologists, supporting
pilot projects, modest research travel needs, and occasional conferences to
advance a variety of research areas in sociology. The current grant continues
the Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline of the American Sociological
Association. The Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline program aims to
nurture the development of scientific knowledge by supporting small,
groundbreaking research initiatives and other important scientific activities.
Through ASA's coordination and outreach, funds are allocated expeditiously for
scholars to engage in exploratory research where support from other sources
would be difficult to acquire. Thus, these small grants constitute an invaluable
form of venture capital for research that has potential for challenging the
discipline, for stimulating new lines of scientific research, and for
facilitating new networks of scientific collaboration. The Fund for the
Advancement of the Discipline provides opportunities for substantive and
methodological breakthroughs, broadens the dissemination of scientific
knowledge, and provides leverage for acquisition of additional research funds
from other sources. These small grants made through the American Sociological
Association are a highly efficient way to stimulate new research approaches, and
maintain the intellectual vitality of scientific sociology.
