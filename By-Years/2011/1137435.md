Funds are requested to support graduate student and new Ph.D. travel stipends
and three training workshops on cutting-edge methods for research on
comprehension and discourse analysis that will immediately precede the 2011
Annual Meeting of the Society for Text &amp; Discourse, to be held in Poitiers,
France, from July 11-13, 2011. Discourse analysis can make invaluable
contributions to the creation and investigation of effective educational
contexts, including the design of instructional materials and technologies, and
developing an understanding how students interact with them. Supporting this
training opportunity will build critical capacity for future educational
research in STEM fields. One of the bedrock questions for STEM education is how
comprehension is achieved. A number of methodological approaches in text and
discourse processing research can contribute to answering this question. The
planned workshops are on a set of methodologies that will advance research on
the processes underlying comprehension and intelligent tutors that can support
learning in educational settings including STEM domains.
