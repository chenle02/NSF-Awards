The objective of this program is to advance the fundamental understanding and
further develop new device architectures based on the use of low dimensional
carbons (nanotubes, graphene) as electronically gated contact electrodes. The
PIs have already demonstrated new devices exploiting the phenomenon.
Specifically, a new architecture transistor that overcomes the inherent mobility
limitations of organic semiconductors and a solar cell having a power conversion
efficiency that can be dramatically improved by electronic gating.

The intellectual merit is in the promise to 1) deepen the theoretical
understanding of the phenomenon by developing a comprehensive model that
captures essential physics of low-dimensional-carbon-contacts and related
vertical devices, 2) provide design rules for exploiting this property in
devices that establish the benefits and the limits, and 3) expand the range of
the devices in new directions and from individual components to functional
circuits (e.g. inverters, logic gates, ring oscillator).

Broader impacts: organic semiconductors have physical limitations that bound
the range of what they can do. The transformative aspect of this project is that
the devices to be developed will greatly extend that range allowing for faster,
higher density, plastic electronic circuits, brighter, more energy efficient
displays, and higher efficiency solar cells. The educational and outreach
activities will include translating the research progress to the undergraduate
and graduate course materials, developing a web-based learning module,
supervising minority and female student research through the outreach programs
in University of Florida, and providing early exposure of K-12 students to
electronics technology through the Student Science Training Program.
