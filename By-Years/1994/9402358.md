9402358 Rix An important soil parameter that controls the amplification of
seismic waves as they propagate from bedrock to the surface is the hysteretic
damping ratio of the soil. Damping is usually measured on soil samples tested in
the laboratory, but the effect of the disturbance on the soil properties when
the sample is removed from the ground is uncertain. Moreover, the frequencies
used in the laboratory tests are usually much higher than those of interest in
earthquake engineering. An alternative approach is to use field tests to measure
the damping ratio in situ. However, despite the advantages of in situ tests,
there have been relatively few field attenuation measurements reported. One of
the objectives of this project is to develop and implement an insitu test
procedure for damping measurements using surface waves. Surface wave
measurements offer several advantages compared to crosshole and downhole
techniques, one being that they are non-invasive. Another objective is to
understand better the causes of the frequently-observed differences in the
damping values between laboratory and in situ measurements. The project involves
three tasks: 1. To acquire surface wave attenuation data at sites within the
Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina, using several different types of
input motion (swept-sine, random, and transient) to determine which one
provides, for example, the best signal-to-noise ratio. Attenuation data will
also be recorded at several different source-receiver combinations to evaluate
the influence of near-field waves. 2. To develop and evaluate algorithms for:
(i) estimating particle motion amplitude spectra, (ii) calculating attenuation
parameters from observed surface wave amplitudes, and (iii) inverting
attenuation data to obtain damping ratio. Throughout this task, emphasis will be
placed on quantifying the uncertainties involved in each step, with the aim of
establishing not only the most likely value of damping , but also the possible
range of values. 3. Once appropriate field procedures and analysis methods have
been developed as part of Tasks 1 and 2, and in order to compare surface wave
damping values with values obtained from in situ borehole methods and laboratory
tests, to perform surface wave measurements of attenuation at the Treasure
Island National Geotechnical Experimentation Site in San Francisco Bay, and at
one or more sites in the Los Angeles area affected by the Northridge earthquake.
