This two year fellowship for postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Botelho, whose
doctoral training is in political science, the opportunity to obtain training in
the conceptual and methodological foundations of historical research in the area
of science, technology, and society at Johns Hopkins University. The creation in
the mid-forties of the Aeronautics Technological Institute, with the assistance
of MIT and the American government, was a watershed in Brazil's postwar
modernization. Dr. Botelho will explore the international and domestic factors
in the transfer of a technological model, the MIT model, from the United States
to Brazil, and will assess the consequences for Brazil's technology development.
Johns Hopkins is an ideal institution for the postdoctoral study given that
similar historical studies are being carried out for other developing countries
there. This research will contribute to the ongoing comparative and theoretical
re-assessment of the role of engineering communities and their values in
national development in the history of technology and, critically, to the
historical knowledge of technological change in developing countries. In
addition, it contributes to our understanding of the evolution of hybrid
technical professions and institutions--in aeronautics, electronics, and
computer science--critical to postwar development in developed and developing
countries. Finally, the research will shed new light on the complex interplay of
political, technological, and cultural elements contributing to a conceptual
framework for analyzing technology transfer between nations and for assessing
the role of the translation of foreign ideas, values, and institutions in the
international diffusion of engineering disciplines and practices. Given the
current scientific and technological dilemmas facing the majority of developing
countries, such a framework could assist in the design of more effective and
sound policies.
