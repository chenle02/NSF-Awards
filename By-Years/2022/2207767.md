Improved precision in measurement has enabled numerous scientific and technical
breakthroughs. For example, increased resolution in timing arising from the
development of ultrashort laser pulses has enabled entirely new approaches to
study molecular dynamics on short time scales. This project aims at developing
experimental methods for the generation, manipulation and measurement of
quantum-mechanical states of light and to exploit these for quantum-enhanced
sensing under adverse conditions in which optical loss and background noise are
present. The project goes beyond prior work by utilizing multiple optical
channels, or modes, that can have strong quantum-mechanical correlations, known
as entanglement, to both enhance the precision in optical interferometry, but
also suppress the contributions of background noise. To diversify, educate and
train the upcoming quantum workforce the project will provide a solid background
and mentoring in quantum and nonlinear optics for a postdoctoral researcher,
graduate student, undergraduate students, as well as related outreach
activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on the
experimental development of multimode squeezed vacuum states generated by pulsed
spontaneous parametric down conversion. Two different approaches to detecting
the nonclassical light will be developed â€“ a photon-number-resolving
spectrometer and photon-counting sum-frequency generation. The project will
explore theoretically the fundamental limits of sensing in realistic settings,
where loss, noise and other imperfections arise. Photon addition and subtraction
in well-defined temporal modes will be explored as means to boost the
performance of quantum sensing protocols. The project results will advance the
understanding of the role entanglement in sensing and influence future quantum-
enhanced sensing research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
