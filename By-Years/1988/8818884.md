They are requesting funds towards the cost of setting up a new program of
research into spin-states in strongly correlated electronic systems in a range
of materials prepared by thin-film deposition methods in an ultrahigh vacuum
environment. Specifically, they will employ high-resolution (50 meV) angle-
resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and STM tunneling characteristics to study
the quasiparticle spin states and energy gaps around the Fermi energy in thin
films of the new high Tc oxide superconductors, magnetic layers, and related
materials showing highly correlated spin fluctuation phenomena. They take as
their theme one of reducing dimensionality (i.e. 2- dimensional ultrathin films
and surface layers) as a means of exploring the coherence length of spin density
fluctuations. Matching funds towards the cost of installing a special multi-
source vapor deposition chamber (the Eiko El-10 system) into their existing
electron spectroscopic analytical instrumentation is also requested. This will
provide them with a flexible facility for insitu film growth and
characterization down to the single unit cell thickness level, with provision
for controlled oxidation and metal dopant implantation.
