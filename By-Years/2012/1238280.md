The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment
of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Drexel
University of the existing Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS). The
center currently involves Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of
Colorado Boulder (CU), and industry and government partners in the UAS field.
The Drexel site intends to augment the centers current capabilities with
additional capabilities to investigate and develop heath monitor, architectures,
and operational procedures for unmanned aircraft systems.

The planned site, in combination with the existing center plans to support the
US in maintaining its dominance in UAS through cooperative research bringing
together all sectors military, commercial and civil. Impact is expected to
extend to civil and commercial applications that include infrastructure
inspection and monitoring, law enforcement, border patrol, and disaster
recovery. The site plans to have a significant impact on UAS curriculum through
course design, textbooks, new laboratory exercises, and senior design
experiences. The center intends to give students the opportunity to define and
work on research that is directly relevant to industry and government labs.
