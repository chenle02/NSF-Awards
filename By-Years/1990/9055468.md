The Computer Visualizations for Teaching Mathematics project is a three-year
effort initiated by the California State University at Northridge to help
secondary school teachers incorporate a visual emphasis in the teaching of pre-
algebra through precalculus. The project will serve teachers from the Los
Angeles area. Two cadres of 40 teachers will participate in a two-year project,
with overlap in the second summer and the second and third academic years.
Teachers will be involved in a three-week summer institute and a series of
academic year followup activities, including monthly meetings and a winter
institute; a week-long followup is included in the second summer. The project
will introduce teachers to three different experimental programs ( the Alhambra
High School IBM Network for Mathematics and Science Project, the W.M. Keck
Curriculum Project, and the Ohio State Enhancing Mathematics Through Technology
program.) Participants' administrators will attend a portion of the program.
Schools will contribute released time and calculators for their participants.
Other cost sharing is provided by the University, the Los Angeles Unified School
District, the Keck Foundation, IBM, and Texas Instruments. Cost sharing is
provided as approximately 40% of the NSF award.
