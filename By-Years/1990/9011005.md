The principal goal of this research is to understand how institutional,
ecological, and regulatory factors combine to influence characteristics of
organizations and of populations of organizations. This study will examine
competing environmental approaches to understanding organizations. Population
ecology theory, institutional theory, and hypotheses about the direct effects of
regulatory changes on firms will be examined using longitudinal data from 1825
through 1925 on several hundred Massachusetts railway firms. The Commonwealth
collected extensive annual data from all chartered railways that will facilitate
the comparison of competing hypotheses about organizational foundings and
failures, and about an array of internal firm characteristics such as
administrative ratios and the presence of particular functional divisions.
