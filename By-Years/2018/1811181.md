This research project investigates questions in stochastic analysis, a part of
probability theory that studies dynamical systems under the action of random
impulses. A central objective of the project is the study of partial
differential equations perturbed by rough noises; such equations provide
mathematical models for a wide range of phenomena, including interface growth,
turbulence in fluid dynamics, and polymer structure. The research will
investigate, among other topics, the intermittency and chaotic properties of
solutions, which are related to important characteristics of physical systems. A
second objective of the project is to broaden the range of applications of the
stochastic calculus of variations, also called Malliavin calculus. Malliavin
calculus is a mathematical theory that extends the classical calculus of
variations from functions to stochastic processes. It has proved to be a
powerful tool in deriving rates of convergence in central limit theorems, which
are of great relevance in statistical inference. Emphasis will be placed on
analysis of random processes with long memory, which are useful for analysis of
data coming from finance, telecommunications, and other
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses questions in three topical
areas. The first topic is the study of the stochastic heat equation driven by a
Gaussian noise that is white in time and has homogenous spatial covariance. A
challenging goal is to derive a change-of-variable formula for functionals of
the solution and investigate applications of this formula to a range of
questions, including large-time asymptotics and intermittency properties. It is
also planned to further develop the analysis of stochastic partial differential
equations driven by rough noises and time-independent noises. A second topic
concerns applications of Malliavin calculus to a variety of open questions,
including rates of convergence and asymptotic expansions of densities, when the
target distribution is a mixture of Gaussian laws and limit theorems for
geometric Gaussian functionals. A third topic addresses questions in the
analysis of fractional Brownian motion and related self-similar Gaussian
processes, including the dynamics of eigenvalues of matrix-valued fractional
Brownian motions and the exponential integrability of self-intersection local
times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
