The purpose of this project is to develop and test a new framework for modeling
family decision-making based on game-theoretic marriage markets. The first part
of the project will integrate altruism into marriage market models. The second
part of the study will explore the empirical consequences of such models and
their interrelations with bargaining models. The goal is to produce structural
models of marriage and family demands and to empirically estimate such models.
Understanding the economics of family decision-making is crucial to many
important policy issues, including the impacts of taxes and subsidies at the
macro and micro levels, the implications of varieties of child care and child
support programs, the impacts of aid to developing countries, as well as
marriage, divorce, fertility, births to unwed mothers and mortality rates by age
and sex.
