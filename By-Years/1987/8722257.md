Research on Decision Support Systems (DSS) involves the application of
information technology to organizational decision making. It has become clear
that developments in information technology are not matched by research on how
the technology affects decision making and the design of organizations. This
award provides partial support for a collaborative research process which will
identify the reference disciplines of DSS and identify new research directions.
The process will involve interdisciplinary groups whose task will be to
highlight important opportunities and problem areas involving the application of
information systems to the decision making process in organizations.
Specifically, the collaborative research groups will consider how information
technology can support group processes such as top management decision making
and negotiation, how information technology affects organizational boundaries,
and how information technology can be matched to the task, the organization and
the user. The results of the collaborative research process will be presented in
a national conference and be will published in a book setting forth a
interdisciplinary research agenda on decision support systems.
