This award provides support for students to participate in the 2023 Gordon
Research Conference (GRC) on Nuclear Chemistry that will be held at Colby Sawyer
College in New London, New Hampshire, June 11 - 15, 2023, with an associated
Gordon Research Seminar on Nuclear Chemistry June 10 â€“ 11, 2023 at the same
location. These meetings bring together scientists from around the world to
focus on research at the forefront of nuclear chemistry. The conference is
organized in a way to promote significant discussion and time for collaboration
throughout the week.

This award will provide partial support for a limited number of junior
researchers to attend the 2023 GRC. The support for the participants will be
selected by the chairs based on submitted abstracts of their research. This
support will allow participants to attend these meetings who may otherwise not
be able to attend. Participation of young researchers in these meetings plays a
large role in the development of the future leaders of nuclear science.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
