This Computing Research Infrastructure project aims to enhance Worcester
Polytechnic Institute's (WPI) high-performance infrastructure to support its
ongoing research and education centered around big data analytics over scalable
infrastructure. The enhanced compute clustering will provide a scalable
infrastructure to support large-scale data analytics research along a number of
important directions, including (1) a full-fledged software platform for
seamlessly supporting large-scale continuous and recurring workloads with
stream-window-centric query processing, (2) scalable annotation and provenance
management for natively supporting annotations as first-class citizen over big
data and exploiting their semantics in query processing and quality inference,
(3) complex event analytics that combines complex event processing with OLAP
techniques for efficient multi-dimensional event pattern detection in high-speed
large-volume data, and (4) multi-model-driven analytics system on high-velocity
data streams with visual exploration of the derived models and patterns. The
projects collectively address key research challenges related to the analysis of
large volume, high velocity, and wide variety of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
infrastructure is expected to significantly enhance the integration of research
and education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at WPI, including in
particular, WPI's project-oriented undergraduate curriculum, which requires each
undergraduate to complete a year-long research project. The infrastructure will
also benefit a diverse group of researchers at WPI in different departments --
as is the case with the current compute cluster -- to conduct their data-
intensive research. Broad dissemination of results of research enabled by the
infrastructure including research publications, open-source software, and
educational materials are expected to benefit the scientific community at large.
