Under this grant (NSF-DMS-0963706), the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM) will organize and run a series of interdisciplinary
conferences in the mathematical and computational sciences, during the three
years April 2010 through March 2013. The grant includes funding for
interdisciplinary workshops that build on programs initiated by the NSF
Mathematical Sciences Institutes and the SIAM Workshops Celebrating Diversity.
The funding will support travel of students, early career professionals and
invited speakers to SIAM conferences and dissemination of invited conference
presentations and tutorials to the wider community.

SIAM interdisciplinary conferences are distinguished from other conferences in
the mathematical and computational sciences by the extent to which they
routinely attract researchers and practitioners from within the mathematical and
computational sciences and simultaneously from within other sciences, industrial
organizations and government laboratories. As a result they contribute to
advances in the sciences, in government programs, and to the economic
competitiveness of the United States. The conferences in the series address a
broad range of topics and applications, giving them intellectual vibrancy,
timeliness, and reach, and they utilize an open format to identify and incubate
emerging areas through community proposed sessions. The conferences provide a
welcoming environment for students and early career professionals, integrating
education with research. Oversight of the conferences by SIAM officers promotes
diversity by forceful and supportive encouragement of diversity among organizing
committees and invited speakers. In addition, a special focus on diversity is
provided by the SIAM Workshops Celebrating Diversity.
