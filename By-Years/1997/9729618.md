This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for a DS-3 connection to the enhance and accommodate research needs for
Washington University by establishing a connection to the Very High Performance
Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the MCI POP in Downers Grove, IL. Projects
in this proposal include: neuroscience, electronic radiology, planetary
databases, computational projects in physics, genome sequence analysis, and
studio quality video for scientific collaboration. With this high performance
network capability the Washington University will expand current research and
collaboration with both academic institutions and federal laboratories. On this
project, collaborating institutions include: San Diego Supercomputer Center,
University of California at San Diego, University of California at Los Angeles,
Henry Ford Hospital, University of Michigan, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NCSA,
