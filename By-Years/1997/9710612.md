*** 9710612 Arlinghaus This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
is to develop, demonstrate, and characterize a high-resolution, resonant post-
ionization imaging sputter-initiated resonance ionization nanoprobe time-of-
flight instrument (SIRINP-TOF) which will make it possible to map
quantitatively, and with very high sensitivity, selectivity, efficiency, and
with submicron resolution, the spatial distribution of trace elements in
electronic and optoelectronic devices. By combining liquid metal ion gun (LMIG)
sputtering with efficient resonance post-ionization, Phase I demonstrated that
high resolution imaging is possible. It was also demonstrated that very high
depth resolution on small analysis areas can be obtained with SIRINP by using a
pulsed LMIG for data collection and a low-energy high-dose ion gun for eroding
the sample. Phase II will redesign the instrument to reduce vibration and
increase long-term stability to achieve 50 nm resolution, and demonstrate the
nanoprobe instrument's imaging and depth profiling capability on samples of
interest to the semiconductor industry. In Phase III, commercial high resolution
image analyses and instruments will be made available for the analytical
community. There is and emerging market for analytical instrumentation with
submicron spatial resolution and high sensitivity and selectivity, particularly
in the semiconductor and biomedical research area. This market extends into the
material sciences, environmental sciences, chemical, catalysis, and
pharmaceutical fields. ***
