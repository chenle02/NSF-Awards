This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site in physics and astronomy
at the University of Oklahoma. Eight undergraduate students and two high school
teachers per year will be involved in summer research projects in astrophysics,
atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, or high energy physics.
Teachers will participate in research and will also develop and build small-
scale experiments, demonstrations, and curriculum that can be transported or
replicated in the classroom. The goal of the site is to bridge the gap from
student (or teacher) to scientist through substantive, consequential research
mentored daily by a faculty member. The program will help to improve STEM
education, develop a better infrastructure for research and education, and
develop the STEM workforce that is needed for the
Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and teachers will be exposed to a broad
range of science, from particle physics to cosmology, and from abstract
theoretical to concrete applied physics. In addition, a key component of the
program consists of a semiweekly seminar series covering the differences between
physics research and physics classes, career options for physicists both in
academics and industry, insight into life in physics research, career
development, and insight on applying and preparing for graduate school. The
students themselves presenting their own work will give the final seminars.
Finally, the site will offer a series of voluntary courses and seminars that
expose the students to research tools. Teachers will participate in the seminar
series, in research, and in the development of classroom-ready experiments.This
award is supported by a combination of the Division of Physics, the Division of
Astronomical Sciences, and the Division of Materials Research within the
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
