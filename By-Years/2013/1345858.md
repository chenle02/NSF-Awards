This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a language learning game for
mobile devices that uses augmented reality technology. The game will teach
foreign language concepts (from languages like English and Spanish) in a unique,
fun way that radically departs from traditional classroom instruction. Inherent
Games' unique pedagogical method, called Embodied Categorical Scaffolding,
allows for engaging gameplay that utilizes actual physical motion to best
reflect the patterns of neurological activation that occur when one uses
language. For example, recent research shows that hearing (or reading) verbs of
manual motion like throw and toss activates the motor cortex responsible for
actually throwing or tossing a physical object. Because touchscreens on mobile
devices allow the user to physically touch and manipulate on-screen objects,
they provide an unprecedented avenue to harness the potential of this innate
cognitive strategy. Furthermore, the game will utilize augmented reality
technology so that the user can learn with the help of cues from their
surrounding environment. This application of technology ultimately provides an
enriched learning experience for the user (whether at home or in the classroom)
and represents a novel means for learning a foreign language.

The commercial impact of this venture is potentially enormous. The initial
prototype will be fully scalable to accommodate multiple languages, extensive
vocabulary domains within a given language (e.g., asking for directions, eating
at restaurants, seeing the doctor, etc.), and even more complex language
concepts such as tense and aspect. The game will also include a (massively)
multiplayer component, where users, classes, schools, or even school districts
can compete against one another for achievements and status points. Given
skyrocketing demand in the United States and abroad for foreign language
instruction, as well as the game's unique utilization of embodiment, this app
could be poised to make a huge impact on the language-learning market.
