This is a proposal to acquire a gas chromatograph-combustion- isotope ratio mass
spectrometry instrument. The apparatus inclues a capillary gas chromatograph
used to separate organic compounds, a combustion interface utilized to convert
carbon compounds into CO2, and a sensitive isotope ratio mass spectrometer
equipped with a triple collector, a mechanism to switch to a standard gas, and
the electronics for simultaneous recording of major CO2 ions. Projects to be
pursued include sedimenary biogeochemical processes that are driven by microbial
transformations of organic matter; organic matter deposition occurring near the
sediment-water interface; chemosynthetic pathways and the fossil record; and
sources and fates of amino acids.
