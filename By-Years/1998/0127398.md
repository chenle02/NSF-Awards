This project restructures two statistics courses, Introduction to Biostatistics
and Experimental Methods. The learning environment is transformed through
interactive labs, collaborative projects, and frequent formative assessments.
Students spend the majority of class time in computer studio labs gaining hands-
on experience with statistical analysis both individually and in teams. The
project team develops discipline specific materials and activities that take
full advantage of the current technologies to tailor courses to the students'
needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project include; 1)
increasing students' mastery of statistical strategies; 2) improving their
ability to transfer knowledge of statistical concepts to problems in different
disciplines; and 3) fostering the collaborative skills that their professional
lives will require.&lt;br/&gt;
