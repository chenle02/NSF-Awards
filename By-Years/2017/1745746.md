This award supports participation in the four-day "Objective Bayes 2017
Workshop" held at the University of Texas at Austin, TX on December 10-13, 2017.
The workshop will consist of one day of tutorials for graduate students and new
researchers, three days of scientific sessions, and a poster session, all
centering on major recent developments in statistical inference methods that can
be used automatically, that is, methodology that does not require subjective
input other than a stylized probabilistic description of how the data
arises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Objective Bayes workshop ("O'Bayes") is one of
the longest running and preeminent meetings in Bayesian statistics, addressing a
wide range of topics including robust, default Bayesian analysis,
reproducibility, variable selection, big data, and nonparametric Bayesian
methods. Objective Bayes methods encompass research in very diverse areas, from
biostatistics, to machine learning, asymptotics, spatial inference, and
computation. The workshop will serve to foster interaction of researchers in
these diverse areas with an aim of initiating novel ideas and research
directions. For more details about the conference please see the conference
