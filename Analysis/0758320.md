Professor Taylor proposes to investigate problems in partial differential
equations, with particular attention to two areas. The first area involves
analysis on rough geometries. This includes analysis on domains with rough
boundaries. Work with S. Hofmann and M. Mitrea has developed the theory of
singular integral operators on a class of uniformly rectifiable domains that the
authors call regular Semmes-Kenig-Toro domains, characterizing them as the class
for which certain important families of layer potentials are compact, and has
opened up what promises to be a very successful expansion of the theory of
elliptic systems to this class of roughly bounded domains. Another topic in this
area that Taylor will continue to investigate involves wave propagation on
manifolds with rough metric tensor, arising as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of a
class of smooth Riemannian manifolds with Ricci tensor bounded below. The second
area involves evolution equations. Taylor has worked with A. Mazzucato, M. Lopes
Filho, and H. Nussenzveig Filho and produced a detailed analysis of the
vanishing viscosity limit of 2D circularly symmetric Navier-Stokes flows, with
particular emphasis on the behavior of the boundary layer. Taylor and Mazzucato
have been investigating a class of 3D channel flows, and have a program that is
beginning to yield results on this technically more challenging problem. They
plan to push further the results they have on these flows, variants such as pipe
flows, and related singular perturbation problems. Taylor also proposes to
continue to investigate analogues of the Gibbs phenomenon and the Pinsky
phenomenon that arise in the short time behavior of solutions to nonlinear
dispersive equations with discontinuous initial data, expanding the scope from
nonlinear Schrodinger equations to other classes.

The analytical tools developed to tackle these problems have the potential to
impact both the understanding of fundamental mathematical issues and the
understanding of physical phenomena, such as wave phenomena and fluid flow
phenomena, which these mathematical theories address. Taylor?s work on boundary
problems has dealt with the problem of how to identify a region by how its
boundary vibrates, and is part of a vigorous effort to identify hidden
structures, be they behind a wall or underground. Many important fluids have
very small viscosity, and understanding the role of this small viscosity in
their behavior is an old and challenging problem, on which recent progress can
produce new insights. The proposed work also has applications to the
understanding of propagation of electromagnetic waves and elastic waves, which
are vibrational modes in solid materials. The project will also play a role in
training graduate students, including Taylor?s Ph.D. students.
