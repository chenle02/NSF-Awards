This project is facilitating the implementation of GIS and GPS technologies in
two-year colleges and high schools in Georgia. Curriculum modules are being
developed for high school students, and high school teachers are being provided
necessary field equipment, data, and software to implement the modules. The
modules are environmentally based and address current regional needs as
specified by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, including source
water protection and land use analysis. The modules are based on courses
developed through previous grant support to Gainesville College and Phi Theta
Kappa entitled "Improving Science and Technology Education at Community
Colleges."

Eight regional high schools are participating in the project. Teams of
faculty/staff members from each school are working closely with Gainesville
College faculty, staff, and students to develop custom GIS/GPS applications for
their region and to integrate the instructional modules into the science
classroom. The modules are being developed at Gainesville College and tested in
geology and integrated science courses during the first year. Each teacher team
is attending workshops and developing a plan for the integration of GIS/GPS into
their school curricula during the second year. During the third year, each team
is being required to implement their plans and disseminate their results to
other teachers and schools. All teams are strongly encouraged to present
outcomes at state and national conferences.
