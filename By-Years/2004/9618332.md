Cowan, John AST 96-18332 Dr. Cowan will continue research into the formation,
evolution, and age of the heavy elements, with particular emphasis on the
formation of the neutron capture s- and r-process elements. His research
utilizes a dynamic r-process code, which incorporates the most current nuclear
data, in combination with observational data for the most metal-poor stars of
the Galactic halo. His theoretical studies will define the environments, both
nuclear and astrophysical, in which these heavy elements were formed and provide
insight into the conditions that existed early in the history of the Galaxy and
into the nature of the progenitors of the halo stars. Closely related efforts to
investigate the r- and s-process production as a function of stellar metallicity
will offer constraints on early Galactic timescales for stellar formation. Dr.
Cowan will also continue studies of the use of long-lived radioactive
chronometers (especially Th and U) and the development of more realistic
chemical evolution models to provide more accurate estimates of the age of the
Galaxy, and constrain cosmological age estimates. ***
