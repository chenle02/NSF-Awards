CDA 9529529 Jacobson, Douglas W. Davis, James A. Iowa State University Computer
System Security Laboratory A research laboratory in computer system security is
supported by this grant. The projects targeted for the laboratory collectively
address the problems of denial of service and intrusion detection, two problems
of increasing importance as the nation becomes dependent on the computer
communication infrastructure. Research has identified several methods of attacks
that can render a network unusable. Hardware obtained from this grant will
facilitate the establishment of a laboratory with an isolated subnet, a network
logic analyzer, and several UNIX-based workstations and personal computers. In
this environment, the researchers have full control of all components so that
network traffic can be closely monitored, and denial of service experiments can
be safely and fully explored. The end goal of the collection of projects
outlined in the proposal is to develop an insight into potential countermeasures
for intrusion and denial of service attacks.
