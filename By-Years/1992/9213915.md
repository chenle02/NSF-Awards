This experiment is aimed at measuring the structure and evolution of coastal
and estuarine near-surface fronts by using a combination of novel instruments
like a moored acoustic imaging SONAR, fully lagrangian floats and an autonomous
underwater vehicle equipped with hydrographic sensors. The goal of the
exploratory research is to identify the mechanisms and scales responsible for
mixing in the upper ocean.
