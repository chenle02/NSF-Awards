This award supports a study of molluscan fossils across the Cretaceous-Tertiary
boundary on Seymour Island in the Antarctica Peninsula. Seymour Island contains
rich and well preserved faunal and floral assemblages in a thick stratigraphic
section that encompasses the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, a time of well
documented extinction in other parts of the world. Previous work has yielded a
rich molluscan fauna but additional work is needed to understand and correlate
the biostratigraphy and sedimentology immediately above and below the
Cretaceous-Tertiary transition. This work will attempt to recover fossils and
examine the sedimentology on a centimeter sampling scale from 5 meters below to
5 meters above the boundary. These fossils, in conjunction with sedimentologic
analysis of the measured section, will allow a determination of the continuity
of the boundary section and will also allow an attempt at high resolution
analysis of the molluscan faunal changes. This study will lead to an improved
understanding of molluscan changes at the Cretaceous-Tertiary transition in high
southern latitudes and the relation of these changes to Cretaceous- Tertiary
extinction elsewhere.
