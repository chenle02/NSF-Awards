9724000 McCarty This proposal continues our investigation of the molecular
mechanisms that underlie VP1 mediated gene activation and repression. The VP1
factor of maize plays a central role in integration of the maturation and
germination pathways in the developing seed. The VP1/AB13 family of regulatory
proteins is unique to the plant kingdom. Recent studies indicate that related
proteins function in other phases of plant development. Dr. McCarty has shown
that VP1 functions as an activator or repressor depending upon the target
promoter and he has recently been able to demonstrate a cooperative sequence
specific DNA binding activity. He will address three key issues: 1) The unique
properties and regulation of the B3 DNA binding domain of VP1. 2) The mechanism
by which promoter context is interpreted to determine whether VP1 activates or
represses transcription. 3) The identification of partner proteins that provide
the context information and mediate repression.
