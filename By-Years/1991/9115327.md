An experimental investigation is to be carried out of the removal of
contaminants from a surface by a flowing liquid. State-of-the-art chemical
detection diagnostics will be used to determine the removal of contaminants from
the wall of a tube by flow in the tube. Parameters to be varied in a controlled
manner are contaminants, flow conditions, and fluid properties. The research
will provide needed information on decontamination parameters, and impact
current practices in the waste disposal and waste treatment area.
