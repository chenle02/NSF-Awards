This is a three-year project to adapt an integrated curriculum model, developed
by the NSF-funded "Mecomtronics" program at the New Jersey Center for Advanced
Technological Education (NJCATE), to develop an engineering technician
curriculum. The four components of the project are Curriculum Development,
Faculty Development, Student Outreach and Development, and Dissemination. The
faculty development team at the College of Dupage has received mentoring in
mecomtronics from the NJCATE. A Virtual Education Network is expected to
facilitate rapid modification of modules and projects according to changing
industry needs. Outreach includes workshops for 70 high school teachers,
seminars for 60 college/university educators, and a high school summer camp for
20 students.&lt;br/&gt;
