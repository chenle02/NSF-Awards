This project will investigate domain decomposition algorithms for solving time-
dependent partial differential equations on parallel processing computers. The
domain decomposition methods to be examined are explicit/implicit Galerkin and
mixed finite element, and finite difference procedures. In these approaches, the
computational domain is divided into nonoverlapping subdomains, and boundary
data at subdomain interfaces are calculated explicitly from the solution at the
previous time step. A priori error estimates for these schemes have been derived
for model problems. Furthermore, preliminary numerical results indicate that the
approaches are viable, and that a speed-up factor equal to the number of
subdomains can be achieved. The principal investigator will investigate the
extension of these algorithms to more general linear and nonlinear problems in
multiple space dimensions, and their implementation on parallel processing
machines. Of particular interest will be the application of these procedures to
flow in porous media problems, such as enhanced oil recovery and subsurface
contaminant transport. In these problems, the physical and chemical processes to
be modeled generally occur over long time periods, and accurate simulation
requires fine-scale temporal and spatial resolution. Current supercomputers have
been extremely useful in increasing the amount of resolution obtainable.
However, it is possible that with the emerging parallel computers, we may be
able to increase resolution by at least another order of magnitude. To achieve
this goal will require modifications to current algorithms and the development
of new algorithms. In the methods proposed here, domain decomposition is used to
effectively divide large problems into smaller subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. By employing this type of approach, fine-scale, multidimensional
simulations that are currently too memory -intensive or time-consuming for
conventional machines may become tractable.
