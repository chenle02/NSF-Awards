9505108 Minc Research under this project will involve the following areas: 1)
embedding of a chainable continuum in the plane with a given point accessible,
2) inverse limits of the same map of 0,1 , 3) fixed-point problems for weakly
chainable tree-like continua, 4) computer-generated images of inverse limits of
arcs, 5) algorithms to determine whether a simplicial map between graphs can be
factored through an arc. Some applications to dynamical systems are envisioned.
