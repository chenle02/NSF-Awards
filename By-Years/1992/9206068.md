Streptomyces are well-known for their capacity to synthesize a vast repertoire
of secondary metabolites (antibiotics). Besides their commercial importance, the
Streptomyces are interesting for their complex developmental cycle. In the
course of this life cycle, antibiotic synthesis is developmentally regulated.
The objective of this research is to define aspects of the global genetic
regulation of Streptomcymes coelicolor antibiotic synthesis. The research
planned is based on a set of genes, recently discovered in this laboratory,
which regulate the expression of antibiotic genes. The goals include genetic and
molecular characterization of the absA, absB and mia genes; study of the
regulation of absA, absB and mia using reporter gene fusions, and investigation
of the mechanism by which these genes globally regulate antibiotic synthesis.
%%% This molecular genetic analysis of the abs and mia genes promises to
contribute not only to our understanding of microbial developmental gene
regulation, but also to biotechnology. Understanding of S. coelicolor regulation
is highly likely to explain much of antibiotic regulation in other
Streptomycetes and Actinomycetes, and this increase the potential for rational
manipulation of production of commercially important metabolites including the
many new metabolites that are continuously being discovered.
