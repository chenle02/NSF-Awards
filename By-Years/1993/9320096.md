Foraging behavior is a critical aspect of animal survival. Its interactions with
the environment are complex and multi-dimensional. Computer simulation holds the
promise of helping laboratory biologists and field ecologists gain insights into
behavioral mechanisms as well as theoretical models of foraging. The use of
simulation in research on foraging behavior is in its infancy; there is great
potential for its use in representation and interpretation of actual and
simulated experiments. Phase I research resulted in a proof-of-concept foraging-
behavior simulation model for personal computers. The goal of Phase II is to
investigate simulation techniques for a range of behaviors, models, and theories
that represent the scope of research on foraging behavior. The approach is to
evaluate simulation techniques for such foraging concepts as learning,
motivation, utility, herbivory, predation, risk-preference/aversion, and
fitness. The work will include development of a user-friendly interface that
includes on-line help for setting up biologically valid simulations. This
project will require original research on the question of how to reconcile
diverse approaches to foraging behavior.
