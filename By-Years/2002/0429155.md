This international field school will bring U.S. and Russian students together at
fixed sites in Alaska (Katmai) and Kamchatka (Gorely-Mutnovsky) to study
volcanology. The principal investigators are Dr. John Eichelberger from the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks and Elena Vesna from Kamchatka State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volcanoes are among the most exciting and
inspiring phenomena on the planet Earth. Understanding volcanoes has become
increasingly important as growing population and technical complexity of society
make us more vulnerable to natural catastrophe and as we realize the role of
volcanism in global climate change. Although volcanology is a small discipline
in the context of science, active volcanism provides unparalleled "teaching
moments" for elucidating fundamental physical and chemical process.
&lt;br/&gt;Scientifically, and as natural classrooms, the proposed venues for
the field school are of exceptional quality, each providing access to sites and
exposures that illustrate a wide gamut of volcanological
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in earth sciences research will
train students in volcanology and will enhance the development of ties between
the next generation of volcanologists. This project also fulfills the program
objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern
Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
