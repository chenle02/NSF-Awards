In this novel application, the plane of scintillation will be oriented parallel
to the axis of the incident radiation beam thus yielding high detection quantum
efficiency. This concept, if successful, will reduce the physical size, cost and
complexity associated with current tomographic system and will promote the
utilization of an ultra high resolution, dual energy, variable focus tomography
in nondestructive testing.
