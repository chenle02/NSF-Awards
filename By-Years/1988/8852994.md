This project upgrades an already existing laboratory for earthquake study. The
laboratory improvement includes the addition of a controller that adds the
capability of simulating a real earthquake on a shaking table. The improvement
of the earthquake lab permits students to study structures and their behavior
under real earthquake conditions. The major piece of equipment supported by this
award is an MTS Systems 469.11 three variable controller. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
