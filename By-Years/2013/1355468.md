This proposal seeks to conduct a geophysical survey of the Hawaiian arch to
characterize crust and mantle-mantle boundary (Moho) structure for one of three
(and, by most accounts, the leading) candidate sites for the international Moho
drilling project. This project is a collaboration with JAMSTEC, the Japanese
cience funding agency. Almost all funding for this project is coming from
JAMSTEC. The PI?s are seeking ship time and funding for an expedition to recover
ocean bottom seismometers deployed at the beginning of the project. Of special
interest is whether or not there is evidence for magmas related to the nearby
Hawaiian Islands hot spot having been injected into the region of interest. If
so, this will be an unsuitable site for drilling. Of more general scientific
interest will be the reference section established for mature fast-spread ocean
crust and characterization of crustal warping related to loading by the Hawaiian
Volcanos. The seismic data will be immediately provided the data to the Academic
Seismic Portal and, hence, to any investigator who wishes to further interpret
or process the data. Graduate students are involved in both shipboard work and
data analysis. This is a US contribution (at very moidest cost) to a large,
highly visible international project.
