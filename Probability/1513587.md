The investigator will study random matrices, a field originating with Eugene
Wigner's idea that random matrices model spectral behavior of physical systems.
Over the years random matrices have found applications beyond pure mathematics,
and are being used in statistics, computer science, telecommunications, and more
generally information networks. This research project's focus is universality --
the phenomenon that the limiting spectral statistics depend only on the symmetry
type and not on other details of the underlying system. Random matrix statistics
now find use in many aspects of integrable systems, growth models, and number
theory. Deep progress has been achieved in the past years, and universality has
been established for a growing class of random matrices. This project will
advance understanding in this fundamental area.

This project explores the following research topics: (1) Universality and
quantum unique ergodicity for random band matrices. The motivation is to try to
approach the Anderson transition via these toy models for random Schrodinger
operators on a lattice. (2) Perturbative analysis of eigenvectors in a non-
perturbative regime, via the eigenvector moment flow, a new random walk
introduced recently. (3) Log-correlated fields and random spectra. This includes
individual fluctuations of eigenvalues of Wigner matrices and beta ensembles.
(4) Extremal statistics of random matrices, through the largest and smallest
gaps, and extremes of characteristic polynomials. (5) A study of non-Hermitian
random matrix theory, with connections between 2D Coulomb gases and the Gaussian
free field. In order to understand Wigner's vision, in their recent proofs of
fixed energy universality and eigenvector universality the investigator and
collaborators developed new tools of interest for the above projects. These
include random walks in dynamic random environments, coupling methods, and
homogenization theory for partial differential equations with time-dependent
random coefficients.
