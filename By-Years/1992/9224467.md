With the support of this award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program, Dr. Russell P. Hughes of the Chemistry Department,
Dartmouth College, would continue investigations on the cleavage and formation
of carbon-carbon bonds promoted by transition metals. Three projects would be
pursued: ring-opening in vinylcyclopropene rearrangements; characterization of
eta-3-cyclopropenyl complexes, including their CO substitution reactions and
rotation barriers; and bond cleavage of sterically destabilized cyclopentadienyl
ligands. The latter reactions do not proceed by simple metal insertion into the
carbon-carbon bond. In order to study the skeletal rearrangments that occur
during the ring opening reactions of the cyclopentadienyl ligands, selectively
isotopically labelled precursors will be prepared. A 1,2,3,-tri-t-
butylcyclopenta- dienyl ligand has been prepared; advantage will be made of the
incipient strain associated with the compound in order to make novel compounds.
%%% By investigating in detail the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond making and
breaking by transition metals, Dr. Russell P. Hughes of Dartmouth College hopes
to achieve increased understanding of this reaction which is important to the
petroleum catalyst industry. The results could be particularly relevant to the
formation and control of carbon ring compounds.
