This workshop will be held in Lyon, France, and will bring together
international experts from the US and France to discuss advancements in
cyberinfrastructure (CI). The specific focus will be on commonalities that exist
between cluster, cloud, and data analytics computing. CI has become of growing
importance to nearly all NSF research, which makes increasing use of
computational simulation and large-data analysis methods. The results will be
published in an open report as well as in several journal papers. They will
contribute to and leverage new ideas in cluster, cloud, and data analytics
computing for the benefit of the research community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
architectural similarities between the above issues, and the fact that high
performance clusters typically make up the major compute nodes of computational
grids and clouds, means that deployment, operational, and usage issues
surrounding computational clouds form a superset of the issues that revolve
around clusters. The workshop will discuss topics such as extreme scale
performance and related software development issues, common protocols and APIs
necessary to facilitate seamless movement, recombination and analysis of large
data flows, creating dramatically easier programming paradigms for highly
parallel systems, creating tools that can support application development in
highly virtualized environments, and system management problems that arise in
multicore-heterogeneous architectures and data intensive applications.
