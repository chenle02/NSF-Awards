Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is an east-west line of convection, which
circles the globe in the equatorial regions. Building on data gathered and
research initiated during the EPIC2001 (East Pacific Investigation of Climate -
2001) field experiment, several initiatives will be undertaken in this study. It
addresses the question whether convection in the East Pacific is controlled by
surface fluxes or Ekman convergence; satellite data will be compared to in-situ
data from the field experiment with a view to creating a climatological
description of the characteristics of the ITCZ. Cumulus cloud ensemble modeling
and idealized models will be used to determine the characteristics and
variability of the distribution of convection in the East Pacific and if
adjustments are required to the parameterization of convection. As a community
service as well as for providing observational data for the study, data gathered
during EPIC2001 will be processed and archived.
