This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the use of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy to
characterize adsorbed intermediates on solid surfaces. Professor Trenary and his
coworkers at the University of Illinois-Chicago will examine adsorbed species
containing CN multiple bonds, which result from the reactions of methane and
ammonia and related compounds on well characterized platinum surfaces. High
quality experimental data, combined with density functional theory calculations,
will be used to make structural assignments for these adsorbed intermediates.
Instrumentation and method development also forms a significant portion of the
work being carried out in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reflection-
absorption infrared spectroscopy is a very powerful tool for the identification
of adsorbed intermediates in surface reaction chemistry. Professor Trenary and
his group at the University of Illinois-Chicago, with the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, have developed an active laboratory
for the development and use of this method to investigate surface reactions.
Work in this project will concentrate on surface intermediates formed from the
reactions of methane and ammonia adsorbed on platinum surfaces, with clear
application to the understanding of HCN synthesis reactions. &lt;br/&gt;
