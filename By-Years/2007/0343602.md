0343602&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is provided for travel to The
Sixth World Congress on Computational Mechanics, to be held in Beijing, China,
during September 2-6, 2004. The support will be for about 15 graduate students,
who will participate in a Symposium on Virtual Tribology at the Congress, and
for about five faculty organizers of that symposium. The students will be
selected from the PI's own institutions and from other institutions with active
programs in tribology. Visits to the State Key Laboratory of Tribology at
Tsinghua University will be included in the
trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
