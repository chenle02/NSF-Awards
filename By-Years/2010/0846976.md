Situational awareness is increasingly reliant on unmanned vehicle teams to
provide information by constant wide area surveillance. Issues of how to best
coordinate the actions of many autonomous agents, individually or in teams, in
order to accomplish the search goal of complete and timely coverage are
essential for the robust information. Unfortunately, the application of robot
teams in coverage tasks has many unaddressed facets of complexity. Specifically,
the propagation constraints of networks limit the ability for robot teams to
facilitate cooperation using digital networks. In this project, we investigate
the cooperation problem with a focus on modeling and experimentation in the
presence of real world network constraints. This research project aims to use
bio-inspired cooperation paradigms to: 1) improve large-scale search and
surveillance by actively predicting and managing network constraints based on
role assignment, proximity-based sub-team formation, and communication through
observation, 2) study of message age and impact upon performance, and 3) study
of proximity to message importance. It is expected that results will be in line
with previous work that shows that less communication can result in better
cooperation in certain areas and team sizes.
