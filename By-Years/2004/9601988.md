This award covers a program which focuses on the study of light propagation in
disordered materials with three distinct experimental components. (1) A low-
coherence optical heterodyning technique will be used to image absorbing
structure imbedded in a high-scattering medium. (2) A low-coherence photon
correlation spectroscopic technique will be developed which should allow the
detection of very low order scattering while suppressing the multiply scattered
components. (3) A pulse-time-of-flight experiment will be implemented in order
to determine the transport and absorption mean-free-path lengths needed for
analysis of all the experiments. The results of this work, in addition to
contributing to the elucidation of the role of scattering in imaging of dense
media, have potential application in the fields of optical mammography and
tomography.
