Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project
include (1) developing a sophisticated and realistic educational infrastructure
which provides interesting and realistic cyber-crime scenes for undergraduate
and graduate network forensics curricula, and (2) developing systematic
laboratory projects with innovative educational toolkits such as wireless
positioning robots for collecting evidence in a 3-dimensional space.
Comprehensive formative and summative evaluations are used to ensure the success
of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses realistic network
platforms and provides a wide coverage of cyber-crime scenes such as distributed
anonymous communication systems and wireless networks. It utilizes PlanetLab, a
global research network that provides overlay services and supports the
development of new network services. The proposer designed a set of toolkits for
teaching network forensics in this environment, including DeAnonymizer toolkit
which traces suspects by watermarking the suspect network traffic through
professional anonymous communication networks such as Anonymizer and Tor.
Another toolkit, 3DLoc, searches the suspect mobile device in a 3-dimensional
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed network forensics projects and
supporting materials create a repository at the National Science Digital Library
(NSDL). The PI provides detailed documents and free consulting for schools of
different sizes and disseminates the outcomes of this project via various venues
such as computer education and research journals, international and national
conferences, and a web portal. The industry and law enforcement partners
standardize the hardware and aid in the technical transfer process.
