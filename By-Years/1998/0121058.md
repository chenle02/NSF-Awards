The proposal focuses on the development and validation of an innovative
methodology for Multi-criteria Design Optimization (MDO) in engineering which
integrates concurrent experiment and simulation. This methodology, denoted Data
Driven Design Optimization Methodology (DDDOM), represents a major change from
current engineering design practice which uses experiment and simulation in a
sequential manner. The methodology will leverage the inherent advantages of
experiment and simulation in a Dynamic Data Driven Application System. The
methodology will be validated for the optimal design of three cases: a flush
mounted inlet for a generic ogive-cylinder body, a cooling system for electronic
components, and a lumbar vertebral spinal structure. The experiments and
simulations will be performed at Rutgers University. The proposal includes an
integrated educational program involving students at the high school,
undergraduate and graduate levels with specific emphasis on women and
minorities. The research program will draw students from five existing programs
of the Rutgers School of Engineering Office of Special Programs. Four research
teams will be formed with participants drawn from each of these programs. These
teams will provide a unique opportunity for research experience and leadership
development. Endorsing organizations include Boeing, IBM, and the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;
