Hardin DMS-9500905 Work supported by this award focuses on the mathematical
development of wavelet analysis and its applications. This is a branch of
harmonic analysis closely allied with applications to many areas of science. The
underlying goals of wavelet analysis are (i) to determine functions whose
integer translates and dyadic dilates form orthogonal (or biorthogonal) bases
for square-integrable functions (ii) to ensure that the basis elements localize
both time and frequency and (iii) that they have the requisite smoothness
dictated by the problem. Normally, wavelets are also expected to have compact
support. This project will focus on construction of compactly supported and
orthogonal wavelets in two and higher dimensions, new filter-bank constructions,
and application to image processing and numerical methods for differential
equations. The theory of wavelets, as it has become known, is actually a body of
ideas which has developed dramatically over the past decade, following several
important discoveries by physicists, computer scientists and engineers concerned
with signal processing and data compression. It evolved into a synthesis of many
existing techniques into a framework which offers possibilities for improved
applications and challenging mathematical ideas which will require years to
reach what might be considered a mature stage. Many areas of science are now
adapting wavelet constructs to important problems currently under investigation.
These included statisticians looking for patterns in large data sets,
compression of fingerprint data, edge reconstruction of images and the
generation of fractal sets with prescribed characteristics.
