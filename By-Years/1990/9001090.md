Professor Fialkow will study several questions in multivariable operator theory
concerning the structure of bounded linear operators in Hilbert space and the
structure of certain associated C* algebras. One aspect of the research concerns
the solution of systems of linear equations in C* algebras. Another facet
involves polynomially bounded hyponormal weighted shifts. A final topic is the
study of structural and spectral invariants for quasisimilarity of operators.
The latter research is particularly concerned with characterizing those
operators quasisimilar to the unilateral shift and determining their spectral
properties. Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex
numbers. These operators have applications in every area of applied science as
well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify
certain important categories of such objects.
