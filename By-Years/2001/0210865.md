0210865 Santschi The aim of this proposal is to investigate the structural
dynamics of aggregates of nano-scale colloidal particles and the role of the
nano-scale fibrillar biopolymers in inorganic colloid aggregation. The proposal
addresses the role that these structures play in the transport of trace metals
and pollutants in natural environmental and engineered systems.&lt;br/&gt;The
combination of experimental studies encompassing microscopic methods (AFM and
EM), synchrotron-based methods (SAXS, XAS), and multi-scale modeling will aid in
elucidating the significance of particulate material in aquatic
systems.&lt;br/&gt;This project is collaborative and multi-disciplinary,
combining expertise from chemistry, biology, and modeling to investigate the
role of fibrils and macromolecules in inorganic colloid aggregation. Results of
this work should help in the understanding the self-cleansing capacity of fresh,
estuarine and marine waters through transport and sedimentation. Of special
interest is the understanding of the similarities and differences between
freshwater and seawater.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to the
Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative, NSF 01-157, category
NIRT.&lt;br/&gt;
