This award supports research in gravitational wave detector and data analysis,
and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea.
The discovery of gravitational waves from multiple black hole mergers and the
spectacular joint observation of electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals
from a neutron star merger have firmly established gravitational wave astronomy
as an important new field. The goal of this project is to improve on our
capability to detect and characterize gravitational signals of all kinds,
including those from unexpected and hitherto un-modeled sources. This will be
done by improving the signal-agnostic waveform reconstruction techniques
developed under predecessor awards, and by developing new techniques to model
and mitigate the effects of non-stationary and non-Gaussian instrument
noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational wave astronomy is producing
revolutionary discoveries that are yielding unique insights into some of the
Universe's most exotic phenomena. These discoveries have generated tremendous
interest from the public, astronomers and physicists in other fields, and with
students of all ages. The research projects supported by this award offer
tremendous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students; the blend of
creative activities associated with the development of sophisticated and
innovative data analysis techniques, combined with hands on exposure in applying
these techniques to complex data sets, will provide excellent training for the
next generation of scientists. These skills are transferable and highly sought
after in other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
