The objective of this project is to build a general purpose database of
commonsense facts about actions expressed in the language of the Causal
Calculator (CCalc). CCalc is a system for automated reasoning about actions and
for plan generation. Its language has been used to formalize many small action
domains, such as the blocks world and the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle, and
also several medium-size domains, such as Sandewall's Zoo World. Building a
general purpose database of knowledge about actions will be a step towards
solving the problem of generality in knowledge
representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on past efforts, this project will
isolate the concepts and principles that these and similar individual domains
have in common, and build a database of such principles stated in a general
form. The creation of such a data base will make it possible to obtain
formalizations of many individual action domains, including those studied in the
past, by adding domain-specific facts. The database will include general
assumptions about the effects, both direct and indirect, of actions of various
kinds, about the executability of actions, and about agents that execute them.
Some of these facts have to do with objects and change in their locations and
internal states. For instance, one useful assumption is that normally an agent
can execute an action affecting the location or state of an object only if the
agent is located next to the object. Another is that an object is typically
supported by something--by horizontal surfaces of some kind, or by other objects
supported by such a surface--and that moving the object indirectly affects the
locations of the things that are supported by that object. The database will
also contain commonsense facts about creating and destroying objects, about
animals and humans, about buying and selling, about actions related to knowledge
and memory, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
