Professor Lindblom will continue his theoretical research on gravitation and
astrophysics. He will emphasize astrophysical situations in which strong
gravitational fields play a significant role. These problems can be divided into
four major areas: a) the pulsations and stability of relativistic stars, b)
superfluid hydrodynamics in neutron stars, c) dissipative relativistic
hydrodynamic theories, and d) fundamental mathematical problems in relativistic
stellar structure. Specific research problems in each of these areas will be
carried out, for example: a) A new approximation method to evaluate the modes of
rapidly rotating fully relativistic stellar models will be developed. This
approximation is based on the fact that gravitational radiation couples only
weakly to the modes of primary physical interest in neutron stars. b) The
program to evaluate the effects of superfluid hydrodynamics on the gravitational
radiation instability of rotating neutron stars will be continued. The next step
is to finish debugging the computer codes that evaluate the modes of rapidly
rotating superfluid neutron stars. c) The relationship between the dissipative
relativistic fluid theories of divergence type and the Lagrangian based
dissipative relativistic fluid theories will be investigated. It is hoped that
the set of theories which belong to both classes can be identified and that
these will contain a strong candidate to be THE theory of dissipative
relativistic fluids. d) Further investigations into the possibility of
determining the nuclear equation of state by measuring the masses and radii of
neutron stars will be carried out.
