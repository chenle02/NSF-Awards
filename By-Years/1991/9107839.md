This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program to the Department
of Chemistry at Rutgers University will help them acquire a gas chromatograph
and mass spectrometer system (GC/MS) system. The acquisition will enhance the
ability of the Department to educate students and will enhance chemical research
in the following areas: Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Research in Carbene
Chemistry, Transition Metal-Catalyzed Functionalization of C-H Bonds and
Structures, and Reactivities of Organic Radical Cations. The Gas Chromatograph
and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system separates mixtures of volatile compounds
and identifies the masses of each separated component. The GC/MS is essential
when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds found in dilute solutions.
The GC/MS is useful in areas such as chemical synthesis, kinetics and structural
analysis.
