9707567 Fu The pattern of segregating nucleotides in a sample of DNA sequences
from multiple individuals of a population contains rich information about the
history of that population, and can therefore be used to make inferences on
various aspects of the population history. The goal of the project is to develop
methods for estimating the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a
population. The methods will be developed based on coalescent theory and
computer simulation, and will make full use of the pattern of segregating sites
in a sample. Several population genetics models will be considered, including
the neutral Wright-Fisher model and population growth. Various degrees of
uncertainty in the values of population parameters that are required for
estimating the age of the MRCA will be incorporated into the methods. The
methods developed will be applied to available data, particularly those from
humans. The computer programs resulted from this project will be available to
researchers through the World Wide Web. The age of the MRCA of a population is
an useful quantity for studying the evolution of that population. For the origin
of modern humans, the age of the MRCA is crucial for distinguishing the two
major hypotheses, the "out of Africa" hypothesis, which postulates an African
population rapidly and completely replaced the populations in all other regions
of the world, and the "multiregional" hypothesis", which postulates a gradual
and simultaneous transformation of archaic regional human populations into
modern populations. Since the methods developed in this project make use of the
pattern of segregating sites, which is highly informative, and do not require
haplotype information, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, they will
be particularly useful for samples from a nuclear genome. The project will
contribute to the theory and methods for the inference on the age of the MRCA of
a population, and will facilitate the study of human evolution in particular.
