The research will involve the generation and solution reactivity of nitroxyl
(HNO), which has recently received significant attention, especially as a
potential alternative to current treatments of cardiac failure. Due to its
inherent reactivity, HNO must be generated in situ, but only a very limited
number of appropriate precursors currently exist. Adding to the difficulty of
studying HNO chemistry is that a viable method for its direct detection in
solution or biologically relevant preparations is not currently
available.&lt;br/&gt;To address current deficiencies in the understanding of HNO
chemistry and biochemistry, in available HNO donor molecules, and in practically
useful direct HNO detection techniques, the proposed research will develop (1)
new physiologically useful thermal precursors to HNO, (2) new photochemical
precursors to HNO suitable for nanosecond time-resolved infrared (TRIR)
investigations, and (3) new analytical tools for its detection and study in
aqueous solutions. The development of new HNO donors, combined with reactivity
studies and the evaluation of HNO-induced protein modifications, will not only
provide fundamental insight into the biological activity of HNO, but may also
ultimately lead to the development of a new class of compounds for the treatment
of heart failure. In addition, proposed research on the development of new
thermal and photochemical precursors to HNO, new analytical tools for its
detection, and elucidation of HNO-induced modifications of PLN will afford broad
training for graduate students and undergraduates. Undergraduate participation
in research will continue to be actively encouraged.
