9632299 Tayebati This Phase I STTR project will produce efficient Strontium
Barium Niobate (SBN) thin films based devices and components. Currently
available nonlinear materials such as LiNbO3 (lithium niobate), BaTiO3 (barium
titanate) and PLZT (lead (lanthanum) titanate-zirconate) do not have the
necessary physical constants to make efficient devices in terms of power
consumption and driving voltages required for operations. SBN provides a
material with extremely large electro-optic coefficient (1380pm/V for SBN:75
compared to 30 pm/V for LiNbO3) that can greatly improve the performance of
existing nonlinear optical devices and components. Growth of highly electro-
optic nonlinear materials can provide the key for enabling the production of
efficient optical components such as tunable filters and modulators for optical
communications. In addition, these devices can be used as a building block for
systems including optical sensors, and interferometers.
