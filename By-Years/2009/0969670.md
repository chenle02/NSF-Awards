The CTEQ Collaboration is an informal group of 32 experimental and theoretical
high energy physicists from eighteen universities and five national labs,
engaged in a program to advance research in and understanding of quantum
chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) governs the strong interactions of
elementary particles, and its study at high energies is increasingly shared by
both elementary particle and nuclear physics. One of the activities organized by
the CTEQ collaboration is a series of CTEQ Summer Schools whose aim is to
promote knowledge of QCD and its applications to precision electroweak physics
and new physics searches among the younger generation of high energy and nuclear
physicists, especially experimentalists. This proposal requests partial support
for the 2010 and 2011 CTEQ Summer Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of
the CTEQ Summer School on the high energy physics community worldwide is by now
well recognized by the major laboratories. On the order of one thousand
physicists have attended CTEQ schools. Some of the early students have gone on
to be lecturers at more recent schools. The broader impact of these Schools is
felt through the students' strengthened awareness of the context of their
research in the overall undertaking of fundamental physics. The interactive
nature of the schools also encourages the skills necessary for communicating the
excitement and results of fundamental physics within collaborations and to the
wider public.
