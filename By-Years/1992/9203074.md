This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This Phase II project addresses the need in networked
environments to provide quick and efficient application-to-application data
transfers between workstations without the overhead of software network
protocols. The solution advanced by the principal investigator is to move key
software functions from the operating system device driver into hardware and
firmware, and by using a packet switch to interconnect the workstations. The
Phase I effort developed a preliminary designfor this network, called the FOX
Network. Phase II involves constructing a prototype FOX Network, testing to
determine network performance, and developing an application for visual
demnostration of the benefits of the network. Potential application areas
include simulation problems, visualization-intensive applications, and large
shared databases.
