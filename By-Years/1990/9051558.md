Several new instruments for modern microscopy are being integrated into a number
of courses. Two high-quality compound microscopes equipped for phase contrast,
differential interference contrast, fluorescence, and photomicroscopy, a
microtome capable of cutting thick and semi-thin sections in paraffin and
plastic, and a glass knifebreaker for use with the microtome are being
purchased. These are essential tools for the practise of modern biological
microscopy, and are being integrated into a variety of courses throughout the
curriculum, including the introductory biology sequence, eight upper division
courses, and the student research program. The college will contribute an amount
equal to the award.
