This project supports 8-12 graduate students for their travel to attend the 2015
IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS). The CNS workshop
is a relatively young conference started by the IEEE Communications Society in
2013, focused on the lower levels of the networking stack (i.e., at the physical
layer), as compared to the higher levels addressed by conferences such as the
Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), ACM Conference on
Computer and Communications Security (CCS), etc. By supporting attendance for
these graduate students, this award helps grow a next generation of researchers
with expertise in secure communications. Participation of women and
underrepresented minorities will be encouraged.
