This award will support student travel to the seventh Midwest Programming
Languages Summit, to be held at University of Wisconsin-Madison in September
2018. This research workshop will serve as a valuable forum for researchers and
students to share in-progress research ideas and receive timely feedback to
influence subsequent work. This will be particularly valuable because of the
high concentration of programming languages researchers in the Midwest, and
because it will provide graduate student researchers opportunities to network
and further develop their research and presentation skills.

The funds from this award will help support U.S. based students, focusing on
graduate students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would
otherwise not be able to attend this workshop. The impacts include training the
next generation of researchers in this important research area. Higher priority
will be assigned to students giving presentations and a strong emphasis will be
put on supporting students from underrepresented groups.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
