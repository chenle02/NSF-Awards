Florida A&amp;M University in collaboration with Albany State College, Bethune-
Cookman College, Clark-Atlanta University, Florida State University, Florida
International University, the University of Florida, the University of South
Florida, the University of Central Florida and three affiliated community
colleges (Daytona Beach, Miami-Dade and Tallahassee) has formulated a program
designed to influence more minorities to select careers in science, engineering
and mathematics. The Alliance will emphasize a focused effort to increase
directly the recruitment, retention, graduation and graduate school placement of
Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans who are enrolled in the undergraduate
SEM degree programs at Albany State and Bethune-Cookman Colleges, Florida
A&amp;M and Florida International Universities. Indirectly, enhancement elements
of the project will influence the persistence of minorities at the other
alliance member institutions (Florida State University, University of Central
Florida, University of South Florida, University of Florida, and Clark-Atlanta
University). The success of this project will be shared with other state and
regional institutions. This project, by applying a holistic approach to
students' preparation, will emphasize multiple components that will positively
impact their qualifications for graduate school admission. The Alliance's
influence will span from the pre-freshman level to the enrollment of scholars in
SEM graduate programs. Participants will be selected from biology, chemistry,
mathematics, physics and all engineering disciplines.
