The goal of the GLOBEC Northeast Pacific program is to gain an understanding of
how variability in the physical environment, specifically changes that might
result from climate change, affects populations of marine animals on the west
coast of North America, specifically salmon and associated species. The PIs will
formulate models spanning the individual level to the metapopulation level for
two genera of interest to GLOBEC in the California Current System (CCS): (1) the
two CCS salmon species identified by GLOBEC, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch)
and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and (2) Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), a
species which covaries with salmon, is a significant prey of both species, and
is subject to similar mesoscale circulation patterns. These models will link the
different scales of variability and levels of ecological organization in the
various retrospective, monitoring and process studies so that the effects of
changes in the physical environment on populations can be projected.
