AST 0205990&lt;br/&gt;Reynolds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black holes are responsible
for some of the most dramatic phenomena seen in the current universe.
Furthermore, the environment immediately around a black hole is a naturally
occurring laboratory in which many exotic physical processes will occur and can
be studied. Some of the most interesting phenomena are associated with the
"twisting" and "dragging" of space and time due to the rotation of the black
hole. This project will conduct a theoretical exploration of the effect that a
spinning black hole will have on its astrophysical surroundings. This is an
extremely timely study since modern X-ray telescopes are already starting to
observe such effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theory suggests that magnetic fields
will be crucial for the phenomena associated with black hole spin. Guided by
past work, Dr. Reynolds and his collaborators will split the investigation into
three parts. 1) Conducting computer simulations of the gaseous flows (including
the magnetic fields) in the vicinity of a black hole. 2) Employing simplifying
assumptions and approximations to study the complex behavior of magnetic loops
in the region very close to the black hole. 3) Computing predictions that can be
directly tested by current and future observations with the XMM-Newton X-ray
observatory.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
