This project is awarding up to 86 one-semester scholarships to academically
talented but financially needy students who are working towards baccalaureate
degrees in engineering and applied science. The program is targeting first-time,
first-year students, and the scholarships are supporting students through their
undergraduate programs. The success and eventual graduation of the scholars is
being supported not only through scholarships, but also with monthly scholar
meetings. These meetings include discussions of available university resources,
field trips to local industries, seminars with speakers from industry, and
workshops on career planning and development. Each scholarship recipient is
participating in one of three professional development programs: Student
Organizations of Professional Societies, Undergraduate Research, or Co-Op.
Scholars may choose different professional development programs in different
years. The goals of the project are to enhance the retention and graduation
rates of students in engineering and applied sciences and to prepare these
students to successfully enter professions or continue in graduate
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
