AST 9530747 The UM/CTIO Magellanic Cloud Emission-Line Survey. Dr. Smith, Dr.
Bregman, and a team of collaborators will undertake a complete CCD emission line
survey of the magellanic clouds. These investigators will take advantage of the
newly available camera on the University of Michigan/CTIO Curtis Schmidt
telescope. The spatial resolution will be 0.84 parsec, and the sensitivity will
be an order of magnitude better than previous photographic surveys. The results
should provide a better understanding of the interstellar medium and its global
characteristics. ============================================
