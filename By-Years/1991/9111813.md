This Research Planning grant will free Dr. Linda S. Ross from teaching in order
for her to obtain data necessary for establishing an independent research
program. The issue of the contributions played by information obtained from
intrinsic genetic information and from the environment in determining cell fate
will be studied by following the differentiation of identified cells in the
visual cortex of the normal and experimentally manipulated, transparent
zebrafish embryo. These studies will form a foundation for future studies of
dynamic analyses of cellular interactions and lineage relationships in the
developing visual system.
