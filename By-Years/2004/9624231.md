This research is on design reuse and design process assessment. Design reuse can
be in any part of the design cycle from initial phases (capture, processing, and
organization of design information), to final phases (matching, retrieval and
actual reuse of design information). Mechanisms for supporting this activity are
being explored. Attention is being paid to maximizing opportunities for reuse,
and assessing the impact on productivity of the reuse infrastructure. Issues
being addressed include the characterization and representation of design
objects and design processes, automatic capture, indexing, retrieval and reuse
of design information. The second investigation is developing a framework,
including risk assessment and planning tools, for design process assessment.
Metrics or measuring management objectives and parameters of the design process
are being identified and characterized. Results of the research are being tested
and validated in the design of large embedded systems.
