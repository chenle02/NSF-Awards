This investigation addresses the dynamics of recruitment- subsidized
populations, i.e. populations in which the addition of new individuals is
largely or completely uncoupled from local reproduction. This includes local
populations of benthic organisms with planktonic larvae and species (many marine
fish) in which stochastic variation renders stock-recruitment relations, if any,
undetectable. The demography of such populations is most appropriately modelled
by writing recruitment as a external "subsidy". The dynamics of the population
are determined by the recruitment signal filtered through the post- recruitment
life history. Dr. Caswell will investigate four models (density-independent
demographic models, density-dependent demographic models, metapopulation models
for coupled subpopulations, and multi-species community models) for subsidized
populations. These models will provide fundamental theoretical insight into the
dynamics of subsidized populations. The first two will also provide tools for
empirical demographic analysis of such populations.
