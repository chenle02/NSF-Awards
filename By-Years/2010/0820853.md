Funds from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support
acquisition of equipment for paleomagnetic and rock magnetic research and
research training at New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU). NMHU is a non-Ph.D.
granting, Hispanic serving institution. Specific equipment to be acquired
includes: 1) a spinner magnetometer; 2) alternating field demagnetizer; 3)
fluxgate magnetometer; and 5) Kappabridge (for the measurement of anisotropy of
magnetic susceptibility). The equipment will support a broad range of
interesting research including study of emplacement mechanisms of igneous
intrusives and mid-crustal metamorphic processes. These research directions
demonstrate a need for analysis of rock magnetic fabrics. The equipment will
facilitate student experience with state-of-the-art analytical techniques in
rock and mineral magnetism.
