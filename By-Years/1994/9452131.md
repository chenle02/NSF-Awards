9452131 Myers 31The project will develop a novel approach to the upper-level
undergraduate inorganic chemistry laboratory which successfully integrates both
the techniques and methodologies of scientific research into the course.
Further, the diversity of inorganic chemistry, from molecular substances to
structurally extended materials, will be presented within the context of a
single, coherent laboratory course. This approach is already under way, and
student experience to date has run the gamut from photochemical preparation and
characterization of an organometallic complex to the preparation and ion
exchange of a zeolite. Four new initiatives are incorporated into the proposal:
1) use of a diode array kinetic spectrophotometer in the study of reaction
kinetics and mechanisms, 2) electrochemical characterization and preparation
techniques (e.g. cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis), 3) preparation and
manipulation of air sensitive complexes by Schlenk techniques, and 4) use and
maintenance of inert atmosphere enclosures. In addition, desktop computers will
be employed for calculating X-ray powder diffraction patterns and for free
energy minimization calculations to predict optimum reaction conditions.
