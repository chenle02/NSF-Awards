The principal investigator will examine fluid behavior in three types of crustal
environments (contact aureole, extensional metamorphic terrane, collisional
metamorphic terrane). The results will help geologists to better understand the
relationship between petrologic and isotopic data and will improve the
coordinated use of these tools as indicators of geologic conditions as they
affected rocks of the Earth's crust.
