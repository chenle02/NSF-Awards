A grant has been awarded to Duke University and the Organization for Tropical
Studies to digitize, image and geo-reference 20,000-plus plant specimens from
the La Selva Herbarium collection, the Duke Herbarium, Instituto Nacional de
Biodiversidad (INBio) and the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica. Station. The
database generated by these collections will be served to the Internet, thus
providing students and the research community with a globally accessible,
comprehensive coverage of plant species found at the La Selva Biological Station
and representing Caribbean lowland tropical rainforest diversity. The Digital
Flora of La Selva will contain taxonomic information, have the ability to create
diagnostic species descriptions and drive interactive multiple entry electronic
keys from taxon x character matrices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of the
tropical flora project will benefit the research and educational activities of
the La Selva Biological Station. The station is a prime site for training U.S.
graduate students participating in the field courses in tropical ecology and
tropical plant systematics. The wealth of knowledge about plant species that has
been accumulated at the La Selva Biological Station over the past 50 years
touches on a broad range of issues that have global implications, for example,
in conserving and protecting biodiversity, resource management, and in trying to
understand the role of tropical forests in global climate change.&lt;br/&gt;
