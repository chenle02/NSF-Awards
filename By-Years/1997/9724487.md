9724487 LEDERER, WILLIAM The goal of this project is to establish a two-photon
microscopy facility to complement and extend existing multi- user bioimaging
resources at the University of Maryland at Baltimore (UMAB). Two-photon
excitation avoids many of the disadvantages inherent in conventional and
confocal microscopies. For example, the approach affords better spatial
discrimination for photolytic techniques and better penetration into thick
samples. Furthermore, two-photon excitation entirely eliminates photobleaching,
photodamage and background fluorescence in planes away from the focus. These
properties make two-photon microscopy an excellent method for the study of
living cells, and will permit important new experiments to be completed by UMAB
researchers. A two-photon microscopy will also provide the basis for state-of-
the-art training for students and postdoctoral fellows.
