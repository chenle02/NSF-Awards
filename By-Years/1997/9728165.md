9728165 Bloomfield DNA functions in crowded, strongly interacting solutions,
mainly while interacting with proteins. The equilibrium and dynamic aspects of
protein-DNA interactions are strongly influenced by the environment. When the
volume occupancy of a solution reaches more than thirty percent, as it does
within cells, simple extrapolations from dilute solution behavior become totally
inadequate. The goal in this project is to develop a better experimental and
theoretical understanding of the ways in which high concentrations of DNA and
other polymers influence the diffusional dynamics of proteins which bind to DNA.
The three specific aim are (1) To characterize the diffusional motion of
proteins within a crowded DNA environment and in DNA solutions which also
contain crowding agents such as dextran, Ficoll, and PEG, so as to understand
the effects of excluded volume, ionic interactions, and specific binding
interactions. (2) To determine how crowding influences the relative importance
of one-dimensional and three-dimensional diffusion in the action of restriction
enzymes. (3) To use Brownian dynamics simulation of protein diffusion in crowded
DNA solutions, to gain insight into the ways in which ionic strength-dependent
volume exclusion and nonspecific binding affect the search of regulatory
proteins for their specific binding sites. The major tools will be fluorescence
photobleaching recovery and dynamic light scattering to measure diffusion, gel
electrophoresis to follow kinetics of restriction enzyme action, and Brownian
dynamics to simulate diffusion in complex, interacting systems. The general
significance of this research is to gain insight into the effect of the crowded,
strongly interacting conditions prevailing inside cells, and how these
conditions affect the dynamic diffusion and reaction processes involved in gene
regulation. ***
