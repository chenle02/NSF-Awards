This project enhances the expressive ability of the fundamental medium of text
with the development of tools that enhance the creativity of people while
generating kinetic typography. Traditional forms of static typography can be
augmented with time and motion, in order to manipulate the position, size,
color, shape, and other properties of text displays over time. This new kinetic
typography offers a number of potential advantages: the ability to convey
emotional content and qualities of the speaker's voice, the potential for
increased reading performance on very small displays, and the ability to
communicate in new ways. These advantages have been largely unexploited because
the technological tools needed to make kinetic typography easily accessible to
both designers and the general public have only begun to be developed. This
project explores the nature of tools that enhance human creativity in the
context of generating kinetic text. The impact of this work will reach well
beyond kinetic typography, with implications for understanding the design
process, emotional communication, and creativity. This research will extend our
basic knowledge of communication and information transfer, and give us a
foundation for understanding and creating kinetic typography tools, with long-
term implications for work in design schools and training environments.
