This proposal studies the problem arising when countries disagree over their
beliefs about how fast global warming is occurring. The objective is to
understand how this divergence of beliefs affects the kinds of international
agreements that are likely to be adopted and to explore formats or mechanisms
that might lead to better international solutions even if no consensus on
probabilities exists. The study also aims to pinpoint the kinds of agreements
that might be possible given the current range of beliefs and mitigation costs.
The major part of the project is a decision theory model of international
environmental policies when probability beliefs differ. We study this in the
context of a particular set of international environmental policies that are
likely to be considered. The second part of the project is a beginning empirical
analysis of the distribution of beliefs and mitigation costs across countries.
Most of these estimates should be available from other sources, and this project
hopes to uncover some straightforward empirical relationships among countries'
environmental policies with respect to global warming.
