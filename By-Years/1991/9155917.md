This project demonstrates how the design activity, fully integrated with
economic principles, can be effectively utilized to teach the engineering
science component of the undergraduate curriculum. The project builds on and
extends the experimental core curriculum being developed at Texas A&M University
(under NSF funding) such that design and economic principles become infused into
required engineering science courses in the curriculum at the Georgia Institute
of Technology. Professors from four engineering disciplines at Georgia Tech will
be developing and testing the experimental courses over several years and
reporting their experiences with a design-focused teaching paradigm.
Additionally, a new course is being developed focusing on the economics of
engineering design that bridges from the lower to the upper division in the
undergraduate curriculum. Professors from six different universities are
assisting in the preparation of educational materials for this new course and
for the economics components of the modified engineering science core courses.
To provide a second experimental test bed for this course, Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University and North Carolina A&T State University will
teach it during the second and third years, and the third year, respectively, of
the project. Evaluation procedures for the modified engineering science core
courses at Georgia Tech and for the economics of design course are being
developed and carried out over the duration of the research. Effective
mechanisms for transferring results are planned to be developed. Significant
support exists for this multidisciplinary effort as evidenced by the fact that
one- third of the entire budget is being cost-shared by participating
institutions. Finally, a National Visiting Committee is being formed to interact
with the project.
