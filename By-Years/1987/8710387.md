The research deals with the optimization of variable pulse rate control schemes
in the control of single and multiple motors. The plan is to incorporate the
stepper motor control scheme into a robotic controller. It incorporates a
feedback loop and a driver/logic circuitry and related algorithms for efficient
control of the stepper motors. The control logic incorporates cycloidal,
harmonic and/or eighth order polynomical motion into the control scheme. The
project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate
Engineering Students.
