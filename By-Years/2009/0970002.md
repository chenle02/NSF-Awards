The research objective of this project is to characterize and investigate the
use of tailored three dimensional fabrics as part of a composite structure to
improve the through-thickness thermal properties. Initial predictions suggest
that one can improve through-thickness thermal conductivity of composites by two
to three orders of magnitude with high z-fiber content. This would be equivalent
to thermal properties of metallic baseline materials. These preliminary results
have motivated this research which will investigate and characterize (i) the
thermal transport mechanisms when highly conductive z-fibers are integrated in
3-D composites, (ii) their arrangement for optimal performance and (iii)
manufacturing issues associated with this class of composites. Validation of the
developed fundamental understanding using well-designed model experiments is
also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research requires knowledge of textile
and composites modeling, composite design, manufacturing and testing. The US Co-
PIs will work together with the Institute for Textile Technology at the
University of Aachen/Germany (ITA). ITA is an internationally renowned center
with complimentary equipment and expertise necessary to fabricate the three
dimensional fabric structures. US students will have the opportunity to conduct
part of their research at ITA gaining valuable expertise in textile technology.
The activity will develop the general framework to address heat transport
mechanisms in multi phase heterogeneous porous media containing a highly
conductive phase. Once this is well understood one can fabricate composites with
tailored thermal conductivities fulfilling their potential in a range of
applications from housing to large-scale structures that need to be electrically
and thermally conductive.
