1339505 &lt;br/&gt;Moskowitz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a three
year continuation of funding for the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the
University of Minnesota. The goals of the IRM include: 1) providing the
geoscience research community with access to a full suite of sensitive
instrumentation for detailed study of magnetic properties of natural materials;
2) providing visiting scholars with the support necessary to use the facilities
effectively, including technical, educational, and logistical components of
support; 3) adapting methods and techniques from physics and materials science,
as well as developing new methods, for using magnetic measurement data to
characterize complex natural samples and to address questions of specific
interest to geoscientists; and; 4) serving as a catalyst in widening and
improving the applications of magnetic analysis in geological and biological
studies, by holding workshops and conferences, and by maintaining active (and
separately funded) research programs in those areas. Research facilitated by the
analytical and technical capabilities of the IRM includes high resolution
studies of variability in the intensity of the Earth?s magnetic field in order
to elucidate fundamental questions surrounding the origin of the geodynamo,
characterization of the properties of microbial nanophase magnetic minerals, and
fundamental studies of the origin of magnetization in minerals and the behavior
of magnetic minerals in response to environmental perturbations in temperature
and applied magnetic fields. The IRM supports the training of graduate and
postdoctoral students in state-of-the-art rock and paleomagnetic analysis
techniques and facilitates international collaborations through the Visiting
Fellows program and a biennial conference series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
