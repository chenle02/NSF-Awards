9701500 Silvera This is a new proposal to study solid hydrogen and its isotopes,
deuterium and HD in the multimegabar pressure range. Pressures will be extended
beyond 300 GPa, where it is believed that the dissociative transition to atomic
metallic hydrogen will take place. This will be accomplished using high quality,
small culet diamonds in newly designed precision diamond anvil cells.
Transitions will be searched for by studying the strong IR absorption, as well
as the Raman scattering from vibron modes, in the A-phase which is believed to
precede the transformation to the atomic solid. A detected phase transition will
then be studied by optical techniques to observe Drude free-electron behavior,
or dc electrical conductivity at low temperature, in order to determine the
conductive state. NMR will be used to determine ortho-para conversion rates.
Optical techniques will be developed to determine the index or refraction and
the equation of state. %%% This is a new proposal to study solid hydrogen and
its isotopes, deuterium and HD in the multimegabar pressure range. Solid
hydrogen and its isotopes have fascinating high pressure phase diagrams. These
molecular solids are predicted to become molecular metals at pressures between
1.5 and 3 megabar and atomic metals at higher pressures. The molecular and
atomic metals are predicted to be possible room temperature superconductors. A
transition to a phase called the A-phase at about 1.5 megabars is still not
understood. These solids will be studied at multimegabar pressures using newly
designed precision diamond anvil cells. IR absorption, as well as Raman
scattering will be used to search for new phases. These will then be studied by
optical techniques or dc electrical conductivity at low temperature to observe
possible metallic behavior. NMR will be used to determine ortho-para conversion
rates. Optical techniqu es will also be developed to determine the index of
refraction and the equation of state. ***
