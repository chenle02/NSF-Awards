The use of protecting groups is a vital tool in the synthesis of multifunctional
molecules such as valuable "new generation" pharmaceuticals. When a reaction
must be carried out at a specific reaction site, protecting groups are used to
temporarily block other sensitive reaction sites on the molecule. Substituted
benzyl alcohols are particularly useful as protecting groups. They are prepared
by reacting electrophiles with a simple derivitive of benzyl alcohol, i.e.,
benzyl alcohol ester. Although this reaction proceeds in excellent yield, it
results in a mixture of isomers with similar physical properties. Separation of
these isomers is technically difficult and expensive. This proposal is aimed
toward the development of a novel membrane-based process to address this
problem.
