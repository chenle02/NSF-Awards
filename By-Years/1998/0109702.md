This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates
advanced ultrasonic techniques for out-of-plane laboratory inspection of paper
materials. Experimental ultrasonic test methods are available to probe thickness
direction elasticity, predict internal bond strength of paperboard, detect
delamination defects in multi-ply boards, and evaluate the softness of tissue
products. However, an analysis of these methods indicates serious shortcomings
in the measuring principles: presence of interfering signals, poor resolution,
simplified interpretation of sound attenuation commercial ultrasonic instrument
already exists to investigate wetting and liquid penetration in paper, but the
technique cannot distinguish between penetrating depth and amount of penetrating
liquid. Also, other measurement needs such as coating thickness evaluation are
not addressed. Since the future of the U.S.Pulp and Paper Industry largely
stands on the manufacturing of low volume but high quality value-added products,
product development, superior quality, and end-use performance are critical
elements of a competitive market environment. In that context, SoniSys plans to
develop new ultrasonic measuring tools, which will sustain the subsequent
development of a versatile commercial ultrasonic instrument for out-of-plane
paper inspection.

SoniSys anticipates at least seven market segments for its instrument in the
paper industry: (1) Nondestructive prediction of internal bond strength and
evaluation of board structural integrity (paperboard mills;paper testing
companies); (2) Measurement of elastic stiffness for product development,
quality control purposes and calibration of on-line measurements (paper and
paperboard mills;R&D centers); (3) Detection and localization of delamination
defects (paperboard mills); (4) Investigation of amount of penetrating liquid
and liquid penetrating depth in wetting and liquid penetration tests (paper and
paperboard mills, R&D centers); (5) Determination of coating thickness and
assessment of paper substrate-coating layer interface (paper and paperboard
mills,R&D centers); (6) Quantitative evaluation of bulk and surface tissue
softness (tissue industry); and (7) Testing of wood coupons and prediction of
pulp and paper properties from raw materials (pulp and forest industries). .
