One's ability to extract relevant sounds from naturally overflowing acoustic
stimulation requires efficient analysis of their identity and spatial origin.
For example, concentrating on a particular spoken message in a noisy
environment, filled with distracting sounds of other conversations, would be
impossible without these essential brain functions. With National Science
Foundation funding, Dr. John W. Belliveau is conducting research towards better
understanding of how the human auditory system processes sound identity ("what")
and location ("where") information. He is investigating how selective attention
to sound identity or location modulates the putative "what" and "where"
processing pathways in the human auditory system. To accomplish these goals, the
researchers utilize spatiotemporal modeling of human brain activity, which
combines spatially specific functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
temporally accurate magnetoencephaolographic/electroencephalographic (MEG/EEG)
measures of brain function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
project include free distribution of developed software/algorithms, and advanced
training of researchers in the field of cognitive neuroimaging. Empirical
information on the auditory-cortex 'what' and 'where' pathways will be
incorporated into computational models of human auditory processing. Advanced
models of brain function may ultimately benefit biological cybernetics,
artificial intelligence, and robotics applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
