Non-commutative algebra and relations to topology and quantum information
theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to develop concepts in non-commutative (or quantum) algebra as they
apply to low-dimensional topology and quantum information theory. The PI plans
to study tensor categories, in particular fusion categories and categories
arising from quantum groups, that can be used to construct 3-manifold
invariants. The PI also plans to study perturbative quantum invariants (due to
Vassiliev and Kontsevich) and the related problem of deformation theory of
tensor categories. In the area of quantum information theory, the PI plans to
study analogues of foundational results in probability theory such as the
central limit theorem, as well as possible applications of
representation&lt;br/&gt;theory and quantum groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of
the foundations of modern mathematics and physics is non-commutative algebra,
which is the study of abstract formulas in which multiplication does not commute
(although addition still does). Non-commutative algebra is the essence of
quantum mechanics, and it is also fundamental for understanding symmetry, The
purpose of this project is to further apply non-commutative algebra to quantum
computation and 3-dimensional topology. Quantum computation is at once an
important theoretical elaboration of quantum mechanics and a possible future
technology. Topology is the study of knots, links, and abstract geometric
spaces. It is closely related to symmetry and it has applications to many other
areas of mathematics, as well as to questions in physics and economics and even
to the study of DNA.&lt;br/&gt;
