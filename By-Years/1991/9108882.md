Exploration of the Far-infrared (FIR) spectral region between 40 GHz and 3 THz
would benefit from the development of fast, sensitive detectors. Pyroelectric
detectors have been used successfully in the infrared (IR) spectral region, and
their use can be extended to the FIR by integrating them with planar antennas.
An antenna-coupled pyroelectric detector (ACPD) which will consist of a planar
antenna, a resistive load element, and a thermally sensitive pyroelectric will
be will be investigated under this Research Initiation Award.
