The GT-SUPREEM program at Georgia Institute of Technology is serving as a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates site. GT- SUPREEM is an eight-week
summer research program designed to attract qualified minority students into the
field of electrical engineering. Ten students of a least junior-level
undergraduate standing will be recruited annually on a nationwide basis and
paired with both a faculty and a graduate student mentor to undertake research
projects in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical Engineering. The students will
be housed on campus, and in addition to lodging and a travel allowance, will be
provided with a $3,000 stipend. At the conclusion of the summer, the students
will be expected to prepare both oral and written summaries of their research
projects. It is anticipated that this experience will encourage these students
to become applicants for graduate school in ensuing years.
