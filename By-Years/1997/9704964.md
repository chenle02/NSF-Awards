1 9704964 Kaner Highly exothermic chemical exchange (metathesis) reactions in
the solid-state can be designed to lead rapidly to materials that are otherwise
difficult to form. This project will explore the application of pressure to open
a new parameter space for the synthesis of high pressure phases which
inaccessible under ambient conditions. This approach to solid state metathesis
reactions will provide a new synthetic method for forming high quality solid
solutions, and for controlling crystallite size, and the important questions
explored in this research will have advance considerably the area of chemical
processing. %%% The classes of materials to be investigated are of considerable
potential technological importance and include crystal size and
photoluminescence studies on gallium nitride, and cubic boron nitride, the
second hardest materials known after diamond. Methods for forming diamond and
substituted carbon materials will also be tested. ***
