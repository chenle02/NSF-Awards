Malicious programs ("malware") are expensive and can put people's lives at risk.
Unfortunately, automatic malware detection is difficult and many automated
detection systems produce a large number of false alarms. In large enterprises,
detectors may create millions of security log entries per day, deluging the
human analysts with false alarms. This project is developing algorithmic and
statistical techniques to automatically analyze these security logs and reduce
the number that human analysts must review from millions to only tens or
hundreds per day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher's key insight is that
attack patterns induce transient correlations across time and nodes (users or
devices). The project explores the hypothesis that encoding and algorithmically
exploiting such transient correlations can lead to tremendous dimensionality
reductions of the multi-scale alert data, and allow statistically significant
insights into malware activity. The team is exploring this hypothesis using two
ideas. First, they have defined the idea of a "neighborhood" that allows
filtering of alerts. A neighborhood is a set of nodes that shares an action
attribute such as having visited a common website or received emails from the
same source within a specific time window. Thus, neighborhoods are dynamic
collections of nodes that are likely to be exposed to a similar attack vector,
e.g., a compromised web-server or a malicious phishing email. The second idea is
a statistical approach for composing local detectors that uses the feature
vectors (FVs) leading to local detector alerts ("alert-FVs") instead of
operating only on the original alert flags from nodes. This may allow a global
detector to better separate true positive neighborhoods from false positive
neighborhoods by comparing the distributional shape of alert-FVs from each
neighborhood. The research team will perform experiments to evaluate their
techniques using production-scale, real-time alert logs from a large commercial
enterprise and the University of Texas' Information Security Office.
