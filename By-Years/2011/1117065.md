The goal of this project is to provide protection against exploits through
untrusted third-party software components and against malicious application
manipulation. These problems constitute an important class of vulnerabilities in
current software, and are tied to a common denominator -- the lack of ability to
divide a program and the data manipulated by it in a fine-grained manner and to
control the interactions between the resulting constituents. This project
proposes practical fine-grained ``least privilege'' enforcement through a
computation model where the heap can be divided into a dynamic number of memory
domains. Security contexts --- called secure memory views (SMVs) --- can be
defined that map privileges of code executing within them onto memory domains.
Threads are allowed to dynamically switch their set of privileges (i.e., switch
which SMVs they are bound to) in a secure and controlled fashion, termed
security context switching. These ideas are realized through three core
contributions. (1) A programming model is devised to allow the application
programmer to easily apply the proposed techniques, while also providing enough
structure to reason about the resulting properties and to secure these. (2) The
new concepts are reified within a modern mainstream programming language through
development of a compiler supporting the language extensions, as well as
modifications of the language runtime. (3) An efficient implementation of
security context switching is proposed, involving both the language runtime and
the operating system kernel itself. To validate the research, a popular web
browser as well as a web server are enhanced to use SMVs. By using widely
employed open-source software for implementing and validating the proposed
support our concepts become available to a large community for use as well as
further research and development.
