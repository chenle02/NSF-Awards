This grant will provide funds to edit and publish an annual review of the
student biomedical engineering design projects supported by the Research to Aid
Persons with Disabilities program at NSF. There are presently over 20
institutions participating in this program. The fourth edition is being
completed and this grant will support the publication of an additional three
volumes/years. The work not only provides a catalog of devices/projects for use
by the rehabilitation community but it is also being used as resource material
in engineering design courses.
