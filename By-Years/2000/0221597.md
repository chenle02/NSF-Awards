0221597&lt;br/&gt;Yamaguchi&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support to continue
Design Projects' activities begun under NSF award #9631744 at Arizona State
University (ASC) in which students designed and built custom projects for people
with disabilities. The objectives of the activities are to enhance engineering
education, provide students with insight into careers in biomedical engineering,
improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and serve the
community. The past 12 years of design projects activity at ASU led to the
successful completion of 109 design projects and training of 115 undergraduate
students in basic design principles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design projects'
activity is structured to work successfully within the environment of ASU.
Disability Resources for Students (DRS), which provides accommodations for
hundreds of mentally and physically disabled students on the ASU campus, will be
closely integrated with the student engineers' work. Ten senior design projects
are to be pursued each year in conjunction with DRS to develop the prototype
devices. Two undergraduate summer interns are to be supported under the program
to work part-time at DRS to develop a listing of appropriate projects for the
student engineers. A graduate student is to assist in administering the program
by helping the undergraduate design teams and fostering new connections between
ASU and nearby communities to serve and/or support persons with disabilities.
This project is to introduce 10 to 20 new engineers each year to the daily
problems faced by the disabled. Additionally, the disabled community will be
directly involved as design consultants and thereby increase the participation
of an underrepresented group in the activity. &lt;br/&gt;
