9415749 Belles Georgian Court College requests support from NSF for connection
of its campus network to JVNCnet. JVNCnet is the midlevel network located in the
state of New Jersey and it will provide operations management and information
services and will give Georgian Court College a connection to the NSFNET, a high
speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The College
needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
