LIGASE: Long Island Group About Science Education The goal of LIGASE (Long
Island Group about Science Education) is to educate a highly skilled work force
for the growing biotechnology industry on Long Island. A consortium consisting
of SUNY Stony Brook, Nassau Community College, Suffolk Community College,
Brentwood High School, Uniondale High School, and firms utilizing the Long
Island High Technology Incubator has been formed to accomplish this goal. Three
different strategies are being used to develop and deliver the curricula: 1) the
Teacher Enhancement Institute, located in the School of Professional Development
at Stony Brook, is educating high school and community college faculty in
current concepts and laboratory techniques in biotechnology, 2) with the
assistance of the biotechnology industry, innovative curricula are being
developed at the high schools and community colleges, 3) academic year and
summer programs are being established that allow faculty and students to gain
hands-on experience at the participating institutions. Campus based teaching is
being supplemented by off-campus electronically delivered curricula. All
developed materials are being made available to other institutions via the
LIGASE home page, publications and workshops. Additional activities stress the
recruitment of underrepresented minorities and women. Imaginative approaches to
broaden instructional capability, including teaching with representatives from
both education and industry are also being emphasized. An ongoing outside
evaluation allows for positive feedback, modification and change on a regular
basis. The overarching structure is provided by the LIGASE Steering Committee,
consisting of teachers, faculty and industry representatives.
