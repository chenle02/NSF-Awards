This award provides support for an REU-Site in geography at Oklahoma State
University. The project deals with applicdations of the geographic information
system (GIS) to soil and water research problems. With the assistance of their
mentors, student researchers will be responsible for: (1) conceptualizing a
research question; (2) data collection, (3) GIS and statistical analysis; and
(4) interpretation and presentation of project results. Examples of the topic
areas for projects include GIS-based investigations of phosphorus and sediment
transport, evaluating soil and water constraints on urban development, and
studies of regional evapotranspiration. Students will have opportunities to take
advantage of research support resources including ArcView Certification, GPS
training, and mentor/peer seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes
to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
