Efficient operation of coordinated multiple robot systems requires continued
development in many areas. One such area is the improved understanding of the
kinematics or motion of the coordinated manipulators. This project contributes
to that knowledge. Specifically, it advances the formulation of the
configuration manifold of combined manipulator systems. A configuration manifold
for a single body is the combined set of possible rotational and translational
states for the body relative to some reference frame. Each manipulator has its
own configuration manifold and the intersection of manifolds provides a method
for determining the available positions of a workpiece held by multiple
manipulators. This research develops a method for finding the intersection. As
industrial applications for multiple robots grow, the value of this research
becomes more evident.
