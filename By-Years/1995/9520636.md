9520636 Bickers Computational research will be conducted on the properties of
correlated electrons in solids within the framework of self-consistent field
approximations. Such approximations constitute the natural generalization of
Hartree-Fock theories to systems with strong interactions and large electronic
fluctuations, including the cuprate high- temperature superconductors. The self-
consistent field approach provides a semi-analytical alternative to numerical
techniques like exact diagonalization or simulation. The research proposed
concentrates on the extension of the self- consistent field approach to (a)
lattice models with nontrivial unit-cell structure, including multi-orbital
models describing the cuprate superconductors; and (b) lattice models with
infinite-range Coulomb interactions. In addition, a program of study is proposed
to improve the treatment of nonlocal vertices in general two-particle
correlation functions. %%% New computational techniques will be investigated to
deal with systems of electrons which interact strongly and for which existing
methods are not applicable. Of particular interest, these new techniques will be
applied to the problem of understanding high-temperature superconductors. ***
