This research is to develop an improved inversion technique for seismic
velocity models such as those required in oil exploration and crustal studies. A
problem with current techniques is that an initial guess must be made as to the
velocity model; this is then adjusted until it fits the observations. However,
the final result is often dependent on the initial guess. An inversion method
termed simulated annealing, based on a model of cooling to crystallization,
attempts to avoid having to make an initial estimate in order to come up with
the best final model that fits the seismic data. A second technique is termed a
genetic algorithm based on biological principles of natural selection and
genetics. Both are global optimization methods. If successful, the techniques
will have wide application in seismic oil exploration and crustal
investigations.
