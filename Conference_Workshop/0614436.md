From August 31 to September 6, 2006 there will be a one-week Summer School and
Research Conference on ``K-theory and Noncommutative Geometry'' in Valladolid,
Spain. The field of algebraic K-theory is rapidly changing, thanks to the recent
developments relating it to motivic cohomology, etale cohomology, C*-algebras,
derived categories and cyclic homology. The field of noncommutative geometry is
also rapidly changing with cyclic homology, C^*-algebras and derived category
techniques playing a leading role. The two subjects have considerable overlap,
as this list shows. Bringing together international experts in these related
fields should result in the discovery of new connections between these branches
of mathematics.

This conference is part of an on-going attempt to link up several different
areas of mathematics undergoing rapid development: algebra, especially its
connections to algebraic geometry via K-theory; functional analysis, especially
operators on objects of geometric interest; and geometry, especially those non-
commuting aspects measured by cyclic homology. The research conference portion
will expose them to the forefront developments in the subject, and the
opportunity for researchers to interact will advance discovery and enhance
partnerships.
