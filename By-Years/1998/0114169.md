0114169 Pavlostathis The objective of this research is the in-depth assessment
of the microbial reductive transformation and decolorization potential of
anthraquinone and phthalocyanine reactive dyes. Several commercial dyes as well
as model compounds will be used. The target dyes will be characterized, and
their redox chemistry investigated. Specific analytical techniques, which are
currently lacking, will be developed for the identification and quantification
of the parent dyes as well as their transformed products. The kinetics and
extent of abiotic, chemical and microbial reductive transformation and
decolorization of the target dyes will be assessed. Mechanistic aspects of
electron transfer during the reductive decolorization of the target dyes and the
use of electron mediators for the potential enhancement of the decolorization
process will be investigated. To further evaluate reductive biodecolorization
under more realistic conditions, the decolorization process will be evaluated
using a continuous-flow, fixed-film bioreactor under saline conditions typically
encountered in commercial textile reactive dyebaths. Experimental measurements
in both batch and continuous-flow systems will be used to develop mathematical
models for the quantitative description of the reductive biodecolorization of
the target dyes, including the potential beneficial effect of electron transfer
mediators. ***
