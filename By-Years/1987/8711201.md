This grant permits Dr. Lambert and his colleagues to study the effect of diet on
bone composition. They will raise laboratory rats on each of several selected
test diets and then analyze the elemental content of their bone. Test diets will
include those with substantial components of meat, corn, wheat, nuts, dairy
products, leafy vegetables, starch and fish. Multivariate analysis will be
performed on the data obtained in order to define both food and skeletal
profiles for the various types of diets used. Through collaboration, analogous
data will be obtained on both rare earth elements and stable isotopes. This
protocol will allow the reseachers to address three questions: How are elemental
levels in diet translated to elemental levels in bone?; in this context which
elements interact, either antagonistically or synergistically?; can a
multielement profile specify several components in the diet? Archaeologists
attempt to reconstruct past lifeways and one key aspect of this involves past
subsistence techniques. Because many materials, such as plant remains, are
poorly preserved in the archaeological record past diet is extremely difficult
to determine. Human skeletal remains are often recovered in the course of
archaeological excavation and analysis indicates that these bones appear to
preserve dietary information. For example levels of strontium seem inversely
correlated with proportion of meat in the diet. However it is not understood
just what these relations are. For this reason Dr. Lambert's research is of
great archaeological significance It may provide researchers with an important
new tool.
