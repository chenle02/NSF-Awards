This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
micromachined antenna tuning module products for cell phone and portable
computing applications. The proposed technology can reduce the mismatch between
the device's RF frontend and its operating environment (user's head, user's
hand, metallic objects, etc.). Compared to competing approaches, the proposed
technology can provide antenna tunability and reduced size, while reducing
system costs and power consumption. The research will focus on the integration
of the varactor technology with a low-loss RF design. Follow-on work could
develop the entire prototype module. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated
that a micromachined varactor was able maintain optimal matching while antenna
output impedance was varied over a range. Anticipated technical results include
demonstrating a product with a tuning range that will sufficiently cover
probably antenna impedance mismatch conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad
impact/commercial impact of this project includes addressing several key
problems currently in the wireless sector: power consumption, bandwidth and
signal reception. The ability to tune the antenna can deliver substantial
benefits. For the radio transmitter, minimized mismatch reduces wasted reflected
power. Battery power savings is critical, and additional features are requiring
more and more power. For the radio receiver, minimized mismatch improves signal
reception. For cell phones, this would directly result in improved call quality
and reduced dropped calls. For data, improved reception will increase bandwidth
without increasing transmitter power. With more than 1 billion cell phones
manufactured a year, the commercial impact for the proposed micromachined
antenna tuning module is enormous.
