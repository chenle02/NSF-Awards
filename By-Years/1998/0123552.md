The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional
practices, policies, climate and culture. The University of Washington (UW)
recognizes the important contributions that women make in science, engineering,
and mathematics (SEM), and the factors that still inhibit women's full
participation. The University proposes to create the Center for Institutional
Change (CIC) to design and implement programs to help eliminate obstacles to
women's full participation and advancement in the SEM disciplines. Many of these
challenges occur in departments, so changing departmental culture will be a part
of the CIC mission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIC will focus on these issues in
SEM on campus:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leadership development for chairs and deans
&lt;br/&gt;Department cultural change&lt;br/&gt;Policy
change&lt;br/&gt;Leadership development &lt;br/&gt;Short-term support program
for faculty in times of transition &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work of the CIC
will seve all groups (men, women, underrepresented) and improve the environment
for everyone in SEM. UW will share its experiences with other institutions,
professional societies, and industrial partners that are addressing the issues
of low representation of women faculty in engineering and science. A network
will be established to facilitate dissemination, and UW will work with Boeing,
Weyerhaeuser, CH2M Hill, and REI to share best
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE
Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
