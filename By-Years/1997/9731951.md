This proposal describes the further development of a multi-fluid simulation
model of the global magnetosphere. It is proposed that the model will allow a
clear identification of processes which permit entry of solar wind plasma into
the magnetosphere, the leakage of magnetospheric plasma into the solar wind, and
the outflow of energized ionospheric plasma into the distant magnetosphere.
Preliminary results show clear differences in the spatial distributions between
plasma components with entry via the low latitude boundary layer and high
latitude reconnection for northward IMF and via the mantle and dayside
reconnection for southward IMF. Comparison with in-situ observations will be
undertaken for particular case studies to perform model validation studies.
