Boundary integral method and parallel processing techniques are used to simulate
the motion and break-up of deformable particles (including drops and bubbles)
encountered in a variety of biological and industrial situations. Particles are
of a newtonian fluid, and are bounded by interfaces with generalized mechanical
properties. Analysis is performed in two- and three-dimensions, for individual
particles, a periodic lattice of particles, and a random dispersion. The main
objectives of the research are to delineate the significance of interfacial
properties on the motion and deformation of particles, compute the magnitude of
interfacial tensions developing during deformations, establish criteria for
permanent deformations and break-up, and study the rheological properties of
dilute and concentrated suspensions. The research is conducted through numerical
computations which are based on asymptotic methods and advanced implementations
of boundary integral methods. A substantial part of the numerical effort is
devoted towards developing efficient techniques of coupling the flow inside and
outside a particle and the deformation of the interfaces. The proposed field of
research is relevant to bioengineering and chemical manufacturing processing, as
well as to high performance computing.//
