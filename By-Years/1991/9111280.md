During a 15 month period, a general framework will be developed for evaluating
the effects of graphic representation of probability on the biases and
inconsistencies observed in preference assessment. Development of the framework
will require investigation of literature in visual information processing,
cognitive modelling, and cognitive complexity. Conceptual developments from
these studies will be used to design experimentation to explore the effects of
graphic probability representations. The framework for modelling visual
information processing and the experimental design for testing this model will
be described in a full grant proposal.
