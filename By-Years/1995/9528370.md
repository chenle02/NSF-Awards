9528370 Kokotovic This is a proposal for continuation of our NSF Grant
#ECS-9203491 which expires on August 31, 1995. Part one of the proposal
summarizes the results under our current grant which have been presented in a
550-page monograph, and in over 20 refereed journal papers and more numerous
conference papers. Among our major accomplishments are new recursive adaptive
and robust design procedures ("backstepping") for nonlinear systems with
parametric and functional uncertainties. For our adaptive designs we have
derived performance bounds which, in the case of linear systems, show that they
outperform traditional adaptive schemes. Although our current results have been
extremely well received by the research community and have also stimulated
interest in applications, our critical examination of their limitations has
motivated the main topics of this proposal: first, to continue to the
development from feasible to implementable designs, and, second, to develop new
design procedures for larger classes of systems. We also propose to initiate an
in-depth study of structure-specific robustness properties of nonlinear feedback
loops, especially those diagnosed by our adaptive procedures. To make our
recursive procedures more attractive for applications, we propose to develop
lean backstepping designs which avoid wasteful cancellations and reduce control
effort. For this purpose we will further develop our inverse-optimal designs. To
extend the classes of systems, we plan to develop new forwarding procedures as
upper-triangular analogs of backstepping. We will extend characterizations of
uncertainties by application-motivated "shape" uncertainties and develop "shape-
robust" controllers. Our robustness studies will quantify performance-robustness
trade-offs and develop redesigns to enhance robustness while minimizing the loss
of performance. Our NSF-supported research provides a theoretical base for, and
is motivated by, our industrial cooperation with United Technologies, Ford Motor
Company and Rockwell International. ***
