&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this grant is to provide support for student travel to
the 2nd ACM SenSys conference, being held in Baltimore, Maryland on November
3-5, 2004. The ACM SenSys conference is a new emerging conference covering all
aspects of wireless sensor networking, with participants from the USA, Europe,
and Asia. This grant offers support for not only student paper authors, but also
for student attendees from a state university serving under-represented
populations. This conference travel support insures that deserving students will
be able to participate in the conference, thereby nurturing the next generation
of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
