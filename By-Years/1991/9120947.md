A central issue in developmental neuroscience concerns the mechanisms
underlying the development of specific connections between two nerve cells.
Fundamental to the formation of these connections is the guidance of axons along
specific pathways to reach their target cells. In the sympathetic nervous
system, preganglionic nerve cells send information from the brain and spinal
cord to cells located in sympathetic ganglia. The ganglia relay this information
to the heart, blood vessels, and glands. The way in which preganglionic nerve
cells are able to find the ganglion during development will be investigated. The
path will be identified by marking nerve cells in the rat and chicken embryo
with a dye that permits the visualization of the earliest fibers growing out
from these nerve cells. The time and way in which the specific projection
pathways are chosen by preganglionic neurons will be described. These studies
promise to provide a basis for future investigations into the mechanisms
involved in directing the guidance of axons in the mammalian sympathetic nervous
system.
