Southwestern area mathematics faculty are attending one of two workshops at the
University of New Mexico in the summer of 1991. Thirty faculty members are
participating in each one-week workshop. The participants are being provided
with a TI-81 graphing calculator and a HP-28S symbolic graphing calculator and
are given "hands-on" instruction in their use. The emphasis is on the use of
these machines as laboratory instruments to gather data and generate hypotheses.
Discovery via visualization is the central theme. A newsletter including
descriptions of post- workshop experiences of participants will be distributed
two times in the year following the workshops and presentations will be made at
regional professional meetings.
