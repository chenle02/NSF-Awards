Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from NSF for connection
of Berklee College of Music, College of Our Lady of the Elms, Rhode Island
School of Design, Saint Michael's College, and the State of Connecticut Board of
Trustees of Community Technical Colleges to the New England Academic Research
Network (NEARnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves the New England
area. A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects and
sharing of resources between institution, including those outside the state.
NEARnet will provide operations management and information services and it will
give the universities and colleges a connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5
- 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The each of the
universities has written a description of its organization and a statement of
the benefits of Internet access that it expects including: greater functionality
and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the links. This is also a unique
opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources. Their
diversity will expose NEARnet to a broader range of user requirements. Nearnet
will use the information obtained by serving this diverse group for the benefit
of New England's academic and research community.
