The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to demonstrate the feasibility of the virtual garment creation
and try-on system. As businesses increase their e-commerce presence, they face a
major challenge: the high rate of returns in e-commerce. The return rate for
online purchases exceeds that of in-store purchases by roughly 4 to 1, with
customers (52-74%) citing dissatisfaction with the garmentsâ€™ fit as the primary
reason for returns. A reduction in returns as small as 1% could keep over 50
million pounds of goods out of the landfill and return $2.3 B to fashion
retailers. This Phase I project is aimed at developing a sophisticated process
using 3D modeling and fabric simulation technologies to enable customized fit
and sizing visualizations prior to purchase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of the virtual garment creation system by using machine learning,
numerical simulations and 3D graphic rendering to generate virtual garments
based on (i) images and text that describe the garment and (ii) a minimum set of
measurements of the customer's body. This process will advance the translation
of novel approaches to combining artificial intelligence and 3D representation
of a deformable shape in a computationally efficient
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
