This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professor Steven
Sperber of the University of Minnesota. Dr. Sperber plans to continue his work
on the properties of L- functions associated with character sums defined over
finite fields. One of the specific projects planned is to continue joint work
with A. Adolphson of Oklahoma State University relating properties of
exponential sums to the shape of certain Newton polygons; another is to study
the p-adic analytic behavior of families of exponential sums, and relations with
the monodromy of the associated deformation equation. This research is work in
the algebraic geometry of positive characteristic. Although the field originated
with notions of continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes,
in this context the discrete takes over, and methods akin to those from the
theory of whole numbers are most useful. Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of
positive characteristic is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers,
and is finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.
