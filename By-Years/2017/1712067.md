This project aims to eradicate a broad class of software bugs, called k-safety
errors, that arise from multiple inconsistent executions of the same procedure.
While there is relatively little work on automated detection of such errors, the
investigators have found dozens of such errors in widely-used software projects.
This project develops semantic reasoning techniques that help software engineers
implement correct programs that do not exhibit k-safety errors. In addition to
improving the security and reliability of many kinds of software, these
techniques make it easier for software engineers to develop, maintain, and debug
their projects. The tools and techniques generated in this project will open-
source and incorporated into the educational curriculum whenever possible. The
project includes graduate and undergraduate students in this research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a comprehensive theoretical framework
for reasoning about arbitrary k-safety properties, including associativity,
determinism, transitivity, and others. Based on preliminary work on Cartesian
Hoare Logic (CHL), the investigators explore a wide range of semantic reasoning
tools for k-safety, ranging from static and dynamic analysis to automated repair
and synthesis. On the analysis side, the project explores precise and scalable
static analysis techniques that can automatically prove the absence of k-safety
violations using automatically inferred relational program invariants. The
project also investigates combined static and dynamic program analysis
techniques that can provide witnesses to k-safety violations.
