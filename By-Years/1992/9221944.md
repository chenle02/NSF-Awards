This is a proposal for Workshop on Variable Structure Control and Sliding Mode
to be held in Cleveland, Ohio, October, l992. The formal introduction of
variable structure systems and notion of sliding modes in control theory were
first introduced by Professor Utkin of Russia in 1960. Since then many
industrial applications in power systems, automotive control, and biological
systems have been reported. The purpose of the workshop is to examine the
current status of variable structure systems related research , to identify
practical engineering issues, and to explore future research directions. The
workshop is co-sponsored by Ohio Aerospace Institute.
