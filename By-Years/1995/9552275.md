This project provides Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) to students and faculty with the goal of expanding elemental analysis
capabilities. The ICP-AES will also be available as a resource for local
educational institutions. Students use ICP in Analytical Chemistry during their
sophomore year. Analysis of more complex mixtures, soil samples, biological
tissue analysis, and environmental samples is emphasized in subsequent course
work; Advanced Inorganic, Biochemistry, Environmental Studies, Instrumental
Analysis, Polymer Chemistry, and student/faculty research projects. The
integration of information obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography,
gas chromatography, mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet and
visible spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used for
the identification and quantification of chemical species present in complex
mixtures. Particular emphasis is placed on samples of environmental importance.
