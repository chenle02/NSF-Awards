This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes
to enable company's existing software to extend concepts from social network
theory and computer science to create a new data type -the relationship master
network. New data types (e.g., customer master) have, historically, solved
business problems and created new enterprise software segments (e.g., CRM).
While the company's existing software's current focus is on using this
relationship to help enterprise sales teams make the appropriate contacts faster
and more efficiently (by answering "who knows who?"), this technology supports
any referral-based process (e.g., finding jobs). In particular, it only connects
parties with mutual interests (e.g., employers and job seekers). Eliminating
discovery costs makes it much easier to gain insight into a person or
organization - thereby bringing the social dynamics of a village up to global
scale. This project will develop a way to prototype components that are
significantly more complex than existing products can currently prototype.

If successful this project will develop methods, using information in the
relationship network, to (1) reconcile the multiple records (each with sparse
data) which appear to describe different people or organizations to a record for
a single person or organization and (2) identify and extract information of
relevance (e.g., biographical information on customers) from the web.
