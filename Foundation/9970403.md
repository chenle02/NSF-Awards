9970403 Hjorth Since many mathematical objects arise as the quotients of some
concrete space by an equivalence relation, attempts to classify such objects
leads naturally to the study of equivalence relations on Polish spaces and the
reducibility order between these equivalence relations. In particular, Hjorth's
project addresses structural issues about the Borel equivalence relations in
which every equivalence class is countable, and orbit equivalence relations on
Polish spaces arising from the continuous actions of Polish groups somewhat more
complicated than the infinite symmetric group. In the first case, there is a
poverty of techniques for distinguishing the Borel cardinalities of the quotient
spaces, and in the second, he would hope to extend the methods from model theory
that have been so wildly successful in the case of the infinite symmetric group.
In a very rough sense, one might try to divide mathematics into the part that
seeks to determine some quantity or equation and the part that seeks simply to
understand some abstract class of mathematical objects. In the former part one
has many examples, ranging from areas of applied mathematics through to the
recent proof of (the inequality comprising) ``Fermat's last theorem.'' In the
second part one has certain areas in abstract analysis (for instance, the
classification of commutative C-star algebras), or even certain parts of
topology (the classification of two- dimensional manifolds), or algebra (for
instance, perhaps, the Hecke algebras, which played such an important part in
Wiles's proof), and the very abstract kinds of objects that can appear there.
Here the intention is that simply understanding these objects can lead to
unforseeable advances. Hjorth's project concerns this second kind of
mathematics, and it might be loosely described as concerned with which kinds of
objects from one mathematical specialty can in principle be reduced to which
other kinds of objects from other subspecialties. ***
