The research project at the Center for Research Scientific Computing (CRSC),
North Carolina State University will use asymptotic analysis with domain
decomposition to solve partial differential equations that arise in the
simulation of fluids. Short-term goals are to apply these techniques to the
numerical simulation of high-speed flow. Longer-term goals include application
to simulation of the fluid flow (and other processes) appropriate for chemical
vapor deposition. The asymptotics identifies the dominant physics in each
region, and provides simplified mathematical models for these regions. In this
way, the physical domain is separated into regions where different modeling
equations govern the solution (hence this is a heterogeneous domain
decomposition). The use of local mathematical models allows the customization of
the numerical method based on the locally dominant physics.
