This project addresses basic research issues on the synthesis and processing of
diamond films. Microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition is used to
synthesize the films under a variety of deposition conditions, and a parametric
variation of these conditions will be conducted to achieve films with improved
structural, optical, and electronic properties. Emphasis will be placed on the
characterization of the effects that lattice defects have on the electronic and
optical properties. The research program seeks to obtain fundamental information
on the nucleation and growth of three crystallographic orientations, (100),
(110), and (111), and to understand the details of atomic structure in these
growth sectors. Diamond films have many potential technological applications
ranging from wear-resistant coatings to more sophisticated and demanding uses
such as primary electronic and optical materials with particular advantages for
use in high temperature environments.
