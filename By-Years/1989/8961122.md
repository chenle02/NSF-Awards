They propose to design, build, develop, and characterize a new narrowband,
broadly tunable, pulsed, solid state laser source based on the newly emerging
alexandrite laser technology. Present day pulsed narrowband tunable laser
sources of the type required for high resolution spectroscopy, photochemical
studies, and analytical chemistry are based on dye laser technology and are
relatively expensive and cumbersome to use. The proposed source, when completed,
will provide new capabilities in spectral purity, pulse duration versatility,
pulse energy and reliability. Perhaps most importantly, when augmented by
nonlinear conversion methods based on stimulated raman scattering (SRS) and
second and third harmonic generation, a general light source useful for chemical
applications will become available that provides enormous cost benefits,
reliability and operating simplicity over previous technology. This source, we
believe, will greatly improve the amount of time researchers can spend on
performing experiments rather than maintaining lasers and will permit multi
laser experiments to be performed vastly more easily and at many more
laboratories than is possible today.
