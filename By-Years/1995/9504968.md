ABSTRACT CTS-9504968 Jose Lage This proposal is to fund a small grant for
innovative exploratory research on the use of time-oscillatory thermal fields
induced in a fluid to promote and enhance mixing. The benefit of this method is
that lower shear stresses are placed on the fluid than by mechanical mixing
techniques, resulting in less severe potential degradation of shear-sensitive
fluids during mixing. This may have applications biomedical applications and in
the mixing of some polymeric solutions which are shear- and temperature-
sensitive.
