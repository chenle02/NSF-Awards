Engineering - Chemical (53) We have developed and deployed a number of virtual
unit operations lab projects. Our lab-based units have been developed to pose
open-ended "what if" design problems by having students work on real time
chemical processes. These chemical processes will include distillation and
polymer crystallization for example. This will enable student on our campus as
well as students from other campuses, colleges and high schools, to gain
experience on a wide range of design, scale-up, and start-up problems generated
by these laboratory projects. We hope to have students gain access to
experiments that would not otherwise be available to them. These experiments can
be used either in a classroom or lecture setting. Development efforts have
involved collaboration between faculty at John Hopkins University and MIT.
