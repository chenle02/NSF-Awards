This investigator will study a number of questions that arise from ecology. An
important direction of the research will be to prove general results in support
of the picture advocated by Durrett and Levin (1994): the behavior of stochastic
spatial models can be predicted from that of the mean field ODE obtained by
pretending all sites are always independent. He will also continue work on
hybrid zones, progressing now to the derivation of PDE limits for these systems
as selection tends to 0, and the study of spatially inhomogeneous models to
understand the structure of mosaic hybrid zones that have been seen in field
work on the cricket species Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus. Other projects
include understanding limits to diversity by analyzing Tilman's competition
model on a finite grid, studying the asymptotic behavior of an evolutionary arms
race, and demonstrating the existence of chaotic oscillations in a simple
discrete time model of gypsy moth populations.

The basic question that drives this research is: when does the spatial
distribution of individuals change the behavior of a biological system? The
comparison is made to a homogeneously mixing system in which each individual
interacts equally with all the others. In the past five years the investigator
and his collaborators have developed some rules for predicting the answer to
this question and have applied them to a variety of biological systems. In the
next three years they will apply this theory to some new examples. One of the
most important questions they will study is: What are the limits to diversity?
They will address this question mathematically by investigating the number of
species that can coexist in a stochastic competition model. Other questions will
concern the fluctuations of the size of gypsy moth populations and the structure
of hybrid zones that result from spatially varying selection.
