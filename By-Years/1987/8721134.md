This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
experimental and theoretical research by Prof. Andrew Streitwieser, University
of California at Berkeley, aimed at analyzing the chemical structure and
reactivity of carbanions. Carbanions are negatively charged fragments of organic
molecules such as hydrocarbons and occur as transient intermediates during a
wide variety of chemical reactions in the laboratory, in the body, and in
industrial chemical processes. Thus, the chemical reactivity of carbanions may
be said to determine the path of many chemical changes. Dr. Streitwieser's
research will include measurements of kinetic acidities of weak carbon acids by
the study of hydrogen isotope exchange rates, including benzene in aqueous
sodium hydroxide and cyclic hydrocarbons with lithium and cesium cyclohexylamide
in cyclohexylamine. Equilibrium acidity studies will be continued, particularly
for dianions and for carbanions not stable in THF. Examples of the latter
include pentafluorobenzene and other halogenated hydrocarbons. Following
observations of low second pKa's for arylacetic acids, measurements of
concentration effects will be made to analyze effects of aggregation of both
mono- and di-salts. Theoretical work will focus on ab initio computations of
electronic structures and geometries of carbanions and their lithium and sodium
salts. Calculations will also be used to estimate the transition structures of
carbanion reactions, with particular emphasis on the previously noted systems,
and on metallated hydrazones, oximes, and imines whose important stereochemical
properties are not yet well understood.
