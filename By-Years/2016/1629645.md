This award will provide support for students to participate in one of the
primary workshops on accelerator science endorsed by the International Committee
for Future Accelerators, "The Physics and Applications of High Brightness Beams"
to be held in Havana, Cuba, on March 28 - April 1, 2016. The workshop will
maintain and further refine the previous central thrusts of the meeting: to
examine the state-of-the-art in high brightness beam physics and technology as
it is applied in advanced accelerators and light sources. The choice of the
location of the workshop indicates a continuing commitment to outreach to
include a wider range of participants, including scientists from developing
countries. The location of the workshop is also expected to help launch a new
initiative that seeks to introduce the beginnings of light source infrastructure
in the Caribbean basin. The workshop has obtained the endorsement of UNESCO and
a broad spectrum of participants from the United States, Cuba, Latin America,
Asia, and Europe is expected.

The award will be used to provide partial travel support for US students to
attend the workshop. The recipients of the travel support will be making
presentations at the workshop. Attendance of 18 US students will be facilitated
by the funds provided by this award. The workshop will be an excellent
opportunity for young scientists to interact with more experienced researchers
and their colleagues in the broader international scientific community. This
award is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of
International Science and Engineering.
