This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of mass spectrometric studies of gas phase metal ion molecule
chemistry. Professor Ben S. Freiser will study new methods for the production
and characterization of the reactions taking place between metal ions and
organic molecules in the gas phase, using Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometry. The results of these studies will advance the means
to describe the relationship between the chemistry of small metal clusters
(groups of a few atoms) and organic species. This is of relevance to
photographic processes, catalysis, atmospheric chemistry and processing in
microelectronics. Continuation of previous work will include the development of
a new pulsed supersonic ion source for creation and studies of cluster ions of
particular stabilities. Studies of mixed metal dimers and trimers reacting with
simple hydrocarbons will be extended to more complicated cluster species as they
can be produced in the laser vaporization/supersonic expansion source.
Thermodynamic stabilities (i.e. so-called endothermic reactions thresholds) will
be determined for particular metal cluster-hydrocarbon reactions, for example
hydrogen abstraction, with the FTMS as the coincident detector of multiple
products. This latter feature is an important point in the study of these
reactions.
