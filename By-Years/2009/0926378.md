The motion of fluids with free surfaces occurs in many problems in engineering
and science; the mathematical theory of such flows is only partially developed,
however. While smooth flows for short times have recently become fairly well
understood, there is little theory developed for other situations. This project
explores models for interfacial Navier-Stokes flows after the onset of
topological transitions, global existence of small solutions for vortex sheets,
and the mathematical theory of non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flow, among other
problems.

There are many possible applications of the theory of free-surface flows in
fluid dynamics in science and engineering, such as the drilling and cementing of
oil wells, understanding blood flow, or understanding the mixing of fluids in
the atmosphere and ocean, as well as problems in microfluidics. In general
terms, the proposed research will improve the understanding of wave breaking,
fluid mixing, turbulence, and stability of such flows. The investigator will
utilize techniques of both mathematical analysis and scientific computing, using
insight gained from each approach to more efficiently and more effectively use
the other.
