Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant that is emerging as a model for understanding
plant genetics, development and physiology at the molecular level. It has many
characteristics that make it more amenable to molecular inquiry than are other
flowering plants and yet because it is a flowering plant, has many homologous
DNA sequences and genes which can be used to both isolate and understand gene
action in plants with less accessible genomes. The laboratory headed by Dr.
Gerald Fink has been in the forefront of those using Arabidopsis to ask
questions which have been unanswerable in previous work with plants. The
biosynthetic pathway for aromatic amino acids is under study and that study has
already provided information suggesting that differences exist between the
pathway in animals and plants. Continuation of this work requires more
appropriate facilities for growing plants under controlled conditions. The
greenhouse, which will be built on the roof of the Whitehead Biomedical
Institute, will allow the continuation and expansion of research using plants as
experimental organisms by scientists in Dr. Fink's laboratory as well as others
at the Institute.***//
