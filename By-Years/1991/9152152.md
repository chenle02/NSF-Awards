An introductory astronomy course for non-science majors, previously a lecture
and demonstration course, is being upgraded to include a strong laboratory
component. Observations, both qualitative and quantitative play a major role in
the new laboratory. Small telescopes make the observational component of this
new course possible. A variety of observing projects are generating an
appreciation of natural phenomena unobtainable from lectures alone, and also
giving students the experience of obtaining, reducing, and explaining
experimental data.
