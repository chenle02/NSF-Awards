Although crinoid ossicles (skeletal plates) are common components of many
ancient limestones and shales, they have received relatively little attention
from the standpoint of taphonomy. With the recent documentation of crinoid
ossicles in Recent sea floor sediment, the opportunity now exists to pursue
actualistic studies of the taphonomy of individual plates. The main emphasis of
the study lies in the area of plate degradation: objectives are to determine
relative resistance to abrasion and dissolution, to examine the distribution of
these taphonomic processes and others in the study area, and to set some
constraints on the rates of these processes. With respect to transport,
objectives are to determine the sites of accumulation of transported ossicles,
and to see if ossicles travel as bedload. The primary objectives with regard to
diagenesis are to determine if ossicles are "prefossilized" by sediment
infilling or early diagenesis and to determine if biostratinomic signatures are
still recognizable in ossicles recovered from Pleistocene reef rocks. Sediment
samples taken from the upper 2-3 cm of the sediment and from 1-2 meter cores
will be used to map the distribution of plates and their degree and type of
alteration. Laboratory experiments of abrasion and dissolution and implants on
the sea floor will aid in defining processes and constraining rates of
degradation. Because the vast majority of fossil crinoid material consists of
disarticulated skeletons, this approach will help to make a large volume of
fossil material more useful to other scientists, assisting geologists from
sedimentologists to crinoid specialists.
