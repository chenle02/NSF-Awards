The entomological collections of the American Museum of Natural History form
one of the world's greatest resources for studying the diversity and evolution
of arthropods, a group that includes the majority of known species of animals on
earth. Over 16 million specimens document the variety of insects and arachnids
found throughout the world, making the collection one of the four largest in
existence. The tremendous growth (c. 800%) of the collection over the past 40
years has stretched to the limit the physical space available for storing it. By
installing a compactor system (in conjunction with the Museum's renovation of
the collection's main storage area), this award will allow a doubling of the
number of cases of insects that can be safely stored and accessed. The compactor
system selected will allow the collection to mount its existing storage cases
directly on the movable carriages, preserving their airtight protection against
collection pests. Positions for one preparator and two assistants, as well as
funding for visiting specialists, will make available for scientific study, for
the first time, large quantities of specimens from all geographic regions,
particularly of groups of noctuoid moths and true bugs (Heteroptera and
Homoptera) that contain economically important agricultural pests.
