The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Cincinnati has
initiated a major effort to increase its research in molecular biology. The
department has been awarded an academic challenge grant from the state of Ohio
to hire new faculty members in the areas of plant molecular biology, molecular
evolution and molecular parasitology. A fourth new faculty member in molecular
genetics is funded by the University of Cincinnati. Three of these faculty
members are now at the University of Cincinnati initiating their research
projects. The objective of this proposal is to set up a departmental facility
for DNA synthesis, sequencing and analysis to enhance the research of the new
faculty and to introduce DNA sequencing and analysis to graduate students and
faculty who have not previously used these techniques. The requested funds will
enable the department to acquire an oligonucleotide synthesizer, ultracentrifuge
rotors and a computer system for DNA sequence analysis. The University of
Cincinnati will provide funding for DNA sequencing gel apparatuses, power
supplies and other small equipment for DNA sequencing as well as a technician to
operate and maintain the equipment. This facility will allow all members of the
department access to current DNA sequencing technology.
