In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Lester Andrews of the University of Virginia will
investigate the matrix isolation spectroscopy of some exotic chemical species.
Systems to be examined in this work include metal atom complexes having pi-
electron systems, metal complexes with carboranes, transition metal hydride or
dihydrogen complexes, transition metal complexes involving carbon monoxide and
molecular hydrogen as model Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, aluminum atom reactions
with small molecules, and heavy Group VA and VIA atom chemistry. A pulsed-laser
evaporation method will be used in many of these experiments to form the metal
complexes, while microwave discharges will be used to make metal clusters.
Infrared and electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy are among
the experimental tools to be used. %%% Professor Andrews uses the technique of
matrix isolation spectroscopy to study the structure of molecules which are so
unstable that they normally are not observed under ordinary laboratory
conditions. In this technique, the species of interest are generated and then
quickly trapped at very low temperatures in frozen rare gas matrices. Included
among species studied are the intermediates formed in chemical reactions,
weakly-bound molecules, or highly reactive forms. Such molecules are difficult
or impossible to characterize by other experimental techniques.
