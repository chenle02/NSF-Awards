This project will explore the relationship between the bacterial cell cycle and
DNA methylation-dependent, heritable gene regulation in the bacterium
Escherichia coli. The model system will be the outer membrane protein Ag43,
which is under heritable but reversible control, also called phase variation.
Previous work from the principal investigator's laboratory has shown that the
heritable nature of Ag43 regulation is a direct result of inheritance of the DNA
methylation state at its regulatory region, and thus can be defined as
epigenetic regulation. The limited number of regulatory factors involved and the
ability to genetically manipulate the system make this an excellent model
system. This project addresses how the DNA methylation state is maintained
during DNA replication, which results in synthesis of unmethylated DNA and
disrupts protein-nucleo complexes. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to
identify how DNA-protein interactions at hemi-methylated DNA contribute to the
inheritance of the DNA methylation state, and to determine whether passage of
the DNA replication fork is required for a switch from the unmethylated to
methylated state. Protein-DNA interactions will be analyzed in vitro and phase
variation examined in mutant isolates. Ag43 expression can enhance biofilm
formation, and understanding the behavior of these communities of bacteria is of
significance for microbial ecology, pathogenesis and biotechnology. This project
therefore may contribute to the development of novel antimicrobial strategies
and identification of new drug targets. By providing new insight into the
complex networks that coordinate cellular events, this project may also benefit
studies in eukaryotic cells in which epigenetic regulation is an important
factor for cell development. This project provides excellent training
opportunities at all levels of expertise. Undergraduate projects can be
developed, but the theoretical and technical complexities will also challenge
postdoctoral fellows.
