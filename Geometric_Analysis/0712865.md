This project co-sponsors a conference titled ``An international conference on
Geometry and Analysis on Manifolds", which will take place from April 8, 2007 to
April 14, 2007 at the Chern Institute of Mathematics in Tianjin, China. Its
scientific focus will be the current and future development of geometry and
analysis on manifolds, especially those related to the Atiyah-Singer index
theory. Key topics include Aityah-Singer index theorems, Witten deformation,
hypoelliptic Laplacian, geometric invariants, twisted K-theory, geometry and
topology of gerbes, symplectic geometry, spin geometry and application of Dirac
operators. The conference will also honor Jean-Michel Bismut, one of the leading
researchers in the field.

The purpose of the conference will be threefold. First, to highlight the recent
major developments in geometry and analysis on manifolds, such as Bismut's
hypoelliptic Laplacian and Donaldson's work; secondly, to bring together leading
experts in the field and survey the recent remarkable progress and point to new
directions; third, to nurture and encourage young researchers and advanced
graduate students by providing them with an opportunity to have direct contact
with the leading researchers and with each other, and foster good opportunities
for future collaboration.
