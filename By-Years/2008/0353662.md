This award from the Chemistry Education Program supports the continuation of a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).
Shenda Baker is the site's Program Director. Eight HMC faculty will serve as REU
student mentors. Eight students will be supported for a ten-weak research
program. Additional students will be supported by institutional funds and
faculty research grants. The REU site at Harvey Mudd focuses on recruiting
female undergraduate students interested in careers in chemistry. The research
projects offered are in the areas of analytical, biological, inorganic, organic,
physical, and theoretical chemistry. Summer research activities will be
supplemented with workshops on careers in chemistry and scientific ethics,
seminars, and a plant tour to an operating chemical facility. Program assessment
will include tracking the students' major upon graduation, publications, career
path and eventual degree obtained. An anonymous program evaluation form will
also be used to provide feedback on ways to improve the students' summer
research experience. This REU site also provides extensive training in technical
communication to both scientists and non-scientists.
