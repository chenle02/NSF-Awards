Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics wherein a ray much like a
pencil beam of light is followed from its source and is allowed to reflect from
the various surfaces of the room until it is gathered in the eye of the viewer.
This calculation technique (actually reversed in an actual program) allows for
the accurate recreation of startling computer images. This research uses a
similar technique to generate a computer code for the ray tracing of sound rays
in a room. The rays would be allowed to interact with the surfaces of the room
and be reflected or absorbed according to the treatment on each surface. The
rays would then be gathered at a receiver location. Both the amplitude and
direction of the rays, as well as the time of arrival, would be retained for
future processing. The reproduction of sound using an array of speakers located
around the observer would be simulated. A small number of speakers is
anticipated, totalling approximately seven in number. Experiments will be
carried out to confirm that this number is sufficient to localize sound sources
at arbitrary angles within the space. The program will lead to the possibility
of using digital signal processing to recreate the sound field of a space by
playing a signal convolved with the room analysis through the speaker array.
