This award will provide travel support for approximately ten graduate students
to attend the USENIX First Symposium on Networked systems Design and
Implementations (NSDI 04), and Third USENXI Conference on File and Storage
Technologies (FAST 04) to be held March 29-30, 2004 in San Francisco, CA. NSDI
and FAST are important technical forums for high-quality research in networked
and storage systems. The collaborative support of these two events will
contribute to initiate, develop, and foster relationships between the two
research communities. For students it is an opportunity to meet and discuss
their research with some of the most notable researchers in these fields.
