Dr. Goldberg is continuing his research toward a biography of General Leslie R.
Groves, Commanding General of the Manhattan Engineer District. The fact that no
scholarly biography of Groves has been written would be reason enough to justify
this project. In almost all treatments of Groves, he appears full blown and
unexplained in September 1942 in the office of OSRD Director Vannevar Bush. Dr.
Goldberg's study provides a context for understanding who Leslie R. Groves was,
why he was picked to head the atom bomb project and why he was so effective. In
addition, this study is a vehicle for analyzing anew the changing relationship
between the miliary and civilian sectors of the American scientific and
technological research communities during and immediately after World War II.
This grant allows the completion of the archival research for this project.
