This research will investigate the dynamics of storage systems, such as street
networks, supply chains and transit lines. It will develop centralized and
decentralized management methods that can prevent instabilities without
undermining system performance. The work will focus on two difficult but related
problems: (a) managing the morning commuting period in a congested city, and (b)
stabilizing freight networks driven by inventory considerations. For the morning
commute problem, centralized policies for congestion management such as tolls,
taxation and land-use regulations will be designed and evaluated. For the
freight network problem, decentralized inventory management policies will be
developed that can eliminate the so-called "bullwhip effect" and approximately
minimize cost. The research is important because it will help reduce the
societal costs of congestion, and will show how to streamline supply chains and
other storage networks. It will also show how generic tools can be developed for
the control of these kinds of systems, which could encourage additional
applications.
