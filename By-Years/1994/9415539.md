9415539 Detrick This funding is for the 4th RIDGE Theoretical Institute titled
"Mechanisms of faulting and magma emplacement at mid-ocean ridges." This
institute will be organized by Roger Buck, Paul Delaney, and Jeff Karson and
will focus on how brittle lithosphere deforms at a spreading center due both to
faulting the intrusion of magma. The Short course and workshop will bring
together land geologists and theorests who have worked on problems of faulting
and magmatism in volcanic rifts with scientists who study the structure and
morphology of mid-ocean ridges. ***
