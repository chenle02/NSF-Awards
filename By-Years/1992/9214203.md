This project makes use of a soft x-ray monochromator and a time-of- flight
electron spectrometer in combination with an ultra fast laser-produced plasma
x-ray source to create a novel facility for x-ray studies with sub-picosecond
time resolution. This setup will be the first of its kind, and will be used to
study dynamic processes in materials using time-resolved x-ray techniques. It
will also be possible to study the physics of x-ray emissions from sub-
picosecond laser-produced plasmas at higher spectral and temporal resolution
than was previously possible. Specifically, a high-intensity femtosecond laser
system is used to create an ultra fast x-ray source. This is done by focusing
the laser pulses onto a solid target to repetitively create a hot, dense plasma.
The plasma emits an incoherent burst of x-rays with time duration less than one
picosecond. A collecting optic will focus a portion of these x-rays into an
imaging soft x-ray monochromator, which will both image and energy select the
x-rays, creating an output beam with an energy width of about one tenth of an
electron volt. The x-ray beam is used for pump-probe studies of ultra fast
processes. A visible wavelength pump pulse will excite a solid surface, with the
x-ray pulse used as a probe.
