A technique has been identified that will enable ultra high-density electronic
packaging connectivity: chip to package; package to socket; and board to board
(connector). Named "AC coupled interconnect", this approach has the potential to
enable a massive increase in the functional density of connections across all
layers of electronic packaging and permit pin counts to continue scaling. This
technique will allow microprocessor chips to have thousands of pins, instead of
the hundreds enabled today. It will allow connectors and sockets to also support
thousands of pins. This will lead to faster computers, networking systems, etc.

The central thesis is this effort hinges on the recognition that the DC
component of a digital signal carries no information, and that non-contacting AC
connections can be built a lot denser and simpler than DC connections. An array
of non-contacting structures is inherently denser, more compliant and more
mechanically robust than an array of contacting structures. By imposing direct
contacts only where DC current transfers are needed, this approach will allow
very high density interconnects to be realized and alleviate the compliance and
rework problems encountered in other high density interconnect technologies. The
AC connections can be inductive, capacitive, or a combination of the two.
