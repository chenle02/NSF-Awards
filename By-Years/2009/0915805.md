The project integrates graduate research activities in hybrid, accelerated
computing applications with undergraduate computer and computational science
curricula, preparing undergraduates for graduate school and industry professions
with application development experience in technologies essential to emerging
high-performance computing and peta-scale systems. Curriculum enhancements
across multiple computer science and engineering courses are investigated using
real research activities to identify specific improvements needed at the
undergraduate level. The research focuses on the use of leading accelerator
technologies (multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs) in real scientific computing
challenges and translating the insights, concepts, and examples for use in
undergraduate computer science and engineering instruction. The significance of
pairing research investigations with curricular development affords the
opportunity to bring real experiences into the undergraduate classroom. Research
level investigations will help to characterize the unique inter-dependency of
computer architectures and high-performance applications. The resources,
strategies and examples created in this project are available to undergraduate
programs across the country that wish to provide instruction on the next
generation hardware and software environments. The project also reaches several
underrepresented populations through outreach efforts at local high schools,
regional HBCUs, and leverages existing REU programs.
