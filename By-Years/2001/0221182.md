Award is for a project to analyze multichannel seismic data acquired in the
offshore Cantebury Basin, on the eastern margin of the South Island of New
Zealand. Interpretation and mapping of the high resolution multichannel seismic
profiles and integration with existing commercial and deep-penetration academic
multichannel seismic profiles will allow evaluation of the relative roles of
eustacy, tectonics, sediment supply and currents on stratigraphic development.
The Cantebury Basin comprises a southern hemisphere counterpart to the New
Jersey margin: both representing siliciclastic margins. The analysis will define
the 3-D sequence geometries to reveal spatial and temporal changes in sequence
geometry, and evaluate the relative importance of local versus global controls
by using forward stratigraphic modeling to reproduce observed
geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
