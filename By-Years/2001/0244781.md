This proposal provides travel support to allow approximately 37 graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty from the U.S. to attend the Enrico Fermi
Summer School on Physics Education Research in Varenna, Italy in July 2003. The
conference will focus on current forefront research in physics education and
will provide the American community with a unique opportunity to interact both
with the international community of physics education researchers and with each
other. A distinguished committee of senior physicists, education specialists,
and education researchers will review applications and select grantees. Each
travel grant will cover the costs of travel, registration, room, board, and a
copy of the proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;
