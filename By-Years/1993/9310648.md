An REG award will support the acquisition of a surface force microscope of an
advanced design and with a laser spectroscopy system attached. The equipment
will be used to study the fundamental nature of boundary lubrication films by
making simultaneous measurements of the rheology of ultra-thin fluid films
confined between two flat surfaces and the behavior of the molecules at the
surface, such as their orientation, relaxation and mobility.
