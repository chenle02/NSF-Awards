While political scientists have studied citizens' reactions to political
disagreement in their social networks, there have been only a handful of
attempts to empirically investigate how citizens react to public political
disagreements. This research uses a nationally representative Web survey over
1000 citizens, to examine how citizens' reactions to political disagreement
affect voter turnout and political participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project tackles a question of central importance in the study of democracy and
the implications of an informed citizenry. This research will expand and deepen
our understanding of how citizens experience political engagement.
