This award provides support for the operation of the ion microprobe regional
facility in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The facility provides analytical support for a
large number of projects in the geosciences that require microanalysis of trace
element and isotope abundances with excellent spatial resolution down to 10
microns. The facility is accessible to the national community of geoscientists
outside WHOI for a minimum of 50% of its operating time.
