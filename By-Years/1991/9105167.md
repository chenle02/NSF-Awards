Within Coreopsis section Coreopsis (Asteraceae) both gradual and saltational
modes of speciation are represented. Chloroplast DNA from both sets of diverging
taxa will be digested with ten restriction enzymes, and the corresponding
filters will be probed with eight cloned chloroplast DNA fragments. The
diversity found within the three gradually diverging diploid morphological
varieties of C. grandiflora will be used to determine whether divergence is
occurring between the taxonomic varieties or between the two major,
discontinuous geographical portions of its range. The presumed saltational
speciation event involving C. nuecensoides and its derivative C. nuecensis will
be examined to determine whether the relative amounts of chloroplast DNA
diversity within the species correspond with a saltational event, and if so, how
severe the accompanying population bottleneck may have been. A preliminary
survey of cpDNA diversity has revealed considerable interspecific,
interpopulational, and intrapopulational variation. The results of this study
will give important insights into the genetic processes involved in two modes of
speciation, and will demonstrate the usefulness of cpDNA for diversity analyses
below the species level.
