9506767 BOYD This research is to digitally scan seismic phase observations
tabulated in the International Seismological Summary (ISS) and Bureau Central
International Seismologique (BCIS) catalogs, use these observations to compute
high quality hypocenters based on techniques developed within the last few
years, make tectonic interpretations based on these relocated earthquakes, and
make the digitized phase observations and the recomputed hypocenters available
to interested research groups. The result will be a much more complete and
accurate seismicity catalog, especially prior to 1964 when the WWSSN program was
implemented, that can be used to understand deformation and seismic hazard
within the U.S. and throughout the world. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
