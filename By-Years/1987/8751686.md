A partnership of school, university, and industry people will carry out a
multipronged program to demonstrate how elementary science education can be
strengthened through a well designed cooperative effort. Elements of the program
are: A Science Resource Network of industrial scientists will be created to
support elementary teachers in a variety of ways. Elementary teacher Science
Specialists will work with each school to demonstrate the various models for use
of this kind of teaching approach. Science-weak elementary teachers will be able
to volunteer as Science Fellows for special training programs to overcome those
weaknesses. Permanent Elementary Sciences Alliances of elementary teachers,
other school and industry people, and university professors will be formed to
provide a reinforcing mechanism for the elementary teachers. A program of
Incentives and Awards will be established to recognize exemplary elementary
science teaching. The partnership will undertake appropriate Science Education
Advocacy activities. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how a
comprehensive community supported program can lead to major improvements in
elementary science teaching. Cost sharing by the partners will total a minimum
of 23 % of the NSF funding.
