It is proposed to use coherent-state techniques as applied to functional
integrals to study problems in five areas: (1) path integral foundations; (2)
geometric formulation of quantization; (3) uniform approximation for
propagators; (4) evaluation of many-dimensional averages; (5) non-renormalizable
quantum field theory.
