This work will determine the age and provenance of glacially derived marine
sediments from the coastal regions of Wilkes Land, Antarctica. These deposits
may offer insight into the history of the East Antarctic Shield (EAS), which is
amongst the oldest sections of continental crust on Earth, but cannot be studied
directly because of nearly complete ice sheet coverage. The study will use
Australian National University's SHRIMP ion microprobe to date zircon and
monazite found in the sediments. Samples of interest include polymictic pebble
and cobble clasts obtained from dredge hauls of tills, as well as sand-matrix
fractions from cores of glacial diamicts on the continental margin. Individual
clasts of igneous and metamorphic rocks from tills will be selected for zircon
and/or monazite age dating, whereas detrital zircons from stratified and non-
stratified diamictons will be analyzed for composite zircon provenance analysis.
In addition, detrital zircon ages will be determined for Beacon Supergroup
sandstones to evaluate recycling of zircon in Phanerozoic basins. Integration of
ages obtained from both sources will provide a good representation of the EAS
terrains underlying the Wilkes Land ice sheet. This project will allow us to
learn more about the remote continental interior and improve our ability to
interpret past ice-flow patterns without further environmental impact on
Antarctica. The results will improve our understanding of Precambrian tectonics
and crustal evolution, and help target future over-ice geophysical surveys and
basement drilling projects currently under consideration. In terms of broader
impacts, the project will provide educational and training opportunities for
undergraduate students in Earth science.
