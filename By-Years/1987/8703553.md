Narrative: A procedure has been developed for quick optimization of rapidly
metabolizing yeast grown in continuous culture. This optimization strategy has
been shown to be useful in developing an economically favorable ethanol process
based on the principle of aerobic pathway saturation. This project will apply
the optimization procedure to the culturing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The
dynamics for the adaptation and selection process will be observed as conditions
for optimal aerobic ethanol productivity are extablished under potassium ion
limitation.
