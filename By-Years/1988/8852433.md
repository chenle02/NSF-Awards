This project incorporates computers into the undergraduate physics and pre-
engineering laboratories. Students use the computers for data acquisition as
well as for analysis and presentation of the data. Experiments have been
modified from those previously available for manual data acquisition to use the
computer in the data acquisition process. A concentrated orientation to the
software and the use of the computers for experimental work helps students to
use the laboratory more effectively. The grantee provides funds for this project
that are an equal match for the NSF award.
