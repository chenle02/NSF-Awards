This award provides funding to The New England Aquarium (NEAq), Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and the University of Massachusetts (UMass)
for development of a New England Regional Center for Ocean Science Education
Excellence (NER-COSEE). This center will focus on capacity building in the New
England region by: 1) providing educators (teachers and other formal and
informal educators) with multiple tools to create programs and curricula that
convey knowledge of the oceans, and 2) providing research scientists and
scholars the means and training to be more effectively involved in K-12
education and undergraduate formal and informal education. All three partners
are highly visible centers of public education, outreach and ocean science
research and work with a wide network of educators from public, private and
informal education centers. In addition, U.Mass has an extensive track record in
educating under-served students and has a strong teacher-training program.
Activities will include working with informal educators throughout the region
via workshops and by providing a pool of resources for prototyping and
evaluation; working with researchers to help them learn to communicate
effectively with teachers, informal educators, students, and journalists, and
providing them with a network by which they may collaborate with educators and
the media; working with K-12 educators to develop innovative curriculum modules
that teach national and state science standards using ocean science, and to
assist in the development of networks and programs that recruit and train more
qualified K-12 science teachers. The NER-COSEE will initially work with the
Global Learning Center School/New Bedford Public School and Harbor School in
Boston to pilot test and evaluate programs. They will also create a Resource
Center, housed in the NEAq's Education Center that will make resources available
for broad distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
