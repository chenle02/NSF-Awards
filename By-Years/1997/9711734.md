Abstract EEC-9711734 Carnegie Mellon University Mark Kryder, PI and Robert E.
Jones and Rodger B. Dannenberg, Co-PI This award provides funding to the
Engineering Research Center at Carnegie Mellon University entitled "Data Storage
Systems Center" to develop a CD-ROM tutorial on the design of data storage
systems. This tutorial will be an interactive, multimedia course on the
fundamentals of magnetic and optical recording system design. The tutorial will
present an interdisciplinary, broad-based approach to data storage technology.
Material will be integrated in the tutorial from the chemical engineering,
computer science, electrical and computer engineering, materials science,
mechanical engineering, and physics disciplines. The course will be designed in
modules that will cover magnetic recording background, magnetic recording
process, magnetic recording media, magnetic recording heads, head-media
interface, magnetic recording electronic subsystems, optical recording
background, optical recording systems, optical recording media, optical
recording heads, optical recording electronic subsystems, and computer systems.
This material will be appropriate for senior level undergraduate or early-year
graduate students.
