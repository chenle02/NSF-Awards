This award will support U.S. participants in a multilateral workshop on the
representation theory of algebraic groups, to be held in Santiago and
Valparaiso, Chile from July 24 to August 6, 1993. The workshop, which is being
organized by Dr. Philip Kutzko, University of Iowa and Drs. J. Soto-Andrade,
University of Chile and J.R. Baeza, University of Valparaiso, involves many
different fields of mathematics and is of great interest, both for its
connections with number theory via the Langlands program and for its relevance
to general representation theoretic investigations of topological groups. The
lectures delivered in this workshop will be edited into a comprehensive basic
graduate text, which will provide an overview of concepts and techniques of the
field. The representation theory is an area which has attracted considerable
attention in recent years. This workshop will provide a forum for the exchange
of recent research among mathematicians from several nations working in this
very important area. It will also serve to encourage further research
collaboration between Chilean and U.S. mathematicians.
