9307484 Clark Ongoing advances in computational physics will be exploited to
characterize and predict the behavior of strongly coupled quantum many-particle
systems under realistic conditions of density and interaction strengths. Two
complementary microscopic approaches will be pursued: one is based on explicit
descriptions of the correlation structure of the quantum system in space and
spin degrees of freedom; the other focuses on the modification in intrinsic
properties and interactions experienced by a particle emerged in a many-particle
medium. These powerful computational methods give access to a wide range of
systems and phenomena of fundamental interest, including the superfluids and
superconductors that exist at superhigh temperatures inside pulsars; the
superfluid phase transition in liquid helium near sero temperature; lattice-
gauge models that offer insights into the nature of the vacuum and the mechanism
of quark confinement; short-distance processes in nuclei and the link between
nucleonic theories and quantum chromodynamics; and the rich panorama of excited
states of nuclei and strongly coupled electronic systems. Projected research on
these problems will provide theoretical support for existing or planned
experimental efforts, including projects at CEBAF and observations of neutron
stars by orbiting X-ray observatories. In a novel interdisciplinary initiative,
neural network computational structures will be used for phenomenological
analysis of nuclei and of materials of potential technological importance. ! ! A
