Cellular adaptation to high salinity by plant cells can be reversible,
indicating that the regulated expression of specific genes is controlling this
adaptation. The osmotin gene is one of the most thoroughly studied genes that
have altered expression during exposure of adaptation to NaCl. The overall
objective of this research is to better characterize the structure and function
of the osmotin gene. Gene transfer studies will be used to determine the
specific physiological role of osmotin in adaptation to NaCl. Molecular
techniques will also be used to examine the regulatory structure of the osmotin
gene to determine the mechanisms that control its expression under natural
conditions. Specifically, cis-acting DNA sequences and a transacting factor will
be examined. Salinity stress is an important constraint on agricultural
production, particularly in irrigated systems. The long term goal of this
research is to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the process of
cellular adaptation to salt by examining specific genes expressed during
adaptation. Understanding of the regulatory properties of such genes will
eventually lead to understanding how to manipulate salt tolerance in plants,
including important crop species.
