Unlike syntax and semantics, design is not an aspect of artificial languages
that has been amenable to formalization, although it is an obvious candidate for
such work. Most studies of the design of formal languages have been extremely
informal, and could not be used to develop tools for a language designer. Even
the more sophisticated, semantics based, studies while insightful, treat the
process of design nebulously. In many situations, ranging from summarizing
natural language database responses, to formalizing question and answer systems
a universe is given and the challenge is to find a way to communicate
information about aspects of the universe in an appropriate language. In
previous research they have developed a formalization of language design in
which designs are expressible in steps. In this work the PI will investigate
several crucial issues in the mathematics of the system of design they have
developed, and will continue an implementation of the language for design.
