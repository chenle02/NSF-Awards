The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a
better understanding of the online world. Specifically, it enables potential
commercial applications in market sectors across countries and languages. The
technology is built entirely from publicly accessible information, without the
need for any individual information. The potential applications include
companies requiring a better understanding of the existing user/fan base and
opponents of its particular products, marketing companies looking to better
understand market sectors, companies in healthcare looking to understand
attitudes toward treatments, and corporations interested in assessing global
risk. The technology goes well beyond current practices and techniques in social
listening and surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project connects and
combines ideas on many-body behaviors in the online world, together with
advances in the science of networks of networks. The combination of these allows
the core technology to provide a window into online crowd behaviors across
multiple platforms and languages. The technology features an automated process
of collecting together the online cluster information and then describing and
forecasting its development. In this sense, it is a form of physics-inspired
artificial intelligence. Instead of collections of particles, the system now
comprises collections of heterogeneous online users. The focus is entirely on
the overall ecology, in order to get at potential tipping points and shifts in
market sentiment about a particular product, as well as the ebbs and flows in
support of a given product's competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
