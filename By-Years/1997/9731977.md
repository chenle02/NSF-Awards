This project concerns the problem of reconstructing a two- dimensional surface,
such as the outside of a real object, from a collection of sample points. The
problem is important for building models in computer graphics, and in other
areas of science and engineering. A new algorithm has been developed which is
provably correct and efficient, based on the Delaunay triangulation of the
samples. An innovative aspect of the algorithm is that the samples do not have
to be evenly distributed over the object - detailed areas can be sampled densely
and smooth areas can be sampled sparsely. The basic algorithm will be tested in
various applications, each requiring different extensions or modifications, and
the application of the theory to other problems in geometric modeling will be
studied.
