Amorphous silicon-carbide materials are proposed to be incorporated into
electroluminescent thin-film devices. These materials, due to their non-
conserved momentum transitions, offer high luminescence efficiencies, and
variable emission wavelengths, depending on the carbon content. At least two
deposition methods are to be used to compare two types of electroluminescent
structures. These methods are suitable for both insulator and amorphous silicon-
carbide layers, as well as for n and p-doped layers. Compared to conventional
large-area thin-film electroluminescent devices, the preparation can thus be
integrated into one technique, and hence significantly reduce cost. Potential
applications include liquid-crystal back- lighting, alphanumeric displays, x-y
addressable monochrome and multicolor displays, ultimately leading to flat-panel
color television.
