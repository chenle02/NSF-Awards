This project extends the capabilities of the engineering graphics laboratory.
The equipment for the project consists of two computer workstations equipped for
solid modeling and one computer aided modeling machine with software. This
equipment adds both rendering and protype making capabilities to existing
courses. This enhances the visualization process, provides "hands-on"
experience, and illustrates machine shop automation. The project impacts a
student body with a large percentage of minority and a historically high drop
out rate. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
