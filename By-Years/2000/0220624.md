Project Summary

Lamar University Computer Science-Mathematics Scholarship Program (CSEMS) serves
24 financially disadvantaged university students to assist them with their
financial and academic needs over their junior and senior years. A combination
of factors including a disproportionately large number of first-generation
college students coming from low-income households exacerbates the problems of
retention and graduation rates. Fully 62% of Lamar's first-time, full-time
entering freshmen are first-generation college students, and 81.3% of the
student body at Lamar University is eligible for financial aid.

In an effort to address the problem of low graduation rates among low-income
student populations in computer science and mathematics, Lamar's CSEMS
Scholarship program expects to increased rates of retention, graduation, and
entry into graduate/professional programs by providing essential services to
ameliorate academic, economic, and social barriers to the completion of a
college education.

In addition, Lamar has developed a management system and an evaluation process
that includes assessment of the project's progress in meeting its goals and
objectives, and to serve as a basis for future planning.
