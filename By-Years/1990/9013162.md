This research concerns optimality issues in maintenance strategies with general
degree of repair. The degree of repair is a decision variable. Optimal structure
of repair policies is to be characterized as well as employment of analytical
and numerical tools for efficient computation. Results from this research will
increase the knowledge base for maintaining models since it will permit greater
options in the selection of decision policies.
