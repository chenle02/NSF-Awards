9722861 Si This award supports participation of thirteen engineering students
in a summer research and education program between Arizona State University,
Tsinghua University, Beijing, and Motorola. The program will involve student
participation in engineering research projects within Motorola-China, with
supervision by Motorola engineers; research at Tsinghua on multi-media software
and on software design, and a comparison of Chinese and American educational
systems. Activities planned for this summer program are intended to develop as
cooperative projects enabling students to gain access to the expertise,
facilities, and unique environments of China in ways that are mutually
beneficial to the United States and China. Exposure to the Chinese education and
academic research systems, and to an overseas operation of a major US
multinational will provide important insights to the student participants,
promoting their ability to develop as competitive professional engineers and
engineering researchers. This project adds an international dimension to ECS
9553202, a Presidential Faculty Fellows award. Funding provided by NSF will be
matched by Motorola.
