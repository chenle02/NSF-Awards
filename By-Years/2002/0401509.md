This project is devoted to the understanding of several new algebraic structures
which are deformations of classical notions. The first aim is the description of
the new algebraic structures that have appeared in string topology and graphs.
Here, the solution is expected to be given in terms of dioperads using their
recently developed theory of Koszul duality. The second aim is the description
of the structure and representation theory of a new noncommutative algebra which
arises from quantization of Slodowy slices. Here, it is hoped that the methods
in the commutative case can be extended to the noncommutative situation. The
third aim is the construction of a conjectural deformed Harish-Chandra
homomorphism that gives a quantum Hamiltonian reduction description of the
spherical subalgebras of symplectic reflection algebras. Here, the idea is to
generalize the radial part construction of invariant differential operators and
the construction of Dunkl representations to the new situation.

Broader impacts: This project will hopefully build a common algebraic framework
for the discovery and study of operations in various branches of mathematics and
physics such as topology, graph theory, string theory, and quantum field theory.
It also hopes that working out some interesting concrete examples in
noncommutative algebra will shed light on the general theory that one can hope
to develop.
