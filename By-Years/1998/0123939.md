&lt;br/&gt; The convergence of telecommunications networks rely heavily on the
interconnection of networks and related Quality of Service (QoS). The Internet
is evolving into a multi-class service, integrated network, which is trying to
support various applications, which require QoS in addition to the traditional
best-effort applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposal is to
design, evaluate, develop and test new dynamic Quality of Service and bandwidth
management mechanisms and systems that allow secure and scalable dynamic open
provisioning for the interconnection of Differentiated services. The proposal
will develop a Bandwidth Management Point to manage scalable and secure control,
and performs the functions of service assignment, admission control, traffic
conditioning and class routing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bandwidth Management
Point will support intra-domain communications, which is useful for applications
within the same domain. It will also support inter-domain applications including
policy information such as reservation process, edge-to-edge admission control
and peer-to-peer access control. The deliverables include the design, analysis
and implementation of software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
