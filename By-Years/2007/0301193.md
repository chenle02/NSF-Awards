0301193&lt;br/&gt;Walden&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides shared-use instrumentation to
significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the research
vessels Atlantis, Knorr and Oceanus, three ships operated by WHOI as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
Specifically, this award will provide two sets of XBT hardware and software, a
150 kHz lowered ADCP transducer repair, large volume in-situ pump components and
upgrades, six 10-liter Niskin bottles, a single 300 kHz lowered ADCP, CTD
sensors (2 T, 2 C), 4 lowered ADCP battery cases, a dual 300 kHz lowered ADCP, a
salinometer, and a 24-position CTD Carousel pylon. These improvements will be of
substantial advantage to marine scientists using these three ships in their
research during 2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
