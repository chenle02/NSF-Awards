This proposal is for "Studies in Spectroscopy and Quantum Electronics" and
continues a productive and exciting program in laser cooling and trapping. The
studies of the cooling and trapping process are aimed at extending the technique
of Raman cooling combined with dipole trapping to reach sub- microkelvin
temperatures at high densities. The trapped atoms will be use to study atom/atom
collisions in the sub micro-Kelvin temperature range and atom/surface collisions
with atoms in the sub nano-kelvin temperature range. The cooled and trapped
atoms are also being used to study atom interferometry for precision time
measurements and for the construction of an atom interferometer for an ultra-
sensitive gravimeter. Finally, the techniques for manipulating atoms are being
extended to the manipulation of biological molecules to study the motion of
enzymes and to measure forces on biological molecules.
