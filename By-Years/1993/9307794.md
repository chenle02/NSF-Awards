9307794 Nayfeh Technical Narrative: This project represents a collaborative
research effort between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the
University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan. The project will focus on the preparation
and characterization of the newly discovered but not yet understood optical
activity of porous silicon using optical methods and scanning tunneling
microscopy. Apart from the scientific interest in the mechanism behind its
operation, there is interest in its potential applications in electronic
devices. Thus this newly discovered property of silicon, a cheap semiconductor,
may lead to the marriage of optical and electronic circuits. Project funding
will enable the research teams from both universities to visit one another over
the course of this three-year study. This project in materials research fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the United States and Jordan to combine complementary talents and
conduct research in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
