This project enables students to conduct independent research on Sandhill crane
courtship and mating displays in a naturalistic setting. This research
opportunity is unrivaled due to the natural concentration of upwards of 200,000
cranes in the immediate area every spring. Students conduct research on proximal
cues used by the cranes for pair formation by using event recorders and spotting
scopes in the field. Vocal behaviors are recorded on a Uher tape recorder using
a long distance microphone. Both types of data are then analyzed in the
laboratory on a computer by running specialized analysis software for time-
series event-recording data and for vocal data. In the course of this project,
students also develop an appreciation for the different types of questions
answerable by laboratory and field research.
