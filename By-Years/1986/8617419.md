In the past dozen years atmospheric scientists have determined that the
hydroxyl radical (OH) apparently plays a pivotal role in controlling the trace
chemical composition of the lower atmosphere (troposphere). Hydroxyl radicals (a
pair) are produced when an ozone molecule (O ) is decomposed by ultraviolet
light to form an 3 energetic oxygen atom which then reacts with a water
molecule. It is believed that the hydroxyl radical is the primary species
responsible for converting a number of water insoluble reduced chemical
compounds (e.g. methane, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,
ammonia and others) into condensable and/or water soluble oxidized species. It
is this oxidation by OH which permits these compounds to be cleansed from the
atmosphere by precipitation or the gradual settling of small solid and liquid
particles. Our understanding of the atmospheric photochemical oxidation process
has been developed primarily by laboratory and computer modeling studies. To
date it has not been possible to evaluate the completeness of the theory of
tropospheric photochemical cycles. To test this theory requires making direct
atmospheric measurements of OH and its relationships to the compounds believed
to be responsible for its creation and destruction. The detection of the
hydroxyl radical in the ambient atmosphere has been a primary objective of
atmospheric chemists for the past several years. The difficulty in measuring
this species results from its exceedingly low concentration in the atmosphere.
Theory predicts OH to be in concentrations one million to a hundred million
times smaller than ozone, its parent compound (which itself has a tropospheric
concentration of less than one part in ten million). The techniques presently
available for measuring OH are not sufficiently sensitive to make the necessary
measuremetns in the atmosphere to study the chemistry of this important species.
In this project an experimental determination of tropospheric boundary layer
hydroxyl radical concentrations using an active titration technique will be
attempted. The method involves release of a mixture of two classes of gases:
titrant gases which are _______ destroyed predominantly by reaction with OH on a
time scale of a day or two; and dispersant gases which are inert essentially and
used to __________ determine the dispersion rate of the mixture once it is
released into the atmosphere. The time rate of change of the ratio of the
titrant and dispersant gas concentrations can be related to the local OH
concentration. Several unsaturated halocarbons as titrants and certain saturated
halocarbons as dispersants will be measured and their concentrations measured
with an electron-capture gas chromatograph.
