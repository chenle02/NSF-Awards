The Principal Investigator and his collaborators study hyperbolic conservation
laws, a class of partial differential equations that covers many of the
fundamental equations in applied math, and in particular in fluid dynamics. The
main lines of current research are: (A) a systematic approach to the study of
one-dimensional systems of conservation laws based on geometric properties of
their eigen-frames; (B) employing vanishing viscosity approximations to obtain
interaction estimates for conservation laws in several space dimensions; (C)
radially symmetric solutions to systems of conservation laws, and in particular
solutions to the compressible Euler system.

All of the projects are motivated by the need to provide rigorous statements
about the properties of physical models that are used by scientists and
engineers. The results assess the range of validity of various physical models
and will be of use in delimiting and refining existing models. Particular
emphasis is put on understanding solutions of complex, nonlinear equations that
are used in simulations of e.g. high speed flight, traffic flow, combustion and
detonations.
