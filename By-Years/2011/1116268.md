Digital storage media failure is a common occurrence, but an understanding of
the mechanisms for the failure can be elusive and have far reaching
implications. This project utilizes a digital laser microscope to investigate
the impact of physical and environmental manipulation of digital storage media
on failure rates and data recoverability. This investigation into the physical
characteristics of digital media is establishing failure thresholds and their
suitability for data recovery. The results of the project are being stored in a
taxonomy of digital media failure characteristics, potential data recovery
techniques, and microscopic image maps of the media failures and interventions.
An additional aspect of the project is an extensive outreach component, which
includes the K-12 and community college environments. Further impacts of this
investigation include the ability to utilize physical media manipulation as a
security mechanism, as well as improve digital media reliability.
