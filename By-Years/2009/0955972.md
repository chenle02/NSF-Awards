A careful analysis of the reactivity of alkylidene carbenes and their precursors
formed from carbonyl compounds and lithium trimethylsilyldiazomethane has led to
the discovery of overlooked reactivity. Dr. Daesung Lee and coworkers at the
University of Illinois at Chicago aim at exploiting the selectivity profile of
alkylidene carbenes, developing new valuable synthetic methods that rely on this
selectivity trend, and gaining new mechanistic understanding of their reactions.
With the support from the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of
Chemistry, new CH2 homologation and ring expansion chemistry will be developed
with concomitant garnering of new information about the regioselectivity of C-C
bond migration. Unprecedented reactivity of alkylidene carbenes to develop new
method for allene synthesis will be investigated. The fundamental aspects of
regioselectivity of carbene insertion reaction will be studied. In addition, the
reactivity and selectivity of strained methylene cyclopropane systems generated
from alkylidene carbene precursors and their utility in cycloaddition reaction
will be explored. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The new understanding of reactivity of
certain reactive intermediates such as unsaturated carbene species and a good
control over their behavior would improve chemists' ability to develop more
effective synthetic methods to prepare compounds of complex structures
(including chemicals of medicinal use), thus ultimately improve human health and
have broad societal impacts. Furthermore, this research provides training for
students in fundamental and applied chemical synthesis and prepares them for
careers in either academia or industrial settings.
