This project will support a group of U.S. mathematicians under the leadership of
Professor H. Blaine Lawson, Jr., of SUNY at Stony Brook, to collaborate with a
group of Brazilian mathematicians headed by Professor M. do Carmo of the
Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), located in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. In general, these mathematicians intend to continue a very successful
research exchange that has grown over the past twenty years mainly in the fields
of Differential Geometry and Dynamical Systems. Funding will go to support
travel by six distinguished U.S. mathematicians to Brazil over the span of two
years, to work interactively on the following topics: minimal submanifolds,
isometric conversions, conformal geometry, Yang-Mills theory, Backlund
transformations, and other related topics. The past two decades have witnessed
the growth of the Brazilian School of Differential Geometry to become one of
major stature. Some of the best results of this school have been in the area of
submanifold theory; in several cases these results have led to collaborative
work with U.S. mathematicians where both sides have benefited. One need only
mention, among others, the fundamental pioneering work of Barbosa and do Carmo
on the structure of stable surfaces, and the complete classification of compact
conformally flat hypersurfaces in euclidean space achieved by members of the
Brazilian school (Dajczer, do Carmo, Mercuri). This project will bring together
a group of productive U.S. mathematicians who either already have established
collaborations with Brazilian mathematicians or whose work is likely to inspire
new activity to continue the direct exchange of ideas that is of vital
importance for mathematical research.
