A series of regional workshops is offered to help faculty develop improved
teaching skills in introductory earth science, earth science-related
interdisciplinary courses, and/or courses in science teacher preparation. The
goal is to encourage faculty to be intellectually vigorous in science courses,
to gain experience in effective teaching methods and educational technologies,
and to explore the beneficial outcomes of reform-based strategies for student
learning. Participating faculty will be provided with methods and materials that
will integrate the geosciences with other academic disciplines. Instructional
methods that will be demonstrated include problem-solving exercises; an issue-
based model in which the teacher plays the role of facilitator; integrated
learning environments that incorporate field work, experiential learning, and
technological access to data into more traditional classroom/laboratory
activities; development of communities of science learners by establishing
student teams and by building a greater regional or national community through
telecommunication access; and use of local and regional issues to demonstrate
relevance and to foster in students a sense of stewardship in their communities.
Participants will continue workshop activities as they develop strategic plans
for collaborative teams at their home institutions. Follow-up reports, including
evaluative assessment of plan outcomes, such as implementation strategies,
student learning achievement, and dissemination beyond the workshop, will
provide information useful to others interested in improving their educational
programs in introductory earth science, earth science-related courses, and
courses in (earth) science teacher preparation. This information will be
compiled into a database that will be accessible to the community through AGI's
Clearinghouse for Earth Science Education, including hard-copy and electronic
format.
