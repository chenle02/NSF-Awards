In the Rocky Mountain foreland, Precambrian basement rocks were deformed during
Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary time in ways which allowed the Phanerozoic
sedimentary cover rocks to be folded over them. The nature of the mechanical
behavior of the basement rocks which allowed them to accommodate the shape of
the cover has been a persistent and controversial problem. The objective of this
research is to examine several well-exposed basement-cored folds in order to
identify the mechanisms active during folding. Methods to be used include field
structural mapping, analysis of deformation features on several scales, and
measurement of strain. The results may help establish the relative importance of
the various geological factors which control the response of the basement rocks
to later deformation.
