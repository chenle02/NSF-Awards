The key to the commercial production of devices fabricated from superconducting
thin films with optimal and reproducible properties is the identification of a
process that has exact control of stoichiometry and morphology. This control can
only be achieved with a thorough understanding of the chemistry at the
superconductor-substrate interface which serves as the template for the growing
film. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the influence of
different substrates on the deposition of a volatile model barium source reagent
to give barium oxide. The predominate gas phase products will be identified,
correlated to the composition of the deposits and compared to results obtained
in homogeneous oxidative decomposition studies. Initial rate data will be
obtained and used to determine the kinetics of the decomposition.
