The plant vascular system is of critical importance for normal plant function,
yet the mechanisms that govern development of the intricate vascular patterns we
observe in nature are largely unknown. The process begins when narrow files of
cells are recruited from a field of cells in a pattern that predicts the final
vein pattern. These cells subsequently develop into the procambium, the tissue
that will ultimately produce the veins. The plant hormone auxin plays a pivotal
role in this process. Directional canals of auxin flow determine the paths of
recruitment of cells into the procambium. Polar localization of PIN auxin
transport proteins, to the plasma membrane on one side of the cells of the
developing procambium, results in these canals of auxin flow. The focus of this
project is on the role of the Sec14-related proteins, PATELLIN-1 and -2
(PATL1/2), in the formation of a continuous vascular pattern in the plant model
organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. Molecular genetic and imaging approaches will be
used to test the hypothesis that PATL1/2 act in a signaling pathway that
regulates PIN auxin transport protein localization in the developing vascular
system. Completion of the project will provide insight into the complex process
of vascular pattern formation. This enhanced understanding of vascular
development may prove useful in designing genetic modifications of plants used
for biofuels since the xylem of the veins makes up the bulk of plant biomass, a
valuable source of renewable energy. This project also stands to broaden
participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the biological
sciences; Wellesley College is a private liberal arts college for women with a
commitment to diversity. Undergraduates will be collaborators in all aspects of
the scientific process, an experience that will provide excellent preparation
for advanced training and which often translates into careers in science and
medicine.
