This is an award to provide support for preliminary research and planning
activities involved in determination of the feasibility of a process to remove
trichloroethylene from groundwater contaminated with this organic solvent. The
proposed process involves use of a reactor that incorporates a hollow fiber
membrane contactor for removal of the trichloroethylene from the contaminated
water, concentration of this contaminant in an aqueous phenol solution followed
by biotreatment in a suspended growth bioreactor. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted in accord with criteria contained in the Program
Announcement NSF 92-90, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards
for Women Scientists and Engineers. Results of this project are expected to
provide guidance necessary in development of a competitive proposal for conduct
of research that would lead to engineering design criteria for a process that
could be utilized in decontamination of groundwater.
