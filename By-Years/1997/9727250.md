This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from Princeton
University, studying how Tibetan women use traditional Tibetan medicine as a
means of cultural revitalization under conditions of state-directed Sinicized
modernization. Specifically, it explores the extent to which women associate use
of Tibetan medicine for reproductive and gynecological disorders with efforts to
ensure the survival of Tibetan culture in the face of Chinese hegemonic
practices. The work will focus on six months of data collection in the women's
ward of a health facility in Lhasa where the idioms used by women for discussing
biological, social, political and cultural discontent are drawn from traditional
Tibetan epistemologies concerning the body, the nature of suffering, and the
relation between ethics, biology, and cultural identity. The investigator will
interview patients and families about their diseases, treatments, and other
factors they consider relevant to their conditions. Physicians as well as
traditional healers will be interviewed and observed as they deal with patients.
The project will provide data on this relatively unknown area of women's health
in Tibet, will advance our understanding of the links between ethnic
revitalization and ethnomedicine in the important area of the world.
