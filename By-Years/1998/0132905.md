The focus of this research is to develop a general synthesis of chiral
oxazolines, which can be applied to the discovery of enantioselective olefin
epoxidation catalysts using molecular oxygen as a terminal oxidant. Further, a
general synthesis of chiral pyridine ligands for application to an asymmetric
allylic displacement will be sought. The educational focus of the project is to
incorporate, into the curriculum, the relationship of current applications in
synthetic organic chemistry to the fundamentals physical organic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER proposal, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and teaching efforts
of Dr. Matthew Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.
Professor Sigman will focus his work on developing new chiral ligands for
applications in asymmetric synthesis. The ligands will be assembled in a
systematic manner in order to allow for optimization and direct insight into
reaction mechanisms. This type of methodology development presents opportunities
for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Dr. Sigman's educational
activities will be focused on improving the organic chemistry curriculum.
