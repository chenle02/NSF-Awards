This Small Business Technology Transfer Innovation Research (STTR) Phase II
project proposes the development of a unique family of biocidal polymers that
have been shown to be non-leaching, and do not require regeneration or
refreshment of activity. The Phase I study demonstrated the synthesis of these
polymers containing potent broad-spectrum biocides. The polymers were spun into
nanofiber webs using electrospinning techniques. The webs were challenged with
bacteria and a 99% reduction in bacterial viability in one hour was
demonstrated. The Phase II program will continue to explore the electrospinning
processing of the polymers. The polymers will be optimized for activity against
bacteria, viruses and molds. Microscopic and mechanical tests will be performed
on materials to identify structure-property relationships.

The commercial application of this technology will be in textile products where
antimicrobial protection is critical, e.g., homeland security (biodefense)
garments, first responders emergency clothing, hospital garments and supplies,
etc. Current systems are water leachable and use can lead to reduced protection.
