In this project, Dr. Travis Williams and his team at the University of Southern
California are developing new bi-functional catalysts to speed up fuel
production. The new catalysts combine two capabilities that allow them to
operate at mild temperatures and with high efficiency. Specifically, the
catalysts pair a transition metal with a color-containing molecule, a Lewis
acid, or other species to produce high-value added chemical products. In
addition to these potentially commercializable efforts, Professor Travis is
involved in several educational outreach activities; These include acting as a
mentor for the student-hosted colloquia at USC and enabling the Boy Scouts to
visit a biodiesel refinery at Catalina Island. The biodiesel plan converts used
cooking oil obtained from a hard-to-manage waste streams to diesel fuel for
water desalination. The visits teach lessons of sustainability to hundreds of
young people every summer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical
Catalysis Program of NSF's Chemistry Division, Dr. Travis Williams at co-workers
at the University of Southern California are developing new catalysts in which
two modes of catalytic reactivity are combined in a single catalyst. The group
is extending concepts in cooperative catalysis to advance technologies that form
and cleave of carbon-hydrogen bonds. The project combines the concept of
quinoline photobasicity with very successful alcohol oxidation catalysts to
realize a first-of-class temporary, photo-activated base within a late-metal
(iridium) complex. This bifunctional catalyst enables catalytic reactions where
both an acid and base are needed in a single catalytic cycle. The project
further deploys a nickel catalyst for carbon dioxide-to-methanol conversions.
These initial efforts are then combined to generate a hybrid system in which
two-electron hydride transfers to the iridium catalyst are enabled by the
sequential one-electron redox events at the nickel catalyst. In addition to
these efforts, Dr. Williams supports an education programs involving a
demonstration biodiesel refinery at Catalina Island. This facility works with
neighboring youth summer camps to teach lessons of sustainability and waste
reclamation to hundreds of young people every summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
