The curriculum is being developed to present calculus as the language of
science. Beginning calculus is being treated as a laboratory course with modern
computers and scientific software as the laboratory equipment. This development
is built on a long history of successful use of computers in a calculus
laboratory and will make use of new software so that students have a serious
start on their education in scientific computation.
