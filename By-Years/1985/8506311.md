This project provides for equipment to support experimental research in chaotic
vibrations in mechanical systems. The equipment comprises a two-channel dynamic
signal processing spectrum analyzer, a laboratory computer, and support
equipment for these items. The research goals are to develop criteria for the
existence of chaotic vibrations and to develop experimental tools to quantify
the chaotic vibrations.
