Theoretically, molecular nanotechnology will mean the ability to build things
from the atom up, to rearrange matter with precision, and to control its very
structure. Nanotechnology promises enhanced living, and the transcendence of
myriad human physical and mental limitations. As self-replicating, super-
intelligent machines working within and beyond the human body, molecular
nanotechnology is likely to radically alter not just the physical, but the
social, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of human life. Therefore, now is
the time, in the theoretical stages of development, to begin to explore the
ethical implications of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
investigator seeks to understand the developing ethics of nanotechnology through
a narrative analysis of discourse inside of its development. The focus is on
engineers and scientists who are working in the field to answer the questions:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do scientists and engineers define as the ethical
issues connected to the development of nanotechnology? &lt;br/&gt;How, if at
all, do scientists and engineers imagine confronting or addressing those ethical
issues as they are defined? &lt;br/&gt;In what ways might religious perspectives
and personal beliefs be a factor in the ethical framework of developing
nanotechnology?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data are drawn from an array of
discourses, oral and written, in order to richly understand the ethics and
beliefs of the developers of nanotechnology, thus revealing its largely tacit,
newly forming moral/ethical frameworks. A textbook on nanotechnology ethics, and
eventually, educational film on the hopes and dreams of nanotechnology
investigators, are hoped to be offered as tangible outcomes of this project.
