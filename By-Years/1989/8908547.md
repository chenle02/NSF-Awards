This is an interdisciplinary project to study the chemical engineering aspects
of organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE). It involves an interdisciplinary
team of two chemical engineers and two materials scientists. The team has
selected a known but important system, the homo- and heteroepitaxial growth of
cadmium telluride onto cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide surfaces. There
are three aspects of the study: 1. Modeling of the deposited films as a function
of temperature, alkyl mixture, and flow in an impinging jet reactor with uniform
heat and mass transfer characteristics. 2. Study of the surface chemical
kinetics by thermogravimetric analysis to develop surface kinetic constants to
feed into the model developed in the first study. 3. Evaluation of the
electronic and structural quality of the films as they are formed under
different conditions, as identified with the help of the model. The great value
of this project is in the combination of well thought-out reactor geometry and
materials selections, with adequate tools for materials characterization,
together with a well-planned, fundamental approach to understanding and
controlling the physics and chemistry of the OMVPE process. Processes of this
type will play a central role in the development of future high-tech industries,
which richly justifies the investment necessary to understand these processes in
as full a manner as possible. This improved understanding will translate into
improved quality of products and into greater efficiencies in the industries
which employ them.
