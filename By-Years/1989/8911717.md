The primary theme of this mathematical research is that of analyzing integral
transforms of classical type in several new settings. They include transforms
generated by toeplitz kernels and their liftings to abstract domains. A central
feature of this analysis is the so-called generalized Bochner theorem which can
be viewed as a Fourier representation of generalized invariant kernels. The
integral representation feature is linked with the general theory of Krein and
Gelfand on eigenfunction expansions, while the lifting property is related to
the Nagy- Foias dilation theory. While the Nagy-Foias theory provides a powerful
approach to the spectral theory of dissipative operators, clarifying the notions
of scattering and characteristic functions, and includes interpolation theory,
it is only remotely connected to the theories of Bochner and Krein. The purpose
of this work is to explore the deeper connections between the different aspects
of the Bochner theorem to understand the relations between the above-mentioned
theories. In particular, work will be done in determining whether the Nagy-Foias
commutant lifting is related to bound mean oscillation and prediction theory. In
addition to direct application to complex interpolation and moment theory, this
work is expected to have applications to scattering structures and control.
