This is a collaborative research project between the Engineering Research Center
(ERC) for Computational Field Simulations at the Mississippi State Univesity and
NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and stennis space Center. The objective of the
research is to address the issues related to improving the quakity of numerical
simualtions of rocket engines, both in operational and testing environments. The
critical science barriers will be addressed in this grant. NASA will provide
funds to develop the test-bed systems that will validate the computational and
simulation results in the Ejector-Mode Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine
performance and survivability studies.
