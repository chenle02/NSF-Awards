The University of Oregon operates the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB)
as a marine laboratory that supports research and education focused on,
ecological interactions, organismal functions and biological diversity in marine
and estuarine environm ents. In a similar fashion, th e South Slough National
Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) also operates trader federal and state
mandates to provide long-term oppommities for research, education and
interpretation with particular emphasis on estuaries within the lower Columbian
bi ogeogr aphic region. These complementary missions focus on increasing
fundamental knowledge and public awareness of marine ecosystems through
scientific research and teaching directed at understanding interactions of
marine organisms and their environment. The S ou th Slough NERR has recently
acquired $450,000 in funds ($200K NOAA / $250K State of Oregon) to support
construction of a dedicated Estuarine and Coastal Research Laboratory on the
OIMB campus. Construction and operation of the new research facility will f
urther strengthen the academic relationship between these institutions and will
serve as a catalyst to increase utilization of OIMB and the South Slough NERR by
visiting researchers. This proposal seeks $60,000 in order to add 500 sq. ft. of
laboratory sp ace to the new Estuarine and Coastal Research Laboratory for use
by scientists visiting OIMB. \par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0 \pard\plain
