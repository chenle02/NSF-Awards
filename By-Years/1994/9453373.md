The research consists of two separate projects, in discrete robotic system
design and discrete motion planning. First, the kinematics, motion planning, and
design of robotic mechanisms with binary actuators are investigated. Robots with
binary (on-off) actuators have a finite number of states. Major benefits of
binary-actuated manipulators are that they can be operated without extensive
feedback control, task repeatability is very high, and two-state actuators are
generally very inexpensive, thus resulting in reliable low cost robots for
industrial use. Second, the design and coordination of`metamorphic' robotic
systems for use in unknown environments are investigated. A metamorphic robot is
a collection of independent modules each of which occupies a space in a lattice,
and has the ability to locomote over adjacent modules. The morphology of the
collection of modules changes as a function of the collective motion. Such self-
reconfigurability gives metamorphic robots unique abilities. For instance,
modules can `flow' into crevasses unreachable by fixed morphology robots, or
grow to form structures which envelop objects and form stable grasps.
