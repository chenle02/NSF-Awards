May 22, 2002 is the closing date for NSF's High Performance Network Connections
(02-73) solicitation. HPNC proposals are complex documents that include many
nuances and requirements. This workshop will take the participants through the
proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing their
proposals. This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and research
justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget, format
and narrative requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be a one day,
hands-on event where the participants actually begin preparation of their HPNC
proposal. The day will be divided into sessions that will focus on key areas of
the proposal development process. Mentors will open each session with a brief
discussion of the area of the proposal being addressed in the session. Then, the
mentors will be available for questions and advice during the time allotted for
proposal writing. Each session will contain actual proposal writing time.
