This dissertation research project will examine the changes in the status of
women in the context of an ongoing social revolution in Nicaragua. The official
propaganda of social revolutions is often to destroy gender biases, but the
actual reality is that such biases endure in particular configurations depending
on the cultural history of the place. This project will interview officials in
agrarian reform and family farmers on the gender division of labor as well as
changes in women's roles in general. Methods will include archival research,
intensive as well as survey interviewing, and participant observation. This
research is important because Central America is a vitally important part of the
hemisphere, and understanding of the cultural and social changes going on there
can help policy in the US formulate reasonable actions in the face of the
revolutionary changes the region is experiencing. In addition, the changes in
gender roles in all societies of the world are significant, and understanding of
how these changes are affected by local official policy and by local custom is
crucial to helping us deal with problems related to gender roles.
