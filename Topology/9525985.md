9525985 Anderson A conference on "Frontiers in Topology" will be held at
Princeton University, October 25-28, 1995. Speakers include Mladen Bestvina
(University of Utah), Gunnar E. Carlsson (Stanford University), Ruth M. Charney
(Ohio State University), F. Thomas Farrell (SUNY at Binghamton), Thomas G.
Goodwillie (Brown University), Ian Hambleton (McMaster University), Lowell E.
Jones (SUNY at Stony Brook), Ronnie Lee (Yale University), Ib Madsen (Aarhus
University), John McCarthy (University of Illinois), John W. Morgan (Columbia
University), Andrew J. Nicas (McMaster University), Robert A. Oliver (University
of Paris XIII), and Karen Vogtmann (Cornell University). Emphasis will be on
some of the most recent developments in topology, particularly those that
involve substantial interaction between topology and other areas of mathematics
(including, for example, analysis and group theory) or of physics. Participation
by graduate students is being encouraged. ***
