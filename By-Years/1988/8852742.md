This award provides funds for a new venture in computer- controlled experimental
laboratory courses which completes a biological psychology track consisting of
physiological psychology, behavioral neurochemistry, neuropsychology, and
psychophysiology. Students will design, run, analyze and write up
neuropsychological experiments on a Macintosh II computer. Experiments with the
major perceptual functions of the cortex, attention and memory as well as higher
reasoning functions will complement the focus on motivation and habitat and
autonomic learning systems in the other biological psychology courses. A broad
exposure to the instrumentation of experimental neuropsychology is aimed for,
with experiments involving dichotic listening techniques, tachistoscope methods,
computer-controlled assessment of attention and memory, as well as traditional
paper and pencil methods of neuropsychology. The project focusses on teaching
experimental methods and proposes that new assessments of the spatial
distribution of attention will be created on the Macintosh II computer. The
Macintosh software Hypercard will be used to create a laboratory manual and an
environment where the student can interact with the computer without special
knowledge of computers. Cumulative data collection and storage procedures as
well as course mechanics such as exams and grading, study guides, class notes,
and course evaluation will be included in the manual. The grantee institution is
matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
