The award from the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at California State University-Fullerton for the
summers of 2004-2006. The PI is Maria C. Linder and the co-PI is Mark S.
Filowitz. Nine students will participate for ten weeks. Faculty members from the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry will provide research projects in the
traditional areas of chemistry (organic, physical, analytical, inorganic) and
biochemistry. The program focuses on recruiting students from the local
community (community colleges, local colleges, CSUF undergraduates) and on
communities where chemistry is not strongly represented (minorities, females).
Weekly workshops on scientific writing and statistics are incorporated in the
program. Ethical and environmental issues are presented and discussed by the
students in seminars and panel discussions, lead by qualified
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the summer, each student makes an oral and a
poster presentation of his/her work, and prepares a scientific report written in
journal style. The program is monitored by a variety of surveys.&lt;br/&gt;
