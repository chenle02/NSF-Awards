Non-technical abstract

Within the past two years, a new strategy has been discovered for manipulating
magnetic devices (such as magnetic random access memories) that is at least a
factor of 10 more efficient than any previously known technique. This approach
relies on taking advantage of "spin-orbit coupling" -- a strong interaction
between the intrinsic spin of an electron and its direction of motion in certain
materials. However, the exact mechanism has not yet been resolved. This project
seeks to determine the microscopic mechanism behind this new effect, to
investigate how best to optimize materials and devices to enable applications,
and to explore the scientific opportunities that can be enabled by using this
new strategy to manipulate classes of magnetic materials that have not been
investigated previously. This research is directly applicable to improving
technologies for magnetic memory and logic, and the project will also yield
additional broad impacts by providing research education to graduate students
and undergraduates that helps teach them to be outstanding independent
scientists.

Technical abstract

This project builds upon demonstrations by the principal investigator and
collaborators that an in-plane current in a heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayer can
provide a very strong torque to the magnetic moment of the ferromagnet on
account of the spin Hall effect within the heavy metal. Other research groups
have also provided evidence of current-induced torques associated with a
different physical mechanism, the Rashba effect, in similar samples. The project
will seek to answer unresolved questions about the microscopic mechanisms,
symmetries, and strengths of current-induced torques in these heavy
metal/ferromagnet bilayers, and how best to optimize materials and devices to
enable applications of these torques. The methods employed include techniques to
measure current-induced reorientations of magnetic moments in nanofabricated
devices and related spin-pumping experiments in which a precessing magnet
injects a spin current into the heavy metal. The research involves investigating
a wide variety of different materials and multilayer geometries, and also the
exploration of new scientific opportunities that can be enabled by using the new
current-induced torques to manipulate spins within insulating ferrimagnets and
antiferromagnets, two classes of materials in which spin manipulation could not
be implemented efficiently using previously-known mechanisms. The overall
project objectives include both new fundamental understanding about the
interactions between electrical currents and magnets and also practical magnetic
memory and logic devices that can operate using much lower power or at much
higher frequencies than has been possible previously.
