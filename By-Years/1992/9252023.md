This project is the development of a laboratory course in undergraduate polymer
chemistry. This is part of an overall plan to develop a chemistry degree with a
polymer option, an objective consistent with goals to increase polymer education
in the undergraduate curriculum. An infrared spectrophotometer is used by the
students to identify common polymers by interpretation of infrared spectra.
Students gain experience in the determination of physical properties of polymers
using differential scanning calorimetry and the thermo-mechanical analyzer.
Specific properties measured are melting points, glass transition temperatures,
decomposition temperatures, and coefficients of thermal expansion. An automatic
recording membrane osmometer is used to provide instruction in the determination
of molecular weights. A film-fiber accessory for an thermo-mechanical analyzer
is used to measure tensile properties and the change in these properties with
temperature.
