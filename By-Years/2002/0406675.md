"Mixing in Math" is a multi-dimensional, three-year project that seeks to build
the capacity of after-school programs to provide meaningful and engaging math
activities for youth. Program collaborators including project leaders from TERC
and after-school program leaders will reach approximately 40,000 children
through at least 350 sites and approximately 9,000 staff and volunteers. Drawing
on the unique features of the after-school environment, the project design
includes the following elements: development of materials appropriate to the
setting; staff development and support; institutionalization and dissemination
of materials throughout an established network and evaluation research to
further knowledge about informal math and after-school programming. Project
goals are to: provide free math materials to all participating after-school
staff; produce a significant increase in informal math training for the after-
school workforce; strengthen the role of informal math in after-school settings;
and conduct and disseminate research on the project in terms of its impact on
after-school programming, informal math education and the math "achievement
gap." "Mixing in Math" national partners will facilitate further reach of the
project. The National Institute of Out of School Time (NIOST) in addition to
posting materials on their website, will incorporate project activities into
their staff development programs. Ceridian, a work-life benefits provider, will
distribute project materials to workplace school-ages childcare programs.
