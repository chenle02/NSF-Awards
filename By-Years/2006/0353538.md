Six undergraduate students will be provided with an enjoyable and productive
research experience in the area of experimental field biology over a ten-week
period in May through July. Research activities will be centered at Sam Houston
State University's 250-acre Center for Biological Field Studies. Students will
live in modern apartment-style dormitories on campus. Students will gain
confidence in their abilities as scientists through planning, conducting and
being responsible for their own research project. There will be much opportunity
to interact with faculty, graduate students and other REU students through
weekly seminars, field trips and social gatherings. Our goal is to foster an
interest and enthusiasm for pursuing graduate studies in biology and ultimately
careers in research. The program is particularly oriented toward recruiting
women and students from minorities traditionally underrepresented in science as
well as students from institutions without research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
Weekly seminars will include information on how to conduct research and
discussions of important issues in science. Students will work closely with
faculty mentors that specialize in field biology and will have their choice
among a variety of research projects in ecology, taxonomy, animal behavior, and
environmental microbiology. Our mentors work on a diversity of organisms
including plants, fungi, protozoans and animals. Students will gain experience
from their specific projects and will be encouraged to learn from, and
participate in, the projects of other students. Students will present their
research in oral, poster and manuscript forms. This presentation experience will
provide students with the encouragement and confidence to present their research
findings at a regional or national conference and to publish research findings
with their mentors. For more information contact Dr. Diane Neudorf at
