The Center for Microbial Ecology at Michigan State University is dedicated to
understanding the underlying principles of microbial ecology with specific
emphasis on the competitiveness, diversity and function of microorganisms in
natural and managed habitats. Results of center supported research will impact
directly on all areas where microorganisms play a dominant role; eg. groundwater
quality, hazardous waste disposal, plant productivity, and the regulation of
agricultural and environmental biotechnologies. Around the largest group of
microbial ecologists in the world, the Center has gathered researchers and
students in molecular genetics, ecology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics,
and computer science. Research is organized into thrust areas that require
multidisciplinary teams of scientists which results in a unique
interdisciplinary research and educational environment. Educational activities
emphasize training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows but also include a
vigorous multi-level outreach program. An industrial alliance program
facilitates knowledge transfer from the Center to industry and stimulates
mutually beneficial collaborative projects with the private sector. The Center's
strong linkages with federal, state and local agencies will have a significant
impact on policies promulgated by these agencies on issues related to microbial
ecology and the environment. Finally, the Center has established three unique
collaborative research programs with Japan, the USSR and Denmark which will
provide exchange students and faculty with intellectually and culturally
broadening experiences.
