The principal investigator will continue his research into the numerical
solution of the acoustic equations that govern the generation and propagation of
noise by aircraft. Specifically he will study two major problem areas: the
development and implementation of numerical codes that can resolve the acoustic
equations in the presence of vorticity, and the posing of physically correct and
numerically consistent boundary conditions for flow problems in unbounded
domains. The vorticity that is generated near sharp edges like the engines or
the landing gear creates difficulties for conventional numerical codes, and so
the principal investigator is developing a finite element code that obviates
many of the problems associated with vorticity. With regard to the posing of
proper boundary conditions it is necessary to set boundary conditions on an
artificial interface, in order to make the computations for a problem in an
infinite domain tractable. The problem of aircraft noise during landings and
takeoffs is of growing concern to many communities and local governments. One
obvious solution of this problem is to design airplanes whose engines and
exterior surfaces operate at minimal noise levels. As one can imagine easily
this is a complicated phenomenon, and so mathematicians and aerodynamicists
often resort to modelling the complex sets of equations with simpler ones, and
then solving the approximate equations numerically. However this can be tricky
too, since aircraft generate vorticity, which influences the noise pattern and
which often defeats conventional numerical schemes. The principal investigator
is working on numerical algorithms that can handle the vorticity and the
unboundedness of the flow domain in a computationally efficient manner.
