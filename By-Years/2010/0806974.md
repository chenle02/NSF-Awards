This CONNECTS 2 S-STEM project will increase the quality, quantity, and
diversity of the engineering workforce by providing scholarships to 80
academically talented, first-generation freshmen students majoring in various
engineering disciplines and computer science. Additionally, the program will
target academically strong students from historically underrepresented
populations. The program utilizes a three-pronged recruitment-application-
matriculation plan to recruit, select, and retain scholarship recipients from 12
selected Texas high schools. The program incorporates student support strategies
such as living learning communities, course clustering, industry interaction,
student professional society involvement, and student career placement.
