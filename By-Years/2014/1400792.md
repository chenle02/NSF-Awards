The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their
efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically
underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality
degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
disciplines. The LSAMP Bridge to the Baccalaureate (B2B) funding opportunity
provides support for historically underrepresented minority STEM students who
begin their instruction at a community college with the intent to transfer into
4-year STEM degree programs in addition to other infrastructure support such as
STEM faculty professional development. The North Carolina STEM Alliance (NCSA),
under the leadership of Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC), is a
community college alliance consisting of CPCC, Davidson County Community College
(DCCC) and Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC). The alliance will
implement a variety of activities that could potentially increase the
participation of underrepresented minorities and veterans in STEM disciplines
and ensure that all populations have the opportunity to succeed in STEM careers
thereby increase the nation's competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of
the project are to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM)
students who transfer to university STEM programs. The NCSA will reach this goal
through targeted engagement, career exploration, and dual enrollment. Activities
that will be implemented to mitigate barriers for community college students,
particularly URMs, include: contextualized curriculum, targeted academic
support, coaching and proactive advising, research and career experiences,
professional development, K-16 curriculum alignment and faculty professional
development. Presentations and scholarly publications produced by the project
will be shared with national community college and other workforce stakeholder
organizations.
