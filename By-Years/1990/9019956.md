The most common process to make the YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor (1-2-3
superconductor)is that with mixed oxides as precursor materials. Co-
precipitation processes, such as the all acetate precursors route, have been
also used to produce 1-2-3 superconductors. However, the all acetate precursor
route is not as widely used as the mixed oxide route because some important
properties of the 1-2-3 superconductor are diminished when the former route is
used. These properties include transition temperature, critical current density,
strength, and the Meissner effect they produce. Although the acetate route has
not proven to produce 1-2-3 superconductors with exceptional properties, there
is an interest in this co-precipitation process because it produces faster
superconductors and with less energy requirements than the oxide precursors
route. %%% The purpose of this research is to optimize the method to produce
1-2-3 superconductors and improve its properties using acetate precursors.
