1733968 Niemeyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to support the costs of
the meeting and the travels of the participants who will attend the workshop on
Building a Sustainable Combustion Research Community. This proposed workshop
will be held on April 22 and 23, 2017, prior to the 10th US National Combustion
Meeting in College Park, MD. Workshop participants will consist of junior
faculty members who just started their academic careers in the field of
combustion and fire research. In the U.S. nearly 70% of energy conversion is
accomplished by combustion. Hence the advancement in combustion science is
crucial to the society. The workshop discussion will be focused on the future
challenges in the field from the perspectives of early-career researchers, who
will be the workforce to address these future challenges in their careers.
Workshop findings will be documented in a report that will be disseminated to
the wider technical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combustion is a key
technology for power generation, and this will remain the same for decades to
come. However, the combustion research community is facing various technical and
non-technical challenges. The goal of this workshop is to identify challenges,
educate the early-career researchers about these challenges, and discuss
possible solutions. Discussion around technical issues will include
brainstorming of novel, possibly cross-disciplinary research areas for future
work. On the other hand, various non-technical issues will also be discussed,
including communication with the general public and lawmakers and attracting and
retaining talented researchers of diverse backgrounds. Results of this workshop
are expected to help build a more productive combustion research community.
