This award provides funds to be used for purchase of instrumentation to be used
for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies. Unlike standard PCR,
real-time PCR is a versatile technique that can be used to both detect and
measure the abundance of a specific messenger RNA, and thus provide quantitative
information about expression of a specific gene. Use of real-time PCR
complements the use of DNA microarrays, another modern technology for monitoring
gene expression, which can provides global information about the expression of
many genes, but with much less accuracy than real-time PCR. The new
instrumentation will be located in a new core Biotechnology Support Facility
recently established at Cook College with donations from industry and support
from the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education. The instrument will enable
the use of real-time PCR in a variety of research efforts, including studies of
gene expression in yeast treated with protein synthesis inhibitors; other
studies of the pyrene and phenanthrene degradation pathways in Mycobacterium;
studies of the expression of genes controlling cysteine and methionine
homeostasis in Arabidopsis; and larger scale efforts to develop accurate
quantitative information about the expression of all genes in Arabidopsis. The
instrument will greatly enhance the ability of Cook College faculty to undertake
research as well as their ability to provide instruction and training to
students at all levels.
