9618425 Turco The project will construct, test, and apply a comprehensive model
of global tropospheric aerosol microphysics, chemistry, and transport. The model
will include the formation, size evolution, composition, dispersion and removal
of airborne particles and thus determine their distribution, optical, physical,
and chemical effects. The research contains three tasks: (1) construction of a
microphysics and optics model which treats a multi-component aerosol system and
calculates wavelength-dependent optical depths; (2) integration of
photochemistry with aerosol microphysics, including material fluxes between
vapor and condensed phase; and (3) coupling of aerosol/chemistry model to a 3-D
tracer transport code. The aerosol model will be applied to an investigation of
new sulfate aerosol particles that are formed in the remote marine atmosphere.
The model predictions will be compared with measurements of ultrafine particles
during the Southern Hemisphere Marine Aerosol Characterization Experiment
(ACE-1). The validated and aerosol model will be used as a tool for predicting
the chemical and climatic impacts of atmospheric particles on climate.
