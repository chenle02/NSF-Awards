This award will provide a stipend for a minority graduate student, Mr. Pablo
Saez. He was an "honorable mention" two years ago in the Minority Graduate
Fellowship competition. The Physics Division is providing equivalent to such a
fellowship as part of its plan to encourage minority students in physics.
