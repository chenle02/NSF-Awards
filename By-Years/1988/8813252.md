Exchange of information and data are essential parts of a successful program in
earthquake hazard mitigation. The purpose of this research is to conduct a
workshop to provide an opportunity for researchers, designers, and construction
specialists to exchange ideas on design techniques used in rehabilitating
building subjected to seismic loads and on construction approaches used for
specific projects. This workshop is being held in conjunction with the
U.S.-Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects (UJNR).
