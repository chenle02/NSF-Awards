This project will take the perspective of phylogenetic diversity in order to
understand biodiversity with an emphasis on evolutionary history. Biodiversity
hot spots, and endemism, are traditionally measured by changes in the number of
species across a region. Such studies miss the full richness of analyses that a
phylogenetic approach can provide. The investigators will use a combination of
spatial distribution data, phylogenetic relationships, and new analysis tools to
provide exciting new insights into the patterns of vascular plant diversity
within California, a globally recognized region of high plant diversity. Plants
currently missing from phylogenetic analyses will be collected, and this project
promises to provide new information about patterns of plant diversity that will
be useful not only to researchers, but also conservation planners and amateur
plant enthusiasts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One postdoctoral researcher and several
undergraduates will be trained in the methods being used to investigate
phylogenetic endemism. These training activities will be coupled with extensive
outreach to citizen scientists and amateur botanists through talks highlighting
the importance of integrating information on phylogenetic relationships when
evaluating patterns of biological diversity. The suite of analysis tools
generated by this project will also provide a model for future analyses of
phylogenetic endemism that could be used in diverse organisms throughout the
world.
