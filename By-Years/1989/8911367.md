The Graduates School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island will
further develop an automated coulometric detection processor for shipboard use.
This Single-Operator Multiparameter Metabolic Analyzer (SOMMA), will allow the
simultaneous processing of several key metabolic parameters in seawater. These
measurements, obtained from a single sample, include total carbon dioxide,
oxygen, carbon-14, pH, alkalinity, and various derivative data. A microprocessor
will control SOMMA's operation, perform statistical analyses, and store
resulting data. It will be designed to work with a variety of existing,
interchangeable chemical detectors. Improvements in making rapid, accurate, and
efficient measurements of chemical parameters in aquatic samples will benefit
many chemical, ecological, and microbiological studies. Being able to make these
measurements onboard research vessels when samples are fresh is a further
benefit and minimizes possible chemical degradation from having to store and
transport samples ashore for analysis. //
