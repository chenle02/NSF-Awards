This research will examine the regulation by polyamines of the translational
efficiency of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA. cDNA and genomic clones for
mouse ODC have been isolated, the sequence of the 312 base 5' leader sequence
has been determined and it has been established that increasing the polyamine
pools of cells decreases the rate of ODC synthesis without changing the level of
intracellular ODC mRNA. Because ODC is rate-limiting for polyamine synthesis in
animal cells, interaction of polyamines with leader represents a means by which
polyamines could contribute to the regulation of their own synthesis. Many
laboratories are studying the regulation of gene expression at the level of
transcription. Few are characterizing regulation at the secondary level of
messenger translation. Dr. Coffino and his associates have been developing this
system of regulation of ornithine decarboxylase for a number of years. Ornithine
decarboxylase is biologically important, appears to play a significant role in
cell growth and is subject to a variety of modes of regulation. The focus in
this project is on regulation at the translational level and the results should
allow greater insight into the different ways a cell can modulate the amount of
product available.
