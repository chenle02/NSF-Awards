Gardner 9501289 The proposed research is in the area of geometric tomography and
convexity theory. The proposer wishes to extend his earlier work on the
Busemann-Petty problem dealing with convex bodies: the Busemann-Petty problem
has to do with drawing conclusions about the relative volumes of two convex
bodies in n-space from information about their central sections. The X-ray
problem - reconstruction of a convex body from a small number of X-ray pictures
- is considered; the proposed research has potentially significant ramifications
in computerized tomography (CAT and MRI scanners).
