Professor Wallach will continue his research in the general area of group
representation theory. In particular his research will involve a generalization
of the Kuznetsov formula and the Laplacian on locally symmetric spaces. In
addition he will study the asymptotic behavior of Whittaker functionals in the
theory of the Toda lattice and further projects in the area of direct integral
decompositions of reducible real reductive groups. Group theory is basically the
theory of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in question is
invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the group of
translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular
situations demand concrete realizations or "representations" of the symmetry
group. Professor Wallach's investigations involve representations of groups
which have geometrical or physical content.
