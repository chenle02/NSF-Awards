This investigation aims at understanding the interaction between atmospheric
dynamics and cloud radiative forcing. The study involves: (a) Analyses of
satellite observations of the radiation budget, water vapor and cloud images as
well as conventional observations of SST, heights and moisture fields to obtain
the regional distributions of seasonal and inter-annual variations in cloud
radiative forcing and the H2O greenhouse effect, (b) Use of the NCAR CCM and 1-D
radiative-convective models to investigate the effects of radiative heating on
the model dynamics and thermodynamics. This investigation will make valuable
contributions in our understanding of the role of clouds in modulating the
earth's climate system.
