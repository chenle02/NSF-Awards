The goal of this student travel support project is to enhance the diversity of
the fourth Universal Dependencies workshop by supporting students to participate
in it. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 28th International
Conference on Computational Linguistics, one of the largest computational
linguistics conferences worldwide. By participating in the workshop in such a
context, the students are offered an excellent opportunity for networking and
building connections across institutions. They are also gaining exposure by
presenting their work. Such experience is particularly valuable for researchers
from smaller institutions, with less funding available for
travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Universal Dependencies is a framework for
morphosyntactic annotation of human language, which to date has been used to
create treebanks for 90 languages. The framework is well suited as the basis for
cross-linguistically consistent annotation of typologically diverse languages in
a way that supports natural language processing computer applications as well as
broader linguistic studies. One of the goals of the workshop is to cover more
low-resource languages, thereby expanding the languages represented in the
Universal Dependencies corpora. This project aims at attracting students who are
working on such languages and whose work would benefit the Universal
Dependencies community. The workshop encourages a spirit of collaborative
research and builds a supportive environment for computational and non-
computational linguists interested in a broad, cross-lingual perspective on the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
