This MSP RETA project will develop a set of comprehensive subject matter
assessment tools that can function as diagnostic tools to identify teachers'
strength and weaknesses across grade levels. The assessment items will measure
the extent to which teachers and students have mastery of the K-12 NRC Content
Standards and the AAAS Benchmarks in Physical Science and Eartha nd Space
Science. The application of psychometric models aligned with cognitive research
findings will be used to establish scales and substests that accurately guage
scientific understanding needed for teaching pre-college science courses. The
assessment items will be reviewed by science faculty to ensure
validity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will work with MSP Institutes both as
a technical assistance project and as a site for research. &lt;br/&gt;
