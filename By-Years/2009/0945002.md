This SBIR Phase I project will develop a unique "lab-on-a-chip", with the
objective to be able to simultaneously detect several water contaminants down to
parts-per-billion levels. The separation method to be used is an innovative
microfluidics undulating electro-osmosis technique which uses a capillary tube
with a varying diameter. The detector is a surface-enhanced Raman
spectrophotometer using embedded metallic nanoparticles. The project team will
conduct tests of the instrument using perchlorate and nicotine as the target
species for testing. These target species are to be adsorbed onto gold
nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the
proposed project will be that this could lead to the capability of detecting a
broad array of contaminants in the natural environment such as emerging
pharmaceuticals, arsenic, heavy metals, melanine, plasticizers, etc.
Contaminants of national security risk would be additional targets. Labs-on-a-
chip have been developed and commercialized by several companies, but in general
they are limited to basic analyses such as pH, conductivity, etc., and/or they
can detect specific organic or inorganic compounds only to parts per million
levels. Being able to go down to parts per billion levels will be a great
benefit for numerous applications such as on-site investigations. Coupling the
novel separation technique to the surface-enhanced Raman spectrophotometer could
result in a unique technology that could be quite useful for detecting and
quantifying many chemical species in water.&lt;br/&gt;
