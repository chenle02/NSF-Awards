This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop novel
algorithms and hardware accelerators for a real-time, high-resolution,
H.264-based network video appliance. It is also designed for transmission over
packet-based networks while achieving significantly superior compression
efficiency compared to previous standards and proprietary solutions. It will
improve encoder performance by at least one order of magnitude compared to
current implementations. A real-time, network appliance with the compression
efficiency of H.264 will have broad applications, particularly in the areas of
distance learning, remote training, security and
surveillance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovations resulting from this research
will enable implementers to significantly improve the real-time performance of
H.264. A real-time, high-resolution network appliance with the compression
efficiency of H.264 will bring digital video in the mainstream by delivering
high quality video to the endpoints of the network. This will drive business and
consumer uses by making communication crucial to making distance learning and
remote training economically feasible. This superior visual communication
capability will foster greater scientific collaboration between geographically
dispersed researchers and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
