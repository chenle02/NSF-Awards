This project is addressed to use synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering to
elucidate the detailed structure of disordered alloys and defective crystals. It
contains both an experimental component (the measurement of atomic correlations
and displacements in disordered alloys) and a theoretical component (the
relation of these quantities to the underlying electronic structure). Novel
alloys will be studied such as the null matrix Nio.52Pto.48 whose average
scattering is zero as the 62Ni has a negative neutron scattering length and
Cu62Ni where magnetic effects become very interesting, especially the
displacements originating in the spins. Extended Fermi surface traces in the
scattering and their origin in alloy theory will also be explored. Finally, the
explanation of the two-length scale phenomenon is V2H, where surface defects
induce a continuous phase transition while the bulk shows a first-order
transition, will be completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a variety of
scattering methods are applied to elucidate the underlying physical (electronic)
origin of a number of interesting and important structures in metals and alloys.
These scattering techniques take advantage of the most sophisticated national
laboratories such as the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National
Laboratory, the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National
Laboratory, new NSF-supported neutron instrumentation at the National Institute
for Standards and Technology, Research Reactor Division, and the High Flux
Isotope Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Collaboration with the Max
Planck Institute for Metals Research (Stuttgart) is well underway and has been
quite productive. The basic aim is the understanding of both simple and complex
alloys at the atomic level in order to relate their structure to their
function.&lt;br/&gt;
