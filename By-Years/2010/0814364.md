PROJECT Abstract

The investigator has created a protocol for developing evaluations of programs
using a web-based system. The project will assess the degree to which the
Systems Evaluation Protocol (SEP) is associated with changes in organizational
evaluation capacity and performance outcomes. The investigator will conduct a
trial of how well this protocol would work in two NSF funded research settings:
a Materials Science and Engineering Centers and a 4-H Engineering and Technology
program. The project includes a development phase where the investigator will be
testing and enhancing the on-line system using a team of evaluators, educators,
and software engineers. It also includes a phase to empirically measure the
results of the evaluation protocol on evaluation quality. The intent of the
project is to significantly enhance knowledge of STEM education evaluation and
how to implement it with rigor. The results are intended to inform educators and
education researchers about the strengths and weaknesses of these evaluation
methods. The researcher has established an intern program to advance the role of
underrepresented populations in evaluation.
