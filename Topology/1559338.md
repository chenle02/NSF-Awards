A longstanding problem in topology is to classify knots (a closed loop formed
from a rope winding in space and closing back on itself) by asking how far a
given knot is from being unknotted (that is, can be pulled apart to look like an
ordinary circle). This problem (the basis of the subject of knot theory) has
implications in physics (quantum theory), chemistry (molecular knots) and
biology (knotting of DNA). A central tool in classifying knots, and indeed in
many topological questions, is to assign an invariant to a knot: two knots are
then different if their invariants are different. The goal is find robust
invariants which can distinguish different knots. This project explores new
types of knot invariants and continues the trend of using tools from algebra to
define and investigate knot invariants. The PI will use techniques from the
mathematical fields of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation
theory. The focus of the project is on the class of knots and links that arise
from intersecting an algebraic curve in the plane with a small sphere centered
at the singularity of the curve (such knots and links are called algebraic). In
this project the PI will study the interaction between the topological
invariants of algebraic knots and links and certain algebraic and combinatorial
objects associated to the corresponding curve.

Quantum knot invariants have proven to be a powerful tool in low-dimensional
topology. To every knot one can associate a polynomial with integer coefficients
in one variable (as in the Alexander polynomial or the Jones polynomial) or in
two variables (as in the HOMFLY polynomial). It has recently been discovered by
the PI and his collaborators that for torus knots all coefficients in the HOMFLY
polynomial are in fact nonnegative. To prove this fact, certain representations
of the rational Cherednik algebra were studied and it was shown that the
dimensions of some graded subspaces match the HOMFLY coefficients. Khovanov and
Rozansky introduced another collection of vector spaces, called HOMFLY homology,
such that the HOMFLY coefficients are presented as alternating sums of their
dimensions. The similarity of the two constructions suggests that for a torus
knot Khovanov-Rozansky homology may be isomorphic to a representation of the
rational Cherednik algebra, equipped with an extra grading (or filtration). This
conjecture has been verified in many examples, but remains open in general. The
PI plans to use the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras for the
construction of explicit combinatorial and geometric models for the Khovanov-
Rozansky homology of torus knots, and their generalizations to algebraic knots
and links. Other knot homology theories, such as Heegaard-Floer homology, will
also be studied.
