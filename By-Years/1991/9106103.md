Recently, a new technique was developed which utilizes high intensity electrical
pulses to temporarily permeabilize the cell membrane, a process called
"electroporation". With this method, exogenous molecules (including proteins,
antibodies and genes) can be introduced into living cells. The major objectives
of this research are: (1) To obtain a better understanding of the basic
processes and mechanisms of electroporation. (2) To improve the technology
electroporation and to develop more widely useful instrumentation. (3) To
develop new applications of electroporation for research in cell biology,
molecular biology, developmental biology and neurobiology. The technology
developed in this laboratory will be made available to other scientists through
the establishment of a collaborative facility located at the Marine Biological
Laboratory, Wood Hole, MA. A number of collaborative studies using an improved
method of electroporation have been planned.
