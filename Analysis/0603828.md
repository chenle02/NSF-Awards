The research will primarily focus on three areas: (i) the analysis of minimal
energy point configurations; (ii) the noninvasive detection of faults (cracks)
in homogeneous media; and (iii) limiting behaviors of certain basis functions
over planar regions. Regarding (i), we shall analyze certain equilibrium (or
"ground state") configurations for N particles interacting via a pairwise
repulsive interaction V and confined to a fixed set (such a sphere or torus).
Such configurations are useful for purposes of sampling data, computer graphics,
best-packing, and understanding the physics of self-assembling materials.
Concerning (ii), we shall continue with the development of rational
approximation methods that can determine the existence and location of cracks
inside a conducting material. Regarding (iii), our focus will be on polynomials
orthogonal over planar regions and how their behavior can be used to solve
problems related to tomography (the recovery of the underlying planar region).
