The speed of the strategic decision making process in rapidly evolving
technological environment, is a critical issue for top management teams and of
fundamental interest to researchers in organization theory and strategic
management. This research involves an in-depth inductive study of the decision
making of the top management teams of eight microcomputer firms. The research
addresses the ways in which top management teams decide major issues, why some
teams make strategic decisions more quickly than other teams and the impact of
these different top management decision making processes on firm performance.
The significance of this research is in its potential to advance the field
theoretically, in its unique research design and in its potential implication
for the design and functioning of top management teams.
