Moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds, Riemann surfaces and general type
manifolds, stable bundles and stable maps have played fundamental roles in many
subjects of mathematics from geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, to number
theory and are also important in string theory. Mirror symmetry has motivated
many deep mathematical results and theories. In this project the PI will study
various local and global problems of the geometry of these moduli spaces. These
problems include the deformation of canonical metrics such as the Kahler-
Einstein metrics and Bergman metrics with respect to various gauges. This study
lead to a geometric quantization of the Weil-Petersson type metrics. The PI will
also study the global properties of the period map from the Teichmuller and
moduli spaces to the classifying spaces of variation of Hodge structures and
their quotients. The PI will also investigate the geometric properties on
canonical and new Kahler metrics on these moduli spaces as well as the general
existence of Kahler-Einstein and Hermitian-Einstein metrics on noncompact
manifolds and bundles over them.

Teichmuller and moduli spaces of Kahler-Einstein manifolds are important for
both mathematics and theoretical physics. In string theory, many fundamental
partition functions can be reduced to geometric or topological invariants of
moduli spaces which also motivated many beautiful conjectures. The study of
these important conjectures not only enhanced the development of various
branches of mathematics but also help in verifying theory in high energy
physics. The research of the PI also has potential applications in industry such
as medical image processing and 3D cameras. For example, with the explicit
construction of the period map the speed of compressing/decompressing pictures
can be significantly increased.
