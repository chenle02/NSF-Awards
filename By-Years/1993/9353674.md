This exploratory study will investigate ways to document what children learn
from their participation in local science fairs. Students' understanding of the
process and elements that make up a science fair project as well as direct
learning of science content related to their science fair topic will be
evaluated though several different methodologies. Comparative analysis will be
made of indicators of children's learning yielded by these different approaches.
This study will be conducted in fourth and fifth grade classrooms in both an
urban and a suburban school district. From 75 to 100 students at each grade
level will participate in the study. The sample will be balanced with equal
numbers of boys and girls. The project is significant because it will utilize a
variety of assessment strategies to assess what children have learned from
participation in a local science fair including who benefits most. The project
should also begin to describe the student who benefits most from science fair
participation. The assessment strategies are more informative to the
instructional and evaluative decisions that teachers must make regarding science
learning and assessment for upper elementary school students.
