The University of California Los Angeles, in partnership with the University of
Oregon and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), propose an extension
to the Into the Loop Alliance. The goal is to build and support the capacity of
the LAUSD to offer high-quality, college preparatory computer science classes,
especially in high schools with high numbers of African-American and Latino
students, and to develop a model and repository of best practices that can help
spread and inform similar efforts to other school districts nationwide. The
project is committed to affecting the depth and scale of change that is
necessary to integrate the teaching and learning of computer science into the
national education enterprise with the intent of engaging all students. Their
focus is on the secondary school level because this is when students are being
prepared for pursuing their careers and interests in college. Into the Loop
proposal builds upon five previous years of accomplishments, most notably the
creation of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and the ECS teacher
professional development program. The scope of work for years 6-10 is focused
on: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -- Deepening, institutionalizing, and sustaining the
reforms in the LAUSD;&lt;br/&gt; -- Expanding the research base and designing
authentic assessment measures for student engagement with and learning of
computational &lt;br/&gt; thinking practices;&lt;br/&gt; -- Creating and
evaluating resources for best and promising practices around ECS curriculum and
pedagogy, teachers professional &lt;br/&gt; development and learning community,
and ECS assessments; and &lt;br/&gt; -- Studying the scalability and
replicability of ECS curriculum and PD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In years 6-10, the
partnership will serve as a national resource for others pursuing CS
education/broadening participation in computing initiatives.
