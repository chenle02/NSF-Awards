The primary objective of this project is to investigate both interspecific and
intraspecific variation in the Drosophila willistoni group, through analysis of
structural and DNA sequence polymorphism in the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh)
gene. Specific aims of this study are 1) to analyze structural polymorphism at
the Adh locus of the willistoni group by assaying for the presence/absence of
the third intron of the Adh gene 2) determine the degree of DNA sequence
polymorphism in the Adh gene among species of the willistoni group and within D.
willistoni 3) to derive a phylogeny of the willistoni group and the subgenus
Sophophora using DNA sequence data and 4) to analyze the degree of inter- and
intraspecific codon usage bias for Adh in the willistoni group. The codon usage
analysis will aim at determining 1) if the level of codon usage bias varies
among species of the willistoni group and/or within D. willistoni 2 if rate of
synonymous substitution is constrained by codon usage bias and 3) if there is a
preference for a particular base at the third position of codons. This study
uses molecular population genetics and evolutionary genetics of the Adh locus to
examine evolutionary patterns in the D. willistoni group, and will further our
understanding of evolution at the molecular level.
