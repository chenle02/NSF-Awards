Planetary nebulae (PN) are gaseous shells of varying shapes surrounding compact,
hot central stars. They are formed by intense stellar winds from luminous,
highly evolved red giant stars. This process of mass ejection robs the stars of
their outer hydrogen- rich envelopes, leaving behind compact stars consisting
predominantly of helium and heavier elements. Upon ejection of their hydrogen-
rich envelopes and the initial formation of the PN, high-speed winds from the
central stars shape the nebulae and affect their kinematic and thermodynamic
properties. The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to continue with their
current NSF-funded study of the spatial and kinematic nature of PN. They will
construct a two-dimensional hydrodynamic computer code, supplemented with
collisional and photon heating and radiative cooling algorithms. The PIs plan to
apply this code to shocks and collisional processes in the evolution of PN and
their halos, the history of stellar winds, and the origin of the peculiar knots
and rims of very low ionization embedded in some PN. Detailed comparisons with
observational data of PN will be made.
