The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Kenneth Showalter of West Virginia University and Dr. M.T. Beck of Kossuth
Lojos University, Debrecen, is to investigate the oscillatory iodate ion
oxidation of sulfite and ferrocyanide ions. Efforts will involve
characterization and systematic examination of major component processes of this
reaction: (1) the direct reaction between iodate and sulfite, (2) the iodine
oxidation of ferrocyanide, (3) the triiodide and iodine oxidation of sulfite,
and (4) the direct reaction between iodate and ferrocyanide. After classical
chemical kinetics studies of these four processes, the researchers will pursue
experimental and theoretical studies of the dynamical behavior of the
oscillatory reaction. Results should lead to development of an accurate model
description of the oscillatory reaction mechanism. This project in physical
chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
