This award supports participation in the Beyond Hyperbolicity Conference at the
Ohio State University, which will be held July 6-10, 2020. The theme of the
conference is in geometric group theory, a field that uses algebraic techniques
to understand complicated geometric spaces. The Ohio State University has long
been a hub for research in geometric group theory, and this conference will
continue in this tradition.

Although hyperbolic groups and spaces are a common topic at geometric group
theory conferences, the goal of this conference is to highlight work being done
in other areas of combinatorial and geometric group theory. Whereas there have
are many conferences focused on hyperbolic and acylindrically hyperbolic groups,
mapping class groups, and cubical groups, there have been relatively few
conferences devoted to a variety of other groups relevant to geometric group
theory such as nilpotent and solvable groups, amenable groups, Thompson?s
groups, groups of dynamical origins, self-similar groups, and more. These other
categories of groups have a long history in the study of geometric group theory.
The focus of this conference is to bring together researchers who specialize in
these topics to encourage fruitful discussions regarding open questions in
geometric group theory outside of the realm of hyperbolic groups. The conference
website is at https://sites.google.com/view/beyondhyperbolicity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
