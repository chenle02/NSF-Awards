Through this project, the Department of Bioengineering provides an
undergraduate Biotechnology and Bioprocess Laboratory. This laboratory course
teaches students the techniques and technologies used in the biotechnology and
bioprocessing industries. The students also obtain an overview of the
biotechnology industry. This course is unique in that it presents laboratory
experiments in the context of gaining an understanding of how the techniques
learned are used in industrial bioprocessing. Of particular significance is the
incorporation of molecular biology techniques within a bioengineering
laboratory. *
