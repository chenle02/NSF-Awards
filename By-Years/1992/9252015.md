Freshmen at a newly established laboratory in Iowa State University are using
solid modeling and interactive software for three-dimensional visualization in
an active learning environment for engineering problem solving and technical
communications. A learning center with 22 personal computers and appropriate
software supports instruction in two introductory engineering courses. The
learning center laboratory is used by 36 students at a time, working with 18
networked high-performance personal computers, in two-student teams. The teams
are engaged in such activities as solid modeling, geometric analysis,
simulation, and documentation. The two introductory engineering courses most
affected by this laboratory are required of all engineering students and,
together, have a total enrollment of over 2,200 students a year.
