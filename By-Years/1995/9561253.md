This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a proof-
of-concept prototype of a complex compound heating system for divers in polar
regions. The proposed heater consists of an innovative design of a compact and
lightweight complex compound thermal storage unit which provides a heat output
to a liquid circulating garment that is worn by a diver under a wet or dry suit.
The proposed project will result in the construction, testing and delivery of a
0.5 to 1 hour capacity complex compound heater demonstration prototype to the
National Science Foundation in the six month time period. Under Phase II of the
project, an optimized heater for longer time periods (2 to 4 hours) utilizing
lightweight materials will be developed, laboratory tested and field tested in
conjunction with a liquid circulating garment. The complex compound heater
developed can be used by underwater search and rescue personnel and even sport
divers in cold water situations. The heater can also be applied to thermal
blankets for keeping people warm in situations where electricity is not
available such as in disaster areas, refugee situations, mountain rescue and
ambulatory services.
