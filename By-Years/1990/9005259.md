The research proposed in this application addresses basic biological questions
concerning the normal functioning of the pancreatic islet in the anglerfish.
This animal is ideally suited for the proposed studies since it affords the
highest yield of pancreatic endocrine cells of any species currently known. The
proposed studies will add significant novel insight into the anatomical
distribution and also the nutrient and neurotransmitter regulation of a key
enzyme (peptidyl-glycine alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase- PAM) which is involved
in the post- translational processing of islet endocrine hormones. Furthermore
the proposed investigations will significantly increase our understanding of the
regulation of islet hormone secretion by two major neurotransmitters,
norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, which are distributed throughout the animal
kingdom. The results of these studies will provide new insight into basic
mechanisms of islet cell function and regulation by the nervous system in
anglerfish and there is also a very high probability that these findings will be
applicable to several other species.
