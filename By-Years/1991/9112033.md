Political Scientists do not understand very well the process by which diverse
groups are forged into effective and enduring political coalitions such as
political parties. Although a variety of explanations have been advanced which
variously emphasize the importance of the political environment, the role of
leadership, the nature of basic social and economic divisions in society, and
the nature of existing political and social institutions, rigorous tests of
these competing explanations have been hampered both by inadequate theory and by
a lack of appropriate data. This ambitious doctoral dissertation research
refines and tests a theory of party formation through comparative analyses of
the formation of Christian Democratic parties in Italy and France following
World War II. Blending statistical analyses and intensive case studies this
project will test a series of interrelated hypotheses linking the development of
parties to the degree of support provided by government officials, the existence
of ancillary institutions such as churches which support party formation, and
the choices made by party leaders. When completed this study will provide
important insights into the process by which democratic political parties are
established and succeed or fail. In addition to contributing to fundamental
knowledge about political processes the lessons learned from this research
should provide valuable guidance to he development of democratic political
parties in the formerly authoritarian states of eastern europe.
