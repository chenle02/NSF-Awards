This Career Advancement project will focus on a relatively new area of research
for Dr. Catherine McNeal. Preliminary studies have established that
Californium-252-plasma desorption mass spectrometry (Cf-252 PDMS)is a valuable
experimental method to characterize large metal clusters. A variety of large
anionic platinum carbonyl clusters and cationic gold and mixed metal gold and
gold supraclusters have been investigated by this experimental approach. This
project will focus on the development of Cf-252 PDMS as a reliable and accurate
method to characterize large metal clusters and to use this approach to
unambiguously characterize intermediates and products in novel inorganic
syntheses. The first step will be to prove that the Cf-252 PDMS spectrum is an
accurate representation of solution and sample composition for a variety of
clusters. Oligomers containing as many as 20 units and over 500 platinum atoms
have been detected, and the origin of such clusters will be determined. These
clusters exhibit redox behaviour on exposure to silica. Cf-252 PDMS will be used
to determine whether these processes involve changes in cluster nuclearity or
cluster charge. An understanding of fragmentation patterns is essential in order
to distinguisn fragment ions from sample components. This project will provide
an unambiguous measurement of the stoichiometry of large supraclusters from
studies on smaller clusters of known composition and structure. %%% This Career
Advancement Award will support activities that will enhance Dr. Catherine
McNeal's research career potential. New skills which are crucial to the change
in direction of her research activities will be developed. Furthermore, this
project is strongly interactive with the research of other investigators who
will benefit from the results as well.
