Travel support is provided to scientists to attend an international conference
on the central and peripheral significance of neuropeptide Y. Neuropeptide Y,
identified in 1982, is the most abundant peptide isolated within the central
nervous system. Within the brain and also the peripheral autonomic nervous
system, this peptide co-exists with several neurotransmitters and possesses
neuromodulatory activity. Neuropeptide Y is thought to be involved in the
control of autonomic function, endocrine regulation, regulatory behaviors and
learning and memory. This conference brings together scientists from diverse
disciplines including neuroanatomy, physiology, molecular biology, behavior and
peptide chemistry with the intent of disseminating knowledge among this group
who normally would not meet together. By exchanging information, it is hoped
that new directions for research will develop leading to a better understanding
of the role of neuropeptide Y in the normal functioning of the brain and the
heart. Moreover, this line of research may prove invaluable in the management of
a number of common disease states where neuropeptide Y has been implicated to
have a role such as hypertension, coronary vasospasm, obesity and stress-related
affective disorders or precipitating presenile dementias.
