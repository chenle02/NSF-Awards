The University of Wisconsin-Superior will initiate a 5-week residential Young
Scholars project for 16 students in grades 11-12 in mathematical modeling. The
focus of the program is acid deposition. Stressing the role of mathematical
modeling, students use techniques of exploratory data analysis and linear
regression to analyze National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) data.
Groups of four use a computer and Minitab to construct a model for pH. Lectures,
lab experiments, and field trips introduce students to sources of pollutants,
chemistry of acid deposition and effects of acidification. During a two-day camp
out near acid sensitive lakes, students inspect a NADP sampling station and the
Little Rock acidification project. Using a VCR tape, students relate their
summer experiences to classmates. School science instructors, and UW-Superior
faculty assist students with a follow up research project.
