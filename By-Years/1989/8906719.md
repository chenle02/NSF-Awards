Earthworms are important constituents of most terrestrial ecosystems and have a
major influence on soil structure and organic matter decomposition processes.
This proposal uses a major historical event to focus on earthworms at the
interface of ecology and biogeography. Differential post-glacial northward
dispersal is hypothesized to have caused variation in earthworm community
structure from south to north. A hierarchical approach is used to define
hypotheses relating dispersal to landscape features, reproductive biology, and
ecological factors. Modern climatic limitation of species ranges, competitive
displacement by exotic species, and interactive structuring of communities are
proposed as alternatives. A program of collecting on four south to north
transects from glacial refugia across Wisconsinan glacial margins and on
elevational transects south of the margins will obtain data on earthworm
community structures, long-term estimates of dispersal rates, and the influence
of geographic barriers on dispersal of different ecological categories of
earthworms. Experiments measuring short-term dispersal rates and testing the
possibility of uniparental reproduction and alternative models are proposed. A
biogeographic and taxonomic data base will be created.
