9452617 Karmon This project addresses community college students who are
planning to major in Engineering and Physics. Traditionally, many students lack
intuition for the underlying physical concepts, and as a result the physics and
calculus courses present a major hurdle for beginning students, especially women
and minorities. This project will improve the learning, retention, and
application of physics concepts and principles by physics and calculus students
at Diablo Valley College. This will be accomplished by the microcomputer-based
laboratories developed by Thorton and Laws and a video projection system. This
project will create mobile units of computers that will serve different areas
and functions in teaching physics and calculus and will augment the
"Interdisciplinary, team-teaching Calculus and Physics Project" at Diablo Valley
Co lege. This project will improve calculus and physics instruction, increase
science literacy, and stimulate other colleges to adapt this approach.
