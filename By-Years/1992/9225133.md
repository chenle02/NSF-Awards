A multifacted attack on some of the basic problems of distant radio galaxies
will be carried out under this research program. Questions to be examined
include determination of the earliest times when active galaxies are formed, the
maximum power radiated by active galaxies, and the detailed physical
morphologies of the most distant (and presumably the youngest) galaxies. Some of
the investigations will make use of the 10-meter Keck reflector at Mauna Kea,
Hawaii. The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in this
research area.
