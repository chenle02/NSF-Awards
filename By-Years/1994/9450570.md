Abstract 570 Lawson Alabama Laser Research Initiative The Alabama Laser
Research Initiative proposes to establish a unique world-class Laser Research
Facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham which will provide
spectrally tunable laser pulses for photonics research and development. The
facility will help to develop systemic linkages between the science,
engineering, and mathematics infrastructure in Alabama in the area of lasers and
photonics. Specific areas of research to be pursued in this initiative include
the development of new active media for future commercial laser systems,
research into new types of nonlinear optical materials for optical switching,
and research into new types of optical systems for laser beam profile
modification to enhance the efficiency of laser systems. The new active media
research (solid state impurity doped and color centers) is spurred by the need
for lasers at new wavelengths, and will result in the development of new
irradiated color centers and impurity doped crystals. These new active media
will ultimately have applications as new types of products for commercial laser
companies, including spectrally tunable solid state lasers, passive Q-switches,
and mode-lockers. The nonlinear optical materials research is motivated by
Department of Defense (DoD) and commercial applications such as sensor
hardening, optical processing or computing, and optical switching, and will
involve the development of new highly photorefractive NLO materials. Color-
center laser-based experiments will be used to characterize these materials.
Ultimately, this will lead to improved nonlinear optical (NLO) materials for DoD
and commercial applications. The beam profile modification research is motivated
by the need to transform a Gaussian laser beam profiles into a more uniform
irradiance distributions for applications such as projection processing of
materials. The proposed research in the area of novel beam reshaping will lead
to beam reshapers for use in producing massive arrays of micro-optical elements.
This Alabama Laser Research Initiative will provide opportunities to educate
undergraduate and graduate students (including participants in the Alabama
Alliance for Minority Participation program) in laser and photonic sciences and
technologies. The emphasis of this educational process will be to develop
applied skills that will be directly used (i) in new commercial laser and
photonics companies located in Alabama; and (ii) to modernize current Alabama
based industries. In addition to educating students, the proposed research will
help to develop new laser and photonics technologies that can be transferred to
Alabama industries to develop new products and to improve manufacturing
processes.
