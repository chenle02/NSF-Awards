With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the
Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP),
Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, will implement a project titled Lincoln's
Excellent Academic Program in Science (LEAPS). The main goal of the project is
to significantly increase the pool of adequately prepared minority students for
degrees in the sciences and mathematics. The project will: 1) Recruit aspiring,
but under-prepared, high school seniors to a structured summer bridge program
aimed at providing the skills to master the gate-keeping and bottleneck science
and mathematics courses; 2) Revise STEM gate-keeping and bottleneck courses; 3)
Integrate student research and other active-learning opportunities into STEM
curriculum; and 4) Provide undergraduate STEM scholarships and awards.

Intellectual Merit: The project will improve the quality of STEM students
through a comprehensive program. Students who successfully complete the summer
bridge program will be professionally mentored, counseled, advised and supported
throughout their college careers. Students will participate in research
internships and be prepared to attend graduate schools upon graduation. Tuition
scholarships will be made on a merit basis to allow students to concentrate on
their academic work. The project also builds on expertise acquired from the
implementation of the LASER, MARC and MASTAP programs at Lincoln University. The
project continues the institutions tradition of establishing alliances and
partnerships with other universities and research institutions in order to
ensure the best possible exposure to the world of research for the faculty and
students.

Broader Impact: The project will increase the pool of science and mathematics
graduates as well as the number of graduates gaining admission to graduate
schools. The proposed program addresses the issues of under-prepared minority
students entering college, a group that is steadily growing in number. Data and
information generated from this project will improve the general knowledge of
science and mathematics education.
