ABSTRACT CTS-97-4907 S. Kumar/Penn. State U. While polymer mixtures are utilized
extensively is practical applications, the prediction of their thermodynamic
properties from a knowledge of molecular structure and interactions is an
unsolved problem. It is our assertion that a quantitative understanding of
polymer phase behavior is necessary to design macromolecular materials with
desired properties for specific applications. With this goal, in this work we
propose utilize new simulation methods, developed by us and by others, to
enumerate the free energies or the chemical potentials and the phase diagrams of
the following classes of industrially relevant polymer mixtures: (a) The phase
equilibria of hydrocarbon based blends where the components are of disparate
monomer structure; (b) The compatibilization of immiscible polymer mixtures by
copolymers of different microstructure; and (c) The phase behavior of confined
polymer mixtures, such as those encountered in paints and in lubricants. This
molecular based understanding of the properties of industrially relevant polymer
mixture will also assist in the development and the critical evaluation of
molecular models of polymer thermodynamics.
