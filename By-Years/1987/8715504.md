One of the fundamental problems in Lie theory is the determination of the
weight multiplicities of the irreducible highest weight representations of a Lie
algebra. The generating function of the multiplicities is called the character
of the representation. This project will consider characters of the irreducible
highest weight representations of certain infinite dimensional Lie algebras and
superalgebras. Specifically, the principal investigator will examine these
characters for affine Lie algebras, Virasoro algebras, the Neveu-Schwarz
algebras and the Ramond algebras.
