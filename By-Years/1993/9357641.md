This research, supported by the National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will continue Mrowka's program to use gauge theory to investigate the
differential topology of 4- manifolds. In particular, he will work toward a
better understanding of Donaldson's invariants and what they tell
about4-manifolds. The National Science Foundation Young Investigator award
recognizes outstanding young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's
strong potential for continued professional growth as a research mathematician
and for significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
