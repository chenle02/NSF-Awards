The proposed project is concerned with the development, analysis and
applications of numerical simulation tools to a number of problems in
computational sciences, in particular, in computational physics and
computational material sciences. It is a continuation of PI's past research work
in this area that has contributed to the modeling, analysis, and computation of
various problems in superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and phase
transitions in binary and multicomponent alloys.

In the proposed work, while building upon the past progress, the PI will take on
new initiatives in the study of some interesting physical problems at various
time and spatial scales and in the design of new algorithms and efficient
solvers which can then be used to understand experimental phenomena and the
underlying physical and material properties. The proposed works are to be
carried out in the following aspects: to develop or refine mathematical models
for the underlying physical problems, so to enlarge the range of validity of
such models; to analyze these models in order to gain further understanding of
their properties and of their solutions; to develop, analyze, and implement
algorithms, in particular, parallel and adaptive algorithms, for the numerical
simulation of these models; and to use our algorithms and codes, together with
physicists and material scientists, to study some interesting phenomena in
physics and material sciences, including the further studies on the quantized
vortices in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates, on the effects of
fluctuation and on the validity and the extension of mezoscopic phenomenological
models. While we will focus on developing innovative mathematical theory and
computational algorithms, comparisons with the physical experiments will also be
made whenever possible.
