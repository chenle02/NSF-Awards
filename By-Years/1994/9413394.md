Abstract - Suib - 9413394 This research involves the use of microwave heating in
the presence and absence of catalysts for conversion of methane into higher
hydrocarbons via oligomerization reactions. In addition, microwave-induced
heating of precursors of manganese oxide sols and gels will be used to prepare
highly dispersed microporous manganese oxides that will be used as
oligomerization catalysts. Optimization of reactor types, modes of operation
(contact times, pulse versus continuous), and addition of dielectrics will be
done to optimize conversion and selectivity. In situ characterization methods
will be developed to monitor the mechanisms of reaction. The goals of the
project are to prepare microporous manganese dioxide (MnO2) Microwave-Induced
Oligomerization (MIO) catalysts, to study MIO of methane to higher hydrocarbons,
to elucidate mechanistic details of MIO reactions, and to study fundamental
aspects of reactor configurations, additives (chain propagators, dielectrics),
temperature measurements, magnetic field effects, and reaction conditions. All
reactions will be done in a flow system. Characterization studies will involve
product analyses by gas chromatography mas spectrometry methods, microwave-
induced acoustic studies of heat and energy transfer in such systems, and
Fourier transform infrared studies of hydrocarbon intermediates and products.
The long-term goal is to understand factors which control product selectivity
and long-term stability of microwave-induced reactions.
