Given its earthquake history, Charleston, South Carolina had undergone an
earthquake education program prior to Hurricane Hugo striking on September 21,
1989. This study seeks to examine how effectively earthquake education in the
Charleston, South Carolina area transferred to appropriate preparedness and
response activities for Hurricane Hugo. The primary data collection methodology
will consist of telephone interviews with a sample of participants in the
earthquake education program and a control sample of residents in the greater
Charleston area who did not participate in the program. Supplemented data will
be obtained through more extensive personal interviews with a smaller subsample
of persons who participated in the phone survey.
