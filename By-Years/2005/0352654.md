In this Small Grant Exploratory Research proposal, a new and novel direction in
finite element methodology is pursued. Polygonal finite elements provide greater
flexibility in mesh generation and are better-suited for applications in solid
mechanics which involve a significant change in the topology of the material
domain. In this proposal, recent advances in meshfree approximations,
computational geometry, and computer graphics will be used to construct
conforming trial and test approximations on polygonal finite elements.
Computational algorithms (optimization scheme) for mesh generation with
polygonal elements will be developed, and numerical studies on the accuracy and
convergence of the finite element technique will be conducted for elliptic
boundary-value problems. The results of this study can potentially open-up new
pathways in finite element research, lead to the wider usage of polygonal finite
element methods in solid mechanics and computational materials science, and also
provide impetus for the construction of cubature rules on polytopes.
