The Novikov higher signature conjecture, a deep problem in the topology of
manifolds, follows from a sufficiently precise understanding of the K-theory of
the unitary dual, viewed as a noncommutative space, of the group in question.
This project focuses on issues related to this conjecture, in particular (1)
approximation properties of group C*-algebras, (2) uniform embeddability of
discrete groups in Hilbert space and (3) the use of controlled methods to study
the K-theory of group C*-algebras. The investigator will also study parallel
problems for C*-algebras associated to metric spaces.

In studying the noncommutative dual spaces of discrete groups, with particular
emphasis on the important Novikov and Baum-Connes conjectures, this project fits
squarely within Alain Connes' program of noncommutative geometry. A recurring
theme will be to incorporate a greater variety of ideas from geometric group
theory into the study of analytic properties of groups. Indeed, the project will
provide a forum for promoting sustained interaction between researchers in
noncommutative geometry and geometric group theory.
