The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Ralph Isovitsch. The co-PIs are Michael Adams
and Ruquia Ahmed-Schofield. A pilot program will be developed to initiate
freshman and sophomores into research experiences. It will illustrate at an
early stage in a student's career the connection between what they learn in the
classroom and real world problems. In the first year students will participate
in an introductory seminar where they will learn program expectations and
interact with possible research mentors. They will enroll in a one-credit
research foundations course. Students will do three-week rotations through the
labs of potential research mentors. This will lead to a summer intramural
research experience. In the second year they will present their work at a local
ACS poster session and continue on their research projects. The capstone
experience will be a summer extramural research experience at a partner
institution that has expressed interest in accepting Xavier students.
Prospective partners are Louisiana State University, University of Maryland,
Tulane University and the University of New Orleans. During the planning phase,
links with two-year colleges, local industrial and governmental organizations
will be developed. Efforts to recruit high school students will be undertaken
involving the Xavier U. Chapter of the ACS Student Affiliates. This award is
cofunded by EHR/HBCU-UG.
