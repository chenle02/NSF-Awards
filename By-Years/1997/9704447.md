Clusters of workstations are increasingly being used as a platform for parallel
computing. Parallel applications executing on workstation clusters must be
fault-tolerant in order to survive network and workstation failures, and must
have the ability to withdraw from a workstation on detecting owner activity.
Malleable parallel applications also have the ability to dynamically shrink or
expand their degree of parallelism. Preliminary research indicates that this
property leads to significant performance advantages in cluster environments
because of the transient nature of the underlying resources. The proposed
research involves the design and implementation of an execution environment that
supports malleable parallel applications on clusters of workstations. Domain-
specific reconfiguration mechanisms that enable changes in the degree of
parallelism of a program will be designed and implemented for three important
classes of parallel applications, specifically loosely synchronous structured
grid-oriented applications, loosely synchronous unstructured grid-oriented
applications, and a class of asynchronous irregular applications from the domain
of operations research. These mechanisms will be integrated into specialized
run-time libraries that support these applications. Finally, algorithms and
techniques for minimizing the overhead of dynamic reconfiguration will be
developed.
