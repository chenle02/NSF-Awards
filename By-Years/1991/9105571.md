Professors Paulsen and Blecher will study questions arising in the theory of
operator spaces and operator algebras, their duals and their tensor products.
They will also study reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Hilbert modules.
Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers.
These operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in
pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain
important families of such objects.
