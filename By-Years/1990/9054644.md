Computer-based materials will be created to enable high school students to
develop specific concepts in advanced mathematics and trigonometry through
guided exploration of sound and hearing. The novelty of this approach lies in
its integration of science and mathematics to promote active, situated learning
and in its use of computer-generated manipulatives to foster the development of
physical intuition as a precursor to mathematical abstraction. Computer
generated sound waves are audible and displayed graphically and as an equation.
Changing the either the sound or the graph or the equation will produce
appropriate changes in the other representations. Operations are performed on
the waves in various "rooms", so that waves van be manipulated, added,
multiplied, etc. Mathematics of trigonometry, vector addition, logarithmic
behavior and Fourier series can be studied. The materials will be field tested
in area high schools and used in preservice and inservice teacher education
projects under a subcontract with UC Irvine.
