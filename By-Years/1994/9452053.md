This project will enhance the student-appeal and effectiveness of instruction
for Calculus I, II and III; Differential Equations; and Finite Mathematics. It
will build upon the groundwork laid down by other projects that emphasize the
use of graphing calculators, but will exceed the calculators' limitations by
incorporating the greater power of computers. The use of graphing calculators in
mathematics instruction has been well received. However, in certain areas -- 3-D
graphics, contour plots, implicit plotting, analytic solutions, etc.-- the
calculators lack power, convenience and flexibility. Graphing calculators are
also not well-suited for Finite Mathematics instruction. By using graphing
calculators and computers, the project will enhance the understanding of topics,
and give students the technical tools to better analyze &amp; solve problems.
Forty experiments/projects for the Calculus and Differential Equations courses
will be implemented under the grant. The design will be to emphasize the
qualitative properties (such as the shape of a curve) of the topics under study,
rather than the analytic analysis of expressions (algebraic calculations). The
recent applications of mathematics (e.g., linear programming or graph theory) in
disciplines such as economics, biology, and political science require such
methods of analysis. An additional 10 experiments/projects will be implemented
for Finite Mathematics, based solely on computers. To accomplish this, the
project is seeking support for a 35-station computer lab, with appropriate
supporting equipment.
