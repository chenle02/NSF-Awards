This proposal will test PES-51 for the in-situ bioremediation of oil spill
contamination. PES-51 is a surfactant derived from oil- degrading bacteria. A
bench-scale test program using contaminated soil from McMurdo has been designed
to be completed before field testing can take place. The soil will be shipped to
the University of Alaska to test the feasibility of remediating McMurdo soil
using PES-51. A survey grid to determine the extent and degree of contamination
in McMurdo from past operations, both horizontally and vertically has been
designed. This survey will consist of two parts 1)a compilation of documentation
of fuel spills over the history of McMurdo Station, and 2) a sampling program
that includes: a) preliminary mapping of those areas around the station that are
"clean" and to delineate contaminated areas, b) a detailed sampling program in
known contaminated areas to determine the vertical and horizontal extent of the
contamination to the degree possible, and c) a "hot spot" sampling program for
small spills or isolated contamination sites in otherwise clean areas.
