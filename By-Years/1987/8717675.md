This is a project to identify and quantify atmospheric ions naturally occurring
in the troposphere. It employs a tandem mass spectrometer in conjunction with a
specially developed collisional dissociation chamber that strips loosely bound
ligand molecules from the central core ion, thus allowing mass spectrometric
observation of the core ion itself. The operation of the apparatus depends on
the development, in an earlier stage of the research, of a gas.flow system for
extracting the ions from air at atmospheric pressure and injecting them into the
vacuum system of the mass spectrometer. The objective is to survey the natural
existence in the lower atmosphere of molecular ions and ionized molecular
clusters. The chemical nature of the ions is to be determined, as well as their
origins, their abundance under a range of environmental conditions, and their
roles as indicators of trace gases. Ultimately the work is expected to identify
the possible roles of ions in aerosol formation and growth.
