The proposed research involves the exploration of new approaches for physics
beyond the Standard Model. Many of these approaches are inspired by string
theory and concerns the implications of string theory for traditional particle
physics. The research of this proposal focuses on three major areas. First, the
possibility of extra space time dimensions continues to impact upon how the
standard model will be changed at energies accessible with the next generation
of accelerators. These implications will continue to be investigated as our
understanding of extra dimensions becomes clarified. Secondly, in order to
understand supersymmetry breaking, the PI will investigate non-supersymmetric
strings and their phenomenological properties. Special attention will be given
to modulus stabilization. Finally the PI intends to pursue new ideas on how to
construct and analyze Type I string models. The phenomenology of these theories
will be investigated in detail.
