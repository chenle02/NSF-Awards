9724781 Branson This is a cooperative research project between U.S. principal
investigators Thomas Branson and Palle Jorgensen of the Department of
Mathematics, University of Iowa, and A. Rod Gover of the Queensland University
of Technology School of Mathematics and D.W. Robinson of the Australian National
University School of Mathematical Sciences. The U.S. investigators will spend a
total of approximately 105 person- days in Australia working with their
counterparts on invariant elliptic and subelliptic operators and their role in
geometry and representation theory. Among the goals is a deeper understanding of
the conformal and tangential Cauchy- Riemann geometrics. They will proceed on
the basis of a new method with the common feature that control of the spatial x-
variable as well as the dual frequency x-variable is required. In this sense,
the proposed work is connected on a fundamental level with modern problems in
wavelet theory, and may in the long run shed light on the underlying geometric
structure of wavelets.
