0200961&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop the geometrical theory of invariant manifolds and &lt;br/&gt;foliations
for semiflows in Banach space with emphasis on how this can be
&lt;br/&gt;applied to important areas of science. Of particular interest are how
one &lt;br/&gt;may establish the existence of these structures knowing that good
&lt;br/&gt;approximations exist in some sense. Applications which will be
addressed &lt;br/&gt;include analysis of lattice dynamical systems, the
existence of modulated &lt;br/&gt;waves in fluid models, the form and dynamics
of vortices in superconducting &lt;br/&gt;materials, the form and dynamics of
material phase boundaries, including &lt;br/&gt;those with random perturbations
in the driving forces, and the development &lt;br/&gt;of good computational
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since most physical systems are highly complex,
it is usually impossible to &lt;br/&gt;solve the equations which are proposed to
describe and predict the relevant &lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena. Even if it were
possible to solve one of these &lt;br/&gt;equations, the imprecision in
measurement and our imperfect understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the actual physical
laws may call into question the meaning of the &lt;br/&gt;solutions. This
project will develop a theory whereby, under certain &lt;br/&gt;conditions, one
can describe the nature of solutions and guarantee that the &lt;br/&gt;physical
system behaves according to this description to a reasonable &lt;br/&gt;degree
of accuracy. Special attention will be given to equations describing
&lt;br/&gt;phenomena in material science, including phase transitions and &lt;br
/&gt;superconductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&l
