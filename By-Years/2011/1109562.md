Ziane&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1109562&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project addresses various
mathematical questions relating to the existence, regularity, qualitative
features, and large-time behavior of solutions and to the asymptotic dependence
on physical parameters of certain systems of partial differential equations,
such as the primitive equations of the ocean and the Navier-Stokes equations. In
particular, the investigator studies the inviscid primitive equations of the
ocean and develops regularizing schemes that are analyzed from the point of view
of convergence. A secondary aim of the project is to investigate stochastic
perturbations of the primitive equations. This includes the study of singular
perturbation problems of the stochastic primitive equation with a multiplicative
noise, as well as stochastic boundary problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This
project addresses various mathematical questions relating to important physical
models of fluid flows, such as the Navier-Stokes equations and the primitive
equations of the ocean. These equations are the fundamental equations of
geophysical fluid dynamics and climate prediction. It is well established, based
on physical grounds and collected experimental data, that atmospheric and
oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum of spatial and time scales,
which makes climate models that include large-scale circulations of flows in the
ocean and atmosphere too difficult to study analytically and extraordinarily
expensive to study computationally. The project seeks to provide a rigorous
mathematical framework for these models and to determine possible limits on the
range of their applicability. It provides adequate approximate solutions and
establishes rigorously the validity of these approximations. The project also
studies these important geophysical models in the presence of random
perturbations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
