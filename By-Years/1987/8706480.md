Drs. Michael Klug and Michael Kaufman propose a structural and metabolic study
of interactions within the hindgut of crickets. The structure of and population
dynamics within most microbial communities are not well understood. Constraints
imposed in the study of natural microbial systems lead to this proposal to study
localized bacterial communities in the hindgut of crickets (Orthoptera:
Gryllidae, Gryllotalpidae) in order to address these fundamental questions. The
principle advantages of examining the cricket hindgut system include the
opportunity to re-associate germ-free insects with specific populations of
bacteria in order to test postulates and about interactions within fermentative
communities. These investigations will elucidate successional patterns,
metabolic characteristics, and factors regulating populations within the
fermentative bacterial community. Furthermore, they will address basic questions
concerning the relationship between populations of bacteria and between
microorganisms and insects.
