This project is concerned with the existence of composition laws for sums of
squares. The principal investigator will determine for which positive integers
r,s, and n one can write the product of a sum of r squares times a sum of s
squares as a sum of n squares. The problem will be approached using algebra,
combinatorics and topology. This project is related to the classical study of
quadratic forms. One of the early acheivements in this field is the discovery by
Gauss that every positive whole number is the sum of four squares. This area is
important not only in pure number theory but in geometry and the mathematics of
relativity.
