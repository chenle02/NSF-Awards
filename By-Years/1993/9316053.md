9316053 Girgis This proposal is for partial support for travel to the 11th Power
System Computation Conference (PSCC). This year the conference will be held in
Avignon, France, from August 30 to September 3. Since its inception in 1963,
PSCC has evolved to become the leading international conference outside of the
U.S. in the area of power systems applications, and attracts key people from
around the world. This year the conference will offer two panel sessions on very
timely topics as well as over 150 technical papers over a wide range of current
interests. ***
