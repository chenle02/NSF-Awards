educational and training program on pharmaceutical engineering in the Department
of Chemical Engineering at Columbia University. It will provide tuition and
stipend for three graduate students for three years. The pharmaceutical industry
will provide similar support for additional seven students. This program is
designed to meet the vital need of the pharmaceutical industry for engineers
specially trained in modern processing and manufacturing techniques. Five new
graduate level courses in different aspects of manufacturing of pharmaceuticals
will be part of the curriculum. The curriculum will be developed with close
cooperation between the Columbia University faculty and industrial partners.
Adjunct faculty drawn from the pharmaceutical industry will participate in
instruction and mentoring. A ten week industrial internship with faculty
oversight will be a requirement. An advisory committee consisting of senior
personnel from the pharmaceutical industry and academe will provide guidance and
evaluation.
