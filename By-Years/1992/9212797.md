This project will organize, convene and report on an NSF regionally- based
workshop on architectural research needs in earthquake hazard mitigation. The
workshop will review the current state-of-the-art in relation to earthquake
hazard mitigation in architectural and nonstructural systems, and relation to
broader land-use planning issues and physical urban design issues. Future
research needs will be identified and prioritized for these same systems under
the goals of the Architectural and Mechanical Systems Program (AMS) program
element. The workshop will focus on West-Coast issues.
