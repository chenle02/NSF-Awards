This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
of Professor Satoru Masamune, which is directed at the synthesis of new bonding
types for molecules that contain silicon(Si), germanium(Ge) or tin(Sn) atoms as
replacements for the usual carbon atom. These new structures will undoubtedly
lead to new chemistry and physical properties and possibly to important new
materials. This research will be concerned with two specific aspects of Si, Ge,
and Sn chemistry: 1) the synthesis and chemistry of small rings including the
cyclopropane, bicyclobutane, and tricyclobutane (tetrahedrane) systems which
consist, fully or partially, of Si, Ge, or Sn, e.g., tetrasilatetrahedrane and
(mono)silatetrahedrane; and 2) the construction and characterization of multiple
bonds of the digermene, disilyne, germathione, and silyne types. These two
series of systems are chemically interrelated and the compounds in one series
are converted into those in the other series. Cyclotrimetallanes and
dimetallenes and tetrasilabicyclo?1.1.0!butane derivatives have already yielded
to synthesis and the initial ground work has been completed. Additional work
will systematize the now known systems. Major emphasis will be on the synthesis
of tetrasilatetrahedrane and disilyne derivatives, and parent disilene and
digermene.
