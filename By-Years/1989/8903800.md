Metamorphosis consists of a dramatic, temporally compressed series of
developmental events that includes cell death, cell movement, cell division, and
tissue transformation. It thus offers numerous developmental processes for
simultaneous study. Knowledge of the developmentally timed endocrine control of
metamorphosis in amphibians and insects is extensive. However, most of the
animal species with metamorphic development are marine invertebrates, and most
marine invertebrates have externally, not hormonally, triggered metamorphoses.
The research described here will utilize the marine slug Phestilla sibogae to
explore further the mechanisms by which externally induced metamorphosis is
activated within the larva. Because of their proven utility as a model for such
studies, larvae of Phestilla will serve as a source of tissues for in vitro
investigation of their priming for metamorphosis (i.e. competence) and their
specific chemical sensitivities. Neurophysiological experiments will be used to
locate and characterize the neurons and nervous mechanisms that bring abut
tissue-specific responses throughout the larva. At the completion of these
studies Dr. Hadfield should have sufficient understanding of the inductive
pathway to begin examination of the intracellular responses that culminate in
metamorphosis. %%% There are hundreds of thousands of marine invertebrate
species which undergo metamorphosis. The understanding of this process in any of
these species is very slight compared to that in insects and amphibians. The
current proposal is to continue a study of metamorphosis in one such model
marine invertebrate.
