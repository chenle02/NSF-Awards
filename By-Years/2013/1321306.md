This research study examines the extent and ways in which the first three
Cohorts of MSP Partnership projects have sustained the accomplishments made
during their respective grant periods. The study addresses two interrelated
research questions: 1) What strategies did the initial cohorts of MSPs use to
sustain and nurture their outcomes beyond their NSF award? and 2) What were the
mediators that either facilitated or hindered projects' efforts to sustain these
outcomes? Guided by a logic model that lays out a proposed theory of
sustainability, the study uses a mixed method approach to investigate factors
influencing those changes at both school district and Institution of Higher
Education (IHE) levels. The study is conducted in two phases: Phase 1 involves
document review, discussions with current and former NSF project officers, and
interviews with PIs and Co-PIs to provide a broad brush examination of project
sustainability. Phase 2 includes case studies in a sample of projects to provide
a fuller assessment of facilitators and hindrances. The specific approach for
each case study will depend on the type of practice being sustained and the
partners and participants involved in the practice.
