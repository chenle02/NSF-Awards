This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the thermodynamics of adsorption on well characterized
surfaces in a unique way. A direct adsorption single crystal microcalorimeter
has been developed by Professor Campbell and his students at the University of
Washington which has the sensitivity to directly determine the enthalpy of
adsorption of a range of metal on oxide and metal on semiconductor systems. In
addition, the adsorption of metals on polymers, and hydrocarbons on platinum are
being investigated using this new instrument. This unique information is crucial
to the understanding of a variety of important surface processes, ranging from
electronic device fabrication to heterogeneous catalysis. In order to understand
surface reaction chemistry, which forms the basis of many important interfacial
technologies, the basic thermodynamic information about the heats of adsorption
of atoms and molecules on surfaces must be known. This basic research effort
addresses this question through a unique experimental approach to the direct
measurement of these quantities. The results of these investigations will find
wide application in technologies including semiconductor processing and
catalytic chemistry.
