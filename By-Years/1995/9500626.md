DMS-9500626 Shreve A singular stochastic control problem arises in finance when
the presence of transaction costs makes constant portfolio adjustment
prohibitively expensive. It is proposed to examine such problems using viscosity
solution analysis of the relevant Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman equation. Particular
interest will be paid to sensitivity of value functions and trading strategies
to small transaction costs. It is also proposed to develop non-Markov methods
for such problems, along the lines of duality and martingale methods used to
handle other types of market incompleteness. The celebrated Black-Scholes
formula for option pricing assumes that trading can be done without transactions
costs, and the hedging portfolio constructed by this formula constantly adjusts
the amount of stock held. When a non-zero transaction cost is introduced to the
Black-Scholes model, the hedging portfolio for an option become practically
useless. It is proposed to construct alternate continuous- time models which
incorporate the presence of transaction costs, and to determine how the size of
transaction costs influence option prices and hedging portfolios in these
models.
