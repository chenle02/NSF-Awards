This award will support studies by Luther, Miller and Hendershott, on low
frequency oscillations of sea level in the Pacific Basin. Numerical models of
barotropic vorticity waves, fortnightly and monthly tides, and island-trapped
Kelvin waves give signals that can be recognized in sea level records of Pacific
Island's tide gauges. The studies combine data analysis, theory and numerical
modeling to interpret the sub-inertial modes of oscillation and will be relevant
to dealiasing altimetry data. The theoretical prediction of free modes from
numerical models with realistic topography will enable for the first time the
use of analysis techniques borrowed from seismology, like "stacking", which look
very promising.
