9629037 Verdoorn Glutamate receptors are proteins that help brain cells
communicate with each other. These receptors recognized the chemical signaling
molecular glutamate and generate an electrical signal when glutamate is found.
The proposed studies attempt to understand the mechanism whereby the glutamate
receptor protein specifically recognizes glutamate. A goal of this project is to
purposely alter the structure of the receptor protein and then study how the
alteration changes the action of glutamate on the receptor. The receptor will be
studied by a technique for measuring the tiny electrical currents generated by
the receptor. This technique is called patch clamp and can be used to examine
the behavior of a single glutamate receptor protein in real time. The studies
will be guided by models of the shape of the glutamate receptor protein in the
area that recognizes glutamate. These high resolution technologies will
eventually allow the design of drugs that will alter the behavior of glutamate
receptors. Such drugs may be useful in the treatment of epilepsy, stroke,
traumatic head injury, and memory problems.
