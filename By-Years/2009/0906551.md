A powerful method to do inference in models with finitely many parametric
constraints is the empirical likelihood approach. This nonparametric
maximization method was originally introduced by Owen in order to construct
confidence regions for the underlying parameter. In the mean time the empirical
likelihood method has been shown to also result in efficient estimation and
testing. Needed are generalizations of this method that allow for semiparametric
constraints and allow for infinitely many (parametric or semiparametric)
constraints. The investigator extends the scope of the empirical likelihood into
these two directions. This research advances the theory of estimation in
semiparametric models and provides new methods to efficiently analyze data in a
wide array of concrete problems. In the process technical problems of
independent interest such a central limit theorems for quadratic forms with
increasing dimensions are solved.

Semiparametric models are widespread in many fields that use statistics.
Although this research is theoretical in nature, it has a strong practical
impact by providing more effective inference methods for all those fields. For
example, results on time series have applications in economic forecasting and in
mathematical finance; results on bivariate models have applications in actuarial
sciences and in medical research. In medical research bivariate data naturally
arise as pre- and post-treatment measurements. The research will provide ample
opportunities to prepare graduate students for careers in both industry and
academics.
