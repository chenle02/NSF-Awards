As telecommunication networks become more complex, the demands for capacity and
data compression become more severe. This research is set up to develop a
general theory of information flow in networks. The networks will have arbitrary
interference among the transmitters and receivers, and arbitrary noise at the
receivers. Such a theory would encompass hybrid communication networks
consisting of fiber optics, wire and electromagnetic media. The primary attack
will be to use Shannon-sense information theory, thus providing the best
achievable limits for distributed capacity and distributed data compression.
Specific problems include progressive transmission, the sequential refinement of
information and the determination of the capacity region of broadcast channels
and multiple user channels, both with and without feedback. Also to be
considered is the general question of the efficient distribution of information;
thus providing guidance to problems in network information theory may lead to
useful heuristics for suboptimal data communication procedures when the optimal
procedure is judged to be practically unachievable for reasons of cost or
computation time.//
