This project focuses on the study of certain special functions which appear
naturally in several physical applications as well as in important problems in
mathematics: the uniformization functions of geometric structures, the Painlevé
transcendents and the Schwarzian functions. The investigator will use model
theory, a branch of mathematical logic, combined with other areas of
mathematics, such as geometry and algebra, to answer far-reaching questions in
functional transcendence theory related to the existence of algebraic relations
among the special functions. Applications of this study to other areas of
mathematics, such as number theory, is also a major goal of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decades, following works around the
Pila-Wilkie counting theorem in the context of o-minimality, there has been a
surge in interest around functional transcendence results, in part due to their
connection with special points conjectures. In this project, the investigator
will use an entirely new approach, centered around the model theory of
differential fields, to attack some of the main open questions about the
algebraic nature of automorphic functions. A major goal is to establish the Ax-
Lindemann-Weierstrass and Ax-Schanuel Theorems with derivatives for
uniformization functions of Shimura varieties as well as other geometric
structures. The project will also investigate the classification of
geometrically trivial strongly minimal sets in differentially closed fields and
aim to characterize the structure of the sets of solutions of the Painlevé
equations and the Schwarzian equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
