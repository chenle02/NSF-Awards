This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental, Population and
Organismic Biology at the University of Colorado at Bolder to continue their
successful Research Experience for Undergraduates SITE in ecology, behavior and
evolution. The program provides undergraduates contemplating a career in the
biological sciences with: 1) an introduction to current research in the areas of
soil ecology, plant and insect ecology and evolution, plant physiology and
behavioral ecology; 2) the opportunity to conduct original research in a
supportive, interactive environment; 3) instruction in the planning, execution,
and interpretation of research in the areas of ecology, evolution and behavior.
All participating students will attend a course that will introduce them to the
fields of ecology, evolution and behavior, aid in planning and executing an
original research project, give them an introduction to statistical analysis,
and provide information on applying to graduate school. They will also present
the results of their research in a short seminar at the end of the summer.
Students will work with faculty members on their projects, and will also be able
to interact with other students and post-docs in their laboratories.
