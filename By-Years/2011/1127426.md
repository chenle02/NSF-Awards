This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a high performance, environmentally benign, and low cost renewable
bioasphalt from recycled agricultural byproduct. The availability issue of
petroleum based asphalt, along with the high cost of petroleum and the fuel
price to transport the asphalt from a centralized refinery plant to distribution
sites, has increased the price of asphalt substantially. The use of the
petroleum asphalt also generates hydrocarbon fumes, which irritate workers and
create a nuisance for the surrounding community. Because of concerns over
dependence on foreign oil, a high asphalt price and unstable supply, and air
emissions, non-petroleum based bioasphalt made from renewable sources needs to
be studied and developed. In this Phase II research, the bioasphalt production
technology developed in Phase I will be scaled up to produce samples for
evaluation in the field. The commercial viability of this technology will be
demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the
use of a renewable and agricultural based product to reduce the use of petroleum
asphalt, eliminate the odor and emissions associated with traditional petroleum
asphalt, and improve the product performance.
