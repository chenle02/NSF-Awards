This award supports visits over a three year period by the various investigators
and a graduate student, including Drs. Alexander Brown, Jeffrey L. Linsky,
Stephen A. Drake, and Jay A. Bookbinder of the University of Colorado Boulder to
the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) of the CSIRO Division of
Radiophysics in Marsfield, NSW, Australia, to work with Dr. Ronald T. Stewart.
The investigators will study stellar radio emission with an array of radio
telescopes called the Australia Telescope (AT). They will exploit the potential
of the AT through a collaboration combining their experience of observing radio
stars using the Very Large Array (VLA) with the capabilities of this new
instrument. The Americans will make two collaborative research visits each year
during a three year period to study the coronae and winds of a broad range of
stars located in almost all parts of the H-R diagram and ranging in age from
pre-main sequence stars to the late stages of stellar evolution. These
investigations of both thermal and nonthermal radio emission processes in
stellar atmospheres are logical extensions of their current research.
