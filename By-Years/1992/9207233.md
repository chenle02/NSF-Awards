Professor Wieman will use novel techniques of atomic optical cooling and
trapping to measure parity nonconservation in radioactive isotopes of the alkali
atoms, cesium and francium. The electron-quark neutral current coupling
constants which are measured in atomic parity nonconservation are different from
those probed in other precision electroweak measurements, this test is uniquely
sensitivity to a variety of new physics which may exist beyond the standard
model.
