US-French Collaboration in Computational Neuroscience, Paris, November 29-30,
2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a US-French workshop, led by Aude
Oliva and Alain Destexhe, on binational collaboration in computational
neuroscience. The workshop builds on interests by NSF, Agence Nationale de la
Recherche (ANR), and other agencies in collaborative research in this rapidly
developing area of research. The workshop will explore the intellectual
opportunities, educational and economically relevant impacts, and practical
considerations needed for US-French collaboration to be successful. The workshop
will be attended by US and French researchers, and representatives from US and
French funding organizations. A report from the workshop will be made available
at http://www.nsf.gov/crcns.
