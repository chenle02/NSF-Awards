An Information System (IS) can be viewed as managing a model of some slice of
reality for the purpose of supporting inquiries. A variety of problems in
information management, including database design, query optimization and
seeking/integrating appropriate source of data, are known to benefit from
knowledge concerning the semantics of the application problem. Research on
knowledge representation and reasoning therefore has significant potential
applications in IS. Description Logics (DLs) are a family of knowledge
representation schemes that allow one to describe and define concepts describing
objects in terms of their membership in classes and their inter-relationships to
other objects. They have the advantage of well-defined semantics and well-
studied properties concerning the complexity of deductions, including some
efficient implementations. DLs have already been applied by researchers,
including the author, to data management tasks such as intelligent data
exploration and schema integration. This project investigates extensions of DLs
that are motivated by the specific desire to support the development of better
information systems. The extensions involve (1) making DLs more expressive as
query and view definition languages by allowing variables to appear in
descriptions for the purposes of pattern matching; (2) providing features for
capturing uniqueness constraints, which express domain semantics very relevant
to databases and query optimization; and (3) capturing significant aspects of
Event-Condition-Action rules used in active databases, with the goal of
supporting tools for reasoning about the consistency, interaction and inter-
relationship of rules. The resulting languages and reasoners will support
improved capture of data semantics, expressing more selective queries and
presenting them more effectively, evaluating queries more efficiently, and the
development of tools that help manage the DBMS components (schema, rules, etc.).
