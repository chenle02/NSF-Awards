The objectives of this award are to develop a software system for complete
three-dimensional structural determination of biological macromolecules by
electron microscopy and image processing at atomic reolution. This will include
i) creation of a rational and complete three-dimensinal database for both
electron images and diffraction pattersn, ii) the coordiantion of a large
collection of existing programs, iii) development of new algorithms for image
processing, reconstruction and visualzation and iv) dissemination by ftp, gopher
or other mechanisms' and training via workshops held a national meetings and
Gordon conferences and a well-maintained manual.
