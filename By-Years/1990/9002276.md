An important factor in estimating a tsunami hazard from a particular source is
knowledge of what previous tsunamis from that general region have done. The
record of these effects is far from complete for the U.S. West Coast. Given a
return rate of 100 to 200 years for many great Pacific earthquakes, and the
changes in the population density, coastal development, and coastal area usage
since the 19th Century, the hazard from a repeat of these events is
significantly increased. Of the 13 tsunamis with amplitudes of 1 meter or more
which occurred on the West Coast, only the latest two, 1960 and 1964, caused
damage of more than a few thousand dollars. These waves would not have been
particularly noteworthy had they occurred in the 19th Century or early 20th
Century; reports of their effects would be limited to local sources. Conversely,
tsunamis which did occur in the 18th Century without causing significant damage
could be destructive if they are repeated in the future. Automatic recording
tide gages were installed at San Diego and San Francisco, California, and
Astoria, Oregon in 1854, the earliest operated in the Pacific. The publication
of newspapers on the West Coast began at a somewhat earlier date. Using
contemporary records, extant tide gage records, and a tide prediction computer
program, this project will improve the quality of the historical record by
adding new descriptive and quantitative data, correcting errors in existing
knowledge, and reducing the uncertainty of the source and effects of reports of
early tsunamis. Analyses of the resulting improved data base will show the
unique features of the hazard. This information is essential to the design of
effective tsunami warning systems and other counter measures.
