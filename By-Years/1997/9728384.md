Ketterson 97-28384 The primary objective of this research is to explore how the
hormone testosterone influences behavior and physiology in a male bird including
any effects on a male's ability to survive and reproduce in the wild. The
results will enhance understanding of adaptation and constraint and help us to
predict how animals respond evolutionarily to changing environments. The
Principal Investigators (PIs) treat free-living male dark-eyed juncos (Junco
hyemalis, commonly known as the snowbird) with slow-release implants of
testosterone (T). Controls receive empty implants. The PIs measure an array of
phenotypic traits and compare fitness of the experimental phenotype with that of
controls. Only by considering the whole array and the net effect of
experimentally induced changes on fitness can they hope to understand what
maintains existing harmonal phenotypes. Specific objectives include: 1.
continued investigation of direct effects of testosterone on fitness-related
traits in male juncos, including a) behavior towards nestlings and b) behavior
and physiology during the non-breeding season; 2. quantification of indirect
effects of T on the male's extended phenotype by measuring die impact of male T
on the behavior and physiology of females (egg steroids, sex of offspring, use
of space while fertile); 3. completion of analysis of an already completed
l0-year demographic study.
