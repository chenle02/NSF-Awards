The Department of Chemistry at UNC-CH proposes to establish a laboratory for
molecular modeling and simulation in support of a wide range of biologically
related projects, many of which have NSF support. The proposed computing
facility would consist of a six processor SGI R10000 Challenge server, a single
processor SGI R4400 Solid Impact workstation and a HP color/bw printer. The
system planned would have adequate memory and disk storage to provide for
molecular dynamics simulations on very large solvated biomolecular systems and
electronic structure calculations on large molecular systems some of which
include transition metals ions. The workstation will provide for high resolution
molecular graphics to support the planned research. Software necessary to
accomplish molecular graphics, molecular modeling and electronic structure
calculations is also included.
