The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important tool available to
organic and inorganic chemists for structure determination; and it is becoming a
significantly useful technique for analytical chemists and biochemists. This
award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at Bates College acquire a high field NMR. The NMR will be used in
the following research topics.: 1. The Synthesis and Solvolysis of
Spiro(Adamantane-2,1'- cyclobutane)-4(e)-Tosylate 2. Catalytic and Structural
Chemistry of Metal Clusters containing Triply Bridging Ligands 3. Lanthanide-
Cyclodextrin Shift Reagents 4. The Structure of the 5' Proximal Regions of
Reovirus mRNAs
