/his award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. This research will
explore the relationships between the properties of molecular, colloidal and
solid state rare earth selenides and tellurides. New organo-rare earth compounds
will be prepared and characterized in order to understand the fundamental
aspects of bonding in rare earth coordination chemistry. These compounds will be
thermolyzed at low temperatures into both nanometer-sized clusters and solid
state compounds in order to examine the unique optical and magnetic properties
of these semiconducting materials. Rare earth nanoclusters will be characterized
by NMR and transmission electron microscopy to document the evolution of size-
dependent structural, electronic and magnetic properties. Once the fundamental
properties of these materials have been outlined, the chemical properties
responsible for cluster stability and particle size distribution can be
determined. %%% This low temperature approach to rare earth chalcogenides may
afford the possibility of isolating metastable solid state compounds which would
be unable to withstand the high temperatures associated with conventional solid
state synthesis.
