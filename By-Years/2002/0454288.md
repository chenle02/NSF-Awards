&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need for wireless
network tools and platforms as recommended in the 2003 NSF Wireless Network
Workshop report. The project will build on the IOTA (Integration of Two Access
Technologies) project at Bell Labs. The PI's will enhance and develop IOTA for a
software and systems package in a distributable form called the Wireless Open
Research Kit (WORKIT). WORKIT will include source code and documentation and
also be embodied in low-cost off the shelf hardware. WORKIT will be an enabler
for research in mobility management, interlayer awareness, software algorithms
for optimal network selection, reconfiguration, security, accounting,
authentication, policy download and enforcement, and hybrid wireless networking.
Broader impacts of this project include use of WORKIT in education and enabling
stronger university/industry collaborations in this area of emerging
importance.&lt;br/&gt;at colleges and
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
