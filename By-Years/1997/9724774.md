This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research aimed at the
development of a suite of computing protocols that can be used to build high
performance and fault-tolerant services for computer applications. The
collaboration involves Mustaque Ahamad at the Georgia Institute of Technology
and Michel Raynal of the University of Rennes and the French National Institute
for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA). They propose to
explore fundamental techniques in support of highly interactive and dynamic
applications, and interactions among widely distributed users. Their research
will focus on the characterizations of consistency criteria useful for
distributed services and scalable implementations. The US investigator brings to
this collaboration expertise in distributed shared memories and management of
fault-tolerant access to computers. This is complemented by French expertise in
theoretical and applied distributed computing.
