The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B Program supports Professor
Robert A. Moss of Rutgers University to investigate the structure and reactivity
of transient carbenes. The scientific objective of this work is to engage in
mechanistic characterization of reactive intermediates, especially the chemistry
of carbenes and carbanions. Its unifying theme is the correlation of structure
with reactivity for highly reactive, short-lived intermediates. Activation
parameters will be determined for carbene-alkene additions of the highly
reactive carbenes Cl-C-CN, F-C-CN, Cl-C-CF3, and F-C-CF3. The results will bear
upon the operation of enthalpy/entropy compensation in carbene/alkene addition
reactions. Equilibrium constants and thermodynamic parameters will be measured
for [PhCX + Y- = PhCXY-], where X,Y = F, Cl, and Br. Transient complexes of
alkylchlorocarbenes with aromatic partners will be spectroscopically and
computationally characterized. Modulation of carbenic reactivity by complexation
will be probed. The chemistry of F-C-OPh encapsulated in a water-compatible
hemicarcerand will be explored. Finally, the "umpolung" or philicity alteration
of nucleophilic and ambiphilic carbenes by reaction with lithium salts will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbenes are very unusual carbon-based molecules
that are extremely reactive, living only billionths of a second in solution at
room temperature. Carbenes can exist in different geometries with different
arrangements of their outer electrons and this can lead to different
reactivities. In this research project, a detailed set of fast spectroscopic
measurements is made to determine the relationship between the geometry changes
and the reactivity of these interesting molecules. Professor Moss is the Chair
of the Coordinating Committee of the International Symposium on Reactive
Intermediates and Unusual Molecules (ISRIUM), meeting in Mexico in 2014.
