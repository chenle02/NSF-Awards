Although campaign acitivists are playing an increasingly important role in
American electoral politics, there is very little in the way of systematic
knowledge concerning who they are, what they believe, and how they operate. This
research is directed at addressing these issues by examining presidential
campaign activists in the 1988 election. The study will provide insights into
the nature and activities of these important presidential campaign activists.
The data for this analysis will be obtained from three main sources. First, the
primary focus of the study consists of a national telephone survey of
county.level presidential activists, to be conducted during the two months prior
to the 1988 election. Second, the researchers will also conduct a national mail
survey of county party chairpersons. Third, the investigators will have access
to public opinion data from a national sample of the American electorate,
obtained from the University of Michigan Center for Political Studies' 1988
National Election Study. The three surveys will select respondents from the same
set of counties across the United States. This will enable the investigators to
make direct comparisons across the three main types of actors in American
presidential elections: campaign activists, party leaders, and the voters. With
the data obtained from the surveys, the investigators will address four main
questions about the role of presidential parties in American politics. First,
have presidential parties become stronger since 1972? Second, what are the issue
orientations of presidential activists? Third, how do policy attitudes of
activists compare to those of constituents? Finally, what is the the degree of
overlap between the presidential parties and the formal party organization?
American electoral politics is changing over time in important ways. Analysts
are not in agreement about the nature of the changes. Regardless of the evolving
form and procedures in national elections, it appears certain that the
presidential parties will continue to play a vital role. Therefore, it is
important to gain an understanding of these organizations and this project is
directed at accomplishing this objective.
