The goal of this research effort is to improve understanding of the role of air-
sea interactions in modifying the near-surface wind structure of tropical
cyclones. Of particular importance is to understand the role of these
interactions as tropical cyclones pass over warm oceanic features that surround
the United States Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico states.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific research objectives are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.
Develop techniques to improve estimates of upper ocean heat content from in situ
and radar altimetry data.&lt;br/&gt;2. Examine the forcing of warm ocean
features on surface stresses, fluxes and waves in the atmospheric boundary layer
(ABL) and the role of the ocean mixed layer (OML) feedback to the
ABL.&lt;br/&gt;3. Quantify the roles of mixing and horizontal advection of
temperature and salinity, including the mass, heat and salt budgets in the OML
and the effects of precipitation on the OML.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful
completion of this research will lead to a better understanding of the role of
warm upper oceanic features on surface wind variations. This may lead to
improved boundary layer parameterizations and improved hurricane intensity
forecasts.
