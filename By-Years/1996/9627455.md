COBURN DMS-9627455 The Department of Mathematics at the State University of New
York at Buffalo will purchase a configuration of a server and nine workstations
which will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment will be used for several research projects: problems associated with
receptors in sensory physiology; a computer program implementation of an
algorithm of Bestvina and Handel for the Nielsen-Thurston classification
theorem; fluid particle and porous media flows, and modeling of island
morphologies in strained solid films.
