Social regulation of reproduction is the foundation of colony organization in
social insects. Yet so little is known about the basic process of oogenesis
itself, it is difficult to do more than guess what physiological processes are
blocked to result in sterility. The long-term objective of the proposed research
is to define the endocrine basis of oogenesis in social insects and to identify
the mechanisms by which reproductive females sterilize in nestmates. Workers of
the ant genus Camponotus present many features that make an in-depth study of
oogenesis and its inhibition feasible. In the first year of the project, the
investigator will define oogenesis and its inhibition in workers
phenomenologically and morphologically. She will produce antibody to
vitellogenin (Vg.) and use it in the study of Vg synthesis in vivo. Honeybee Vg
and Vg antibody will be used to develop protocols that can be applied to ants.
Next, in vivo endocrine studies (e.g., assay of ecdysteroid titers, effects of
exogenous juvenile hormone on oogenesis) will begin. A defined culture medium
for in vitro studies and an antibody-based assay for quantification of Vg will
be developed. Then, the investigator will begin in vitro studies on Vg synthesis
by fat body. During the third year of the proposed research, the responsiveness
of fat bodies in different physiological states to hormonal challenges will be
determined. The investigator will test the feasibility of studying the role of
the ovary, including ecdysteroid secretion and Vg uptake, in vitro.
