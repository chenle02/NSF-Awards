This proposal requests support for the travel expenses of junior participants
from the U.S. who would otherwise not be able to attend ISIT, such as graduate
students, research associates, and new faculty hires. These participants would
be individuals whose papers have been selected for presentation at the
Symposium, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel
support. ISIT has a strong tradition of junior participation that has helped it
to maintain its reputation as a leading forum for new ideas. IT is proposed that
the co-chairs of the symposium, Daniel Costello and Bruce Hajek, make the
awards.
