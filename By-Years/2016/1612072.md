Radford University (RU) has received an Improving Undergraduate STEM Education:
Education and Human Resources Directorate (IUSE: EHR) Exploration and Design
award for a project to design, implement and assess interventions to help
undergraduate biology majors improve their attitudes and decrease their anxiety
towards mathematics. Introductory mathematics courses are a key roadblock for
many students interested in pursuing careers in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Since student attitudes toward
mathematics are strongly correlated with their performance, the goal of the
current work is the development and study of strategies that reduce student
resistance to mathematics. The Biology undergraduate Math Attitudes and Anxiety
Program (BioMAAP) is a cohesive program that can be added to existing courses
and curricula, without replacing content instruction. The approaches, which
include biofeedback and metacognitive reflection, are readily adoptable and
actively engage students in reducing their own mathematics anxiety and improving
their attitude toward mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the program
is a set of online activities, with supplemental in-person group activities
available when local resources permit. In biofeedback activities, students use
simple smartphone devices to collect data on their own physiological responses
to mathematics and to measure their responses to anxiety reducing interventions.
Metacognitive activities lead students through purposeful reflections on their
own methods of solving mathematics problems and learning quantitative content,
which will help to demystify mathematics and improve student attitudes. While
the current study involves biology majors, the knowledge generated by this
project will be applicable to the amelioration of mathematics anxiety in
students in all STEM disciplines. This, in turn, will increase the persistence
of these majors and increase the number of STEM majors entering the graduate
school and the workforce.
