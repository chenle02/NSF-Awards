The objective of this research is to clarify the relationship of dental
development patterns to the life histories of anthropoid primates as well as
increasing our knowledge of growth and development in human and non-human
primates. There has been a long-standing discussion as to the maturation rates
in human ancestors. Some feel that their maturation resembled tht of modern
humans; thus indicating a long period of childhood dependency in our ancestors.
Others have argued against this perspective; holding that their maturation was
neither human-like, nor ape-like. The proposed research will help to resolve
this debate and paint a clearer picture of the maturation pattern of earlier
humans. Four specific projects will be undertaken: 1) a comparative study of
tooth emergence sequence in anthropoids 2) a comparative study of tooth
formation patterns in anthropoids 3) development of standards for the
determination of non- human anthropoid age from dental data 4) a survey of the
literature on the development of mammalian dentition. This basic data is of
central to the ability to compare development between species.
