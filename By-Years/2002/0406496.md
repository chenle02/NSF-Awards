Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding in a sequence-specific
manner to double-stranded DNA and modulating the initiation of new transcripts.
The unique binding specificities of transcription factors are critical
components of their ability to regulate gene expression. Yet determining binding
specificity is time-consuming and detailed information is available for only a
fraction of transcription factors, even in well-studied organisms. The goal of
this project is to develop and validate a rapid, simple, high-throughput assay
to determine the full spectrum of binding specificities (or position weight
matrix) for any transcription factor. The approach uses a microarray containing
thousands of different dsDNA hairpin probes to assay relative binding of all
permutations of seven base pairs. This method will be tested by comparing
results to those obtained using existing, more laborious methods, and then
refined, calibrated, and optimized for general use. This high-throughput method
should be applicable to understanding the binding specificity of almost any
protein:DNA interaction. It is expected that this approach will offer several
distinct advantages over existing methods for determining position weight
matrices: speed, simplicity, and comprehensive sampling of all potential binding
sites. Successful validation of this method should benefit basic research on
mechanisms of gene expression by providing detailed information about the
binding specificities of many different transcription factors. Other aspects of
basic research will also benefit, including automated annotation of genome
sequences and evolutionary analyses of gene networks.
