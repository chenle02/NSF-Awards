A workshop will be held on seismo-acoustic applications in marine geology and
geophysics. Oceanic hydrophone networks that exploit T-phase arrivals provide a
popular, convenient and inexpensive approach to monitoring earthquake activity
in the ocean basins. The goals of this workshop are to identify necessary,
important, or promising research directions to further the application of
T-phase, and will provide an opportunity for the marine geology and geophysics
and ocean acoustics communities with clear guidelines for future research in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
