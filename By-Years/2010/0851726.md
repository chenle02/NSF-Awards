This award supports the Training and Research Experiences in Nonlinear Dynamics
(TREND) REU Site at the University of Maryland. The main goal of the program is
to involve undergraduate students in frontier research on nonlinear dynamics.
The program is also aimed at helping undergraduate students prepare for graduate
school, and for research and teaching positions throughout industry and
academia. The program will involve approximately 10 students who will spend 11
weeks in the summer on campus involved in research. Examples of possible
theoretical and experimental research topics include: nanophotonic devices,
spatio-temporal chaos and synchronism of chaotic systems, chaotic microwave
circuits, granular media, development of singularities in fluids and solids,
nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and charged particle beams, magnetic
reconnection, and turbulence and nonlinear phenomena in plasmas. Seminar series
will complement and reinforce the learning experience. Student projects and
presentations will be judged on the final day of the program, and winners will
be funded to present their work at a national conference.
