This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Santa Clara University. Julie
Mueller is the site's Program Director and Patrick Hoggard is the Co-Program
Director. Eight faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period
(2002-2004), eight students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.
The goal is that at least six of the eight students each year should be women
and underrepresented minorities. Students select research from among projects in
organic, biological, and physical chemistry. Ethical issues in scientific work
will be examined through weekly meetings directed by ethicists from the Santa
Clara University Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. The Societal Dimensions of
Engineering, Science, and Technology Program support this portion of the REU
program. Summer activities will end with a symposium. A written evaluation by
each of the students of the overall REU program will be provided at the
conclusion. Periodic surveys of all REU alumni will be done to assess the long-
term impact of the program.
