The proposer will investigate connections between Galois representations and
modular forms in the context of two fundamental problems in algebraic number
theory. The first of these problems is to determine which Galois representations
are associated to automorphic representations. The second problem is to relate
special values of L-functions of varieties or motives to associated algebraic
quantities (such as orders of Selmer groups). In the direction of the first
problem the proposer intends to pursue extensions of his recent work on the
modularity of various families of two-dimensional p-adic Galois representations.
In particular, the proposer intends to explore possible extensions to
representations of higher dimension. In the direction of the second problem, the
proposer will investigate the influence of divisibility properties of constant
terms of Eisenstein series on higher-rank groups (which often involve special
values of L-functions) on congruences between the Hecke eigenvalues of these
Eisenstein series and those of cusp forms.

Both of these problems fall under the rubric "Arithmetic Geometry," a branch of
mathematics which attempts to apply sophisticated mathematics to the often easy-
to-state, but-hard-to-solve problems of number theory. The problems most readily
tackled by arithmetic geometry include 1) counting the number of integer
solutions to systems of polynomials and 2) understanding L-functions (functions
attached to systems of polynomials and which encode information about their
solutions). These problems are of increasing importance in applications. Recent
advances in computing, cryptography, and coding theory have depended on
solutions to these problems as do many proposed advances in these areas.
