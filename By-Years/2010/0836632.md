&lt;br/&gt;New Mexico State University proposes a project, called Young Women in
Computing (YWiC), to develop and implement effective strategies and permanent
infrastructures for increasing interest in Computer Science among female
students, especially of Hispanic heritage. YWiC ? with interventions starting in
middle and high school, and continuing through freshman and sophomore years in
college ? will improve recruitment and retention of women, preparing them for
academic success and careers in Information Technology and Computer Science. Two
themes provide the underlying basis for the interventions: Computing in Context
and Linked Communities. Computing in Context will result in curricula that uses
computational thinking and media applications of fundamental concepts anchored
in real-world contexts (e.g., bioinformatics, assistive technologies, space
exploration). Linked Communities will develop community building components,
aimed at reducing the sense of isolation, providing a social background for the
development of training motivation in computing, and becoming a portal of
information for students, parents, and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
