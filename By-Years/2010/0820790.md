This project entails accelerator radiocarbon dating (AMS) and stable isotope
analysis of human remains from the Nuvuk Cemetery site at Point Barrow, Alaska.
It is complimentary to genetic research directed by Dennis O'Rourke and M.
Geoffrey Hayes (OPP-0732846) designed to establish the relationship between
burials from this prehistoric cemetery, which are rapidly eroding into the
Arctic Ocean, and modern groups now living both along the North Slope of Alaska
and in the eastern Arctic. Previous research suggests that eastern Arctic groups
originated at Point Barrow; however Nuvuk Cemetery lacks the chronological
control necessary to anchor prehistoric genetic variability and provide the
temporal framework needed to reconstruct migratory events. Here, the research
team will extract and purify bone collagen from 100 individuals for AMS dating
and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. The former procedure will
establish much needed temporal control while the latter will allow the
investigators to examine dietary patterning over the temporal span of the study.
The research at Nuvuk is in collaboration with the community of Barrow,
including the participation of Barrow high school students in research
activities.
