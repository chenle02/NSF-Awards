With this award, the Chemistry Division is supporting a meeting organized by Dr.
Donald T. Sawyer of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University. The
seventeen participants will met in Los Angeles from January 13-14, 1994. They
will carry out an on-site review of the first-year chemistry course at the
California Institute of Technology, they will meet with the new instrument
development executives of Hewlett Packard and Varian and they will meet as a
group to define a laboratory course for chemistry majors entitled "Molecular
Characterization and Measurement". The goal of the course is to make a
fundamental change in the laboratory experiences for chemistry majors by using
the methodologies practiced not only in academic laboratories, but also those
used in industrial and government laboratories.
