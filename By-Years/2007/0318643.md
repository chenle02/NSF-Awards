This project will initiate the development of a model of the plasma density
distribution within the magnetosphere. It will utilize data from the RPI (Radio
Plasma Imager) instrument on the IMAGE satellite. A mathematical inversion
algorithm has been developed that allows the local plasma density measured at
the satellite to be combined with the RPI data to determine the plasma density
all long the magnetic field line on which the satellite is situated. Combining
data from similar magnetic conditions will make it possible to derive a density
model as a function of latitude, radial distance and local time. The resulting
models will be made available to the space weather community. The project will
support a graduate student from an under-represented minority.
