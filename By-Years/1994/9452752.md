9452752 McNeil Norfolk State University seeks to initiate a five-week, commuter,
Young Scholars program in mathematics and chemistry for 40 minority students
entering grades 8 and 9 in the Tidewater, Virginia area. Students will engage in
hands-on laboratory activities, including experiments in water chemistry, and
will use graphics calculators and personal calculators to assist in the analysis
of water-related data. The project features field trips, career exploration
activities, and academic year follow-up activities. The major goal of the
project is to increase students' ability and confidence in mathematics and
science applications and hereby encourage them to pursue careers in these
fields.
