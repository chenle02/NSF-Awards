The objective of this collaborative research award is to improve the delivery of
chemotherapy drugs to its target tumors. With existing chemotherapy, it is
estimated that less than 0.1 percent of the administered drugs are taken up by
the tumor, the remaining 99.9 percent go to healthy tissue and cause severe and
life-threatening side-effects. In magnetic drug targeting, chemotherapy can be
attached to biocompatible magnetic particles. This allows magnetic control of
the drugs - magnets placed outside the patient can potentially be used to focus
the therapy to tumors. Doing so is difficult. The human body is complex and it
is not yet understood how to actuate the magnets (when to turn them on and off)
to best direct the drugs to the tumors. The goal of this project is to develop
sophisticated and experimentally-validated tools to better understand how
magnetized chemotherapy moves through the body, and based on these to develop
methods to optimally actuate the magnets to better direct the chemotherapy to
tumors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impact will be a suite
of techniques to improve magnetic drug targeting - potentially moving it from a
method that could only focus drugs to single shallow tumors, to one that could
access deep tumors as well as small and poorly vascularized metastatic tumors
spread throughout the body. This project is a collaborative effort between
cancer clinicians, engineers, and mathematicians, and will also serve to bring
these fields closer together in major part by training students to work
effectively at the intersection of these three areas. High school,
undergraduate, and graduate students will be involved in the research, and will
interact with doctors, engineers, and mathematicians on a weekly basis.
