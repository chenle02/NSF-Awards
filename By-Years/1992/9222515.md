The purpose of the research to be performed under this SGER award is to verify
experimentally that interface coatings of optimum stiffness applied to
reinforcing fibers can significantly improve the performance of composites by
reducing, or eliminating, cross- ply cracking. New detailed information on the
interaction between a fiber, the matrix and the interphase regions of composites
will be generated. This will provide a fundamental understanding of the
influence of physically controllable micro- parameters on fiber reinforced
composite materials, which will aid in the optimal design of this class of
materials.
