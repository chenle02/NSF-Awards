9512917 Glander This award provides renewed support for maintenance of a
collection of prosimian primates maintained at the Duke University Primate
Center. These animals are of particular interest for research in animal behavior
and in evolutionary biology. The collection includes a number of rare and
endangered species, including aye-ayes and sifakas, most of which are now only
found in the wild in Madagascar. The Duke Primate Center was established in 1966
with the help of an NSF award. Since then, the number and species diversity of
prosimians represented in the collection has grown from the initial 80
individuals to approximately 500 individuals representing approximately 17
species of lemurs and loris. Approximately 85% of the animals were bred at the
Center. Funding provided through this award helps make these animals available
for study by investigators from other institutions. Although it does not support
them directly, this award facilitates a vigorous program of educational and
conservation activities carried out by the Center. ***
