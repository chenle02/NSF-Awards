Dr. Fredrick Richardson is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to continue his research on the electronic structure, optical
and magneto-optical spectroscopy, and coordination properties of lanthanide ions
and complexes in solution and in the solid state. This research will have
practical applications in the design of lanthanide-based optical materials for
lasers, the use of lanthanide ions as structural probes for biological systems,
and the characterization of lanthanide coordination properties in solution. The
primary emphasis of Richardson's research is on the properties and processes
associated with the lanthanide 4f electrons and their interactions with ligand
and crystal fields, magnetic fields, and radiation fields. Richardson is
attempting to develop quantitative relationships between optical properties,
electronic state structure, coordination number and geometry, and ligand
structure of lanthanide complexes containing polyatomic ligands, multidentate
chelate structures, and functionally specific ligand substituents that influence
optical properties in specific ways. Two-photon absorption and electronic Raman
scattering experiments will investigate ligand-field interactions and states not
accessible to study by one-photon optical absorption and emission techniques.
Chiroptical measurements will also be used to study detailed state structure of
several classes of systems.
