This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Wake Forest University
to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE. The program will be
a 10 week research experience in which the interests of the students will be
matched with those of appropriate faculty advisers in the Department. In
conjunction with the research program, the students will be exposed to a wide
range of research expertise through weekly seminars and two, overnight field
trips. Additional time will be spent in learning elementary statistics,
experimental design, slide preparation, etc. During the last two weeks of the
research period, the students will be joined by their Mentors from the home
institution. In this way, the students can share their research experiences with
faculty with who they will spend the majority of their remaining academic
career. These faculty members will be able to gain first-hand knowledge of the
student's research and, hopefully, sustain the research momentum during the
following academic year(s). The summer's research activities will culminate in
an all day colloquium at which time the students will formally present the
results of their work. In order to encourage and facilitate maximum student-
student interaction, they will be quartered in one of the University's
residential houses throughout the summer.
