For the Schrodinger operator, the effective geometry for spectral
considerations consists of the distribution of resonant wells and is controlled
by the pseudo-Riemannian metric of Jacobi and Agmon. The effective geometry for
the wave equation is determined by the shape of the obstacle and the boundary
conditions. The effective geometry for the hyperbolic manifold is determined by
the Poincare metric. In each of these cases, this research will examine how the
spectral data reflects the trapping or non-trapping property of the potential or
the capacity of the metric to trap geodesics. A goal of this research is the
derivation of the trace formulas which express geometric properties of the
manifold in terms of the spectral data. This research addresses the general
question of the interplay of the geometric and spectral properties of non-
compact manifolds. First, how does the geometry of the manifold determine the
spectral types. Second, how does the spectral data place constraints on the
geometry and topology of the manifold. Three cases of application are the
quantum mechanics of ordered media with electric fields, scattering for the wave
equation, and infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds.
