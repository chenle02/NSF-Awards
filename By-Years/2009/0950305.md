&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EArly-concept Grants for
Exploratory Research (EAGER) award seeks to use nanoscale electronics technology
to develop brain-like computing structures that possess the density and
plasticity that allow arrays of synapses to perform sensing, pattern
recognition, and motor control at performance levels beyond what is possible
with traditional computers. The goal is to determine if nanoelectronics
configured in a self-assembled crossbar array can achieve the density and
plasticity of synapses. To address plasticity, the research focuses on phase-
change and metal-oxide materials for neuromorphic systems. To address density,
the project investigates ultra-dense interconnects for self-assembled
nanoelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the
research builds on recent progress in the use of phase-change and metal-oxide
memory cells for nonvolatile memory, but takes the technology in a different
direction to use phase-change and metal-oxide memory cells for implementing
electronic synapse arrays for brain-like computing. The research uses an
experimental approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to broader impact, this
research has the potential to dramatically alter how computation is done for a
number of tasks, such as pattern recognition and motor control. An undergraduate
student from an underrepresented group will be engaged in the research. The
project also facilitates multidisciplinary interaction between nanoelectronics
and bioengineering researchers.
