Dr. Jeffery G. Saven has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Saven's doctoral degree was from Columbia University under the
supervision of Professor James Skinner. Dr. Saven will continue research at the
University of Illinois under the sponsorship of Professor Peter Wolynes. Dr.
Saven's postdoctoral training will deal with the theory of glasses and the
quantum mechanical simulation of proteins. Longer term, he plans to develop
theoretical models for transitions between conformational substates of proteins
which will simulate hole burning spectroscopy experiments. %%% The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
