This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemical reaction dynamics. The electrochemical
properties of several widely different modified electrode systems will be
investigated, including electrodes modified with polymer and clay films,
organized molecular assemblies, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) systems.
Electrochemical methods will be used to investigate how the structure, charge
and polarity of small molecules affect their interactions with DNA and to
attempt selective cleavage of the DNA strand. Electrolytes based on novel inert
solvents capable of operation at very low temperatures, e.g., liquid sulfur
dioxide, will be used to generate superoxidizing agents that have not previously
been prepared. The kinetics and energetics of reactions of organometallic
species that exhibit large conformational changes on electron transfer and those
that contain multiple electroactive groups will also be studied in order to gain
information about the effects of structural changes and intramolecular
interactions on oxidation-reduction potential. This research project is
concerned with the continued development of electrochemical methods as
analytical tools and their application to chemical problems. Electrochemical
methods of analysis play a complementary role to the spectroscopic methods more
generally used and provide special insight into the kinetics of electron
transfer processes and the oxidation-reduction potentials of electrochemical
reactions.
