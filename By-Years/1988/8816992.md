Soybean calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) is the first Ca2+-dependent
protein kinase from plants to be purified to homogeneity. This enzyme represents
a new class of protein kinases that are dependent on micromolar calcium for
activity but do not require phospholipids or calmodulin for activity.
Preliminary immunocytochemical localization of the enzyme shows that CDPK is
associated with actin filaments in soybean and onion root tip cells. This
association suggests that CDPK may play a role in the regulation of plant actin.
The purification and characterization of CDPK allows the study of both the role
of calcium and protein phosphorylation in plants. This research investigates
these roles by (1) fully characterizing the calcium-binding properties of CDPK,
(2) determining the immunological properties of CDPK, (3) determining how CDPK
binds to actin, and (4) identifying actin-associated proteins that are
substrates of CDPK.%%% Many metabolic activities in plants and animals are
regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. Protein kinases play
a major role in this type of regulation. Recently, a new class of protein
kinases which directly bind calcium have been discovered. The experiments
defined here will provide for investigation of the potential role of these
calcium-dependent protein kinases in the regulation of the plant cytoskeleton
and to better define its role in the regulation of plant cell function and in
plant growth and development.***//
