The faculty team at Rochester Institute of Technology has created the EMC^2
Scholars Program represents a collaborative effort of four academic programs
(Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Engineering, and Computer
Science) across three colleges, and the Enrollment Management and Career
Services Division at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Their program
builds upon their existing infrastructure for mentoring students, and involves
their co-operative education program, both of which help students address their
financial needs and facilitate placement in the high technology
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their scholarship program supports 62 scholars
each year. RIT will provide an equal matching support to more than double the
scholarship amount to students positively impacted by the EMC^2 program. RIT's
1.6-to-one matching support to this program indicates the university's
enthusiasm, a firm commitment of support to their students, and an endorsement
of the goals and objectives of the EMC^2 program.&lt;br/&gt;
