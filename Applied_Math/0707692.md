This project concerns chemical, electrochemical, and biochemical reaction
networks, reaction routes (reaction pathways) through these networks, and the
depiction of these networks using Kirchhoff graphs. This work will build on a
vector space approach to reaction routes to establish that one or more Kirchhoff
graphs exist for any given reaction network and to develop a method for
constructing these graphs. Neither of these results is obvious for arbitrary
reaction networks.

Results of the project will significantly aid fundamental understanding of
reaction networks and have potential application to the design of fuel cells and
other devices involving complicated chemical reaction networks.
