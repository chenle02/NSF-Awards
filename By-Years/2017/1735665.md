PI: Davalos, Rafael V.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
#:1735665&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will enable an
international workshop from June 13-15, 2017 in Arlington, Virginia, bringing
together engineers and scientists to discuss emerging cancer biomedical
technologies. The overarching goal of this international meeting is to
understand the status of the field, specifically relating to topical areas of:
biophotonics and imaging, cancer detection, cancer treatment, tissue
engineering, cell therapeutics, drug delivery, biomedical engineering, and
multi-scale modeling. This workshop will increase our scientific understanding
serve as a catalyst for a large economic impact as these platforms are
developed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will explore and develop
opportunities for cutting-edge research spanning basic to translational
collaborations between U.S. and Australian participants while also strategizing
a future for cancer research internationally. The workshop will be limited to
less than 100 participants and will focus on cutting-edge, emerging biomedical
technologies applicable to cancer detection, treatment, and clinical studies.
The collaborative sessions will bring together researchers, federal scientists
and companies specializing in topical areas such as: biophotonics, epigenomics,
genomics, genetic engineering, proteomics, nanotechnology, tissue engineering,
single cell analysis technologies, imaging technologies, microfluidics,
materials, and minimally invasive technologies.
