This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop materials
that function as semi-permanent mold release for the tooling industry. The
coating systems proposed also offer icephobic, hydrophobic (non-stick),
antibacterial and corrosion resistant properties.

The tooling industry employs numerous combinations of materials and processes
that require a release agent to reduce adhesion of parts to the tool. Water or
silicone based releases are the conventional solution, but need frequent
application incurring high material and labor costs. This solution offers
considerable cost savings that will be very valuable for most tool companies.
