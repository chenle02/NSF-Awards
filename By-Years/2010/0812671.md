How can we build robots that are able to distinguish and handle the many objects
located in our everyday environments? And how can we endow these robots with the
ability to reason about spatial concepts such as rooms, hallways, streets, and
intersections? Even though the robotics community has made tremendous progress
in the development of efficient techniques for representing and dealing with
noisy sensor information, current techniques do not have the expressive power to
address these questions. In this project, we will develop statistical relational
machine learning techniques that are able to extract high-level concepts from
robotic sensor data. By transferring knowledge learned in other environments,
our techniques will enable robots to recognize objects and places in previously
unseen environments. Ultimately, this research will bring us closer to the dream
of truly autonomous robots; robots that can interact with people and operate
successfully in the complex environments we live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project also includes teaching efforts and the involvement of undergraduate
students in research. Furthermore, it contains collaboration with an existing
NSF project to expose young African-American students to the educational and
career opportunities available in computer science, robotics and artificial
intelligence.
