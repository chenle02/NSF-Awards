This project is concerned with a novel, cost-effective scheme, called task-based
fault tolerance (TBFT), for providing fault tolerance to heterogeneous
distributed computing systems. The technique considers computations at the task
level and places assertion checks on the tasks to achieve fault tolerance. It
requires no hardware overhead and relatively small amount of delay overhead.
Allocation and scheduling of the taks is performed in the task graph to support
fault tolerance, while at the same time an attempt is made minimize the schedule
length and obtain a balanced load. Simulation results show that the overhead in
schedule length incurred due to the introduction of assertion checks is very
small compared with the case when all the tasks in the system are duplicated.
The topics under investigation include the following: (1) applying TBFT
techniques to multiple faults, (2) developing mixed allocation/scheduling
methods to reduce schedule length and fault tolerance overhead, (3) developing
methods to ensure safety of operation without much adverse effect on the
reliability of the system, (4) developing allocation and scheduling methods
which would permit the use of redundancy at the task level to provide fast on-
line diagnosis, (5) develop probabilistic diagnosis methods, (6) integrating
detection/diagnosis results with a backward error recovery method to minimize
the rollback domino effect using asynchronous checkpointing, and (7) developing
allocation and scheduling methods for periodic and aperiodic tasks in fault-
tolerant real-time distributed systems based on the notion of forward error
recovery for safety-critical tasks.
