Dr Bernstein, Dr Jain and their team will develop and test software to extract
information on weak gravitational lensing from large imaging surveys. Weak
lensing refers to the small distortions in the images of distant galaxies that
result when its light is bent by the gravitational pull of clumps of matter that
lie along the light path. This work therefore gives information about how mass
is distributed on the largest cosmic scales. The team will explore better
techniques for measuring the shapes of galaxy images. They will improve the
performance of pipeline software for determining the point spread function (PSF,
which measures the distorting effect of the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope
optics on the images), and for measuring galaxy colors, and the distances
inferred from those colors, even when the PSF differs between images in
different colors. They will develop a method to find the combination of
cosmological parameters that best fits a given set of such observations, while
taking account of important systematic errors, and making use of all the
available information in the survey images, but remaining computationally
feasible. Finally, the team will explore the best combination of lensing
measurements to test theories of modified gravity, which have been proposed as
alternatives to dark energy in explaining the observed cosmic acceleration. The
software developed will be tested with commissioning data from the Dark Energy
Survey prior to the start of the main survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two graduate
students will be trained as they participate in the research. The proposed
improvements in measurements of galaxy shape, color and estimated distances will
be generally applicable to astronomical imaging surveys, and should be useful
for studies beyond gravitational lensing.
