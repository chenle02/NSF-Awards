This project addresses the national need to increase the preparation of US
citizens, especially groups underrepresented in STEM, for jobs in the
biotechnology industry and academia. Local workforce needs are addressed by
focusing on biotechnology, one of the growing industries in northern Alabama.
The goal of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) - Hudson Alpha
Outreach Partnership (UHOP) program is to improve recruitment, retention and
graduation rates of academically-talented, financially-needy undergraduate
students interested in careers in biotechnology by providing them with financial
support, mentorships, experiential activities, and undergraduate biotechnology
research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UHOP partnership will provide
students with a traditional academic-based curriculum enhanced by a practical
industrial based component. The project is expected to influence student
academic aspiration, motivation and career success and to provide a ready
workforce for fostering the local and state-wide biotechnology industry. This
program, combined with an existing Joint Undergraduate Master's Program, is
designed to motivate students to complete a master's degree, leading to
increased employment and higher salary
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation of the UHOP program will be
performed by an external evaluator. Components of the evaluation plan include
comparing retention, academic performance, and graduation rates of UHOP scholars
with those of other majors. Student success after graduation will be tracked and
evaluated using using social media such as Facebook. An external review board
composed of educators within and external to UAH and Hudson Alpha provides
recommendations for the UHOP program on an ongoing basis.
