The primary potential benefit of this research is to help understand how brain
cells (known as neurons and glia) work together to generate behavior. The
researchers will use genetic techniques to identify small populations of glial
cells in the fly brain and carry out experiments to determine how they regulate
fly locomotion. Relative to humans, the fly brain has fewer cells and can be
readily manipulated. Because fruit flies share similar genes and general
principles of brain cell structure and function with other animals, insights
gained from this project will increase our understanding of glial function in
the brains of these animals, including humans. This project will train students
and postdoctoral scholars, including students from underrepresented groups. The
research team will participate in 'Brain Awareness Week,' a 'Saturday Morning
Science' seminar series and other activities that serve the public in local
communities. They will work with teachers to conduct fly genetics science
projects in middle and high schools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Using a newly
developed genetic method (FINGR, flippase-induced intersectional Gal80/Gal4
repression), the researchers will conduct a forward genetic screen to identify
subsets of glial cells that modulate fly locomotion, refine broad glia into
smaller units, map glial morphology, perturb glial function, correlate
behavioral changes with specific subsets of glia, and examine the impact of the
glial subset on neuronal function and morphology. The screen is unbiased, and
thus, will provide unprecedented opportunities for studying the effects of
specific subsets of glia on neuronal function. Results from this research will
also be disseminated through scientific meetings and through publication of
peer-reviewed journal articles.
