A physics research program for nine undergraduate students is planned at
University of California, Irvine each summer for the next three years. The
program involves projects with a variety of physics research groups under close
supervision by faculty and senior research staff. Research opportunities are
offered in the areas of experimental elementary particle physics, condensed
matter, plasma physics, and astrophysics. Close contact between student
participants, encouraging the sharing of research experiences in these varied
areas, is promoted by providing shared housing, and through social activities.
The research experience is further enhanced through a seminar series, visits to
the labs of fellow participants, and excursions to other research labs in the
Los Angeles area. The program is administered by the co-principal investigator,
a woman who has involved undergraduates extensively in her own research leading
to numerous papers including undergraduate authors. With the assistance of the
project PI, this administrator arranges publicity, recruitment, orientation,
seminars, excursions, a postsummer follow-up program, and generally works to
insure a valuable research experience for students in the program. ***
