This workshop will investigate the research issues and future associated with
the new field of ubiquitous computing, which is centered on a vision of a world
populated by networks of cheap and easily accessible computing devices. Such a
vision has generated a great deal of excitement as there is a potential for
improving the quality of our everyday lives. However, the realization of such a
vision requires the resolution of a number of difficult technological and social
problems. One major challenge is the interdisciplinary nature of such an
endeavor, which requires coordinated advances in many fields of computer science
including network design, security, user interfaces, coordination and
collaboration theories, privacy, agent technologies, and mobile computing
hardware. This workshop will focus on 1) supporting technology areas, 2)
promising application areas, 3) research issues, and 4) evaluation methods. The
steering committee spans both relevant technology and application areas.
Position papers will be invited before the workshop. Formal papers will be
gathered into a book-length manuscript after the workshop.
