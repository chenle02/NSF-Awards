The focus of this research project is to determine the reaction dynamics of gas
phase reactions between neutral metal atoms and small organic substrates. This
collaborative effort will involve synthesis of labelled substrates such as
carbon dioxide, organic halides and alkanes. Analysis of the reaction dynamics
will be done using mass spectrometry and rotational spectroscopy. With this
award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting fundamental studies in the
area of neutral metal reaction dynamics. Professors Grotjahn and Ziurys will
focus on the reactions between small organic molecules and neutral metal atoms.
These results will help future investigators determine details regarding energy
barriers and ligand effects.
