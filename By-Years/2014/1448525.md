The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the treatment and decrease
the high costs associated with treating patients who suffer severe traumatic
brain injuries. This project aims to develop an accurate, affordable (&lt;$100
per use) and non-invasive device to monitor a patient?s intracranial pressure
following traumatic brain injury. Increased intracranial pressure can result in
serious condition or death, if left untreated. However, the only available
method to monitor intracranial pressure is expensive (~$10,000 per patient) and
requires neurosurgery. The lack of a method to accurately screen patients to
determine who needs surgery results in misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in
about 46% of patients among an estimated 50,000 patients in the US alone, and
hundreds of thousands more globally. Successful commercialization of product is
expected to result in savings in the range $250 million ever year to the US
healthcare system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will test the
feasibility of developing a non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring
method for use outside of the neuro ICU. To develop an accurate, affordable, and
non-invasive ICP monitoring device, the team will first write and validate a
software framework that analyzes Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFV) waveforms.
CBFV waveforms are acquired non-invasively by using transcranial Doppler (TCD)
ultrasonography. In order to use CBFVs to predict ICP, two novel signal-
processing methods will be developed. First, the high noise levels typical to
TCD-acquired waveforms will be reduced within a machine-learning framework.
Second, we will use a method to track morphological features that predict ICP
from the CBFV waveform. Both these approaches to signal processing to analyze
CBFV waveforms are entirely novel. This approach is expected to allow for
accurate (&gt;92% of area under the diagnostic ROC) non-invasive real time
monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement
limits for TCD procedures.
