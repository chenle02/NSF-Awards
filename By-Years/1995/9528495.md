9528495 Idriss This action is to support a US-Japan workshop to discuss the
geotechnical issues and lessons to be learned from the Great Hanshin (Kobe)
earthquake of January 17, 1995, and to establish a blueprint for cooperative
research and a strategic plan for integrating the experiences of the Kobe and
other recent major earthquakes into improved engineering and planning practices.
The workshop is being held in Osaka, Japan, 22-24 January 1996. The objective is
to highlight the key geotechnical issues involved and provide a mechanism for
US-Japan cooperation in initiating, completing and finally evaluating the
information gathered with the ultimate objective of improving understanding and
in developing methodologies and procedures to mitigate the effects of future
earthquakes. This workshop is being organized by three Principal Investigators
at different institutions (the University of California at Davis, the University
of Southern California, and Cornell University), thereby providing wider
technical and geographic coverage within North America and the increased ability
to coordinate and work with researchers in Japan. Several key researchers in
Japan are cooperating in the planning of this workshop. It is also being
coordinated with similar activities investigating structural engineering aspects
of the Kobe earthquake. Emphasis is placed on including as large a participation
of North American and Japanese participants as funding allows, in order to
provide the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience necessary to
accomplish the objectives of the workshop. These participants include those who
have initiated and completed many research efforts as well as those who have put
the results of such research into practice. ***
