The principal goals of this research are to investigate Re- Os systematics in
the upper mantle and the nature of processes that produce Os isotopic variations
in the mantle. To achieve these goals, the P.I.s will implement a two-phase
research program. First, they will expand the characterization of Os isotope
ratios in OIBs by analyzing selected basalts from Iceland, Hawaii, St. Helena
and the Canary Islands. Second, they will investigate the extent to which
assimilation of altered crust may be important in determining the Os isotopic
composition of OIBs by comparing Re-Os systematics in differentiated and
undifferentiated basalts, and by direct characterization of altered submarine
basalt sections.
