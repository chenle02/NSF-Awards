This project involves an innovation that supports full upper-body representation
in Virtual Reality systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual Reality (VR) in its
current form lacks products for upper body haptic feedback and tracking. The
need for haptic feedback when contacting virtual objects and environments is
recognized as an unmet void. This project's "NullSpace" VR system is a full
upper body haptic feedback suit for virtual reality, using a built-in tracking
system and programmable vibrating pads placed on muscle groups around the body
and on the hands and fingers. When a user enters a VR experience, the tracking
system accurately maps motions into the virtual space; then, as the user
interacts with virtual objects and obstacles, the vibrating pads activate to
provide a sense of touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NullSpace is appropriate for
users of both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in simulation and
gaming scenarios including researchers and medical professionals seeking ways to
make PTSD Immersion Therapy and phobia treatment more effective, or projects
requiring accurate simulation for training purposes, such as astronaut task
training, flight simulation, and medical procedure training. Another potential
user population of the NullSpace system are gamers who are interested in
interactive virtual reality and desire additional control and feedback
capability in their virtual experiences. Virtual reality games using standard
headset hardware cannot track the arms and body and represent them as a player
avatar, creating a disorienting visual effect of being limbless and incorporeal
while in the virtual space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A prototype of the haptic
system has been developed, and has been demonstrated to users at private display
events, but the suit will require significant user need finding and testing to
focus on the commercialization space. For the duration of the I-Corps program,
the team plans to focus on need finding through market-oriented interviews.
