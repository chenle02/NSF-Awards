The Polymath Jr is an online program that provides hundreds of college students
the opportunity to participate in mathematical research. This highly inclusive
program allows each participant to choose how much they want to get out of the
program by selecting how much time they want to dedicate. The program presents a
variety of research projects in many branches of mathematics. Each project is
mentored by a mathematics professor and graduate students. The program supports
students who might otherwise have no opportunity to explore their mathematical
potential. The participants learn how mathematical research is conducted, and
some participants even publish papers in research journals. The program also
helps participants explore various other engagement opportunities in
mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2022 Polymath Jr program will
include research projects in number theory, combinatorics, topology, algebra,
complex analysis, theoretical computer science, and more. The program focuses on
questions that consist of separate parts at different levels of difficulty. The
staggered projects allow supporting groups of students with varied mathematical
backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
