9505175 Croke The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
geometry. In particular, various dynamical properties of geodesic flow are to be
investigated. Other topics include the study of periodic metrics: this portion
of the project relates to the recent resolution of Hopf's conjecture on toral
metrics. Hopf's conjecture states that a Riemannian metric on a torus without
conjugate points must be flat. Riemannian geometry is currently a very active
field of research in mathematics; length-minimizing paths, periodic behavior of
the distance function, curvature and its relation to the global shape of the
space are among the topics studied in this field. The familiar Euclidean
geometry is a very special case of Riemannian geometry characterized by a total
absence of curvature.
