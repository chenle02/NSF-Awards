This proposal seeks support for the analysis of previously collected
quantitative and qualitative data on how people use communications technologies
to construct their availability and manage the boundaries between work and
everyday life. The project is risky and exploratory because the relationship
between technology use and the construction of personal boundaries has never
been examined. The project promises to yield important insights into how new
technologies affect the ecology of everyday life. In particular, the study could
significantly influence the literature on work and family by drawing attention
to the role technologies play in the social construction of boundaries. It could
also have important societal impacts in helping employers and employees to
better understand how new technologies could enhance the quality of everyday
life.&lt;br/&gt;
