This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "The Interface Between Analytic Number Theory and Harmonic Analysis".
This conference will be held at Kansas State University May 21-26, 1990. The
lectures will be given by Professor Hugh Montgomery of the University of
Michigan. The topics covered range over multiplicative number theory, additive
number theory, and Diophantine approximation, with emphasis on the fundamental
analytic ideas involved. The lectures will call attention to a number of topics
of common interest to both analytic number theorists and harmonic analysts, and
will provide basic instruction on those areas.
