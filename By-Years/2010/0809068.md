Geometric and computational problems involving points and objects of various
shapes are basic to the understanding of geometric modeling, computer graphics,
the analysis and synthesis of mechanisms, robot manipulation, structural
analysis, protein folding and granular materials, for example. What are the
geometric principles that are relevant to understanding how configurations of
linkages in the plane can be reconfigured? What are the basic geometric tools
that can be applied to understand and analyze the area/volume of various
arrangements and formulas for the union and intersections of circular disks in
the plane or space? Recent advances have shown that there are some subtle and
insightful ideas that can be brought to bear on these very basic problems that
include packing and covering problems as extreme special cases.

Suppose a configuration of points in the plane or space is given. The distance
between some (but not all) of the pairs of these points is fixed. Is there
another corresponding configuration, other than congruent copies of the original
configuration, of the points with corresponding distances the same? When this
occurs, the configuration is called globally rigid. When the configuration is
sufficiently generic, there is a reasonable algorithm to determine if it is
globally rigid. This is of interest in protein folding, point location problems
and structural stability, for example. It is proposed that this theory and
corresponding algorithms can be used to provide structural information about the
shapes of molecules as well as the stability of a wide variety of novel
structures.
