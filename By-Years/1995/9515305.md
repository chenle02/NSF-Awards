This research is part of multi-stage program seeking to develop new methods in
risk analysis building on multiobjective trade-off analysis of vehicle-safety
interventions for evaluating changes in future vehicle design. In Phase I of
this effort, fault-tree models for accident causation and consequence were
developed that use historical accident databases to analyze the potential
effectiveness of vehicle safety features. Phase II integrated the `100 Crashes`
scenarios (a data-driven catalog of severe accident types), accident statistics
from Michigan, and expert assessment of safety technologies to demonstrate a
trade-off analysis of the benefits and costs of 15 prospective vehicle safety
features. This funding supports Phase III, and adapts the fault trees for event-
occurrence rates that are based on travel exposure, applies them to crash
scenarios of automated urban interstates, and assesses the performance benefits
of vehicle-safety technologies in order to reduce the losses of lives and
property on automated highway systems. This research is funded under the Joint
NSF/Private Sector Initiative with the continued strong collaboration of senior
scientists from General Motors.
