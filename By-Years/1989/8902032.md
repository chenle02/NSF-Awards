This award supports cooperative research in theoretical condensed matter
physics to be conducted by Eduardo Fradkin of the University of Illinois at
Urbana and Fidel Schaposnik of the University of La Plata in Argentina. The
study of Fermionic models in condensed matter physics and field theory is an
extremely active area of theoretical physics. Here, path-integral methods will
be used to study the Kondo effect, resonating valence band models of
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism and related field theoretical models.
These techniques will be used to understand the consequences of symmetries,
anomalies and topology as well as currently proposed models for high-temperature
superconductivity and related field theories. The Physics Department at Illinois
is one of the leading institutions in the U.S. in condensed matter physics, both
theory and experiment. The Laboratory for Theoretical Physics at the University
of La Plata is internationally recognized for contributions to the study of
anomalies in field theory. These techniques are particularly useful in the field
of high-temperature superconductors. The research interests of the two groups
are complementary and the continued collaboration will develop further exchanges
and cooperation between scientists, post-docs and students.
