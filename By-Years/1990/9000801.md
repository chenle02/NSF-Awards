This award provides funds to the Program in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
(PMBB) to establish a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) Site. PMBB
is an independent campus-wide unit created to promote genetic engineering
research and education at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
Academically promising students chosen from a national pool will participate in
ongoing research carried out by a select group of PMBB faculty. Emphasis will be
placed on recruitment of students with limited research opportunities and on
students from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. Two students
will be funded by the UNC School of Medicine and eight funded by the NSF REU
program. In addition, matching University funds will be available and earmarked
for two additional minority students, for a total of 12 participants. The
overall goals are to (1) introduce students to a range of biological research
and techniques, particularly in molecular biology and molecular genetics, (2)
familiarize students with the process of independent research, (3) promote
developments of laboratory and communication skills, and (4) provide counseling
to aid students in selection of graduate programs. To meet these goals students
will (1) work for ten weeks with faculty on projects having meaningful
scientific objectives and derived from ongoing research, (2) attend weekly
research topic discussions with each faculty preceptor, (3) attend a workshop in
which Directors of Graduate Studies from various departments provide students
with advice and information about Ph.D programs, and (4) present the results of
their research in talks before the campus community.
