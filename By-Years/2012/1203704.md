This award seeks to develop millennium-length estimates of the strength of Asian
monsoon atmospheric circulation and to infer variability in past monsoon
circulation from replicated, annually-resolved stable oxygen isotope time series
from the long-lived southeast Asian conifer Fokienia hodginsii in Vietnam and
Laos. The research leverages a previously supported pilot study that
demonstrated that tree-ring isotopes from this species in this region responds
to broad-scale patterns of Asian monsoon circulation that are consistent with
climate dynamics, known controls on the stable isotopes of precipitation, and
the physical and chemical mechanisms comprising the study of isotope
dendroclimatology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impacts include
supporting undergraduates in the planned research and providing a potentially
important new archive of data from a climatologically sensitive region.
