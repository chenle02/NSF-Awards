9600492 Eliel This is a 12 month award proposed by Dr. Ernest Eliel, American
Chemical Society and Professor Tai-Shan Fang, National Taiwan Normal University.
This proposal requests funds to convene a U.S.-Taiwan symposium on innovations
in undergraduate education in chemistry. This symposium will be modeled after
the U.S. Gordon Conferences; eight U.S. educators and seven Taiwan educators
will present lectures. Twenty college chemistry educators and students from the
U.S. will be invited to attend. Innovation in undergraduate education in
chemistry is an important topic in the development of human resources in science
and international research infrastructures. This topic is particularly
opportune, since chemistry education in Taiwan has been undergoing a major
change. The Ministry of Education has spent a billion dollars remodeling the
chemistry laboratories at 20 universities during the last ten years. The
experience gained from this renovation will be useful to share with chemistry
educators in the U.S. The meeting will be held at the University of California
at San Diego on December 15-18, 1996 and is jointly supported by the Taiwan
National Science Council and the NSF.
