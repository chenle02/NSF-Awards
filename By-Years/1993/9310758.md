9310758 Gladue Pollution, overfishing, health concerns and increased consumer
demand have enhanced the importance of acquaculture as a source of edible
seafood. However, increased production of cultured marine finfish will depend on
improvements in larval culture, currently hampered by inadequate supplies of
rotifers (B. plicatilis), which are used as larval fish food. And rotifers feed
on microalgae, which can be difficult and expensive to produce. Heterotrophic
(without light) production of algae should significantly reduce the cost and
difficulty of rotifer production while significantly reducing water usage. This
Phase II project will measure the growth and survival of larval red drum
(Sciaenops ocellata) on rotifers that are fed heterotrophic vs. photosynthetic
algae. The ability of the heterotrophic algae to be cultured at high biomass
densities in laboratory- and production-scale fermentors will also be evaluated.
