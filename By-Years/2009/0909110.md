This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Kumar's research program will
address two fundamental issues regarding long duration Gamma Ray Bursters
(GRBs). The first is the mechanism for production of the prompt gamma-ray
emission and how the energy in an expanding jet is converted into radiation. The
second involves the properties of the progenitor stars and the nature of the
"central engine" powering GRBs. Both will be examined using model-independent
theoretical methods of analysis and data modeling. The research will make use of
data obtained by various ground based telescopes supported by the NSF and also
space-based telescopes. The result will be an enhanced understanding of GRBs and
the nature of the stars that explode to produce them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training of students, public
lectures, and a course for future K-12 teachers on how to teach science and
conduct research.
