This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research aimed at the
study of transport dynamics in magnetic and correlated electron systems in novel
materials. The collaboration brings together the complementary expertise of
Srinivas Sridhar of Northeastern University and A. Revcolevschi of the
University of Paris at Orsay. The US investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in microwave measurement techniques. He will conduct measurements of
surface impedance. This is complemented by French experience in the area of
crystal growth. The French investigator's group will prepare high temperature
superconducting cuprates. These materials were chosen for this study because of
their high quality and low dimensionality. The collaboration will advance our
knowledge of phenomena related to the dynamics of charge, spin, superconducting
pairs and quasi-particles, and superconducting vortices. ?> / ?ÁÂ%Á?¥??Á ¢Á/?Á?
