This is a proposal to purchase a confocal scanning light microscope to be used
by a group of developmental and cell biologists. This microscope uses a solid-
state beam deflecting device to achieve very high speed image recording. The
instrument will be used predominantly for developmental studies, reconstructing
critical events in animal development. Fluorescent markers will be used to tag
specific cells or molecules in the developing organism, and confocal microscope
images will be acquired, stored, reconstructed and analyzed using integrated
computer software. The group of developmental biologists proposes to study
pattern formation and cellular determination in a variety of organisms. They
will also study nerve cell growth and differentiation during development. Cell
biologists will use the microscope to visualize and analyze transient events,
such as transport, organelle assembly, orientation and disassembly.
