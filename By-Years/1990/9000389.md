This project will focus on the public policy response to mitigate future
devastating natural disasters, including earthquakes, resulting from Hurricane
Hugo in the state of South Carolina and the city of Charleston. The objectives
of the project are to: (1) identify significant components of the natural
hazards public policy adoption process, (2) identify mitigation measures, and
(3) develop a model identifying factors that impede or facilitate the adoption
of specific mitigation measures. Project tasks include: (1.) identifying key
influentials in Charleston and Columbia who are critical to the natural hazards
mitigation adoption process; (2.) conducting interviews with key influentials;
and (3.) constructing a model that can be used to predict policy adoption in the
natural hazards arena.
