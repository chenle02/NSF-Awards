The author of this SGER Proposal aims to synthesize and characterize a new class
of laser materials for the visible and near infrared spectral region. The solid-
state synthesis of compounds consisting of reduced rare earth metal phosphates
will be pursued, with the emphasis of this effort on the lower valent rare earth
metal cations such as scandium and yttrium in an oxo- type phosphate anion
framework. Growing single crystals and characterizing new phases by techniques
such as powder or single crystal x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy,
differential thermal analysis, magnetic susceptability, photoelectron
spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy will be done with equipment
presently aailable for this project at Rice University. The exploratory
synthesis of new classes of compounds with unusual oxidation states and
coordination is a rapidly emerging area that is providing new materials or
important "hot technology" areas such as magnetism and new laser materials
exhibiting sharp fluorescent lines, strong absorption bands, and high quantum
efficiencies.
