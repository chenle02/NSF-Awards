The objective of the proposed research program is the development and
demonstration of adaptable vibration analysis sensors which use specialized
weighted-sensitivity optical fiber waveguide structures. Several methods to
create the necessary sensitivity variations along the length of the waveguide
are suggested, based in part upon prior published research of the principal
investigators and Fiber & Sensor Technologies, Inc. Extensions of this work to
further permit the realtime modification of such spatial fiber sensitivity
profiles, and hence the in-line optical signal processing of integrated sensor
signals, will also be investigated. Applications of sensor instrumentation
products which would use such adaptive, weighted fiber elements include
vibration analysis systems for noise suppression, active structural acoustic
control, and structural damage monitoring. Additional uses in adaptive
electromagnetic detection arrays for both the communication and biomedical
diagnostics areas seem possible. Fiber & Sensor Technologies will with
cooperation from the Fiber & ElectroOptics Research Center at Virginia Tech to
model, fabricate and test the performance of weighted sensitivity fibers for
selective vibrational mode analysis of laboratory demonstration articles during
the proposed Phase I project.
