WGBH/Boston in association with the Chedd-Angier Production plan the production
of a series of five one hour public television programs on the environmental
history of North America, "A Continent Transformed". Each of the programs will
emphasize a key process which has shaped American environmental history:
biological invasion, drawing boundaries, linking transportation and market
systems, projecting ideals onto the landscape, and increasing the pace and
complexity of systematic change. The principal author of the series and its on
camera host will be William Cronin, a leading ecological historian. The series
will be assisted by a prestigious Advisory Board, educational materials will be
developed for series classrom use, and 8 million viewers should see each episode
when the series airs in the Fall of 1992. NSF support will represent
approximately 10% of the project total.
