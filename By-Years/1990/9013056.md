The doctoral student is Michael N. Keas. His topic is "The Structure and
Philosophy of Group Research: A. W. Hofmann's Research Program in London and
Berlin." As a teacher, experimentalist, and organizer of science, August Wilhelm
von Hofmann (1818-1892) made an important contribution to both British and
German chemistry. He improved the laboratory research and instructional methods
developed by Justus Liebig in Giessen and pondered their epistemological
assumptions long after Liebig had retreated to agricultural chemistry. Hofmann
became the first professor of the British Royal College of Chemistry in 1845 and
continued his teaching and research in London until 1865 when he accepted an
invitation to direct the chemistry program at the University of Berlin. A number
of his students and assistants became prominent chemists in England and Germany.
Under this grant for doctoral dissertation research support, Mr. Keas aims to
analyze the composition, organization, and methodology of A. W. Hofmann's
laboratory research group and to explain how these factors guided the group's
choice and solution of research problems. his approach combines tools of social
and intellectual history. He hopes to show how the composition and organization
of the research group interacted both in harmonious and in conflicting ways with
Hofmann's academic goals and scientific presuppositions to carry out a body of
group research achievements.
