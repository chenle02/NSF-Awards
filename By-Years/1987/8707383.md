The development of beams of fast bare ions in the last two decades has allowed
atomic physicists to vary the coupling constant in non-trivial ion-atom
reactions, and much has been learned. In atoms, the electrons provide a wide
range of velocity scales, and thus there has been motivation to concentrate on
developing efficient computer codes to simultaneously describe excitation,
ionization, and charge transfer in a broad energy region. The method chosen by
the principal investigators for such studies has been a variational expansion of
the wavefunction in a truncated space of Hilbert basis functions. Until now, all
work done by the principal investigators has been carried out in the independent
particle model approximation. In the present work, the Forced Impulse Method,
which allows the solution of the fully correlated two- electron problem, will be
developed.
