9305708 Prave PI will construct an outcrop-based sequence stratigraphic
framework for upper member Crystal Spring Formation and Stirling through Wood
Canyon formations section of the Proterozoic-Cambrian sequence in the Death
Valley region. Goals include: 1) testing conflicting hypotheses with regard to
tectonic setting of deposition; 2) correlation to a better-dated succession; 3)
attempting to determine if regionally significant bounding surfaces indicate
significant hiatuses; and 4) testing paleogeographic consequences of
palinspastic reconstructions.
