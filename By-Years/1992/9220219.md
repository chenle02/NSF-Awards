9220219 Comrie The Principal Investigators will prepare a descriptive grammar of
Tsez (Dido), a hitherto little investigated language of the Daghestan region in
the Caucasus mountains, in collaboration with a native speaker of Tsez. The
grammar will throw light on a number of phenomena of current interest in
linguistic theory, including gender/class systems, ergativity, clause linkage,
and extraction phenomena. In addition to the grammar, the Principal
Investigators intend to prepare a collection of Tsez texts with dictionary for
publication, and to publish articles on points of more general interest in Tsez
grammar. This detailed work on the Tsez language will also contribute to our
understanding of historical-linguistic and ethnic patterns in Daghestan, an
important cultural area on the border of Russian and Islamic spheres of
influence. ***
