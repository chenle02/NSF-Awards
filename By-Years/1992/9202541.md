This proposal studies the materials which are formed during the crystallization
of polymers dissolved in a supercritical fluid. Polymers such as linear
polyethylene and polypropylene are completely miscible with toluene under
supercritical conditions. As the mixture is cooled and depressurized, polymer
crystals form in a linked network. The gaseous solvent is removed by
depressurization, leaving the crystalline network intact. The result is a
solvent-free gel or foam of uniform structure, and with a broad range of
porosities and mechanical strengths which can be varied depending upon the
crystallization conditions. The process has the advantage over liquid phase
crystallization where removal of the solvent usually destroys the crystalline
network. The proposal will study the mechanical strength and microstructure of
these gels formed from a variety of different polymer precursors, including
polymer blends.
