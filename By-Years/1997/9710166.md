With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate, Professor Edward L. Clennan, of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Wyoming, studies the oxidation of organosulfur compounds with
molecular oxygen. Professor Clennan examines the reactions of dialkylsulfides
with singlet oxygen, in which both physical quenching and chemical reaction are
observed, elucidating their mechanisms by observing reactive intermediates such
as O,S-sulfenyl sulfinates and thiopersulfoxides. The photooxidations of
thiolanes and 1,3-dithianes are also explored, focusing on the formation and
reactions of hydroperoxy sulfonium ylides. In order both to investigate the
fundamental influence of environment on organic sulfide oxidations and to
develop new synthetic methods, Professor Clennan examines the electron transfer
oxidation of 1,3-dithianes and the molecular oxidation of sulfides in zeolite
microenvironments. Sulfur-containing organic compounds and their oxidation are
matters of considerable importance in a wide variety of biological, atmospheric,
and industrial processes. Professor Edward L. Clennan, of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Wyoming, with the support of the Organic Dynamics
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate, studies the reactions of sulfur-containing
molecules with oxygen. Through analysis of the products of these reactions and
of the intermediate compounds formed en route to these products, Professor
Clennan sheds light on the fundamental molecular events responsible for their
formation. In addition to the provision of a more general understanding of such
oxidation reactions, these studies are leading to the development of new
mechanistic tools to explore light-assisted oxidation reactions and the
discovery of new and useful oxidizing environments and new methods for the
synthesis of important materials.
