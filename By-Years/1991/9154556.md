The project will present a mini-course on the elements of a successful
scientific conference. Particular attention will be given to behind the scenes
operations, logistics, arrangements, and publicity. Participants will get hands-
on experiences in conferencing. NSF program officers will discuss particular NSF
programs. Programs aimed at minority institutions and programs designed to
increase minority participation in the scientific community will be emphasized.
An objective of this project is to increase the number of minorities submitting
proposals to NSF.
