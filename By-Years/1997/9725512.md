9725512 Doerr Calls for reform in mathematics teaching suggest that teacher
should reflect on their own practice and guide their students' mathematical
development by creating lessons sequences that support students' efforts to
construct increasingly sophisticated understandings over time. However, pre-
service teachers in methods courses do not have a practice on which to reflect,
and have little, if any, first-hand experience observing the processes by which
students develop mathematical conceptions over time. As a result, this proposal
has been written to fill this void by creating, implementing, and researching
three CD-ROM based case studies centered on actual lessons sequences taught in
reform-based classrooms at the middle and secondary level. The two goals of this
proposed project are (1) to better understand how multimedia case studies can be
used to support the development of effective practice among pre-service
mathematics teachers, and (2) to refine our design theory to elaborate specific
aspects that make cases more effective in promoting such reflection. ***
