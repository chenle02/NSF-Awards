This project in precision measurements seeks to measure at greatly improved
accuracy the following four fundamental quantities: 1) the magnetic moment of
the electron (often called its g value) ; 2) the fine structure constant; 3) the
ratio of positron and electron g values; and 4) the ratio of the masses of the
proton and electron. The measurement of the fine structure constant, along with
the measurement of g, will test QED to an unprecedented level of accuracy.
Greatly improved techniques for trapping positrons will aid the comparison of
measured g values for the electron and positron to provide the best test of CPT
invariance with a lepton system.
