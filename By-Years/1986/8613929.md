This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a Zeiss inverted microscope and
accessories. The microscope will be used to: l. Evaluate the cytostructural and
secretory properties of cultured rat pituitary cells in order to determine
whether subpopulations of gonadotropin secreting cells are differentially
recruited to release hormone during periods of continuous hormonal stimulation,
2. Quantitate changes in endothelial cell morphology and migration behavior in
response to activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cell factor, 3.
Identify and study ion channel distributions on cultured myocardial and vascular
smooth muscle cells, 4. Study the transfer of fluorescent dyes between coupled
myocardial cells and to obtain cellular morphometric data, and 5. Evaluate the
functional properties of acetylcholine containing ventral horn neurons. The
microscope and accessories will benefit the faculty of the Department of
Physiology and will allow the department to expand and broaden its basic
research potential in electrophysiology.
