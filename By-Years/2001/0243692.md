This proposal requests funds for a group at Northern Illinois University (NIU)
to pursue a research and education program with high-energy particle colliders
to search for new phenomena. Their two main activities will be centered on the
D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron and on Linear Collider Detector
calorimetry and muon tracking. The goals of the D0 experiment are to study the
top quark and electroweak bosons, to search for new phenomena such as
supersymmetric particles and quark compositeness and to study Quantum
Chromodynamics. The NIU group, in addition to contributing to the searches for
new physics, will lead the efforts on commissioning the tracking trigger, on
calibrating the muon scintillation counters and working on the second hardware
stage of the muon trigger and parts of the muon software analysis code and
particle identification. They will also coordinate the tau and jet
identification working groups in D0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIU group is
active in linear collider R&amp;D, working on a digital hadron calorimeter
prototype, on simulations and energy flow algorithms and on muon tracking
detector design studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will also have a broad
impact on education in northern Illinois from K-12 through graduate school. The
group operates an outreach program for local elementary and secondary schools
and community centers. This is designed to increase scientific knowledge in the
immediate area and to familiarize citizens with high-energy physics and with
Fermilab.&lt;br/&gt;
