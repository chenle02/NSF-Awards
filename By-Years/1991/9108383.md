This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from Rutgers University studying the indigenous Negrito people of the Andaman
Islands, India. These islands were the site of some important ethnographic
research on hunter- gatherers in the early part of this century, and have not
been restudied in recent times. This project traces the history of the Indian
state's administration of the indigenous societies, the history of resettlement
of mainlanders, and the diminution of the native populations. Methods involve
participant observation, in-depth life history interviews, and the study of
local government archives. This project is important because the declining
population and immense health and social problems of local indigenous peoples
caused by their interaction with national states has been a recurring tragedy.
This case study of a group studied several generations ago will add valuable
material that can help policy makers understand the impact of state involvement
with native peoples, and hopefully ameliorate the negative impact of the
interaction.
