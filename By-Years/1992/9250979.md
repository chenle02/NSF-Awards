Physics Pathways - Initial Step is the first phase of a five- year initiative in
the Department of Physics at North Carolina State University to improve and
extend opportunities for students in lower-division physics courses to learn in
a technologically rich environment. This Initial Step is expanding the existing
program of teaching problem solving in physics using interactive courseware
(Physics 1 and 2) from 50 students per semester to 1,000 students per semester.
By networking 50 IBM student workstations and installing a curriculum manager,
we are able to offer a one student-one computer learning environment for large
service courses. In addition, the expanded PCIC facility is being used twice per
semester to assess and monitor the development of basic laboratory skills such
as error analysis, significant figures, and curve fitting. The Physics Pathways
program, when fully operational, will offer choices to students for how they
wish to learn. This Initial Step is helping to initiate the scaling up of both
the quality and number of microcomputers available for teaching large numbers of
students. The problems being attacked by this project are common to many large
universities. If Physics Pathways - Initial Step is successful, the model we are
developing will be transferrable to other settings.
