9402568 Luckett NYSERNet, Inc. proposes NSFNET connection-assistance for adding
the following schools to NYSERNET: New York Institute of Technology, SUNY Health
Science Center at Brooklyn, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and Le Moyne
College. NYSERnet will connect these colleges to its backbone network which in
turn will be connected to an inter-regional service provider . This new
architecture will allow for total networking capabilities among the nation's
research and education enterprise. Research, education, and access to resources
on the NSFNET are all benefits for connection for these participating
institutions. Each has submitted a proposal requesting aid through NYSERNet.
Each is presently connected or is awaiting installation of a connection to the
network. Each is committed to supporting the full cost of networking once their
subsidy support is concluded.
