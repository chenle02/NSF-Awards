Ideas from Gromov-Witten theory in the 90's have led to new perspectives on
classical questions of complex enumerative geometry. Many old problems have been
elegantly solved. An example is the basic question of counting rational curves
in the plane passing through given points.

Beginning about 10 year later, in the present decade, a renewal of interest in
enumerative questions in real algebraic geometry has occurred with impetus from
Gromov-Witten theory and tropical methods.

The workshop on "Real, topical, and complex enumerative geometry" will, for the
first time, bring mathematicians in these various fields together for a common
discussion of results, ideas, and future directions.

Several lecture courses addressed to broad audiences will take place during the
first week. C. Faber, A. Gathmann, R. Vakil and J.-Y. Welschinger have agreed to
give lecture series. Graduate students interested in the field will greatly
benefits from these courses. The second week will have several 1 hour research
talks on more advanced topics.

The main purpose of the grant is to allow junior US mathematicians the
opportunity of participating in the workshop.
