The objectives of this research are: (1) optimum design and control of the
resistance brazing process using Taguchi-class optimization techniques; (2)
investigation of the influence of process parameters on mechanical and
electrical properties of the brazed joints; and (3) development of a physical
model based on microstructural analysis in order to rationalize the results and
to enhance the understanding of brazeability of electrical contacts made out of
dispersion-strengthened composites. This study includes the development of an
experimentally- based process model using Taguchi's experimental design
approach. The signal-to-noise ratio method will be used to analyze the results
in order to explore the optimum process conditions that yield the best joint
quality with minimum variation about the target value. The results of the
metallurgical investigation will be correlated with fracture loads, fracture
surface, and resistivity of the brazed joint. This will provide a better
understanding of the dependence of brazing joint microstructure on processing
variables such as brazing current, heating time, electrode force, and joint
clearance.
