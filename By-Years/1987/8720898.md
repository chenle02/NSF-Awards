This project studies the design of international and domestic policies when a
government has incomplete information about its own citizens or firms, or about
its trading partners. Examples of incomplete information include the moving
costs of trade- displaced workers, production costs of domestic or foreign
firms, or political pressure faced abroad. The project applies for the first
time the theory of the design of incentive compatible mechanisms to problems in
international trade policy. In this theory, a government or international
organization maximizes some social choice function, recognizing that the various
agents may optimally misrepresent the private information they have. According
to the revelation principle it is possible for the government to achieve its
objectives by using truth-revealing or "incentive compatible" policies, i.e.,
policies which are designed so that the agents choose to tell the truth. In the
examples given above, incentive compatible policies would lead workers to reveal
their disutility of moving or foreign firms to reveal their production costs.
Another feature of this research is that governments maximize an objective
function based on political interests (such as votes or lobbying). Specific
policy problems considered include: the ranking of trade and domestic
instruments; international regulation of domestic policies; design of "status
quo" trade, to be used when countries cannot agree on a policy; and design of
incentive compatible mechanisms when countries cannot commit to a trade policy
over time.
