This project studies small clusters composed a few to dozens of atoms. The
clusters are formed in the gas phase at very low temperatures -- otherwise they
would fall apart. The research sheds light on the mechanisms by which individual
atoms (particularly helium and neon) attack one another and form larger masses
leading to the bulk phase. The research also looks at electrically charged
clusters and their properties, which also provide information about the build up
of materials firm atoms or clusters.
