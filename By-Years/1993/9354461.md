9354461 Meloan The project will continue an effort to develop a comprehensive
six semester curriculum in chemistry. Much of the effort will be directed at
organic chemistry concepts. The laboratory oriented approach will be
individualized so that students from different majors and interests can learn
chemistry within a context that excites and interests them. This will include
experiments on food chemistry, tanning, soil chemistry, etc. All students will
be exposed to standard techniques through videos and other approaches. The
experiments are all multipart and extend over several laboratory sessions. They
focus on real world situations which has proven to be exciting to the students.
