Formation of precipitation in deep convective storms has long been recognized
as such a complex process that numerical simulations are needed to assist
scientists in understanding critical physical processes. The situation is even
more complicated when considering the question of artificial modification of
precipitation. The Principal Investigator will use advanced numerical models to
study cloud seeding effects on the cloud and regional scale. Questions to be
addressed include: (1) how would the distribution of precipitation over an area
be altered by cloud seeding; (2) can seeding of individual clouds within a cloud
group lead to a more favorable environment for the development of successive
generations of clouds; what are the primary and secondary modes of ice
generation in clouds of different types and how does seeding affect these
different situations? Model results will be continuously compared to actual data
collected from previously completed field programs. In the second year of the
award the Principal Investigator may participate in a field program using the
numerical models in a real time predictive mode. Model results will be used to
help guide the activities of the field program on a daily basis.
