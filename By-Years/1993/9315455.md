9315455 Phinney Several related studies in theoretical astrophysics will be
conducted. One concerns interactions between members of binary star systems
which are caused by the fact that stars are neither static nor elastic. Mass
transfer between an ordinary star and its black hole or neutron star companion
will be modeled to account for observations of x-ray binaries and planets
orbiting pulsars. A broad research program will be undertaken which is aimed at
understanding how stars may form in the densest nuclei of galaxies and what
these stars tell us about star formation. ***
