The Department of Geological Sciences at Northwestern University requests
funding from NSF to pay for 45% of the cost of upgrading their computer system.
The remaining 55% will be contributed by Northwestern University. The computer
system will be use primarily for research in global plate motions, display and
analysis of large data sets for digital topography, marine magnetics and
satellite altimetry, physics of the earth's deep interior, subduction zone
dynamics, and the evolution of divergent plate boundaries. The proposed upgrade,
consisting of a fileserver and two graphics workstations, will be an asset in
these areas of research because of the much faster turnaround time in numerical
processing and the greatly enhanced modeling capabilities of the new graphics
system.
