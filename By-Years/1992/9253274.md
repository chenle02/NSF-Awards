This project will train K-12 educators in Wisconsin, from August 1, 1992
through July 30, 1995, to incorporate environmental education into all areas of
the curriculum. This will be done by having twenty-five environmental educators
offer 30 courses per year in locations throughout the state. This program will
also initiate a Master's degree in environmental education at the University of
Wisconsin at Stevens Point that will provide 50 teachers the opportunity to
become leaders in environmental education. There is an approximate cost-share of
15%.
