This research addresses the need for high brightness sources of high current
pulsed electron beams through an in depth study of electron emission from
ferroelectric materials. Recently copious emission of electrons has been
observed from ferroelectric materials upon fast polarization change. Using lead
zirconium titanate (PZT) and lead lanthanam zirconium titanate (PLZT) electron
emission current densities of 100A/cm2 have been observed. This current density
is about an order of magnitude larger than possible with thermionic cathodes and
close to the maximum obtained with laser driven photocathodes. The ferroelectric
source is a room temperature emitter with a theoretical brightness limit a
3.2X1012 A/m2.rad2 which is an order of magnitude large than present
photocathodes. The beam emittance, brightness and spatial profile will be
measured during Phase I. This simple source has the potential to replace
thermionic and photocathodes in advanced accelerators and RF sources. The source
is potentially attractive due to the high brightness obtainable with a simple
system as compared to thermionic cathodes requiring pulsed bunching for high
currents or photocathodes driven by large lasers.
