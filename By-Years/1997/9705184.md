9705184 Chevalier This is an award to support preliminary work on use of
surfactants to alter the interfacial tension of fluids that change the
characteristics of their movement through aquifers they have contaminated. The
project involves procedures that simulate the use of pumps to withdraw non-
aqueous fluids such as gasoline that have contaminated aquifers. The research
will be conducted by use of a laboratory-scale model that can be used to study
the effect of the surfactants on the capillary, gravitational and viscous forces
that affect the motion of fluids through porous and permeable subsurface
formations. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to an
NSF Program Announcement for Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement
Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers, NSF 93-130. Results are expected to
provide information that can be used in determining the feasibility of the
process to be studied and the basis for further research in restoration of water
quality in aquifers contaminated by non-aqueous fluids. ***
