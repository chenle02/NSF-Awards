This research will look at robust estimation of multivariate location and
dispersion. The standard classical estimators are the sample mean vector and
sample covariance matrix. The affine equivariant M-estimator is robust but has
several unresolved problems associated with it. Direct efforts to solve the
problems of nonuniqueness for finite sample sizes and lack of a convergent
algorithm to find these estimates have failed. The investigator proposes two
stage estimators to circumvent these difficulties. The second problem is of
identifying non-elliptical point clouds based on the robust residuals. Emphasis
will be placed on detecting data sets which cause the breakdown of the M-
estimators. The investigator also suggests to study the efficiencies of
M-estimators and the higher breakdown statistics under a non- i.i.d. setting.
