Data generated from multiphysics simulations, such as binary black hole mergers
and fluid dynamics, have experienced exponential growth because of the growing
capabilities of computing facilities. At the same time, data-intensive science
relies on the acquisition, management, analysis, and visualization of data with
increasing spatial and temporal resolutions. This project develops a new set of
approaches to support the core tasks in scientific data visualization (such as
feature tracking, event detection, ensemble analysis, and interactive
visualization) in a way that is more reflective of the underlying physics using
measure theory. The results will be instantiated by a collection of open-source
software tools to be deployed for the collaborating scientists in materials
science and high-performance computing, and the larger research community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages tools from geometric measure
theory, information theory, and transportation theory for topology-based
visualization, which utilizes topological concepts to describe, reduce and
organize data for scientific understanding and communication. The project
focuses on two technical components. The first component represents topological
descriptors as metric spaces equipped with probability measures, which supports
their enrichments with physical quantities, information quantification, and
comparative analysis. The second component uses information and transportation
theory to enable a wide variety of visualization tasks for time-varying data and
ensembles. The project couples correspondence criteria with optimization
processes from optimal transport to understand the evolution of features of
interest; incorporates uncertainty in event detection with geometric measures;
as well as utilizes statistics of metric measure spaces to guide interactive
visualization. The investigator works closely with scientists using data from
astrophysics, materials science, and mechanical engineering to evaluate and tune
the framework to better reflect the underlying physics. This project provides a
unique environment for multidisciplinary activities and training opportunities
for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
