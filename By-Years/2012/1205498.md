Recent declines in the cost of DNA sequencing have enabled biologists to conduct
experiments that produce very large DNA and protein sequence data sets.
Understanding this data requires computational analyses to recognize known
sequences and group new ones by similarity. As data sets grow, these analyses
become a serious bottleneck to progress. Computer scientists have therefore
tried to accelerate sequence analysis using hybrid computing architectures that
combine multicore CPUs with accelerators, such as field-programmable gate arrays
and graphics engines, whose performance equals that of tens or hundreds of CPU
cores. To more effectively accelerate biosequence analysis tasks, new
infrastructure is needed to facilitate both development of accelerated
analytical tools and their deployment to biologists.

This project is a planning effort to create development and deployment
infrastructure for accelerated biosequence analysis applications. The PIs are
developing design criteria for a preferred hardware platform and set of software
tools to speed the creation, validation, and deployment of biosequence
accelerators. Key activities include qualifying hardware platforms, developing
prototype software and firmware, and consulting developer and user communities
for accelerated sequence analysis tools to guide the planning effort. In
particular, the PIs are organizing a special track at a major accelerator design
conference to solicit input on proposed infrastructure.

Developing the proposed infrastructure will stimulate creation of biosequence
analysis accelerators with low cost, rapid deployment, and a large supporting
developer and user community. More agile development will boost adoption of
accelerators by biologists, empowering labs to analyze massive biosequence data
sets and speeding discovery.
