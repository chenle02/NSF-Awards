The goals of this project are to advance the state-of-the- art in language-based
tools for software engineering. There are three related aspects to the research:
(1) extending dependence-graph-based tools, (2) carrying out theoretical and
practical studies of pointer analysis, and (3) quantifying trade-offs in
dataflow analysis. The work builds on the prior research in two areas: the
design and implementation of software engineering tools, and the design,
implementation and evaluation of algorithms for dataflow analysis. The first
part of the work includes the continuation of previous NSF-supported research
extending underlying theory to permit graph-based tools to be used for a wider
range of languages than is currently possible, and improving existing graph
based tools. It also includes new directions: the design and implementation of
new tools using a hybrid approach that combines text or syntax-based tools with
semantic checks. The research on pointer analysis and dataflow analysis
tradeoffs is complementary to the work on dependence graphs, since the results
are expected to improve the graph-based tools. They are also expected to be
useful to other researchers and practitioners concerned with applications that
rely on the results of static analysis. ***
