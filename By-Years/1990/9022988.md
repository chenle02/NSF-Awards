This proposal is to examine and compare sources of contem- porary racial unrest
in the United States and in South Africa. The proposed research builds on
previous research supported by NSF and expands the ecological perspective by (1)
considering how the timing and goals of state actions regarding desegregation
policies intensify racial competition and conflict, (2) establishing a
comparative context within which new applications of event-history methods will
be applied to the best available data on racial conflicts in the United States
and South Africa, and (3) giving substantial attention to violent events
initiated by dominant groups: white citizens, the police, and other agents of
the state apparatuses in the two countries. The key argument is that initial
deviation from complete segregation sparks intense racial unrest. This argument
is tested using data on desegregation and racial conflict in cities in the
United States during 1960-1990 and in cities in South Africa during 1970-1984.
Data on the occurrence and timing of racial events have been coded from
newspaper accounts that provide continuous coverage of events in the United
States and South Africa. The proposed project uses event-history methods to
analyze parallel models of racial conflict in the two countries. Such models use
information on the exact timing and duration of events so that effects of
changes in racial policies and racial segregation during this period can be
examined directly.
