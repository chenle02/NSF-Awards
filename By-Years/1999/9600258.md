The Princeton group will continue their broad and outstanding program of
research in theoretical physics. This will involve continued study of
superstring theories, of two and higher dimensional quantum gravity, of
nonperturbative approaches to string theory, of the new symmetries of string
theory that are now being revealed and of the phenomenology of string theory.
They will also study QCD, focusing on numerical investigation, the construction
of an effective string theory of hadronic flux tubes and on the large N limit,
and will carry out a continue study of the physics of the standard model and
unified theories that can produce large scale structure in the universe. In
addition they will study turbulence bringing to bear on this problem new
insights from quantum field theory. This group's research has had an enormous
impact on modern theoretical physics. They have created a true center of
excellence of international renown.
