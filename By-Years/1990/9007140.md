The Principal Investigators request an autoclave with clean steam, which is
essential to aseptic culture without harmful residues from house steam; two
biosafety hoods to protect workers when transformed cells are being used; and an
electronic particle counter which is essential for rapidly monitoring growth
kinetics and cell size. Examples of projects to be supported by the requested
equipment are: 1) development of improved bioreactors and operating strategies
for production of proteins and insecticides from the insect cell-baculovirus
system; 2) testing of mathematical models that predict responses in cellular
physiology to alterations in culture conditions; 3) development of cell-culture
analogs to pharmokinetic models for the purpose of improved risk assessment with
respect to potentially toxic chemicals; 4) model studies on the dynamics of
receptor-mediated cell adhesion; 5) development ofan experimental model of cell
adhesion to blood vessels to preventmetastasis or the spread of tumor cells from
one organ within the body, using metastatic cell lines; and 6) the development
of biomaterials for culture of attachment-dependent cell lines to improve
bioreactor performance.
