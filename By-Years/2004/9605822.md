AST-9605822 George Wolf The knowledge of many basic stellar properties is
dependent on observations of binary stars. The values for stellar absolute
dimensions and masses, for example, are dependent on the study of the eclipsing
members of the spectroscopic binary stars. This research project will use the
techniques of CCD differential photometry to focus on (1) obtaining and
analyzing light curves of known, but neglected, longer-period eclipsing binaries
with double-line orbital solutions and (2) searching for new eclipsing binaries
among known double-line spectroscopic binaries. The major purpose of the
research will be that of extending the base of known stellar properties,
absolute dimensions and masses. The long-term observations required for study of
these types of binary stars are most effectively done at small observatories
with focused observational priorities. The astronomical observations and
analysis for this research will be carried out mainly with the use of the CCD
detector system on the modernized, semi-automated 0.4 meter telescope of the
Baker Observatory at Southwest Missouri State University. Undergraduate
students, supported separately by a NASA grant to the Missouri Space Grant
Consortium, will form an integral part of this research and will assist in all
phases of the observations, data analysis and dissemination of the results. ***
