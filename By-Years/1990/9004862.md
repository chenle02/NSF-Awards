This award provides matching funds that will be applied toward the purchase of
a new generation, sensitive, high- resolution ion microprobe to be installed and
operated in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of
California, Los Angeles. UCLA is committed to matching more than 50% of the
acquisition costs of this equipment. The need to better understand the evolution
of the Earth and its natural resources requires continual advances in the
ability to characterize the geochemical properties of Earth materials, and
isotope geochemistry in particular has made outstanding contributions by
permitting age dating of materials and events in Earth history and the use of
isotope tracers for delineating the transfer of material during both local- and
global-scale processes. The new generation instrument to be acquired through
this award will extend existing capabilities in the U.S. for isotopic analysis
of Earth materials by permitting micron-scale, in-situ, isotopic analyses with
detection limits in the part per billion range. The instrument will be the
centerpiece of a facility that will be open to earth scientists outside of UCLA
and will permit the fullest application of recent instrumental developments to a
better understanding of the origin and evolution of the crust and the genesis of
mineral resources.
