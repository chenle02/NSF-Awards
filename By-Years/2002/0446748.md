0446748&lt;br/&gt;Carey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for the
acquisition of a laser diffraction-based grain size analyzer for studies of
marine and lacustrine paleorecords and volcanological research. A Mastersizer
2000 capable of particle size distribution analysis from 0.2 to 2000 microns
will replace an antiquated Electrozone laser diffractometer (&gt; 20 yrs. old)
at the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography. The
instrument will support faculty and student research requiring precision
granulometery and will be employed for research training through laboratory
exercises incorporated into graduate
classes.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
