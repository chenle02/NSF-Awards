Methane is a natural component of the earth's atmosphere. However, the increase
in the concentration of atmospheric methane since the turn of the century is a
likely contributor to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect. A significant
portion of atmospheric methane comes from freshwater wetlands where
microorganisms produce methane in oxygen depleted soil. It is known that
microorganisms living in the oxygenated part of the soil can consume some of the
methane produced, so that the amount of methane leaking to the atmosphere is the
difference between production and consumption. It is also possible that this
methane consumption can occur in the oxygen depleted zone of the soil, yet this
process is poorly understood. Most evidence for this process comes from
sediments beneath the ocean, yet I have found strong evidence that large amounts
of methane also can be consumed by microorganisms in the oxygen poor soil of a
freshwater wetland in central New York State. The process is elusive and linked
to seasonal climate patterns, which may be why the process was not seen by
earlier investigators. This proposal requests funds to examine the extent of the
process in peatlands in central New York State, Maryland, West Virginia, and
Sweden. These are all well studied sites where the process would be expected to
occur. Primary objectives are to assess the role of microorganisms that use iron
instead of oxygen to consume methane, and how iron availability might limit the
process. Results of this study should provide valuable insight into the
relationship between atmospheric methane and wetland methane emissions.
Moreover, a mechanistic understanding of methane emissions is essential in order
to predict how methane emissions from wetlands will respond to future
environmental changes.
