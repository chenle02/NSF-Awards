9413204 Schultz This award will support the multidisciplinary training of
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students with a focus on understanding
plant responses to a wide variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. The 19
participating faculty come from 9 departments and have strong research programs
relevant to the focus at biochemical, organismal or populational level of
analysis. The training program will be organized around an innovative, "problem-
based learning" (PBL) approach in which a particular example of plant stress
will be considered by students from all three perspectives. A series of courses
is planned to implement this unusually broad training strategy in an area of
great significance to modern biology. ***
