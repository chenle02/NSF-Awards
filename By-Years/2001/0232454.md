This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will initiate creation
of a capability termed Spider Explorer Data Visualization. This project will
explore new means for organizing, exploring, and visualizing large data sets by
incorporating into a fundamental presentation format, the spider diagram,
innovative hierarchical capabilities and a supporting data management tool set.
The project team will research, develop, and integrate innovative data
exploration and visualization capabilities with emphasis on hierarchical
structures and data normalization. The foremost benefits will result from an
unprecedented ability to explore and organize large data sets and thus achieve
levels of comprehension not possible with current methods. The objective is to
enable humans, with their finite cognitive resources, to effectively organize
and absorb copious amounts of data. The impact of such a capability will be
significant, and the potential benefits span many domains including scientific
research, economic growth, productivity, and education. Commercial potential is
broad ranging and has strong potential for domains including scientific
research, manufacturing and production, financial analysis, and engineering.
