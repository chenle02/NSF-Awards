A three day workshop on future trends in logic programming will be held in
Argonne Illinois, October 11 thru 13, 1989. The workshop will be coordinated by
Argonne National Laboratory and by the Institute for New Generation Computer
Technology (ICOT) of Japan. The objective is to provide an open forum for
discussion between American and Japanese researchers on recent advances in logic
programming and on the impact of developments in deductive databases, artificial
intelligence, and multiprocessing. The workshop will feature 25 lectures on such
topics as multiprocessing, constraint logic programming, knowledge
representation, and the logical foundations of programming. Participants will
also be given ample time for informal and open discussions. It is expected that
after the workshop is over, researchers will collaborate on projects in logic
programming research. Thus the workshop will have the long term benefit of
promoting scientific advances in a spirit of healthy cooperation.
