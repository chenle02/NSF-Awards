This research is in the area of nonlinear analysis and partial differential
equations that arise in applications to deterministic and stochastic control,
differential games, mechanics and physics. Specific topics of interest include
the following: Partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman type;
existence of value for stochastic differential games; pattern formation in
reaction-diffusion systems; generic regularity of solutions to porous medium
equations; stability of solitary wave solutions to Korteweg-de-Vries equations;
and analytical studies of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.
