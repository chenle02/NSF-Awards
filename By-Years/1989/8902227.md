This award supports the research in quadratic forms of Professor Donald James
of the Pennsylvania State University. Dr. James's project is to study quadratic
and Hermitian forms over integer rings of number fields, with special emphasis
on the theory of classification, diagonalization, and representation. Except for
counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number
theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the
fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most
astonishing applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer
science and coding theory. The theory of quadratic forms is an aspect of number
theory that is almost as ancient as the whole field itself, and was advanced
especially far by the great nineteenth-century mathematician C.F. Gauss. This
subfield of number theory retains its vitality even today, and has proved to
have applications both in physics and in many branches of mathematics.
