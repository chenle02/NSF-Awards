The assembly of continental crust into large continental cratons typically
involves several continent-continent collisions. Relatively shallow level parts
of such collisions can be addressed in active or young system such as the
Himalaya, however, deep portions are only exposed in ancient orogens. This
project, a collaboration between Syracuse University and University of
California, Santa Cruz, will investigate the crustal evolution of the Archaean
Rae-Hearne platform and the bounding Snowbird Tectonic zone in northeastern
Saskatchewan to document Archean and early Proterozoic crustal growth and to
evaluate the effect of terminal collision within the orogen at 1.8 Ga. Because
approximately 20 km of crust has bee removed by uplift and erosion, a view of
mid- crustal levels of orogeny will be directly studied. Results are expected to
help understand not only Archean events in the Trans- Hudson orogen but also
deeper parts of compressional tectonic settings generally.
