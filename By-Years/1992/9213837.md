In order to evaluate the ultimate usefulness of the Earth as a gravitational
wave detector Professor Boughn will compute the excitation of the quadrupole
modes of the Earth by terrestrial mechanisms, the most important of which are
earthquakes and atmospheric/ocean pressure loading. This research will primarily
involve careful modeling of the latter mechanism and then comparing the results
with seismic data taken in earthquake quiet times. The results of this analysis
will not only provide an evaluation of the ultimate sensitivity of the Earth to
gravitational waves but should also provide interesting geophysical information
about excitation mechanisms of the modes of vibration of the Earth.
