Landsberg and Robles will continue their joint work in applying and advancing
exterior differential systems (EDS). In particular they will complete their
determination of the projective rigidity of rational homogeneous varieties,
study questions regarding invariant differential operators (e.g., what is the
image of the Killing operator on a Riemannian manifold?), and further the
connections between Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) resolutions and EDS. Robles
will will identify necessary and sufficient conditions on curvature for the
metric on a Riemannian 4-manifold to admit orthogonal coordinates, and determine
geometric representatives of homology classes in Riemannian manifolds. Landsberg
will work on problems originating in complexity theory and signal processing, in
particular determining equations for secant varieties of homogeneous varieties,
and establishing properties of the Mulmuley-Sohoni varieties associated to the
determinant and permanant.

Differential geometry may be thought of as the study of geometric objects "under
a microscope" (i.e., infinitesimally). Landsberg and Robles are especially
interested in geometric objects with symmetry. Over the last 40 years
significant advances have been made in representation theory, which
systematically studies symmetry (e.g., the BGG machinery), and these advances
will be applied by the PIs to establish properties of systems of partial
differential equations arising in differential geometry. Individually, the PIs
will use also use differential geometry and representation theory to work on
problems in topology (Robles), in theoretical computer science (Landsberg and
Robles) and signal processing (Landsberg).
