The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the process of turbulent magnetic
reconnection through the use of large-scale numerical simulations of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models in regimes relevant to the solar corona.
Specifically, this research team will investigate how random magnetic field
footpoint motions on the Sun produce instabilities, large-scale fluid motions,
Alfvén waves, and turbulence; determine how the magnetic reconnection rate
correlates with the level of self-consistently produced MHD turbulence; and
obtain the overall Lundquist number scaling of the reconnection time-scale and
energy dissipation rate. The researchers will also study the process that
generates Alfvén wave turbulence dynamically, instead of imposing turbulence
externally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This problem of magnetic reconnection and
turbulence is highly relevant to solar research. The science results obtained
from this project will increase our understanding of many fundamental phenomena
in solar physics, such as coronal heating, solar flares, and coronal mass
ejections. The process of magnetic reconnection not only applies to the physics
of the solar corona and heliosphere, but is also fundamental in many different
physical systems, such as planetary magnetospheres, astrophysical accretion
disks, and fusion experiments. This project will fully support a graduate
student and provide partial support for a Post Doctoral Research Fellow. The PI
plans to actively participate in education and outreach activities in the
University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) community, such as those organized through
the 'Public Information and Education Outreach Office' of UAF's Geophysical
Institute, as well as those coordinated by UAF's 'Science Education Outreach
Network.' The PI will also teach university courses in plasma and space physics
at UAF. The simulation codes developed in this project will be made available to
the scientific community.
