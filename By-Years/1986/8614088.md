In this project a detailed inventory of U &amp; Th series radioisotopes and
plutonium in the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara and Eastern Mediterranean Sea will be
constructed. Both dissolved and particulate species will be measured in the
water column. Additionally samples from sediment traps and bottom sediments will
be measured. The objectives are to learn more about the geochemistries of these
isotopes in a large anoxic system and to apply this knowledge to specific
questions concerning the ventilation of deep waters, surface residence times and
mixing patterns, and particle removal rates.
