This award is designed to improve software engineering education by providing
technological support for the integration of language and design, object
modeling methodology and software libraries of generic components. Rensselaer
will be establishing a Design Conference Room containing networked workstations,
a high-end projection system, a laser printer, and scanner. Four courses in the
undergraduate curriculum will be the focus of this project: the second computer
science course, a programming languages course, a software design course, and a
software development course. Rensselaer proposes to develop and integrate into
its curriculum, novel tools and techniques in software design and
implementation. There are three major themes to this effort: better design
through better use of language during conceptual stages of design, better design
through object modeling and dynamics, and better software products through the
use of libraries of reliable, reusable software. The results of the curriculum
and materials development will be disseminated through publications, and
presentations at professional meetings.
