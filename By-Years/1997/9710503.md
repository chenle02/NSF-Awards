This is a project to compare two efforts at biodiversity conservation underway
in two quite different sociopolitical settings. One of the cases involves the
Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), a state corporation responsible for administering
all of Kenya's protected areas and all its wildlife outside protected areas. The
other organization is the Malpai Borderlands Group (MPG) in the Southwestern
United States, an nonprofit organization dedicated to conserving the undeveloped
wildlands and rangelands of the Southwest and to preserving the traditional ways
of life of such regions. Both agencies work in highly charged environments,
negotiating among powerful and strongly-held interests. Both organizations must
also transmit, translate and reformulate scientific and policy concerns
expressed at the global, national, and local levels. This project will examine
how this is accomplished and with what level of success in two quite different
national contexts. &lt;Ã­
