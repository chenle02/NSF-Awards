With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Washington and Jefferson College will acquire a400
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will facilitate the following studies: a)
characterization of polymers, specifically by studying the aging phenomena of
solicone elastomers; b) design and synthesis of potential metallomesogens; and
c) synthesis of new DNA analogs with an amide linkage.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry
and biochemistry.
