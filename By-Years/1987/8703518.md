A theory of organizing and role enactment during the emergency period of
disaster will be refined and field tested over a two-year period in this
project. Organizing has been observed in earlier work by the principal
investigator as interrelationships among four core elements: domains, tasks,
human and material resources, and activities. The four elements have proved to
be useful for describing how organization is improvised in communities
threatened by earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. The data bases
will be archival data on earlier disasters and primary data on two disaster
events collected during the current project. The findings will yield principles
of emergency management that are both historically based and contemporary.
