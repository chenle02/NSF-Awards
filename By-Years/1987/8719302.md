A new series of polymers has been discovered based on polyvinylpyridine
containing pendent allyl radicals and anions fully substituted with pyridinium
cation groups. These "densely charged" polymers show interesting properties.
They are remarkably stable. The dry polyallyl anions are not conducting, but the
polyradicals have electrical conductivity in the semiconductor range. A new
polymeric structure is proposed, which will be prepared and may have interesting
conduction and photoconduction properties. The polymers may also have specific
ion-exchange properties. The research deals with the preparation and
characterization of a number of such polymers with varying degrees of
crosslinking. The electrical properties of these polymers will be tested, and an
important part of these tests will be their behavior as electrode-coating
materials. This grant is being funded under the Materials Chemistry Initiative.
