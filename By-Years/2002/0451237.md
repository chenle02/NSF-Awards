The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), or TeraGrid, (TG) involves nine
resource providers operating high-performance computing, information, and
visualization facilities, interconnected with a dedicated optical network and
integrated with a set of common software that presents the user community with a
cohesive set of resources and services. On October 1, 2004, the ETF will
conclude a three-year construction effort to create this distributed environment
and will transition into an operational state. This proposal outlines a set of
services to be provided at Indiana University (IU) as part of the TeraGrid
system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;IU was funded, along with Purdue University, in
September 2003 by the NSF to be part of the TeraGrid via the Terascale
Extensions Program (TEP). As part of the ongoing maintenance and operations
(M&amp;O) phase, IU requests funding via this proposal for early operations of
its ETF facilities and for TG services for the period from October 1, 2004
through March 30, 2005. Resources and services described herein will be provided
to the scientific and engineering community by IU as one of the nine TG RPs.
This proposal describes both IU-specific functions as well as IU.s participation
in TG-wide activities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
