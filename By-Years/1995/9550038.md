9550038 Sandler Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) in collaboration with
Inverness Reqearch Associates and Horizon Research, Inc., will form a
collaborative with education and community leaders who are currently involved in
long-term efforts to reform science education. Over five years, the Center will
support the initiation, implementation, and institutionalization of district-
wide, K-8 science education reform efforts in school districts nationwide. The
primarily activities of the Center will be Site-specific consultation and
support, and Institutes and Seminars focusing on critical issues, common
interests and role-specific challenges. These institutes will provide
opportunities for participants to capitalize on cross-district sharing and
collaboration. Specifically the Center will: 1) Provide assistance, consultation
and professional development activities for at least 15 large school districts
who are beginning the science education reform process. The Center will help
them to develop and effectively implement a strategic plan for district-wide
science reform focusing on building leadership capacity to sustain and
institutionalize quality science instruction. 2) Provide professional
development activities for districts with reform programs already in progress.
These cities will participate in the Center as leaders, as well as, participants
in professional development opportunities. 3) Develop and support a cadre of
education leaders from the districts participating in Center activities. These
specialists will become leaders for others implementing science education reform
nationwide. 4)Establish a coalition among all participating districts who are
engaged in district-wide reform of science so that by the end of the five years,
there will be a self-sustaining permanent network of district communicating with
one another and working together with the capacity to provide continuing
assistance to additional districts attempting to reform th eir science education
programs. The cost sharing for the project will be 34% of the NSF portion. ***
