Geologic evidence and general circulation model experiments show that the
monsoon climates respond very strongly to insolation changes induced by orbital
variations. Pleoclimate data from northeast Asia and northwest Pacific Ocean
suggest that these terrestrial and marine environments, influenced by northeast
Asian monsoon, respond to global climate changes in a complex way that varies
temporally and geographically. Using high resolution terrestrial, marine, and
atmospheric climatic information generated from analyses of pollen, radiolaria,
oxygen isotopes, and mineralogy of sediments from marine cores, the regional
response to late Pleistocene climate variations will be examnined. The changes
in the intensity and duration of the northeast Asian monsoon through two
complete glaciation to deglaciation cycles will be determined. This work is
important because it will enable construction of an empirically based conceptual
model of northeast Asian monsoon; an independent model to compare with
simulations based on numerical general circulation models.
