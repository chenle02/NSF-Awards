This project is for emergency funding to carry out additional interviews in the
World Values Surveys (WVS) being carried out in Pakistan and Bangladesh. These
interviews use the version of the WVS interview schedule designed for Islamic
societies, and adds supplementary questions to measure approval or disapproval
of the recent terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. The
investigation also assesses whether such attacks are seen as compatible with
Islamic teachings. The researchers also probe into support for democratic
institutions and openness to ties with the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
existing WVS questionnaire explores the basic values and worldviews of each
society without touching on current political issues. Adding a battery of
questions measuring attitudes toward terrorism and relations with the West makes
it possible to analyze the extent to which these orientations are linked with
enduring core elements of Islamic belief systems, and the extent to which they
may be changing. The pilot surveys conducted in Iran, Egypt and Jordan found
surprisingly widespread support for democracy and indications of an
intergenerational change in the direction of growing support for social and
political liberalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory
Research investigation is extremely timely and will enhance substantially our
understanding of this very important topic. &lt;br/&gt;
