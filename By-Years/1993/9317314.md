9317314 Sahagian We propose to develop an analytical formulation and numerical
model directed toward gaining a quantitative understanding of the relationship
between bubble growth and volcanic eruptions. As a result of the proposed
project, we hope to quantify the processes which control bubble growth in
ascending magma during eruption and how the various magmatic properties,
parameters, and environmental conditions affect the style of volcanic eruptions.
Our proposed study can be divided into two basic objectives including 1)
quantification of the factors contributing to bubble growth in an ascending
magma (parametric study); and 2) quantification of the effect of bubble growth
on magma ascent during eruption. The first objective involves numerical modeling
of individual bubbles (small scale) and their interaction with the surrounding
melt. The second objective is to account for the feedback between magma rise
(and decompression) and bubble growth throughout the magma column. This will
allow the quantification of dissolved and exsolved volatile fractions at the
point of melt fragmentation into spray. The proposed project will extend our
analysis far beyond the preliminary work, and should be more applicable to
natural systems.
