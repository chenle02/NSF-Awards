The Brigham Young (BYU) Site of the I/UCRC for High-Performance Reconfigurable
Computing (CHREC) seeks to continue its momentum from its initial phase of
operation through a Phase II award. Reconfigurable computing, promises to
realize performance potential of underlying hardware system resources in a
highly adaptive manner, maximizing performance while minimizing implementation
challenges such as system size, weight, cost, and power. Areas of research
thrust for the next phase of the BYU CHREC site include: reliable reconfigurable
computing, design automation and programming methods; algorithms and
applications; and systems and services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leadership in
reconfigurable hardware and system platforms represents a critical area for
national competitiveness of every growing cyber-enabled economy. Working with
its Industrial Advisory Board, the BYU site of CHREC center along with the
center as a whole intends to serve as a catalyst that brings leading
organizations together to define common goals, methods, and standards. Research
results are planned to be integrated into the university educational process
with expanded programs at multiple levels in engineering. Activities are planned
to be structured to attract a diverse set of students and faculty, including
underrepresented students via several minority recruitment programs.&lt;br/&gt;
