This proposal seeks to continue the design, construction, and testing of a
prototype electric current computed tomography (EECT) system. This system
applies patterns of electric current through an array of electrodes on the
surface of a body, and records the voltages that result on those electrodes.
From these measured voltages the system generates and displays an approximate
reconstruction of the electrical conductivity within the body. In order to
achieve the theoretically predicted maximum signal-to-noise ratio, this system
is adaptive in the sense that the successive patterns of current applied to the
body are determined from the previous voltage measurements and the optimization-
reconstruction algorithm. The immediate impact of this proposed research on
engineering and medical imaging will be the demonstration that an adaptive
system can be built and made to yield image constructions that achieve the
resolution predicted by the PI's theory. The long term impact will be the
creation of higher resolution impedance imaging systems than are possible with
existing processes. Higher resolution systems will yield more powerful
diagnostic tools in medicine, as well as more useful imaging techniques in
nondestructive testing, geophysical exploration, and flow through porous media.
