This award supports a workshop with the goal of bringing together U.S. and
Colombian researchers and graduate students to identify nanotechnology research
problems related to energy and medical applications that are of mutual interest
to our hemisphere. The focus areas of the workshop will be local nanomaterials,
biofuels with more diverse feedstocks than the US, low-cost solar cells using
local biodegradable materials, low-cost medical innovation, which will build on
the US strength in fundamental nanoscience and state-of-the-art instrumentation.
Potential areas of discussion are the role of nanotechnology in 4th generation
biofuels production, and scanning probe methods for characterizing energetic
materials. The long-term vision for this workshop is to develop a model for
international cooperation that addresses three key aspects: (i) emphasizing
long-term, international research opportunities for graduate students and early-
career researchers; (ii) leveraging existing cyber tools to accelerate
collaboration between U.S. and Colombian scientists; and (iii) identifying
international funding opportunities that will promote nanotechnology research in
the U.S. and Colombia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is scheduled to be
held in October 2012 in Medell√≠n, Colombia. Multiple Colombian federal agencies,
research centers of excellence, universities and leading corporations will be
partners in this effort, including: (i) Colciencias, the Colombian Department of
Science, Technology and Innovation; (ii) EPM, the largest energy provider in
Colombia; and (iii) the Center of Excellence in Novel Materials. This workshop
will consist of oral presentations and poster sessions, panel discussions, and a
tutorial on the "nanoHUB" tool and other cyber-infrastructure organized by
Purdue's Network for Computational Nanotechnology. Strengthening graduate
education and education opportunities will be a key focus of the workshop. Event
organizers will broadly disseminate the presentations made at the workshop and
the final report of the exploratory workshop.
