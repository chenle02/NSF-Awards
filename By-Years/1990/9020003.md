Root systems of trees and lianas native to north-central Florida will be
compared on the basis of morphology, maximum depth, and efficiency of
colonization of resource-rich volumes of soil. Allometrical studies of lianas
and trees will elucidate differences in the following ratios: roots:shoot
biomass; leaf area:root surface area; leaf area:stem cross sectional area; and,
root:root biomass. Additionally the P.I. will determine the degree to which
dense tangles of lianas suppress tree seedling growth through competition
belowground and aboveground. Liana roots, like their stems, do not serve a
mechanical support function and thus belowground biomass can be allocated to
maximize the volume of soil explored for water and nutrients. Liana root systems
are expected to be extremely opportunistic in distribution and thus benefit more
frequently than tree roots from spatial and temporal variation in water and
nutrient availability. Differences between trees and lianas in root foraging
efficiency will be experimentally determined.
