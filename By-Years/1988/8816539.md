This award provides 25% of the funds required to purchase a mass spectrometer
system for analyzing rare gas isotopes in geological, lunar and meteorite
samples. The spectrometer will be installed and maintained in the Lunar &amp;
Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona. The University of Arizona
will contribute 50% of the acquisition cost, and the remaining 25% will be
contributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The
spectrometer will be capable of performing sensitive analyses of helium, neon,
argon, krypton and xenon isotopes. Scientific projects will initially focus on
dating of samples using the argon 40/39 method, xenon-based geochronology and
the use of noble gases as tracers of planetary processes.
