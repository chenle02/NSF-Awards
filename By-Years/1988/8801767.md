The objective of this project is to adapt existing microscopic equipment to
provide a capability for conduct of research to study the spatial distribution
of free-living bacteria in water as that distribution is affected by organic
substances exuded by phytoplankton. The research has significance in determining
the fate of pollutants and their potential impact on water quality as those
pollutants are affected by environmental forces and influencing their diffusion,
dispersion and interactions when discharged into water. The proposal leading to
this award was submitted in response to NSF 87-68, Engineering Research
Equipment Grants.
