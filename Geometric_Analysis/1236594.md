This award is to support participants from the US attending the IV Latin-
American Congress on Lie Groups and Geometry in CIMAT, Guanajuato, Mexico,
August 27-31, 2012. The study of Lie groups in Geometry has a long history,
developed by figures such as Sophus Lie, Felix Klein, Wilhelm Killing, Elie
Cartan, Hermann Weyl, etc. In particular, Klein proposed that specifying an
appropriate transformation group leaving certain geometric objects invariant,
one would then observe various geometries. At the global level, whenever a Lie
group acts on a geometric object, such as a Riemannian manifold, this action
provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure in terms of
its Representation Theory on tensors, cohomology groups, etc. The scientific
focus of the conference is the interaction between Lie Group Theory, Geometry
and Topology in the broadest possible sense. Topics to be touched upon in the
conference will be: infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their applications to
geometry and topology, infinite dimensional representations as spaces of
functions on a manifold, representation theory of Real Semisimple Lie Groups and
Integrable Systems, actions of the mapping class group on the representation
varieties of surface groups, special holonomy, proper affine actions on
Minkowski space, Lie groups and their arithmetic subgroups, tessellations of
homogeneous spaces, unipotent dynamics, etc.

The aim of the fourth Latin-American Congress on Lie Groups and Geometry is to
disseminate the latest developments in the area to both senior and junior
mathematicians. This meeting will bring together researchers from all over
Latin-America, USA and Europe, working in diverse areas related by their use of
Lie groups in their different facets, namely geometrical, topological,
algebraic, etc. It will also raise awareness of the excellent academic work
taking place in Latin America and provide a networking opportunity for
researchers and students. Graduate students and postdocs will especially benefit
from the interaction with the senior mathematicians. Researchers working in
developing countries will have the chance to interact with their counterparts
from the USA and Europe.
