9725214 Laffey This project will study a teacher education program that has
undergone substantial restructuring, is committed to a vision of developing
technology-using educators, and has made a substantial investment in an
innovative technology in a teacher education program, building knowledge about
1) how technology supports professional development, 2) how and learning, and 3)
how a teacher education program supported by advanced technology influences the
development and socialization of beginning teachers. This study is focused on
two core questions: a) what social and cultural patterns emerge when advanced
technology is utilized in teacher education, and how do these affect the process
and outcomes of professional socialization? and b) how does the technology
infrastructure contribute to the development of technology-using teachers&gt;
Data collected will include a longitudinal qualitative study of professional
socialization: a portfolio review of technology -related products from the
teacher education program; and pre- and p0ost- instrumentation to assess changes
in attitudes, expectations, and practices for key learner outcomes of inquiry
orientation, reflective practice, learner-centered instruction, and technology
use. Project outcomes include contributing to the formative development of this
teacher education program, creating a database and methodological framework for
the study of technology in teaching and teacher development, and articulating a
model of technology-based teacher preparation from which other programs can
learn.
