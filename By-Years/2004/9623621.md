9623621 Geng This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to
study a novel three dimensional (3D) camera concept called the Color 3D Camera.
The Color 3D camera, is able to capture 3D images of objects in the scene at
camera's frame rate (30 frames per second or faster). Because the system uses
only one CCD camera, it eliminates the time consuming and often ambiguous
correspondence problem of conventional stereo vision systems. There are no
moving parts, nor mechanical scanning mechanisms. The 3D camera is also able to
provide normal color 2D intensity images in addition to 3D range images of the
scene which facilitates object recognition and sensor fusion tasks in many
machine vision applications. The feasibility of the Color 3D camera has been
investigated theoretically and demonstrated experimentally during the phase I
effort. The design philosophy of the phase II prototype will be to integrate
seamlessly system's function modules in a compact printed circuit board equipped
with multiple DSP processors. All the image acquiring, image processing and
range calculation will be performed on-board so the real-time range images can
be produced. Building a seamlessly integrated low cost high speed 3D vision
system as a product line of Robotronics, Inc. is a key to commercialize this
SBIR research results of the color 3D camera. Such products will make a reliable
and inexpensive 3D vision capability widely available to many practical machine
vision applications.
