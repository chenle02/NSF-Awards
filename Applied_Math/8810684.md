This research in the mathematical theory of fluid mechanics will analyze sets
of complicated nonlinear sytems of ordinary and partial differential equations
which arise in fluid flow problems. Singularly perturbed ordinary differential
equations associated with solitary water waves, boundary layer theory, and flame
propogation will be considered. Traveling wave solutions of the Euler equations
in an infinitely-deep, stratified fluid will be examined, and the existence of a
classical solution of the standing wave problem will be investigated. Theory
developed in this research should advance our basic understanding of the
behavior of fluid flows.
