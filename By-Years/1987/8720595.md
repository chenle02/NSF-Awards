In the Vulsini Volcanic complex in central Italy, mafic and felsic magmas have
erupted with varying degrees of mixing. Despite the predominance of tephra in
the Vulsini area, models of magmatic evolution at this center have been based
almost entirely upon compositional variations among lava flows, and such
sampling cannot avoid bias. Pumice clasts in tephra provide more representative
samples of move voluminous magmas at the instant of eruptive fragmentation, and
more adequately reflect the petrogenetically significant crustal components that
are likely to be greatly undersampled if felsic tephra are ignored. This is an
ongoing effort whose aim is to provide a petrogenetic model based on microprobe,
major and trace element and isotopic analyses of crystals and glasses in an
extensive suite of fresh pumice clasts from carefully studied pyroclastic units.
This award is specifically to provide 60 neutron activation analyses. The
results should advance understanding of the genesis of subsequent evolution of
the mafic silica-undersaturated potassic magmas and the silica-oversaturated
magmas, the processes by which the two magma types mixed, and the mechanisms of
eruption of the resulting broad compositional range of magmas.
