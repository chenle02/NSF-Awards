Hands-On Science Outreach, Inc. has for a number of years developed and
operated recreational after school and Saturday Science Classes for children, at
first in Montgomery County, MD; and subsequently, with NSF support, at more than
22 sites around the country. During the last 10 years, they have reached more
than 20,000 students with their unique collection of hands-on science
activities. The project is well on the way to becoming self sufficient, and this
final award will document both the philosophy of instruction and specific
teaching methods that they have used and provide a third party evaluation of the
processes of learning that they encourage in informal science education
programs. Hands-On Science Outreach, Inc. will publish two 32 page booklets
outlining their history, philosophy, and methods, and will conduct a third party
evaluation of classes in four demographically diverse sites around the country,
carried out under the direction of Dr. Harris Shettel, a nationally recognized
informal education researcher. The resulting reports and publications will be
widely disseminated, providing valuable information to others planning to offer
hands-on science activities for children.
