The proposed research revolves around two general questions: 1) Complete
classification of problems according to which frequency algorithms they are
amenable; and 2) Complete understanding of the of the recursion-theoretic
properties of frequency computable problems. Computing, as it is practiced
today, is of an interactive nature. Rather than the model of twenty years ago,
where the computer was presented with a program and ran until it obtained an
answer, the programs of today pause frequently and ask for input before
continuing. Thus the true model of computing, as it is practiced, is the Turing
machine with an oracle.
