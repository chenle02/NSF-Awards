A new approach for Fourier transform spectrometry (FTS) is proposed. The
principal advantage of FTS is the tremendous throughput improvement compared to
dispersive or filter spectrometers. Traditional FTS techniques, however, require
a precision scanning mirror. This requirement significantly increases the cost,
and is difficult to implement for use from a moving platform or for a dynamic
target. A more recent technique does not require scanning. This provides the
ability to acquire all spectral bands simultaneously, allows high spatial
resolution from a moving platform, improves the reliability, and lowers the
mass, volume and cost. These non-scanning FTS, however, have yet been unable to
exploit the tremendous potential throughput advantage of FTS, since they require
operation in a "pushbroom" mode. In this mode, a narrow slit masks the field-of-
view (FOV) to a narrow strip and this severely reduces the throughput. The
proposed approach uses deconvolution techniques to provide spatial resolution
along-track, without the need for a narrow field mask. This technique can
therefore simultaneously provide both the throughput advantage of traditional
FTS, and all the advantages of non-scanning FTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imaging
spectrometry is a powerful tool for Earth Science, particularly for
investigation of land cover and land use change. When applied to Space Science,
particularly exploration of the solar system, imaging spectrometry is the
primary tool for global determination of surface mineralogy and is also useful
for studies of atmospheric composition. In Human Exploration and Development of
Space, spectrometry is being employed for diagnostics of reusable rocket
engines, by observation of the exhaust plume. The proposed technique provides a
factor of 10 to 1000 advantage in throughput compared to current techniques for
imaging spectrometry, allowing greatly improved radiometric resolution. The
absence of moving parts improves the reliability and lowers the cost, mass and
power requirements.&lt;br/&gt;
