This award supports cooperative research in atomic and molecular physics to be
conducted by James McGuire and C.D. Lin of Kansas State University and Roberto
Rivarola and Ruben Piacentini of the National University of Rosario, Argentina.
This work will involve the development of theoretical models of atomic and
molecular collisions. A new class of inelastic processes in atomic collisions
with highly charged ions will be investigated. This is made possible by new ion
sources, developments in the study of laboratory plasmas and new access to
antimatter beams. Inner-shell and outer-shell phenomena will be included and the
collision speeds will range from slow to fast with single particle and
multiparticle excitations. These scientists have been involved extensively in
the development of theoretical models which provide an understanding of new
experimental results and on which are based systematics for further experimental
tests. This research will build on an increasing cooperation between these
scientists beginning in 1981. Both groups published studies of electron capture
and initially, contact was made through international meetings and
correspondence. In 1988, McGuire and Rivarola collaborated on a study of
electron capture from molecules by fast ions and have submitted a joint paper.
They have just begun a study of electron distribution in atomic ionization. This
grant will formalize the cooperation between them and allow contact with other
theorists in both countries.
