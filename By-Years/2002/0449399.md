0449399&lt;br/&gt;Daugherty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomolecular recognition is one
of the cornerstones of biotechnology, and though the importance of binding
strength (affinity) is appreciated, the interplay of molecular specificity in
biological systems (e.g., protein interaction networks) is not well understood.
The primary objectives of the proposed research are to develop new methodologies
that enable discovery and engineering of highly-specific biomolecular
recognition elements, and to elucidate mechanisms through which biomolecules
achieve high specificity interactions. A new framework for investigating and
engineering specificity is proposed that uses two new biotechnologies developed
by the PI. First, an in vitro approach utilizing bacterial display peptide
library technology in conjunction with cell sorting instrumentation will be
developed and applied to generate protein-binding peptides with optimal
specificity. Second, a mammalian cell two-hybrid system will be developed using
Forster resonance energy transfer, and applied to detect and screen for specific
recognition inside living cells. The peptides resulting from these approaches
will be investigated in a protein-detecting microarray format. Such technology
is likely to extend current capabilities in systems biology, medical diagnostics
and proteomics, and basic research. The educational component of this work aims
to disseminate molecular specificity concepts and current research to young
students through integration into graduate curriculum via "Biomolecular Science
and Engineering," and through a new first-year undergraduate student colloquium
entitled "Biotechnology Controversies." The colloquium aims to augment students'
scientific literacy, communications skills, and awareness of controversial
issues in biotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;
