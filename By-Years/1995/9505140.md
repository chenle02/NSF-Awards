Caporaso 9505140 Professor Caporaso will work on two problems in algebraic
geometry. She intends to study the Kodaira dimension of fiber products of
certain families of curves whose general member is of general type. She will
also study the geometry of the universal Picard variety. This is research in the
field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter- century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and roboticq. ***
