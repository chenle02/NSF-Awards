This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy students
majoring in chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and interdisciplinary
fields. The project emphasizes supporting students through formal and informal
interactions with faculty and among students, seminars, and an opportunity for
dedicated funds for their thesis research project, covering supplies and/or
travel, when they become seniors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic
support activities. The project targets attrition between the first and second
year of college, and it provides incentives for students to declare and remain
in a STEM major. The project builds on a successful scholarship project that is
just being completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is
increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go
on to work in the field or to further education.
