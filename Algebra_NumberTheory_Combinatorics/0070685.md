The Principal Investigators are conducting research connecting combinatorics
with various topics in algebra, representation theory, and algebraic geometry.
The specific areas include: the theory of total positivity; combinatorial
aspects of representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras; combinatorics of
Coxeter/Weyl groups; and Schubert calculus. In addition, the proposers are
developing free software to assist research in these areas.

This research is in the general area of combinatorics, the study of discrete
structures. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for
the manipulation and enumeration of discrete collections of objects. The
behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications,
and is an essential part of the mathematical foundations of computer science.
Combinatorial techniques are also of increasing value in older branches of
mathematics such as algebra, geometry, probability and mathematical physics,
since explicit computations often require a better understanding of the
underlying discrete structures.
