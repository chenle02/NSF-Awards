This award supports cooperative research between Prof. William K. Laurenroth of
Colorado State University and Prof. O. E. Sala of the University of Buenos Aires
on grass/shrub interactions in semiarid regions. The vegetation of arid and
semiarid regions is dominated by one of two life-forms of plants: grasses or
shrubs/low trees. The replacement of grasses and grasslands by shrubs and
shrublands is a serious worldwide problem in semiarid regions. Associated with
this problem of brush encroachment is a collection of theoretical problems
concerned with resource partitioning between these two dominant forms. Other
problems arise from the study of the geographical distribution of grasslands and
shrublands. Models that emulate the interaction between grasses and shrubs have
been quite successful in predicting that interaction in tropical savannas. These
models often make the simplifying--and limiting with regards to resource
allocation--assumption that differentials in soil water use by coexisting
grasses and woody plants is due to access to different soil layers (two-layer
hypothesis). The investigators plan to study the question of the applicability
of such models to temperate regions. Additionally, the investigators plan to
explore the potential for a biogeographic model, based upon current theoretical
models of resource partitioning, that may be used to better predict the
distribution of grasslands and shrublands. The North American site for this
project is in the Central Crossland Region in Colorado and is part of a
nationwide network for long-term ecological research (LTER) funded by NSF.
Comparison of results coming from the Argentinian site, will not only serve to
continue a long standing collaboration and aid our theoretical understanding of
woody plant/grass interactions, but will also aid in judging the management
potential of sites and in the decision making about alternate land uses.
