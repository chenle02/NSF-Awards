Dr. Eugene G. Mueller has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr. Mueller's doctoral degree was from Harvard under the supervision of
Professor Jeremy Knowles. He intends to continue his research with Professor
John Bercaw at the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Mueller's thesis work
involved studies of the stereochemistry of phosphoryl transfers. He plans to do
postdoctoral work in basic inorganic chemistry studying agostic interactions in
catalyis and learning about oxidation of substrates by ruthenium based systems.
This will help prepare him for his long range career goals of the chemical
modelling of the myo-inositol oxidase enzyme. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
