This research will examine sampling and zone estimation within an integrative
framework for the form verification of cone, sphere and torus features. The
objective is to develop a comprehensive and integrative approach to the
inspection of these complex forms using coordinate metrology. Individual
research problems within this integrative context include sample point location
determination for complex forms using alternative strategies, probe path length
optimization, and minimum zone estimation using alternate formulations and
solution methodologies. The impact of sample size and strategy and the
optimization method used will be assessed on the computed tolerance zone.
Experiments will be conducted on actual Coordinate Measuring Machines and the
role of multiple factors and their interactions determined. The applicability of
appropriate models and methods for specific part inspection problems will be
suggested through a decision support software system that will be developed
using the research results. A 'guidelines' repository will be attempted for
effective dissemination of research findings. Research will be deployed to
education, through multiple channels, throughout the project. &lt;br/&gt;
Sufficient number of industrial parts such as nozzles, frustrum cylinders, dies,
tapered holes, and balls, tapered rollers and roller races in bearings possess
complex features that must be efficiently inspected for form. Considering these
applications of complex features, and their impact on interchangeability, it is
logical that these features be studied more exclusively and extensively. If
successful, this project will lead to better standards and solutions for complex
feature verification. Further, the mathematical developments for these advanced
forms will be useful to other inspection methodologies. In addition, the
integrative analysis will be useful to the development of formal guidelines for
part-based inspection.
