This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) seeks to develop three
significant permanent, self-cleaning, anti-fog coatings for plastic and glass
surfaces. Fogging of the windows of a car is a hazard most drivers have
experienced at one time or another. Fogging results in poor visibility, and
unsafe driving or flying conditions. Durable, anti-fog coatings that provide a
permanent solution to the problem have potential to satisfy critical needs,
especially for the growing number of aging baby boomers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of the coatings has been
tested independently; these coatings will be fine-tuned for applications in
aircraft cockpit windows, motorcycle helmet visors, and in related personal
protective gear. These multifunctional hard coatings can be used as abrasion
resistant, anti-fog and anti-reflection coatings on both glass and plastic
surfaces. The coatings are made from inexpensive raw materials and simple
processing techniques like dip or spray coating suited to forming conformal
coatings.
