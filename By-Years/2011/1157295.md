Understanding the morphology of the teeth is vital for paleontologists analyzing
mammalian evolution, both for the identification of species and for assessing
relationships between different species and groups. Additionally, as teeth
function primarily to process food, the dentition provides information on diet
in fossil primates. The goals of the project are to gain a better understanding
of the relative contribution of dietary specialization, phylogenetic history and
body size to primate dental morphology, and to test hypotheses concerning best
practice in the use of dental morphology to reconstruct diet and phylogenetic
history. This will be accomplished through the compilation, measurement, and
analysis of a large sample of three dimensional (3D) digital images of dental
morphology from all major groupings of extant primates, and fossil species from
key periods in primate evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research contributes
to building scientific infrastructure through the creation of a database of
digital images, which will be made available to other researchers and students
for teaching and research purposes. When requested by museums providing access
to specimens, high quality dental casts and digital images will also be archived
with these institutions. The project also will provide training for
undergraduate students in the creation of anatomical images from computed
tomography, a technique that is employed extensively in medical practice, and
similar digital images also are used in the fields of architecture, art, and
engineering. This work will be carried out at Brooklyn College, and will promote
undergraduate participation in scientific research through providing
opportunities for employment as research assistants, and through associated
exercises that will form part of the coursework in classes taught by the
principal investigators.
