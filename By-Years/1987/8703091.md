This research project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
designed to provide deeper understanding of molecular structure and reactivity
in organic compounds. This new knowledge is to be gained through preparation and
study of new molecules representative of polyfunctional and topological types
not encountered among natural products. Several projects will be undertaken in
the areas of non-natural products organic chemistry. Emphasis will be given to
the completion of ongoing work involving cyclooctatetraenes, relay orbital
systems, and highly unsaturated propellanes. New studies to be initiated will
involve the development of a route to truncated tetrahedrane and its triene
isomer, together with thermochemical assessment of homoaromaticity in the
latter. Another aspect of the investigation is to focus on the preparation of
the first known sigma-allyl cation and a detailed analysis of the new structural
framework involved. Other work will be aimed at the first preparation of an
organic "belt". Access to this new type of molecular host will likewise require
a major synthetic effort. Once the prototype approach is successfully realized,
avenues to larger beltenes will hopefully be opened. Detailed investigation will
also be made of alpha- silyl carbanions, where preservation of configurational
stability has been observed in preliminary studies.
