Project Summary Clegg, James S. 9412883 The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) is a
research unit of the University of California (UC located on the Sonoma coast 80
miles north San Francisco. Since 1966 the Laboratory has provided unique
opportunities for field research on a rich floral and fauna in close proximity
to the Laboratory buildings. BML has well-equipped laboratories, and excellent
seawater system, strong on-site support staff and a firm commitment from the
Davis campus to continue developing the facilities and support needed by the
growing number of resident and visiting researchers. The Laboratory is located
on the Bodega Marine Reserve (BMR), A 362-arce protected field site with a
diverse set of marine and terrestrial coastal habitats. Adjacent subtidal areas
are protected and available for study within the Bodega Marine Life Refuge. The
Research programs of visiting scientists and graduate students have been
constrained in recent years by the lack of adequate laboratory and office space.
Fortunately, a new expansion building is under construction (UC funds) that will
rectify this problem. However, the lack of adequate housing for visitors is
becoming an ever worsening problem as requests for use of the site for research
and instruction continue to increase. The project will provide support for new
housing unit that will remedy this situation, and provide a suitable balance
between Laboratory facilities and the ability to accommodate the housing needs
of visitors.
