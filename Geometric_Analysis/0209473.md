A whole array of questions in different mathematical areas seem to be converge
to questions having to do with the set of alcoves in a fixed Weyl chamber of a
semisimple Lie group. The areas include Kac-Moody theory, homology of loop
groups, quantum cohomology, the Verlinde algebra, MacDonald identities, Schubert
calculus, ideals in the Borel subalgebra, symmetric space theory and the Cartan-
Weyl representation theory of compact Lie groups. In effect our proposal is to
sort out what is going on to unify what seems to us to be unifiable in the
subjects listed above.

Group theory, and especially Lie group theory, lies at the heart of mathematics
and the application of mathematics to problems in the real world. Included in
the latter are applications to both classical and quantum mechanics, control
theory, string theory, chemistry and crystallography. Lie group theory is
extremely intricate and the extent to which it is applicable depends highly on a
knowledge of its intricacies. The proposed project expects to discover highly
exciting new structures in the subject and would unify many existing structures.
The effect that would be to greatly increase our understanding and our ability
to use these powerful structures. This award is jointly funded by the programs
in Geometric Analysis and Algebra, Number Theory, & Combinatorics.
