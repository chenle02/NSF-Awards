Integrating behavior, engineering and mathematics: Applying modern network
theory to social transmission of parasites

Gaps in the understanding of parasite transmission and social networks exist due
to 1) lack of experimentation 2) difficulty obtaining accurate measures of
social interactions and 3) analytical challenges associated with robust
statistical comparisons of networks. This research involves describing social
networks in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) using digital transceiver devices to
characterize fine-scale social interactions among individuals belonging to
independent subpopulations. Parasites will be experimentally removed from half
the individuals per network and sampled later to measure recolonization of
directly transmitted parasites relative to social network properties calculated
based on digitally recorded contact rates between members of the tagged
populations. A second experiment will manipulate the network rather than the
parasites, through alteration of host ventral plumage color, a trait known to
affect physiology and social behavior.

There is growing recognition of the importance of individual-level heterogeneity
in host behavior in the context of parasite transmission, and this experimental
approach is a powerful way to understand relative contributions of social
network measure on parasite transmission as well as understanding how features
of morphology and physiology influence position in social networks. Motivated by
career goals in undergraduate research and education, the inclusion of
University of Colorado-Boulder undergraduate students in this research is a high
priority, especially participation by students typically underrepresented in the
field. The research will enhance the University's infrastructure by establishing
collaboration between the Applied Math and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
departments. Outreach associated with this project includes working with citizen
scientists through the Swallow Surveillance program.
