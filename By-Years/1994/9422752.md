ABSTRACT CTS-9422752 A theoretical and computational approach will be undertaken
to study multiphase flow in a rotating field. The main objective is the
development and implementation of a boundary integral method for solving the
linearized equation of motion in rotating viscous flow at relatively low
Reynolds numbers (O seen approximation), and considering the Taylor columns
formed around individual particles or bubbles. The study of multiple particle
interactions, with and without the presence of solid boundaries, will provide
insights into the microstructure of rotating suspensions and determination of
rheological behavior. A visualization experiment to describe the Taylor column
interactions of two particles is planed. The proposed study has relevance to
separation process in environment, minerals and biology; mixing in combustion
and processing industries; manufacturing of composite materials; and geophysical
fluid motion. ***
