The objectives of this research are to study the pressure/temperature effects on
extremely thermophilic archaebacteria and to understand the unique metabolic
processes and mechanisms of adaptation to extreme environments of these
archaebacteria. The work addresses several of the engineering problems related
to growth and function of extremely thermophilic bacteria for biotechnological
applications. In particular, focus will be placed on the effects of both
elevated pressure and temperature on these microorganisms.
