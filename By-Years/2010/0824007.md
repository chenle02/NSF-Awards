The objective of this research is to stochastically model wireless networks and
develop integrated optimal solutions that maximize social network utilities
while guaranteeing survivability against disruptions caused by natural disasters
or malicious attacks. The approach is rooted in convex and distributed
optimization and entails modeling of possibly correlated failures and changes in
traffic patterns, characterization of pertinent performance metrics, and
development of protocols that are stable with respect to throughput and
robust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the project
investigates a framework for joint scheduling, routing and control of
information flows through wireless nodes while guaranteeing network
survivability against large-scale service disruptions. The stochastic model
matches the randomness of failures and lends itself to optimality criteria and
computationally affordable protocols. Various applications and critical issues
are studied, including quality of service, fairness, relaying, robustness, on-
line, distributed implementation and sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
respect to broader impact, the theme is directly relevant to the evolution of
the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless local area network standards and emerging
initiatives in mobile ad hoc networks. Incorporation of robustness has important
potential societal and economic impact in future wireless networks, especially
in wireless sensor networks where survivability is critical. Through the
development of experiments and trials, this research provides meaningful
experiences to students and integration of the expertise gained to enhance the
content of graduate classes. Outreach to government and industrial sectors is
accomplished through short courses in laboratories, tutorials in workshops and
conferences, and student-faculty-staff collaboration to develop field trials of
the proposed protocols on the University of Minnesota campus.
