Howard University seeks to provide an enrichment experience for a six week
commuter program in mathematics for 36 students. The program will serve 18 ninth
grade and 18 tenth grade students from the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. A
variety of problem solving and hands-on activities in mathematics will be
provided integrated with research activities. Students will be introduced to
research methodology and will engage in a research project supervised by
experienced scientists and mathematicians. Career exploration is an important
aspect of the program with special interest in stimulating student career
interest in mathematics and scientific fields.
