The research will extend the range of models and problems to which Bayesian
analysis can routinely be applied. The objectives of the research include
development of theoretical foundations and applicable methods for integrating
multiple sources of information, both prior and data-based. They also include
providing the applied statistician with indications of robustness with respect
to priors and model structure. Other objectives are the development of novel
modeling techniques to extend the applicability of dynamic forecasting and
survival analysis as well as continued development of numerical methods for the
evaluation of integrals required in Bayesian analysis. Much of the research is
based on the development of entirely new lines of attack made possible by recent
advances in computing. Accordingly, closely integrated analytical and
experimental tools will be applied.
