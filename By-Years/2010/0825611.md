Evacuation management is an essential service for large-scale (e.g., hurricane)
evacuations because of the difficulties inherent in moving a large number of
people long distances using infrastructures not designed for the purpose. One
common problem is massive congestion, which causes longer, costlier, and more
stressful evacuations, lower compliance rates, and increased risk to the
population. This research will study demand-based strategies to manage large-
scale evacuations, that is, strategies that organize the evacuees so as to
improve the efficiency of the evacuation. Specifically, aggregate-level staging
and routing and network flow controls will be studied. Current evacuation
management is mainly supply-based (e.g., increasing the evacuation capacity
using contra-flow). However, a purely supply-based management approach often
does not sufficiently reduce congestion (and thus risk). Because of this,
several jurisdictions have started augmenting their evacuation plans using
demand-based strategies. Nevertheless, how best to use these strategies is
unknown; unfortunately, research suggests that poorly developed strategies can
decrease evacuation efficiency. The research methodology of this award will be
to study analytical models to understand the structural properties of optimal
evacuation strategies and to gain insights into this difficult problem. These
structural properties and insights will then be used to develop effective and
efficient demand-based evacuation strategies. These strategies will be tested
under more complex (and realistic) settings using simulation.
