Dr. William J. Evans, Department of Chemistry, University of California -
Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program
of the Chemistry Division for research into the chemistry of organosamarium(II)
and related complexes. The general objectives of the project are to identify and
develop new types of chemistry and chemical transformations by exploring,
defining, and exploiting the special properties of divalent samarium. Four areas
of general importance will be investigated: carbon-carbon bond formation in
hydrocarbon coupling processes, the insertion chemistry of oxygen-containing
substrates, the chemistry of main group substrates containing element-element
bonds, and the synthesis and reactivity of isolable, alkane-soluble
carbocations. Metal compounds are used to facilitate many important chemical
processes. However, there is a group of metals, called the lanthanides, whose
chemistry is not well developed. Over the past few years tantalizing hints have
appeared that indicate that samarium, one of the lanthanide elements, may
possess heretofore unrecognized abilities to mediate chemical reactions. In this
project the ability of a series of samarium compounds to activate hydrocarbons
and to break and form bonds between carbon and other elements will be assessed.
This will contribute to the discovery of new uses for samarium, which is an
inexpensive metal readily available in the United States.
