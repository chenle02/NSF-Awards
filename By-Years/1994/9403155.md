9403155 Hammond Dr. Paula T. Hammond has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Hammond received her doctoral degree from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of Professor
Michael Rubner. Dr. Hammond will continue research at Harvard University under
the sponsorship of Professor George Whitesides. Her postdoctoral research will
focus on the use of self-assembled monolayers to pattern the deposition of
metals on surfaces, directed towards the development of a grating structure that
responds to electrochemical potential with the diffraction of light. Longer
term, she will apply patterned self-assembled monolayers to the development of
optically functional devices such as optical waveguides and liquid crystal
devices. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as
an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching. ***
