With prior NSF support, Social Psychology Network (SPN) has become one of the
most heavily used Internet sites in scientific psychology. On an average day,
the Network's pages are viewed more than 30,000 times by visitors from 75
countries around the world -- a total of more than 22 million page views since
SPN was established. The current project will further develop SPN into a web
portal with many of the features found in nonacademic web portals, such as
customization by users, automatic link-checking, optional email bulletins, and
an advanced search capability that relies on an annotated database of more than
10,000 web links. In addition, the Network team will add a new web-based
technology for conducting complex "human-like" interviews via the Internet. This
advanced technology, created by the SPN team for its partner site at
eInterview.org, will be capable of changing question wording, response options,
and topics depending upon the answers given by interviewees. Together, SPN and
its eInterview.org partner site will strengthen the infrastructure of social
science research and education, offering new possibilities for global data
collection, scholarly communication, and dissemination of research results.
