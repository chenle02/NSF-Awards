Recent evidence suggests that fecundity in women begins to decline 15 or more
years before the average age of menopause, but the physiological mechanisms of
this process are poorly understood. Ovarian function is an important proximate
determinant of fecundity, and can be assessed through salivary measurement of
circulating ovarian steroids. The research proposed will examine the
relationship between age and ovarian function by determining, for three groups
of regularly-cycling women, ages 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49, (1) episodic patterns
of luteal progesterone release in saliva and (2) patterns and levels of salivary
estradiol across the menstrual cycle. Comparisons will be made across groups and
with previously-determined profiles of younger women (under 35 years of age).
This study will seek to identify specific aspects of ovarian function which may
be altered in women of late-reproductive age, and thus which may contribute to
impairment of fecundity. The results of this research will contribute to
understanding of this process in our own population. They will also help to
provide additional bases for study of the age structure of fecundity in other
populations of anthropological interest, and for consideration of the historical
development of human menopause.
