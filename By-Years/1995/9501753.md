ABSTRACT Phelan U/ Hawaii CTS-9501753 Research on the contact resistance
between nonmetallic compounds at cryogenic temperatures will performed. This
work has applications in mechanical cryocoolers and in applications of high-
temperature superconductors. The work will focus on combinations of metallic-
nonmetallic and nonmetallic-nonmetallic contacts. The work will use experimental
measurements to aid in developing a model of the contact resistance at these
conditions with the goal of providing a tool for the thermal design of cryogenic
equipment. The education program includes development of advanced nontraditional
courses in heat transfer as well as a new undergraduate course in Energy
Conversion Systems. Of special note are proposed student exchange programs with
a Japanese university and outreach programs to native Hawaiian and Filipino
students. These programs have special value for the investigator+s home
institution of the University of Hawaii.
