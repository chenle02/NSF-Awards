Equipment for Real -Time System Protyping The development of real-time embedded
computing systems requires a combination of software simulation and hardware
emulation to verify functionality and estimate performance, costs, power
consumption and reliability. The requested equipment is for the development of a
generic approach to the prototyping of real-time systems as well as specific
hardware and software for applying this approach to ongoing research projects in
Wireless Networks and Real-time Robotics. The equipment consists of a small
network of Personal Computers which run Computer Aided Design tools for software
simulations as well as serving as hosts for hardware emulation systems based on
microprocessors and digital signal processors. Together , the entire system
allows the rapid development, verification and analysis of systems which could
not be explored by either simulation or emulation alone. In particular, it
allows the statistical study of data-dependent and environment-dependent
properties which are difficult to model analytically and too slow using
traditional software simulation.
