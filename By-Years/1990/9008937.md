This award supplies funding to provide an existing near-infrared camera with
state-of-the art focal plane array detectors. The instrument was built to ensure
that astronomers at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington
(OCIW) have the best possible near-infrared array camera for general use between
1 and 2.5 um. OCIW is a partner is a consortium that has a contract with the
Rockwell Science Center to produce a series of HgCdTe array detectors. The
funding will be used mostly for hardware items -- the detectors, some
electronics, and a computer. OCIW will cover all the salary money needed to
complete this project. The major scientific programs to be carried out with the
camera in the next several years concern primarily a long-term study of stellar
populations in distant galaxies in clusters, direct imaging of the environs of
Young Stellar Objects, morphologies of high redshift (z &gt; 2) radio galaxies,
and infrared photometry of Cepheids.
