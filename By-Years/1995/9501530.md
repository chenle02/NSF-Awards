9501530 Spivack It has been argued that the boron isotopic composition of
foraminifera test are a function of both the isotopic composition of seawater
and pH. Initial data indicates that the B isotopic composition of seawater has
been nearly constant over the past 20 Myr while fossil foraminifera tests
exhibit a decreasing trend between 7.5 and 20 Ma. This data has been used to
infer changes in surface ocean pH, approximately constant between 7.5 Ma and the
present and with an increasing trend form 20 Ma (pH 7.4 4 + 0.2) to 7.5 Ma.
Investigators on this project will: 1. Conduct a systematic intercomparison of
the &11B of common planktonic species isolated form recent sediments, 2.
systematically examine the foraminifera 11B.
