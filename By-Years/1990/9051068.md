This project establishes an undergraduate Ada laboratory for upper level
computer science courses. Central to this undertaking is the acquisition of
eight 80386 based IBM-compatible computers with Ada software including an
integrated programming environment. These are used for instruction in Data
Structures, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering. Emphasis is placed on
the use of both the current and expanding literature in these areas. The award
is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
