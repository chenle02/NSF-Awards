9414807 Gupta This research will determine the failure mechanisms in laminated
carbon-carbon and carbon-polymer composites under biaxial compression and off-
axis uniaxial compression loading using a multi-axial testing system (MATS)
which can triaxially load a specimen in three mutually perpendicular directions.
A primary focus will be to determine the failure mechanisms experimentally
rather than just obtain the failure strength data and its empirical dependence
on various microstructural parameters. Concomitant failure laws will be
developed which are based on the participation of the experimentally determined
failure mechanisms on final instability. The developed micro mechanism-based
failure laws should aid laminate manufactures produce optimum microstructure in
laminate composites. ***
