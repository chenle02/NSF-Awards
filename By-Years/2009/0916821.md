Future multi-core microprocessors will be capable of deconfiguring faulty units
in order to permit continued operation in the presence of wear-out failures.
However, the unforeseen downside is pipeline imbalance in which other portions
of the pipeline are now overprovisioned with respect to the deconfigured
functionality. Such an imbalance leads to sub-optimal chip-wide power
provisioning, since power is now allocated to pipeline functions that no longer
provide the benefit they did with a fully functioning chip.

This research proposes to dynamically redistribute the chip power under pipeline
imbalances that arise from deconfiguring faulty units. Through rebalancing --
achieved by temporary, symbiotic deconfiguration of additional functionality
within the degraded core -- power is harnessed for use elsewhere on the chip.
This additional power is dynamically transferred to portions of the multi-core
chip that can realize a performance boost from turning on previously dormant
microarchitectural features. The technical deliverables of this project will be:
(1) a novel resilient multi-core system architecture -- including dynamic power
redistribution management algorithms -- that achieves much higher performance
than one that is oblivious to pipeline imbalances; and (2) detailed simulations
that quantify this performance advantage for various multi-core workloads.

The broader impacts of this project relate to integrated research and education,
enhanced infrastructure for research, broad dissemination of results, and
potential societal impact. Furthermore, the PI will recruit women and
underrepresented minority students to work on the project.
