This project is to develop a method of solving certain partial differential
equations arising in the theory of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. The
particular equations deal with such phenomena as transonic flow past thin wings
and the development of shock waves. Certain symmetries exist in linear PDE's via
the hodograph transformation. The problem of characterizing initial data leading
to global solutions is also discussed.
