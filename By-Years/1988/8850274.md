The University of New Hampshire Mathematics and Marine Science Program (UNH
M&amp;M Program) will be an integrated approach to introducing participants to
scientific studies and careers. This is a three week summer program consisting
of the study of marine science, probability, statistics, computer analysis of
data, and scientific methodology. Twenty 10th grade students will receive
classroom instruction in the above areas, and participate in four field trips
revolving around the study of coastal issues and environments. The UNH Sea Grant
Program has access to several wildlife areas including an offshore island
laboratory. Field trips also will be conducted to Great Bay, Appledore Island,
Odroine Point, Portsmouth Harbor, and local salt marshes. All instruction will
be provided in a team-teaching format.
