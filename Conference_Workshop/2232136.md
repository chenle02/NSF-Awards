The conference on "Emerging Trends in Variational Models of Materials" will be
held June 26-30, 2023, at the Centre de Recherches Math√©matiques (CRM)
affiliated with the University of Montreal. The meeting represents the
convergence of many of the world's top researchers in the mathematical analysis
of materials science. Furthering our understanding of how materials behave when
exposed to external stresses, magnetic or electric fields, or temperature
variation allows us to design more effective devices and to adapt to the natural
fluctuations found in nature. For mathematicians, this translates into
formulating and analyzing more and more sophisticated mathematical models. The
speakers and attendees of this meeting have international reputations as highly
effective investigators of this realm of science. This conference will provide a
rich experience for young researchers at the graduate and post-doctoral level in
the United States who through NSF funding can attend and interact with leading
scientists.

The wide-ranging topics under investigation at this conference include pattern
formation, phase transitions, dynamics, and control of soft matter systems,
including liquid crystals, ferromagnets, and superconductors. Also featuring
prominently will be topics related to self-assembly and collective behavior of
many-particle interactions such as biological swarms and granular media, along
with image processing and dissipative flows. These problems, originating from
physics, materials science, and biology, constantly reshape contemporary
mathematical research. In addition to applied mathematicians, there will be
talks presented by a leading experimentalist in liquid crystal research and top
experts in scientific computation as it applies to materials science.
