It is common to think of using the brightest stars to determine extragalactic
distances. Over 50 years ago Hubble first attempted to resolve stars in other
galaxies to quantify the expansion of the universe, and since then, the use of
blue and red supergiants for extragalactic distance determinations has been
explored several times. However, only recently has it been appreciated that
young planetary nebulae also fall into the "brightest stars" category and are
therefore potentially useful as distance indicators. The central stars of these
objects are almost as luminous as bright red supergiants, and, as a result,
present telescopes and current technology allow planetary nebulae to be detected
at distances as large as 25 megaparsecs. Planetary nebulae have several
advantages over most other extragalactic distance indicators. Because they are
not associated with any one stellar population they can be found in all types of
galaxies, and are particularly valuable for probing elliptical galaxies. It is
elliptical galaxies which define the cores of large groups and clusters. In this
grant surveys of planetary in elliptical galaxies will be made out to a distance
of 25 megaparsecs. These measurements will add to our understanding of the large
scale motions of galaxies and in other studies. The Principal Investigator is a
recognized expert in this research area.
