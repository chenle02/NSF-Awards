9520847 McKenna This research involves determination of the evolutionary
relationships among fossil and recent hedghogs. Morphological, dental
morphometrics and biogeographical evidence will be evaluated. The proposed
research will yield significant new phylogenetic information regarding the
interrelationships of members of this mammalian family. In addition the study
will provide an evaluation of different methods for recovery of the best
estimate of phylogemy (taxon congruence vs. total evidence approach) and
consideration of the dispersal corridor for hedgehogs from the Old World to
North America. A final consideration will be the power of a phylogemy to predict
climate change.
