9523663 Molter In current work on integrated photonic subsystems at EPSD,
researchers are studying a millimeter wave communication system. In this scheme
it is necessary to divide the signal into 256 channels, each of which has an
analog amplitude and phase control. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of
such a system, a 1 x 16 waveguide splitter is proposed. A study of waveguide
bends, Y's, and curves is proposed in order to predict the behavior of such
structures. The results of these analyses would be compared to experimental
results that would be obtained using devices fabricated in the Electronic Power
Sources Directorate (EPSD) at the Fort Monmouth Army Research Laboratory, in
collaboration with Dr. Wei Min Zhou and Dr. Mitra Dutta. Design parameters would
then be optimized based on considerations of loss, device size, and ease of
fabrication. ***
