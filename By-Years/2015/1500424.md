This project will study dispersive partial differential equations. Such
equations model many different phenomena, among them the propagation of various
kinds of waves, such as water waves and laser light. These equations also model
certain phenomena in particle physics. This project attempts to understand long-
time behavior of such equations and related systems.

There are a number of problems that will be studied in the course of this
endeavor. The study will mainly revolve around the three well-known dispersive
partial differential equations: wave, Schrodinger, and Korteweg de Vries. A
great deal is unknown for the focusing Schrodinger and Korteweg de Vries (KdV)
problems, particularly for the mass-critical problem. The PI intends to study
the focusing, mass-critical Schrodinger problem for mass above the mass of the
ground state, as well as the focusing gKdV problem for large mass below the mass
of the ground state. The PI also plans to extend recent work with the I-method
to the wave and Klein-Gordon equations. Finally, the PI will study the ultra
hyperbolic Schrodinger equation.
