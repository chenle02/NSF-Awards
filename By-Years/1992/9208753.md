The comparative study of electoral systems has, for the most part, been
confined to aggregate national-level returns, for the simple reason that these
are the data that are available in machine- readable form. This pilot study
seeks to compile electoral results at the district level for a range of
democratic countries. The investigator will then code the results and make the
resulting machine-readable datasets available to the scholarly community and
public. The proposal also seeks to investigate the relationship between
electoral structure and the number of parties (an area long dominated by what is
called Duverger's Law) with a deliberate district level focus. The pilot study
should substantially enhance our understanding of the topic.
