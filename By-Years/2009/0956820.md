Epigenetic information, in the form of differential cytosine methylation and
alternative chromatin structures, plays a central role in the modulation of
eukaryotic gene expression. In some cases, alternative epigenetic modifications
can be inherited through meiosis, opening up the possibility that epigenetic
variation plays a role in generating phenotypic and genomic diversity. This
project is an investigation of two examples of epigenetic variation in the
flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The first epigenetic system to be
investigated involves the complex BAL genomic locus, which contains paralogous
pathogen defense genes and interspersed transposable elements. The defective bal
epigenetic allele leads to overexpression of several genes from the locus and
confers both developmental and pathogen defense phenotypes. The research will
probe the molecular changes at the locus that cause this mis-regulation of gene
expression, as well as the unusual metastable behavior of the bal allele. The
second objective of the project is to characterize a newly discovered class of
non-LTR retrotransposons, comprised of members that are epigenetically silenced
in some strains of Arabidopsis but not others. The mechanistic basis and
significance of this natural epigenetic variation will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The slightly different forms of individual
organisms in a population result from the interaction between the genetic
potential of those individuals and the environment. Also important are
epigenetic changes, which do not involve alterations in DNA sequence but rather
the packaging of this genetic information. This project takes advantage of the
experimental tools available in the small flowering plant Arabidopsis to study
the role of epigenetic changes in inheritance and the control of morphological
diversity among individuals and strains.&lt;br/&gt;
