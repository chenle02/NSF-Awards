This award to Wayne Gladfelter at the University of Minnesota is supported by
the Advanced Materials Program in Chemistry and the Electronic Materials Program
in the Division of Materials Research. The twofold goals of the research are the
development of new precursors to gallium nitride which will permit lower
processing temperatures, and the development of synthetic schemes for the growth
of nanocystalline particles of defined size. New volatile precursors will be
based primarily on gallium hydride complexes and organogallium azides. The
chemical reaction mechanism of the deposition will be examined using film growth
kinetics and isotopic labeling. Specific labeling of the precursors with
deuterium and simultaneous profiling of H and D using forward recoil elastic
scattering spectrometry will permit the determination of the source of hydrogen
incorporation in the films. A novel chain-termination approach will be used to
control nanocrystal particle size using known and new gallium hydride complexes.
Under this approach, unreactive chain terminating groups will coat the surface
of the gallium and nitrogen groups on the particles and prevent further growth
or agglomeration. Gallium nitride is an attractive candidate for optoelectronic
devices capable of absorbing or emitting blue light. This research will provide
a picture of the evolution of gallium nitride film structure as a function of
time, temperature, pressure and precursor structure. By correlating these data
with studies of the deposition mechanism, the critical connection between growth
chemistry and film composition and structure will be made.
