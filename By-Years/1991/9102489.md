This is a field and laboratory study of off-axis flow-line sampling to test for
petrologic temporal variability. To avoid the petrologic complications that
exist near large EPR offsets the study will be sample the EPR at 13 degrees
13-17 minutes north. Two paired and symmertical flow-line sampling transects,
separated by 7 km, will be occupied. The goal is to determine whether the
composition of the ocean crust varies episodically, quasi-periodically, or not
at all.
