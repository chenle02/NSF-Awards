9623204 LJUNGGREN In 1996, Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
will operate the research vessel MAURICE EWING in support of NSF-sponsored
research. The EWING is a 230' general purpose research vessel with specialized
capability in marine geology and geophysics. The vessel is owned by the National
Science Foundation and operated by Lamont-Doherty through a 5-year charter
agreement. The EWING is capable of operating world wide and will support cruises
in the south Pacific Ocean and the north Atlantic Ocean in 1996. The ship is
scheduled for 319 operational days in 1996, of which 315 are in support of NSF-
sponsored marine geology and geophysics programs. This vessel is part of a fleet
used by the National Science Foundation in support of oceanographic research.
Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive
support from the ship's crew members. Increasingly research projects require
equipment which must be permanently installed on the vessel, thus requiring
specialized vessels. These vessels do not operate the same as general
cargo/fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the operation of a variety of
vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
universities and research institutes around the country. ***
