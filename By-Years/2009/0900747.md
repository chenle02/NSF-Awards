The major aim of this research is to design, implement and apply a full-spectral
interrogator for FBG sensors operating at high data acquisition rates and the
associated signal processing algorithms required to interpret the acquired
spectral data. The performance of the interrogator and sensor system will be
evaluated for two applications: (1) the identification of sub-surface damage
states in woven composite specimens subjected to multiple low-velocity impact
events and (2) structural health monitoring of bonded composite joints. The FBG
sensor grating structure (profile) will also be optimized for each of these two
damage identification and structural health monitoring cases based on the
ability of the inversion and signal processing algorithms to uniquely identify
damage conditions. The research plan is a collaborative effort between
researchers in the Mechanical and Aerospace Department at North Carolina State
University and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Brigham
Young University. The PIs will also work in collaboration with programs at the
two universities to prepare diverse students for engineering and scientific
undergraduate careers.
