This project will motivate and prepare undergraduate minority students for
graduate studies in physics, chemistry, and material science. The plan will
strengthen the academic environment of the College of Science and Technology,
and establish the school as a significant resource center for promising minority
scientists. In particular, it will: o Establish a conducive undergraduate
research environment in the College of Science and Technology by providing
encouragement and incentive to faculty members to develop creative undergraduate
research projects, o Recruit talented minority undergraduate students as
Research Scholars in the program, o Enrich their undergraduate educational
training by involving them in research projects and imparting basic skills in
methods of scientific research, o Enhance their research exposure and motivation
by arranging summer research internships at graduate schools and
national/Federal laboratories, o Accentuate their self-image and confidence by
assigning them as speakers in regular colloquiums and research seminars, o
Organize visitations of area high school seniors and juniors to the monthly
research seminars to stimulate their interest in sciences and encourage high
school students to major in physical sciences, and o Recruit top-ranking high
school seniors to major in physics/ chemistry by instituting a Freshman
Scholarship program.
