The internal cellular anatomy of wood has a fossil record extending back to the
origin of the flowering plants, and beyond. Dr. Elisabeth Wheeler is a leading
expert on the fossil record of wood anatomy, and she has been instrumental in
assembling an international effort to construct a database of wood
characteristics. Dr. Wheeler has requested a Career Advancement Award to allow
her to gain the statistical and computing skills necessary to begin critical
exploration of this data resource. Patterns of evolutionary and functional
relationships will be established through this analysis, thereby clarifying the
factors behind the diversity of wood structures found alive today. Dr. Wheeler
is uniquely qualified to lead both the expansion and the analysis of the
proposed database of wood anatomy. The proposed career advancement activities
will provide her with a realistic opportunity of expand and accelerate this
research program.
