A course entitled Microscopy and Microtechniques is designed to provide students
with opportunities to obtain instruction and hands-on experience in modern
microscopy and apply this knowledge in a project which will allow them to use
the scientific method. Completed projects will be submitted in the form of a
scientific paper and as a 15 minute oral presentation, poster presentation, or
videotape. High quality bright field and phase microscopes and photographic and
video camera equipment will enable this course to be given. The university will
provide matching funds.
