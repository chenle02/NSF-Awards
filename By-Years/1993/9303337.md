Qualified, active ocean scientists from developing countries will participate in
a series of planning workshops and international scientific meetings relevant to
their particular area of expertise, to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic
Research (SCOR) and of interest to the National Science Foundation. Travel
awards will be provided through the SCOR Secretariat to attend meetings that
relate to SCOR activities. This program provides an effective mechanism for
establishing contacts between oceanographers from developed and developing
nations. Project objectives include: broadening traditional participation in
ocean-related international scientific meetings to include more scientists from
developing countries; to enhance the exchange of detailed regional knowledge or
expertise in planning for large-scale oceanographic experiments; and to provide
greater opportunities leading to the involvement of developing countries in
international collaborative programs, such as JGOFS and GLOBEC.
