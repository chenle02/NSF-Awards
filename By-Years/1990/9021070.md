This action is to assist in the organization of a workshop on "Seismic
Microzonation and Instrumentation of Geotechnical Structures in Chile". This
meeting is to be held at the University of Chile in Santiago, with a tentative
date of January 6-10, 1992. Specifically, this action is to provide travel
support for Professor Chaim Poran of the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte to meet with Prof. Eugenio Retamal in Santiago, Chile, to begin
planning for this workshop. This region of Chile is seismically very active, and
historically and in recent times (1985) it has been subjected to large damaging
earthquakes. The motivation for this meeting is to forge and maintain contacts
between the U.S. and Chile. Following the 1985 earthquake, collaborative
research projects were initiated to assist geotechnical engineers in Chile and
the United States of learn from that event. This workshop will continue and
enhance that collaboration; it will assist with the development of preparedness
plans for the next major earthquake in Chile; and it will enable researchers in
the United States to be in a position to learn from that event.
