Modern programming languages encourage programmers to use abstraction and
encapsulation to hide one moduleOs data representation details from other
modules. But this leads to slow execution without in-line expansion
(substitution of procedure bodies for procedure calls). The problem is
particularly acute in object-oriented and functional programming languages that
support method and function abstraction. Most previous work on in-line expansion
(in imperative languages) fails to inline higher-order and recursive functions,
but in functional languages (and object- oriented languages, with dynamic
methods) these can be crucial. Since modules can be compiled separately from
each other, cross-module in-line expansion complicates program linkage. This
work uses a lambda-calculus framework for cross-module in-line expansion, which
cleanly separates the compilation- management issues from the inlining
algorithms. The objective of this project is to implement this framework, and
then design inlining algorithms within the framework that can be tested in the
field.***
