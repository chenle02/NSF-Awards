Lange will explore several subjects that require solving problems in pure
computability theory, some that are purely model-theoretic, and some that are a
mix of the two. For example, Lange is studying the structure consisting of the
computably enumerable (c.e.) sets under inclusion, an object of intense study in
classical computability theory. The problems she plans to study focus on when a
given c.e. &lt;br/&gt;set is mapped by an automorphism of this structure to a
set that &lt;br/&gt;computes the halting problem. On the other hand, Lange is
examining the computational complexity of structures associated with real closed
fields, generalizations of the ordered field of the reals. Many of these
questions cannot be answered without first solving purely algebraic or model
theoretic problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of computable structure theory,
Lange's area of research, is &lt;br/&gt;to examine mathematical structures from
an algorithmic perspective. &lt;br/&gt;There are many problems in mathematics
for which there is no way to compute a solution. Knowing a problem is not
computably solvable, however, provides only limited information about its
algorithmic complexity. Given two problems, if one can compute a solution to the
first problem from a solution to the second, the second problem is at
&lt;br/&gt;least as computationally difficult as the first. Lange and others in
&lt;br/&gt;the field work to precisely calibrate the algorithmic difficulty of a
mathematical problem by finding its place in the standard computational
framework that grew out of Turing's work. A critical aspect of computable
structure theory is understanding the relationship between definability and
computability. Definability refers to the ability to describe aspects of a
mathematical object using a formal language. Thus, answering questions in
computable structure theory often furthers the understanding of the mathematical
objects under consideration.
