93-53655 Engstrom Electronic Communication and Information Retrieval The
proposed project focuses on developing a state-of-the-art communication and
information retrieval system for the EPSCoR investigators in South Dakota. New
technology will be utilized to overcome difficulties in effective collaboration
caused by physically separate centers of research within the existing clusters
of the Advanced Development Program. Three specific activities will be
implemented: 1) A telecommunications seminar series will be initiated over the
recently inaugurated Rural Development Telecommunications Network; 2) All
investigators will be provided access to Internet and instruction in its use so
that daily communication between investigators, between the Project Director and
investigators, and between investigators and their colleagues outside of South
Dakota can occur; 3) Investigators will be provided with access to Uncover2, an
information retrieval and document delivery service so that they can have the
research libraries of the country available to them.
