The proposed research has two goals. Its scientific goal is to understand the
structure of human handwriting. Its engineering goal is to advance the state-of-
the-art in handwriting recognition technology. To accomplish both goals, the
characterization of statistical constraints in unconstrained handwriting is
proposed. To be investigated are physical constraints on handwriting (arising
from the structure and limits of human anatomy and motor control), motor-
perceptual constraints on handwriting (such as executability and legibility),
and constraints due to the ad-hoc conventions of handwriting (such as those
arising from the Roman alphabet and chosen language).
