9615634 Ekstrom This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of
computing equipment to upgrade the computer facility for research in seismology
in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. The
remaining funds required for the acquisition will be provided by Harvard
University. The upgrade will allow the Harvard seismology group to write and
make use of numerically intensive seismic wave propagation codes to study global
and regional internal Earth structures. ***
