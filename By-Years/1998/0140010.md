Our proposed research program is directed towards developing a better
understanding of the quark structure of protons, neutronsand light nuclei.
Particular emphasis is placed on measurements of electromagnetic and weak
properties of the nucleon using electron scattering at Jefferson Laboratory and
MIT-Bates. Such data provide precise information about the spatial distribution
of charge and magnetization in the nucleon. A major component of our program is
the G0 experiment at Jefferson Laboratory, in which parity violation in
polarized electron scattering from hydrogen and deuterium is used to identify
the contribution of strange quark-antiquark pairs to the proton's charge and
magnetic moment. Coupled to this activity is the determination of "anapole"
contributions to proton structure, which arise from parity-violating
electromagnetic effects. Also proposed are studies of nucleon excitations using
polarization measurements&lt;br/&gt;of the recoiling nucleon, and the use of
kaon electroproduction to create hypernuclei in which one nucleon in a nuclear
system is replaced by a lambda particle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
