The goal of this research is to explore how robots might follow a trajectory
more accurately with practice of that trajectory. The research focuses on an
adaptive feedforward control, where a feedforward command is modified on the
basis of previous performance errors. Proposed trajectory learning algorithms
will be analyzed mathematically, evaluated through simulation, and implemented
on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Robot Arm. The objective of this research is
to make robots, and machines in general, move more accurately. This research
will lead to improved robot performance, and the ideas and algorithms developed
can be applied directly to the control of a wide variety of machines. Robots and
other machines will be able to move more accurately at higher speeds, allowing
faster throughput and greater productivity. In addition, more accurate
performance will make it easier to program robots to do particular tasks, as
programmers will no longer have to anticipate and compensate for dynamic errors.
