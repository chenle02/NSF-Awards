Comisiak In 1980, the Department of Geology &amp; Astronomy and the Department
of Biology at West Chester University of Pennsylvania established an instrument-
intensive Electron Microscopy and Analysis Center in the basement of the Geology
&amp; Astronomy Department . The Center has grown to include six electron
microscopes, an electron microprobe, an x-ray diffraction/fluorescence system,
ultramicrotomes, and a variety of instruments for preparation of geological and
biological samples, some of which were acquired through an NSF Instrumentation
and Lab Improvement award. The Center is used actively for faculty research, for
joint student/faculty research, for undergraduate research training courses, and
by researchers throughout the region. Unfortunately, the use of the Center s
instruments is hampered significantly by inadequate environmental controls,
outdated plumbing and electrical service, and poorly configured room
arrangements. The University plans to renovate the entire basement complex by
installing new plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems, new fume hoods, and by
reconfiguring lab spaces to eliminate conflicts among the use of various
instruments. The planned renovation of the Electron Microscopy and Analysis
Center will increase the efficiency with which samples can be prepared and
analyzed using different instruments, and will increase the Center s use for
research and research training. The renovation will create a suitable
environment for current and future research instruments, and will help to
attract students to careers in science.
