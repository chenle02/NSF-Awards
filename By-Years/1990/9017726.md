This project is concerned with the photoregulation of carbon- fixation enzymes
in the photosynthetic process; two key enzymes-- one in the cytoplasm, the other
in the chloroplast--are subject to post-translational modification by reversible
phosphorylation(s), and are the focus of the research planned. Detailed
biochemical examination of in vivo phosphorylation events is one part of the
project, while a second part will be focused on an apparent light- modulated
protein turnover. Regulation of photosynthetic events will be understood much
better when the results of these studies are available, for they will provide
enlarged insights into both chloroplastic and cytoplasmic, reversible
phosphorylation processes in plants. This three year, renewal project is focused
on analysis of the reversible light activation of two key enzymes involved in
C-4 photosynthesis in plants. The results can be expected to provide important
details of this regulation as it is effected by reversible phosphorylation in
both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts of plants. //
