9317120 Gautier The budget of Antarctic surface ultraviolet and
photosynthetically active irradiance will be investigated over a variety of
spatial and temporal scales. This project will continue ongoing mapping work to
characterize the spatial variability of surface irradiance over large
geographical areas. The largest scale maps will cover the entire Antarctic
coastline and Southern Ocean at a fifty kilometer resolution. Higher spatial
resolution maps will be constructed for areas where extensive biological
research is conducted, and for areas where polar vortex dynamics suggest
important radiative phenomena. Satellite mapping will be augmented and refined
by incorporating microwave satellite data for ice edge determination and by
utilizing Monte Carlo radiative transfer methods to enable a greater variety of
cloud simulations. Field work will include the installation during the austral
spring of 1994 at Palmer Station, Antarctica a network of newly developed
sensors to augment the National Science Foundation Ultraviolet Monitoring
Network instrumentation there. This project will be the first to study the
albedo of Antarctic peninsular snow, sea ice, and ocean surfaces in the
ultraviolet and will provide important results for both physical and biological
scientists. ***
