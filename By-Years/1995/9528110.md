Wheeler, J. Craig 95-28110 Dr. Wheeler will use a combination of photometry and
spectroscopy, including polarimetry, to better understand the progenitor
evolution, the explosion mechanism and the use of supernovae as cosmological
probes. A particular topic of exploration will be Type Ic supernovae which seem
to be devoid of most of their hydrogen and helium envelopes, a critical clue to
their progenitor evolution. Some of these events have rather shallow light
curves resembling other events like SN 1993J with rather different spectral
evolution and some have steeper light curves. This may give clues to the nature
of the collapse, clumping, mixing, and explosion of these events. Also to be
continued is the program of supernova polarimetry, which promises critical
information concerning the nature of the ejecta and of the circumstellar
environment. Preliminary results are that Type Ia supernovae are unpolarized,
implying a nearly spherical ejecta and very little circumstellar scattering, but
that Type II, and perhaps all collapse events, have finite polarization,
implying substantial asymmetries in the ejecta or circumstellar matter. Finally,
the observational program includes three supernova search programs, one a visual
search for nearby bright supernovae with the newly dedicated Supernova Search
Telescope, one at redshifts of Z about 0.1 to determine possible galaxy
evolution effects, and one deep survey at Z about 1 to constrain cosmological
models. The observing program will be complemented with coordinated theoretical
investigations. These will include multi-dimensional models of thermonuclear
explosions, including deflagration flames and detonation structure and stability
and gravitational collapse with multi-dimensional and multi-energy group
neutrino transport. Also computed will be the spectral evolution of models to
compare with observations. Of special interest is the spectral evolution of
models that reproduce the dispersion of light curve speed, color and maximum
brightness associated with Type Ia supernovae. ***
