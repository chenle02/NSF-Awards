Supporting the professional development of sponsored program personnel at the
nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) contributes to the
national STEM enterprise. The North Carolina-Supporting Sponsored Program
Success (NC-SSPS) project supports thirty-six research enterprise personnel from
the public and private HBCUs across North Carolina to attend a two-day
conference focused on enhancing research enterprise infrastructure. This will
increase the institutional capability to access federal research funding and to
engage the rural and urban communities where HBCUs conduct research. The North
Carolina-Supporting Sponsored Program Success (NC-SSPS) project will catalyze
the development of transformative ideas and a scalable model to strengthen the
Nation’s research enterprise by growing capability and access to research
support and service infrastructure particularly at emerging research and
minority-serving institutions. The goal is to convene sponsored programs
professionals and support their community of practice (CoP) engagement with the
National Sponsored Programs Administrators Alliance of HBCUs Inc (NSPAA).
Conference participants will contribute to the production of a statewide
guidebook, a Standard Operating Procedures manual that each campus can customize
for its use. NSPAA will support maintaining the CoP by offering an association
for attendees to join at the conclusion of the conference. The outcomes of the
conference include increased engagement with the expertise of NSPAA and tools
organized by research enterprise classification (pre-award, post-award, and
reporting services) that will strengthen the research enterprise at HBCUs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
