9452735 Chopyak-Minor Keystone School Science will initiate a three-week,
residential, Young Scholars Project in Ornithology for 24 students entering
grades 11 and 12. The participants will be involved in activities in
environmental science, biology, ecology, and ethology in the study of resident
and migratory birds, while fostering a sense of stewardship toward all bird
species and their habitats. The program provides hands-on laboratory
experiences, field trips, and classroom instruction in ornithology.
