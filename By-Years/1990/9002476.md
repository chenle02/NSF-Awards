This proposal is to make carbon 14 measurements on the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the central Pacific on longitude 150 west. The
carbon data are useful as tracers of the ocean circulation. These measurements,
along with hydrographic and other tracer measurements will form the basis for
ocean circulation descriptions and models which are the principal objectives of
WOCE.
