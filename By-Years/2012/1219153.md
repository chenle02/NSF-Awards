University of Minnesota proposes to support technical services on R/V Blue
Heron, an 86? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the UM Duluth
Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. They request support for basic services only.
They will provide one technician on each lake-going research project of R/V Blue
Heron to support lacustrine research projects and to maintain, calibrate and
provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research
instrumentation. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year
continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal
impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure
support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in
support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually
undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers. All users (or the appropriate
funding agencies) share support for basic technical services on the vessel
equally, with NSF paying a share of technical support costs based on fractional
usage of the vessel during the year.
