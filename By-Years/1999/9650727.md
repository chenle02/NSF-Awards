The project is incorporating the Hewlett Packard gas chromatography/mass
spectrometer HP 6890 GC/MS, a benchtop GC/MS with an electron ionization and a
chemical ionization detector, in to the sophomore organic lab for chemistry
majors, the Honors general and organic chemistry, and the senior level organic
and inorganic laboratories. This system provides all the necessary features for
effective use in an undergraduate organic laboratory environment, namely high
sensitivity and accurate reproducible quantitation, but at the same time it is
very easy to use and very reliable. The Chemistry Department has made a
conscious effort to include more instrumentation in the undergraduate
laboratories in order to expose students to modern techniques and to incorporate
more experiments requiring higher-level and independent thinking. The instrument
is being used in organic qualitative analysis to supplement existing equipment,
and in the independent research projects done by undergraduates of all levels.
