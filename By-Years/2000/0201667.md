AST-0201667 Gawiser, Eric

Dr. Gawiser is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Yale University.
He will conduct a wide-field, multicolor survey for galaxies of high redshift
(z=3 to 5), which will allow him to measure galaxy clustering. The large number
of objects identified in this survey will provide measures of galaxy mass that
will discriminate among competing theories of galaxy formation and evolution.
His educational program involves a program of public education and outreach at
the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in
New York. He will develop tools that will provide general public access to the
future virtual observatories of astronomical archival data and will conduct
seminars introducing visitors to the techniques for using these virtual
observatories. ***
