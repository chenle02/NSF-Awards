EEC-9700557 ABSTRACT The award provides funding to Northwestern University, the
University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Argonne
National Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Raymond Krizek, for the support
of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled,
"Geoenvironmental Engineering: A New and Strategic Curriculum." The objective of
this project is to develop a series of twenty 10-hour educational modules in the
rapidly maturing area of geoenvironmental engineering. These modules will be
used selectively to complement an existing course on a related topic, present an
entire course or series of courses to complement a program, or update practicing
professionals via continuing education.
