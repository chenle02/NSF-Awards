0107199&lt;br/&gt;Ruzek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) and its parent body the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research (UCAR) exemplify a national research organization that has enormous
potential to positively impact SMET learning at all levels. Excellent
educational programs already bridging the research and education communities can
be further leveraged to reach a diverse, interdisciplinary national and
international education audience by collaborating with consortia of universities
and colleges seeking closer ties to research institutions. NCAR will host the
"Earth System Education Partnerships with Research Institutions" workshop
January 29-31, 2001 in Boulder, CO. The workshop will bring together a small
group of Earth system education leaders with NCAR and UCAR personnel to engage
in a strategic discussion of ways to enhance and expand research institution
involvement with the education community.&lt;br/&gt;
