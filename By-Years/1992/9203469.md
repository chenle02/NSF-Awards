Professor Gouvea will work on several problems connected with the theory of
p-adic modular forms. In particular, he will study conjectures on the existence
of modular forms connected by congruence conditions. He will also work on the
arithmetic properties of elliptic curves in twisted families. This project falls
into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
