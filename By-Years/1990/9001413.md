This study involves an historical-comparative analysis of Hindu- Muslim enmity
in four villages in rural West Bengal, India and Bangladesh. The objective is to
gain an understanding of the processes by which people think about disputes,
pursue conflict, and choose their enemies. With this kind of information, it may
be possible to negotiate resolution of conflicts that occur in communally based
ethnic, nationalist, and language-based conflicts.
