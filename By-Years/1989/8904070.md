Inclusions of glass in volcanic phenocrysts can reveal the preeruptive state of
magma and its pressure of crystallization. Such knowledge is needed to
understand volcanic eruptions and the formation and evolution of magmas and
ores. This project will determine the vesicularity and crystal content of
individual lumps of pumice as well as the compositions of phenocrysts and
concentrations of H2O and CO2 in glassy and revitrified inclusions in quartz and
feldspar phenocrysts from stratigraphically controlled sites in the rhyolitic
Bishop Tuff, Calif. These determinations will be used to assess the following
postulates: 1) An accumulation of gas existed in the upper part of the
preerupted body of magma; 2) Gas accumulation was mostly responsible for a
strong upward decrease in bulk magma density and consequent prevention of
convection and survival of magmatic zoning during eruption; 3) the transition
from plinian to ash- flow style of eruption corresponds to a sharp change in the
amount of accumulated gas; 4) gas accumulation largely derived from deeper
levels of differentiation rather than in situ crystallization; 5) H2O was added
to magma during ascent.
