This CRPA award will address the science behind solar energy, its capture,
measurements, and uses. It is a collaborative effort between scientists at
Portland State University (PSU) and the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry
(OMSI). Materials for the OMSI staff will be prepared by the scientists and the
OMSI staff will work with the scientists on making presentations to the public.
OMSI will translate information from the exhibits, displays, and presentations
into Spanish to engage the Hispanic population. Scientific caf√©?s will be part
of this engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and OMSI museum have had a
working relationship for some time adding to the potential success of the
project. The PI and his colleagues at PSU have a major effort going in research
on photonic science suggesting that this engagement can continue to be updated
as the time goes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be evaluated by the
well established evaluation group at OMSI. Further, Spanish speaking public will
be embraced with this material as will rural residents from traveling exhibits
and displays.
