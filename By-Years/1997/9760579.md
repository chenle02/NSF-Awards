*** 9760579 Norris This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims
to solve the p-type doping problem in III-V nitrides by means of a novel variant
on the concept of 'bandgap engineered' doping. It is shown that this approach
can enhance the electrical activation of impurities and thus strongly increase
the free carrier concentration.'Initial calculations predict p+ material is
possible which is of great importance to III-N laser technology. Research in
III-V nitride materials has resulted in substantial progress over the last few
years including the demonstration of efficient green/blue light-emitting diodes,
and lasers emitting in the ultraviolet and the blue part of the optical
spectrum. The thermal stability of III-V nitrides and the high radiative
efficiency of highly dislocated materials grown on sapphire has led to much
interest in the field. However, several significant problems remain to be solved
in this new class of materials, One of these issues, the "p-type doping problem'
is due to the large thermal activation energy of acceptors in GaN and other
III-V nitrides. The commercial applications of p+ doping for low resistance
p-contacts are manifold. These include all 111-N LEDs that is: blue, green and
yellow , III-N lasers as well as high frequency, high power vertical JFETs for
microwave applications.
