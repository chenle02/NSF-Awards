The focus of this program is to increase the number of students from
traditionally underrepresented groups who pursue undergraduate degrees in
engineering in the Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources at West
Virginia University. The program will provide merit scholarships to academically
talented, low-income students with a focus on first-generation college students,
females, African-Americans and Hispanics. Recipients of the scholarships will
participate in a pre-fall bridge program, specialized first-year courses, and a
variety of co-curricular activities designed to provide support and increase
retention in engineering degrees. The major goals of the program are to increase
the annual enrollment of underrepresented students in the engineering programs,
to enhance curricular and co-curricular support services for these students, to
develop and utilize partnerships with local and regional engineering companies
and to assess the impact of these activities on student motivation and
success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plans for project implementation include
facilitating student participation in activities designed to increase retention
including enrollment in common courses, participation in live-learn communities,
academic advising and tutoring, and multi-tier mentoring from academia and
industry with opportunities for internships and undergraduate research. Program
activities will be assessed to determine the relationship between program
participation and academic success, what elements of the program most
significantly impact success, how practical and logistical challenges are
overcome, and what the longitudinal impact of the program is on motivation,
perceptions, feelings of inclusion, and overall outcome. Data from the project
will be used to identify successful program elements that can be disseminated to
other institutions to foster persistence and perseverance of under-represented
and low socioeconomic status students in engineering programs.
