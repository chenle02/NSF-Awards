9353951 Preston The East Tennessee College Mathematics Consortium is conducting
two five-day workshops to introduce mathematical modeling to freshman and
sophomore two and four-year college mathematics faculty. The first workshop is
calculus-based and the second workshop is precalculus-based. Participants are
expected to develop and incorporate appropriate models into the calculus and
pre-calculus courses they teach during the year following the workshop. Three
follow-up sessions are being held after each workshop to reinforce the modeling
techniques studied and strengthen participant communication. A project document
containing the models studied and developed is being produced and distributed to
all participants. Fifteen of the participants in the first workshop serve as
leaders for the second workshop. ***
