Modern science claims to be universal, yet its rise in the 17th century was a
distinctly Western phenomenon. This is not to say that no science existed
outside the West - there were great scientific traditions in, for example, China
or India. Yet the institution which we know of as `modern` science was developed
in Europe and then spread around the world. But how was it accepted in non-
Western cultures? What were the impacts on these cultures and, reciprocally, on
modern science itself? This is an issue of central concern as science truly
becomes `universal` in the contemporary world. This is the focus of Dr.
Prakash's study in the context of modern science's acceptance in India. Dr.
Prakash is examining the historical emergence of science as a metaphor of
modernity in India. Locating the emergence of science's dominance in its
diffusion and dispersal in the discourse of the western-educated middle class,
he intends to view the dissemination of science's authority as a process of
translation-a process entailing the renegotiating and reconstitution of prior
categories of identity and knowledge. In doing so, it touches upon the emergence
of scientific disciplines, but its principal concern is with discourse outside
the laboratory-in arenas such as religion, textual traditions, social practices
and national identity where sciences authority had far-reaching effects. The
purpose of such an inquiry is to examine and understand how science was
institutionalized outside the West, and what were the effects and forms of its
diffusion. The questions he asks are: How did science acquire its privileged
status as a sign of modernity? What were the conditions and effects of its
translation across geocultural and political borders? Science's status as a sign
of modernity in India became established during the second half of the 19th
century. It was then that new technologies of British colonial rule-railroads,
telegraphs, census operations, administrative rationalizations, technical
institutes, museums and industrial exhibitions-became an enduring and dominant
part of the landscape. The emergent western-educated middle class was drawn to
science as a grammar of social, cultural, and eventually political reform. By
the time India achieved independence, science had acquired a prominent place in
imagining `modern India.` Dr. Prakash is carrying extensive research into the
processes of science's authorization. He is carrying out this research in
archives freshly opened in London and New Delhi. This research promises to
provide a rich portrait of the history of science's authority in India.
