Dr. Gifford-Gonzalez will continue her research on African archaeological
faunal materials. For a number of years Dr. Gifford-Gonzalez has analyzed food
remains recovered in East African sites. This allows her to trace changing
subsistence through time, to determine how societies adapted to changes in
environment, and to demonstrate how pastoralism was integrated into hunting and
gathering societies. The project will also train students and other
archaeologists and expand her work into other areas of material culture
analysis.
