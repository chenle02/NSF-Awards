Data speculation refers to the execution of instructions before it has been
determined that the data being used is valid. Data speculation depends on
dynamic memory disambiguation to determine if the data was valid, and forces
recovery code to execute if the data was invalid. A data speculation compiler
generates recovery code to handle the situation where such execution violates a
memory dependence. This project examines data speculation techniques, and
attempts to understand how to utilize them more effectively. The issues
addressed are (1) using data speculation with predication, (2) improving the
scheduling algorithms used with it, and (3) using static analysis to help
determine when it should be applied. This work will be done using the Memory
Conflict Buffer (MCB) technique for dynamic disambiguation. The concepts will be
developed so they are applicable to other forms of dynamic memory
disambiguation. ***
