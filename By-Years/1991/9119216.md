The recently completed X-ray all-sky survey carried out by the ROSAT satellite
can provide a sample of clusters of galaxies which has both well established
quantifiable selection criteria and is in a contiguous region of the sky. To
obtain this sample it is necessary to identify the clusters from the more
numerous other sources. The Principal Investigator is only one of a few US
astronomers who were invited to participate in the ROSAT survey and has access
to this X-ray data well in advance of publication. This grant will provide
support for follow-up optical studies of the cluster sample with particular
emphasis on the initial identification of the clusters and later investigations
of evolution of X-ray and optical properties, large scale structure, and the
classical magnitude-redshift relation. Analysis of the ROSAT data will enable
significant improvements over previous studies to be made.
