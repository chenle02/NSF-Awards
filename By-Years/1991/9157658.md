This research focuses on high performance operating systems for uniprocessors
and multiprocessors. Architecture and programming technology, the two fields
which border operating systems, have undergone radical changes in the last ten
years. Unfortunately, the reaction of operating systems to these changes has
been slight. Consequently, overall system performance is growing much less
quickly than advances in either of these areas would lead one to predict. Three
fundamental issues are interprocess communication, virtual memory management,
and distributed memory parallel programming. The goal is to bring operating
systems technology into step with modern architecture and modern programming
systems.
