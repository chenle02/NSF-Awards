In the late 1980's the field of computational science and engineering emerged as
a new discipline, one with a research core that generalized from its many
applications and led to the creation os several academic programs at leading
unversities. Computational science has since proven itself with many successes,
but it has also evolved both in its tools, methodologies, and research
challenges and goals. This workshop seeks to re-examine the area, and develop a
new consensus on the directions it should be taking. A major goal of the
workshop will be a document summarizing the accomplishments of the past decade,
and prognosticating the future for scientific computing research.
