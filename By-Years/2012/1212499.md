Recent years have seen the growth of a new field at the intersection of computer
science and economics: algorithmic economics. So far there were few
opportunities for students to receive a concentrated exposure to this field.
This first-ever summer school on algorithmic economics, to be held at Carnegie
Mellon University in Summer 2012, will bring together roughly fifty Ph.D. and
advanced undergraduate students from computer science and the social sciences;
and top researchers in algorithmic economics, who will give concentrated classes
on their areas of expertise. The summer school will cover areas such as
mechanism design, equilibrium computation, social choice, social networks,
market design, and fair division. The proposed summer school will promote
understanding within algorithmic economics, as well as foster collaboration
between computer scientists and social scientists. It will emphasize emerging
areas in algorithmic economics and help increase interest in these areas,
thereby leading to conceptual and technical advances. The summer school will
also serve as a basis for future summer schools on algorithmic economics.
