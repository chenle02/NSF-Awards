This project will pursue a combination of basic and applied research on role-
based control (RBAC), using a three-pronged approach, by developing 1) models,
2) mechanisms and 3) tools, to support the effective deployment of RBAC in
future systems. The basic concept of RBAC is that users are not directly granted
access permissions. Instead permissions are granted based on roles, and users
are made members of appropriate roles. This simplifies management of
authorizations. RBAC owes its origins to multi-user and multi-application on-
line systems of the early 1970's. There has been a recent resurgence of interest
in RBAC stemming from its use at application level. This project will provide a
sound scientific and engineering foundation for providing general purpose
facilities for using RBAC, both at the operating systems level and applications
level.
