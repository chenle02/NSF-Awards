This proposal suggests purchasing a cryogenic stage and controlled
vitrification system for cryogenic electron microscopy. The system will be used
to study the structure of nanometer sized ceramic and metallic particles
precipitated or reduced inside the microdomains of vesicles. The production of
nanosized particles in the microdomain reactors of vesicles and microemulsions
represents and emerging technology with important applications. The purchase of
the cryogenic system will easily allow for the rapid cooling of samples, thereby
preserving the structure in its original state. Electron microscopic examination
of these samples will provide information on the structure, kinetics and size
distribution of the precipitated particles which will be of great use in
tailoring process conditions to particle functionality.
