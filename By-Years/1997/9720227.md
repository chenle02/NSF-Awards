Multi-dimensional transient partial differential systems are computationally
demanding and may, for example, involve accident simulation, weather
forecasting, chemical and material fabrication, turbulence, and combustion.
Balancing computational loading on a parallel computer must be dynamic, since
adaptivity by either h- or p-refinement will upset an initial balance. Efforts
to date have concentrated on h-refinement rather than the potentially more
efficient p-refinement. This research seeks to develop the technologies
necessary to support effective and reliable adaptive computation for transient
partial differential systems on heterogeneous parallel computing environments.
These technologies will be incorporated into an extensible software framework
and evaluated using applications involving fluid flow, material processing,
chemical reaction, and crystal growth.
