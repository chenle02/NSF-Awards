This research by Dr. David W. Thompson will be funded by the Synthetic Organic
Chemistry Program at the College of William and Mary. The research will be
carried out primarily by undergraduate students and should provide well trained
students who have been involved in new development of new organometallic
chemistry. The general goal of the research centers on the development of
selective syntheses for 3-alkylidenetetrahydrofurans, 5,6-dihydro-2H-pyrans, and
tri- and tetra-substituted allylic and homoallylic alcohols. The projected
cyclic ether syntheses are of two types: 1) bimetallic organotitanium/zirconium-
aluminum carbometallation of acetylenic acetals followed by
vinylmetal/oxocarbocation coupling, and 2) Lewis acid promoted cationic
cyclization of acetylenic acetals. Particular emphasis will be placed on the
selective synthesis of 3-alkylidenetetrahydrofurans which will be subjected to
newer ether cleavage reagents with expectation of producing selectively
tri-/tetra-substituted alkenols.
