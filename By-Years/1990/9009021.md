PI will investigate the timing and style of the initial opening of the Gulf of
California. Sediments, sedimentary structures, sediment provenance and age-
dating will be used to constrain the times and patterns of rifting. Elucidation
of rifting in this region will permit understanding of rifting in other geologic
settings and at other times.
