This award provides support to Dr. William Axinn under the National Science
Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program. The objective of this program is
to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to enhance
the academic career of recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster contact and
cooperation between academia and industry. Dr. Axinn has already made
significant research contributions to the field of demography, and he has the
potential to become a leader in academic research and education. This award will
allow the investigator to pursue his research interests in family formation
processes in the United States and in Nepal. Dr. Axinn plans to expand his
research on family formation in the United States. He will examine the
mechanisms through which children's family formation behavior is influenced by
their parents' family formation and dissolution experiences, and their
educational and financial resources. He also plans to study intergenerational
influences on childbearing decisions. Dr. Axinn's work on fertility in Nepal
will be aimed at understanding the causes of fertility change in that country.
This research will provide important insights into the processes resulting in
fertility decline in non-industrialized settings.
