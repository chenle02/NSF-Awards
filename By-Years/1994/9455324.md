9455324 Karplus This proposal is to introduce interactive tutorials using 3-
dimensional computer graphics to visualize macromolecular structure and function
into introductory biochemistry. Specific goals of this proposal include the
development of 14 computer graphics tutorials to be used in the introductory
auto tutorial biochemistry course, the publishing of these tutorials, and the
holding of workshops for training teaching faculty at other universities to use
these tutorials. One difficulty associated with developing such an interactive
curriculum for introductory biochemistry is the large class size. For this
reason, this auto tutorial biochemistry course provides an excellent forum for
curriculum development, because it has already successfully adopted a highly
personal and interactive format. This computer graphics based curriculum should
have a large impact on undergraduate education, because tremendous numbers of
undergraduates take introductory Biochemistry courses each year, and very few
(if any) such courses currently have interactive, three-dimensional, graphics
content. This curriculum should be effective both for attracting more students
to continue in biological sciences and for preparing the scientific and
biomedical community of tomorrow so that they may assimilate and effectively
apply structural information about proteins and other biological molecules.
