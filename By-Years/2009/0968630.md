This award supports US-participation in the China/US Conference Research
Roundtable "Securing the Legacy of the International Polar Year through China-US
Cooperation", which will be held in Beijing, China, October 22-23, 2009, as the
part of the "George Bush China-U.S. Relations Conference: 2009 China-U.S.
Relations Conference: Looking Ahead After 30 Years". It is the fourth in a
series, hosted by Texas A&M University (Bush School of Government and Public
Service and George Bush Presidential Library Foundation) and the Chinese
People?s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. The conference will
involve thematic sessions and research roundtables in which distinguished
academic scholars from both countries will discuss collaborative research
opportunities in a variety of strategic areas, such as environmental
sustainability, energy, and education. The research roundtable proposed here
would be a part of these discussions. In terms of broader impacts, this proposal
is strong in that the roundtable discussion will foster international
collaboration, broaden the perspective of U.S. scientists, and provide an
opportunity for proposing joint projects in the Arctic and Antarctic. Following
the formal conclusion of the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 in March
2009, efforts are now focused on formulating a framework for securing the legacy
of this international event.
