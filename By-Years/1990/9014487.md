This grant is funded in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing
Initiative. It is a collaborative effort between a chemist and a materials
scientist that is concerned with the synthesis of new metal-organic precursors,
the preparation of amorphous oxycarbides and crystalline carbides from these
precursors, the elucidation of the structures of these new amorphous solids, the
mechanisms of their transformations and the measurement of their chemical,
mechanical, electrical, optical and magnetic properties. Specifically, the
precursors for boron carbide, boron/silicon carbide, iron carbide, tungsten
carbide, and vanadium carbide are being synthesized into thin films, bulk
solids, or fibers, and heat treated in inert atmospheres.
