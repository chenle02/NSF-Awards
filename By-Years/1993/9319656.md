9319656 Green Central to the mechanisms that underlie central nervous system
function are the different neurotransmitter receptors responsible for the rapid
signaling between neurons and between nerve and muscle. These different
neurotransmitter receptors are membrane proteins composed of several subunits,
which are structurally similar and form a single large molecular family. While
much is known about how these receptors function, little is known about how the
subunits fold into the correct conformation and assemble together to form the
receptors. To address these questions, the research will focus on the best
characterized member of this receptor family, the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor. A series of experiments will identify specific chemical processes that
are part of subunit assembly and identify specific regions on the subunits
responsible for interactions between subunits. ***
