This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Oregon State University
for a ten-week program that will provide ten undergraduates in biological
sciences with research experiences in ecosystem studies at the Andrews
Experimental Forest. This is a site which involves several interdisciplinary
projects, including the NSF sponsored Long-Term Ecological Research Program.
Students will learn and develop skills as they interact and work closely with
scientists from several disciplines on individual projects within the larger
coordinated studies. To foster student development and monitor what careers they
pursue after they complete the program, a 4-phase program is planned: an
overview phase which explains integrated ecosystem studies, an apprenticeship
phase to develop skills, a personal research phase, and an evaluation and
follow-up phase. According to their interests, students will join a
collaborating scientist for the second and third phases. The principal
investigator of this award will coordinate the program, organize the overview
phase, field trips, and seminars, integrating the students and collaborating
scientists, facilitate progress toward independent questioning, and evaluating
results. Students will be housed at the field station with other researchers, an
arrangement that encourages after hours discussions and helps break the barriers
between disciplines. The project will place promising students at a scenic
research site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to produce good
science and develop an enthusiasm for biological research.
