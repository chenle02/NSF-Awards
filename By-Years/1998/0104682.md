AMNH ASCEND is a new model afterschool program of the American Museum of Natural
History in New York City. AMNH ASCEND focuses on the legal, ethical, social and
cultural implications of new discoveries in genetics. Eighty New York City high
school students will be involved in a two-year program that includes a series of
courses, hands-on activities, laboratory experiences, field trips, career
development opportunities and educational support. In the first year students
will participate in seven-week laboratory courses on genomic technology followed
in the second year by a research experience in genomics at the Museum. The
project is a collaboration of AMNH with AAAS, Mount Sinai School of Medicine,
the City University of New York and the New York City Board of Education.
