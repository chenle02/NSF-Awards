The proposal is directed at the design and implementation of a VLSI Gopher. The
VLSI Gopher aims at providing an infrastructure to researchers in VLSI Design
Automation. It is expected to provide the latest pertinent information on
benchmarks, design layouts, research papers, university publications,
proceedings of conferences, journals in a well organized format for use by the
research community.
