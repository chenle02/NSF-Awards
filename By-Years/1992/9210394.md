Intact nerve supply is known to be important to the development and maintenance
of muscle. However, the mechanisms underlying nerve- muscle interactions are
poorly understood. To examine this issue, a unique case of muscle atrophy
following damage to a remote nerve will be studied in a simple, insect system.
In the grasshopper, loss of a hind leg by autotomy results in atrophy of
undamaged, fully innervated muscles in the thorax. Experimental cutting of
nerves and loading or unloading of these muscles indicates that severing the leg
nerve during autotomy trans-synaptically induces atrophy of the undamaged
thoracic muscles. Staining with antibodies and intracellular recordings from
muscles and identified neurons will elucidate cellular changes that precede and
accompany atrophy. Selective ablations of sensory neurons will examine the role
of orthograde influences in the induction of atrophy. Selective axotomy of leg
muscle motoneurons will examine the role of retrograde influences. Selective
nerve blockade with tetrodotoxin will test the role of neural impulse activity.
Blockade with colchicine will test the role of molecules transported by fast
axonal transport maintaining. These studies will advance our understanding of
the regulatory interactions among neurons and muscle cells that are crucial for
the development and maintenance of their mature form and function.
