This project will develop instructional materials for incorporating the use of
graphing calculators in algebra. The lessons and "investigations" using graphing
calculators will be designed for direct use by the students and will include
materials for the teachers to aid them in the use of materials. there will be
transitional materials developed that help the student make the leap from simple
calculators to graphing calculators and provide an early introduction to
experimentation in mathematics. The project personnel will provide inservice
workshops for teachers, both during the year and in the summer. These materials
will be published in a monography by the Michigan Council of Teachers.//
