Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists and biochemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award,
co-supported by the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the Biological
Instrumentation Program, will help the Chemistry Department of Oklahoma State
University to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Synthesis of diheterobicyclic
and heteroarotinoid molecules 2) Studies on the structure of face to face pi-
systems and the use of metal complexes in organic synthesis 3) Synthesis of
heterocyclophanes and the photochemistry of constrained molecules 4) Studies of
the thermodynamics of fossil fuels 5) Synthesis and characterization of polymers
6) Studies of the effects of small hydrophobic molecules on heme proteins 7)
Studies of the structure of the polymers in plant cell walls 8) Studies of the
metabolism of retinoids 9) Studies of the elucidation of the mechanism of
electron transfer and energy conservation reactions of ubiquinone in
mitochondria
