9731870 Naigles This proposal development visit will allow the principal
investigator, Professor Letitia Naigles of Yale University, to travel to LaTrobe
University in Victoria, Australia, for two weeks to discuss a cooperative
research project with Edith Bavin of the LaTrobe University School of
Psychological Science. The subject of the study is the relationship between
early syntactic and vocabulary development. Previous studies have approached the
problem from the point of language production, with mixed results. The new
method they will apply, comprehension method of preferential looking, to assess
young children's grammatical knowledge. The project will establish the new
method in Australia leading to more accurate assessments of linguistic knowledge
in children acquiring English around the world. The Australian investigator,
Edith Bavin, is internationally known and respected for her linguistic research.
She has recently turned her attention to the acquisition of knowledge,
particularly native languages of Australia. Thus this collaboration also holds
the possibility of increased insight on the main problem based on knowledge of
acquisition of languages other than English. This is a new partnership which
promises to lead to increased cooperation in linguistics between the United
States and Australia.
