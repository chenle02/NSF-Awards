This award will provide partial support for a conference in the area of stellar
polarimetry, or the measurement of polarized light from stars or their
surroundings. Polarization is the alignment of the orientation of the
oscillations of electromagnetic waves (visible light, infrared, radio waves),
and is a powerful indicator of physical conditions such as light scattering from
grains or population inversions from non-thermal processes. Historically,
studies of polarization have not been very popular, mainly because they are
somewhat difficult to perform and calibrate, and generally are done best on
bright sources. This conference will address current and future directions in
polarimetry studies, especially in the context of observations on large
telescopes. The discussions will focus on three areas, namely on stellar
magnetism, the geometry of light scattering, and the exploration of opacity
sources in stellar atmospheres.
