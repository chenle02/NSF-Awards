The overall objective of this proposal is to discover whether a family of brain
peptides found in cockroaches, A-type allatostatins (ASTs), occurs in termites
and to determine what role these peptides might have in modulating the
production of the juvenile hormone (JH) that is thought to have a role in
termite caste determination and reproduction. The presence of AST-like peptide
will be determined with antibody against a cockroach AST and these A-type ASTs
will be tested for ability to inhibit JH production by termite glands. Extract
of termite brains will be tested on termite glands, and the termite ASTs will be
purified and identified by biochemical (chromatography and mass spectroscopy)
methods. Because termites are close relatives of cockroaches it is expected that
these peptides will be effective regulators of JH production in termites. This
discovery has potential for application to biological control of this
economically important group of insects. The study will involve the training of
undergraduate research students, and the results will be disseminated in journal
publications, talks at national and international meetings and will be
incorporated into courses taught at the University of Iowa. &lt;br/&gt;
