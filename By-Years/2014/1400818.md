This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2014. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Dana M. Freund is "A Systems Biology Approach to
Understanding Lysine Acetylation in the Regulation of Plant Metabolism and the
Effects of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide" The host institution for the fellowship
is the University of Minnesota and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Adrian D.
Hegeman and Jerry D. Cohen.

The research will look at how plants respond to environmental changes which will
lead to knowledge that can be used to engineer plants for the future. Training
objectives include plant biochemistry, stable isotope labeling techniques,
protein turnover and metabolic flux analysis. Broader impacts include workshops
hosted by mentors on metabolomics and training of graduate and undergraduate
students. The knowledge gained will increase the understanding of how altered
levels of carbon dioxide will affect plants in the future and how plants
modulate responses to environmental variables, such as atmospheric carbon
dioxide.

Understanding at a molecular level how plants deal with climate variability,
especially changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, will contribute to the
ability to engineer plants that are able to be productive in the future. One
aspect to consider is lysine acetylation, a readily reversible modification that
alters protein function and regulates metabolism. This research will investigate
the regulation of lysine acetylation at the level of removal and the resulting
metabolic changes. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels directly influence
important plant metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and photorespiration.
Proteins and metabolites will be measured at various levels of atmospheric
carbon dioxide. Connections between protein stability, lysine acetylation, and
metabolite flux information will explain the role of acetylation as modulated by
changes in environmental carbon dioxide levels.
