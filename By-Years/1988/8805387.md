This award will provide subsidies to enable twenty-three earth science seniors
or beginning graduate students to attend a symposium on geographic information
systems (GIS) in September 1988. The symposium is sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Association of American
State Geologists. The purpose of providing student subsidies is to expose
beginning scientists to an important new technology early in their careers in
hopes that they will incorporate GIS into their graduate research programs. This
award will improve the effectiveness of the conference and it will
simultaneously augment the nation's supply of scientists trained in GIS by
providing superior students with timely exposure to the technology and its
benefits.
