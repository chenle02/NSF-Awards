ABSTRACT This grant will fund a workshop on the phonological structure of the
American Sign Language of the deaf (ASL), and its implications for our
understanding of phonological structure in human language. The workshop will
take place over a weekend in the summer of 1989, in conjunction with the
Linguistic Society of America Institute, to be hosted by the University of
Arizona, Tucson. The workshop is designed to (a) provide a forum for the
interaction of phonologists currently working on ASL, with linguists involved in
other areas of phonological research; and (b) familiarize a wider linguistic
audience with recent research in this area, and its import for our understanding
of phonological structure in general. The workshop is expected to accelerate the
development of this subfield of linguistics, which promises to provide
significant advances in our understanding of the role played by the modality of
the signal in determining the nature of phonologic structure in human language.
An edited collection of papers resulting from the workshop will be published.
