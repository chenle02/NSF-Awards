While there are many methods of reconstructing images, there is no current
technique that allows a comparison of performance based upon a global
performance criterion. This is a proposal to develop techniques that will
objectively characterize the quality of reconstruction theoretical techniques
that take into account known statistical characteristics of the images. This
novel research may result in a way to quantitatively characterize different
imaging systems using a global performance criterion. The work has potential
practical usefulness since it may lead to the selection of the most cost-
effective imaging system for given applications.
