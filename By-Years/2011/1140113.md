This project is developing an illustrated undergraduate text in projective
geometry applied to perspective art, which is suitable for use in sophomore- or
junior-level mathematics courses for mathematics majors, students pursuing
computer graphics, or mathematically talented art majors. The project builds on
the prior NSF-funded work of one of the PIs, which resulted in the publication
of the undergraduate text, "Viewpoints: Mathematical Perspective and Fractal
Geometry in Art" and a series of Viewpoints Mathematics and Art workshops for
undergraduate instructors. The project is 1) developing a series of materials
(papers, classroom modules, homework exercises), 2) testing the materials in the
classes at Franklin and Marshall College and Southwestern University and
evaluating these materials formally, 3) presenting these materials (via talks,
journal publications, web distribution, and mini-courses) to other instructors
for their feedback, and 4) publishing, marketing, and disseminating the text.
This course enhances knowledge of geometry and gives readily-accessible
applications that can be used in teaching, in studies where this type of
projective geometry course is relevant, and in fulfilling mathematics course
requirements with content that is relevant to non-mathematics majors.
