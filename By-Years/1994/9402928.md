9402928 Schmitt This U.S.-Chile Cooperative Science award will support a
collaboration between Dr. Klaus Schmitt, University of Utah, and Dr. Raul
Manasevich, University of Chile, in a study on boundary value problems for
nonlinear partial differential equations. The purpose of the research is to
study quasilinear problems, with the goal of establishing global results about
the solution structures of such problems, with emphasis on the development of a
bifurcation theory. Problems with nonlinear partial differential equations of
elliptic type which are parameter dependent and subject to nonlinear constraints
arise in a multitude of applied areas, such as the study of porous media, plasma
problems, and astrophysics. The theory of quasilinear equations is just now
being developed, and an understanding of the bifurcation possibilities is an
important aspect that needs to be studied. Both researchers are considered
experts in the field, and their collaboration could result in a major
contribution to this area. ***
