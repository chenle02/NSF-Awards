This project will incorporate into the chemistry program at Pacific University a
computer-controlled scanning ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer with software
and accessories necessary to perform a variety of experiments. This instrument
will replace an obsolete spectrometer, and will expand substantially the range
of experiments possible with the enhanced capabilities of the new equipment.
Students will use the instrument for quantitative and qualitative analysis, and
for the study of reaction rates, chemical equilibria, and electronic structure
of molecules.
