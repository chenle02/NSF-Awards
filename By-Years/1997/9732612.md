9732612&lt;br/&gt;Jessen&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to develop methods for
quantum state control and to study macroscopic quantum coherence in neutral
atoms trapped in a far-detuned optical lattice. The primary goals of the project
are to: (1) develop tools for coherent control and quantum state preparation in
optical potential wells; (2) explore the possibility of preparing few-atom
quantum states in large optical potential wells; (3) study quantum tunneling in
double-well optical potentials; and (4) study decoherence in quantum tunneling
in double-well optical potentials..&lt;br/&gt;
