This award funds the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in
Physics at the University of Chicago. The site will support twelve students for
ten weeks of summer research at the University of Chicago each year. The core of
the program for each student is a well-defined 10- week summer research project
under supervision of a University of Chicago faculty member. The program
provides students with exposure to the breadth and unity of physics, and the
students will learn to communicate science by submitting a written report and
making an oral presentation on their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
undergraduate students are introduced to many of the ideas of leading-edge
research, and student projects are among: high-energy physics, cosmic-ray
physics, astrophysics, general relativity, condensed-matter physics, non-linear
dynamics, biophysics, and topological physics. A series of talks presented by
faculty provides an overview of some of the most important research topics
currently pursued in these areas of physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
