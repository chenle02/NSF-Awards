The PIOUS system is an experimental software architecture for efficient data
management and I/O in heterogeneous parallel and distributed computing
environments. PIOUS offers scalable concurrency control with standard
consistency semantics, presents global or segmented views of parallel files to
applications, and declusters physical data for improved performance. Concurrency
control in PIOUS is based on transactions, and permits either volatile or stable
file access semantics for increased throughput or resilience to system failures.
The goal of this project is to complete and implement the PIOUS prototype system
on the PVM message passing substrate. The system will consist of an API library
that is designed to present familiar file system syntax and semantics, while
permitting multiple concurrent accesses and declustering across multiple disk
devices. The PIOUS infrastructure will then be further enhanced by designing
appropriate file system primitives that will enable the efficient implementation
of high level file access semantics and permit large structured and
heterogeneous data sets to be efficiently stored and accessed in distributed
networked environments. An appropriate file model will be defined, based on an
extensible and flexible, multilayered architecture, and will specify a set of
access interfaces; these methods will be realized as a suite of portable and
efficient runtime libraries and support software. ***
