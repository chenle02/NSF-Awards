The broader impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in two main application areas: infrared
cameras and telecommunications components. Tunable infrared lenses will enable
highly capable miniaturized infrared cameras, resulting in improved systems for
security, automatic navigation, and safety. In communications, tunable infrared
lenses will reduce component costs by eliminating active alignment requirements,
and can enable new functionality in configurable optical design. There are
impacts, too, in scientific research, which will benefit from the availability
of a continuously variable infrared lens for use in optical experimentation.
Finally, there will be substantial economic and employment benefits stemming
from successful commercialization of this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a new
type of device for infrared optics and photonics: tunable lenses with focusing
and beam-steering properties that can be adjusted without the use of mechanical
parts. The devices are compact, low-power, robust, and inexpensive; they promise
to enable a broad array of new applications in infrared imaging and
communications. The tunable lenses contain two immiscible liquids with different
refractive indices, and the curved interface between the two liquids forms a
lensing surface. The liquid interface can be altered by an applied electric
field to change the focusing properties of the lens or to tilt it in order to
steer light in a desired direction. The project will develop electrowetting
optics with a new set of materials optimized for use in the short-wave infrared
band between 0.9 and 1.7 microns, which is used for night vision, sensing, and
telecommunications.
