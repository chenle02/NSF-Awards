Vitaly Rassolov of the University of South Carolina is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop a new quantum
chemistry paradigm based on strongly orthogonal electron geminals, and to test
its suitability for chemistry-oriented applications. The geminal concept
consists of a correlated two-electron function, in contrast to the one-electron
function that is central to most modern quantum chemistry methods. If proven
accurate, the geminal model will have a broad impact on theoretical studies of
bond-breaking, reactive species, and transition metals due to favorable
computational scaling with respect to system size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports high risk/high impact
research in the theoretical modeling of chemical compounds and reactions. The
goal is to develop a novel, computationally advantageous method that will
accurately predict chemical properties important in understanding reactivity and
bonding.
