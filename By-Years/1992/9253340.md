The Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education (FASE) is offering a
two-year professional development project for secondary mathematics teachers.
This project is designed to help teachers motivate students' interest in
mathematics through effective classroom use of the PBS Instructional Television
series "FUTURES, with Jaime Escalante" and student materials which are under
development in the Multimedia Math Project (MMP), funded by the NSF
Instructional Materials Development Program. The project will test and evaluate
workshops for teachers to enhance the effective classroom use of both FUTURES
and MMP; develop Workshop Facilitator Kits, which are the materials needed to
produce such local workshops at nominal cost; and produce a multimedia (laser
disk and supporting print material) presentation which will provide teachers
with exemplary examples of motivational teaching strategies. Cost share of
approximately 35% of the award is provided by the Department of Energy and by
businesses such as ARCO and IBM.
