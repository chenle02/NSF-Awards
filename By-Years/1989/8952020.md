This projects integrates the principles and practice of high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) into the chemistry curriculum. The students become
familiar with the sample requirements, instrumental design and components,
optimization methods, analytical applications, and preparative uses of modern
HPLC equipment. The major use of the HPLC is in our advanced laboratory courses
and in undergraduate research. It is exceedingly important that students acquire
"hands on" experience with HPLC to prepare those going on to graduate or
professional studies and for those immediately entering the work force in the
local growing biotechnology industry. The institution is matching the NSF grant
with an equal amount of funds.
