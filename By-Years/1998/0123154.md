This project builds on the PI's research in computational geometry, a branch of
computer science with deep mathematical roots and ties to many applications
areas, including computer graphics, robotics, and manufacturing. The PI's recent
research on folding and unfolding, is a topic brimming with easily comprehended
unsolved mathematical problems, and with connections to protein folding, to
manufacturing by sheet metal bending, and to a host of other application areas.
This project aims to incorporate the latest research in this developing area
into educational levels from grade school through graduate school and industrial
research: origami constructions in grade school, creating folding toys in middle
school, a two-week summer high school course, a new interdisciplinary college
course, "Folding and Unfolding in Engineering" touching on topics from design of
the Space Shuttle robotic arms to automotive air bag unfurling, an academic
monograph readable at several levels, and software addressing industrial needs.
The goal of the project is to communicate the depth of frontier research, the
joy of exploring it and its practical usefulness, to all these different
constituencies, capitalizing on the rare accessibility of the
research.&lt;br/&gt;
