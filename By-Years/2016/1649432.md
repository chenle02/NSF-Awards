As semiconductor devices continue to shrink, it is clear that we are about to
witness stunning levels of integration. As we proceed through sub-10nm
technology, we will be able to integrate over 1,000 sizable cores and
substantial memory on a single die. Moreover, die stacking will be the norm. In
this environment, the main obstacle to building usable architectures is and will
be energy and/or power consumption. To ensure that architecture progress is not
bottlenecked by these limitations, architectures need to be redesigned for
energy efficiency from the ground up. This work will help develop a set of
technologies that will enable the next generation of ultra energy-efficient
multicores. Such multicores, applied to a variety of domains that include
energy, transportation, environment, or public health, will deliver major
economic and environmental benefits to our nation. The PI envisions this effort
as contributing to the research and education on advanced energy-efficient
computer architecture at the University of Illinois. The PI is currently
teaching courses in computer architecture; he will enhance the courses with the
research in this proposal. The project will also have a major impact on
industry, since it addresses a real, very timely technical
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project analyzes three
transformative, high-risk and high-payoff technologies for ultra energy-
efficient multicores. They are: (1) flexible multicores with cores that attain a
large range of operation, either through voltage scalability or through
combining CMOS and TFET; (2) control-theoretic hardware controllers for energy,
performance, and other parameters; and (3) advanced thermal support in
3D-stacked multicores. Moreover, it engages in research in a crucial area using
approaches that are radically different from the current research trends.
