Research Infrastructure: Collaborative Research Between Geological Sciences,
Astrophysics, and Computer Science: Infrastructure Support for a Visualization
Laboratory This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the development
of high speed computational, networking, and graphics facility. The research
projects supported by the facility include: 1. Geophysical studies of mid-ocean
ridges. 2. Kinematic and dynamic modeling of the deformation of the western
United States lithosphere. 3. Geological and environmental fluid mechanics. 4.
Characterization of fault rupture and the recurrence behavior of large
earthquakes: and 5. Retrieving and processing observational astrophysical data
by representing it as a virtual N-dimensional universe.
