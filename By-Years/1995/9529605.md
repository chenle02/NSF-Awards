Van Scoy OCE-9529605 An inert and safe chemical tracer will be released in the
center of the Greenland Sea gyre during the summer of 1996 to study mixing,
convection and circulation within the gyre, as well as exchange with the
surrounding waters, and flow into the North Atlantic through the Denmark Strait.
The tracer will be sampled in November 1996, prior to winter convection, in
March 1997, during or just after winter convection, and again in May 1997.
Samples will also be taken in the surrounding waters and across the Denmark
Strait on cruises through 1998 to study the paths and rates of water mass
exchange. This work is in collaboration with European scientists (European
Subpolar Ocean Programme Phase 2) and contributes to the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE).
