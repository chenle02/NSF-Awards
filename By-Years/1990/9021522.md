A mass spectrometer of special design is used to identify and measure ions in
the atmosphere. These ions are individual molecules of atmospheric gases bearing
either positive or negative electrical charges. The apparatus, developed over
several years of laboratory work, is capable of extracting from the atmosphere
ions existing in concentrations well below one part in a trillion, and injecting
them into the vacuum chamber of a mass spectrometer. Measurement of the masses
of the ions by the spectrometer permits their chemical identification. An
atmospheric-pressure flow tube into which specific ions can be injected is used
for the measurement of trace atmospheric species, including gas-phase sulfuric,
methanesulfonic and malonic acids, pyridine, and ammonia, all of which are
believed to be measurable at concentrations as low as 0.001 part per trillion in
clean air. Variants of the technique will be used to search for large naturally
occurring ion clusters, and to study clusters formed, or charged, by specific
ion species such as protonated pyridine or the nitrate ion. Ion-assisted
measurements will be made of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and
possibly of the OH free radical. The extreme sensitivity of these ion
measurements opens up new possibilities of detecting, and measuring hitherto
unsuspected low levels of atmospheric trace gases of natural or man-made origin,
some of which may come from biological sources, e.g., pyridine. It is expected
that these studies of the properties of atmospheric ions will help to clarify
the molecular details of the conversions of gases to particles in the
atmosphere. Implied in this is a better understanding of the nucleation of water
droplets, and this of cloud formation.
