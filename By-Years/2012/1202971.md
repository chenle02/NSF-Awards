University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral
Dissertation Research: How Mattering to Teachers Shapes Student Aspirations and
Performance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on teacher effects and the teacher-
student relationship has shown that teachers contribute in important and durable
ways to how students function in school. However, the ways in which teachers
exert this important influence remains poorly understood. This project examines
the degree to which student academic outcomes depend on the students' perception
that they "matter" to teachers. In that way, this project complements extant
research that focuses instead on teacher characteristics or student
interpretations of teacher qualities. The concept of mattering includes the
sense that one is noticed, important, and/or needed, in this case by teachers.
The project uses a mixed-method approach with data collected from ninth-graders
at two large public high schools, including survey data, observational data, and
interview data. This study is grounded in social-psychological literature and
links adolescent self-concept, the teacher-student relationship, and important
social and academic outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study addresses a central concern about the determinants
of educational outcomes and disparities. It intends to generate findings of
interest to practitioners in education, as well as families and the general
public. Findings could also be used to inform scholarship in several
disciplines, as well as future data collection efforts. Findings may have
implications for social expectations regarding the effects teachers can have on
their students. Findings may also have implications for school structure,
classroom pedagogy and teaching practices.
