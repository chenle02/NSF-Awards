Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Moore's doctoral degree was from the University of Illinois under
the supervision of Professor Samuel I. Stupp. Dr. Moore intends to continue
research at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of
Robert Grubbs. Dr. Moore's area of postdoctoral research will be on the rational
design of catalysts for stereo controlled ring-opening metathesis
polymerization. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as
an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
