9527024 Molnar The key link between dynamic processes and the resulting large-
scale kinematics of continental deformation is the constitutive law relating
stress to strain rate. The PI proposes to determine lateral variations in such
constitutive relationships across deforming continental regions where continuous
deformation approximates the kinematics of continental tectonics. Calculated
velocity fields will yield an internally consistent strain-rate field that the
PI will use to determine the laterally varying, vertically averaged, effective
viscosity of deforming continental lithosphere. This study will test the
validity and limitation of the thin viscous sheet as a model for large-scale
continental dynamics. Quantifying effective viscosity will reveal whether
regions of low strain rate deform slowly because of high strength or because of
low stress. A decrease in effective viscosity with increasing strain-rate will
allow inferences of the relative importance of friction on faults and ductile
deformation at depth in resisting deformation. In addition, the study of
kinematics alone will address specific conundra of Asian tectonics.
