Watermarking is the technique of embedding un-detectable information into
objects (e.g. images and video) mainly to protect the data from unauthorized
duplication and distribution by enabling provable ownership over the content.
Whereas considerable work has been invested in this topic, little has been done
to enable the same concept in the area of relational databases. There is much to
be gained from the ability to watermark relational databases, in particular
considering current mainstream migration of business interactions towards
distributed computing technologies. Effective watermarking can decrease the
reluctance of vendors to provide public availability or sharing of valuable
data.

Compared to multimedia, watermarking in the area of relational data presents a
whole new set of challenges. Relational data are characterized by value lying
both in the actual values stored as well as the organization of these data. A
major challenge for watermarking relational databases is simply the "lack of
bandwidth", deriving from the inherent lack of a major noise component in that
domain. To further add to the challenge, these constraints are data and
application dependent.

This project explores the issue of watermarking valuable outsourced relational
data. In particular, it addresses: the design of a resilient watermarking
method, a proof-of-concept implementation for numeric relational data,
deployment on real outsourced commercial data, and an evaluation of the
resilience of the algorithm.
