ABSTRACT

The goal of the proposed research program is to develop an adaptive multiscale
computational framework for transient problems aimed at predicting dynamic
response of engineered components and structures including complex failure
mechanisms operating at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The term
multiscale computational framework is coined to emphasize that the dynamic
behavior of structural systems is assessed from the fundamental physical
processes operating at smaller spatial and temporal scales than currently
resolved in simulations. The technical challenge is to develop new multiscale
analysis and design concepts where material and structure are viewed as a single
system and to enable the analyst to account in much more detail for the physics
of the problem to ensure reliability of computations.

Intellectual merit: The proposed framework will expand the fundamental
computational and material mechanics knowledge in the following two respects:
unified discrete-to-continuum and continuum-to-continuum scale bridging with
concurrent consideration of multiple temporal and spatial scales, and adaptivity
of hierarchical mathematical models.

Broader impact: If successful, this effort will greatly impact science and
industry's ability to model, analyze, and understand a vast array of multiscale
systems in an accurate timely manner. Validation of these technologies will be
performed on three feature applications: (a) Shock wave response of
piezoelectric ceramics; (b) Energy absorption of honeycombs; (c) Crash
prediction of polymer-based composite structural systems. These three feature
applications have been carefully selected not only because they embody typical
complexities associated with modeling multiple spatial and temporal scales, but
more so due to their national economical impact (importance of energy absorbing
material systems), and availability of experimental data critical for validation
of computational capabilities. In addition to the three feature applications
selected, other applications requiring large-scale, high-fidelity, predictive
numerical simulation of naturally heterogeneous materials and engineered
composites will benefit from this work.

The technologies involved with this effort are enabling adaptive multiscale
computational technologies associated with mechanical engineering, material
science, physics, advanced modeling and software development. Educational
materials including a new graduate course entitled Adaptive Multiscale
Engineering Principles as well as tutorials and multiscale simulation tools will
be developed.
