Considerable research interest has recently been focused on fold-and- thrust
belts, not only on the geometry and kinematics but also on their thermal
evolution. This project will utilized a well-studied fold-and- thrust belt in
the Hudson Valley of New York to attempt to distinquish burial heating effects
from conductive heating from overriding thrust sheets. Regional down-section
trends of illite crystallinity and vitrinite reflectance will be documented in
order to establish relative temperature trends form the Catskill Mountains into
the Hudson Valley- Little Moutains thrust belt. These temperature estimates from
thermal maturation indexes, together with palinspastic restoration of thrust
geometries, will be used in constructing thermal models illustrating the thermal
and structural evolution of the region. Results are expected to demonstrate
whether or not significant heating occurred by over thrusting, and these
findings will have wide importance.
