Telomeres are the specialized structures that form the termini of eukaryotic
chromosomes. These structures are essential for the replication and maintenance
of the genome. Telomeres have been extensively studied in lower eukaryotes but
considerably less in known about higher eukaryotic telomeres. A higher
eukaryotic telomere has recently been cloned from the flowering plant
Arabidopsis thaliana, providing the opportunity to study the telomeric regions
of this organism as a model system. Two aspects of telomere structure and
function will be studied. First, the nature and organization of the DNA
sequences that lie adjacent to A. thaliana telomeres will be investigated.
Second, the mechanism by which a broken chromosome end acquires a new telomere
(i.e., telomere healing) will be studied using a chromosomal mutant of A.
thaliana which carries a healed telomere. The healed telomere will be isolated
and its structure compared to that of the original chromosomal site to determine
how the healing event took place. In addition, the healed telomere, which
resided proximal to a centromere, will be investigated as a potential tool for
studying A. thaliana centromere structure. Characterization of essential
structural components of chromosomes gives greater insight into a basic
understanding of mechanisms used by cells to maintain the correct chromosome
complement. Additionally, this information could be useful in engineering
artificial chromosomes for plants, a technique which would add significantly to
the already powerful repertoire of available molecular techniques.
