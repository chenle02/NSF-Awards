The National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering, Inc.
(GEM) is funding its second teleconference. The overall goal of this national
teleconference is to inform undergraduate students and employees without
advanced training in science and engineering fields of the difference between
undergraduate education and graduate level training and responsibilities. In
addition, this teleconference will focus on the process of selecting the
graduate school best suited to one's particular needs. This information will be
prepared and presented with a multi-ethnic and multi-racial viewing audience in
mind.
