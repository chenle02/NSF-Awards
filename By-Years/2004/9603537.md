Form 10 Abstract Proposal AST 96-03537 PI: Joshua Frieman Institution:
Universities Research Association Inc. This award supports partial travel
expenses for attendees at the 18th Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics,
to be held in Chicago, IL on 15-20 December, 1996. Prominent topics at this
year's meeting will include pulsars, supernovae, solar neutrinos, X-ray
astronomy, gamma ray bursts, astrophysical magnetic fields, dark matter, nuclear
astrophysics, big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background,
gravitational lenses, galaxy clusters, large-scale structure and galaxy
formation, measurement of the cosmological parameters, the interaction of
particle physics and cosmology in the early universe, active galactic nuclei,
quasar absorption line systems, gravity wave detection, numerical general
relativity, quantum gravity, and cosmic rays. The highlight of this year's
meeting is particle astrophysics.
