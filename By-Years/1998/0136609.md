ABSTRACT

OCE-0136609

Box models of the ocean-atmosphere carbon system have suggested that atmospheric
CO2 is sensitive to perturbation of the high latitude surface ocean properties
and quite insensitive to low latitude perturbations. In contrast, ocean general
circulation and carbon cycle models show a greater role for the ocean's warm
surface waters and a weaker response to changes in high latitude biological
export efficiency. For this reason, a PI from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, proposes to test the hypothesis that these discrepancies can be
attributed to the role of the ventilated thermocline and mode waters using a
hierarchy of numerical ocean circulation and biogeochemistry models. In
addition, the PI plans to carry out detailed simulations of the interannual
variability of the thermocline, mode waters and the Southern Ocean intermediate
waters and their ventilation to examine the interannual and decadal variability
of air-sea gas fluxes and atmospheric CO2.
