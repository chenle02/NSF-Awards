This three year study is concerned with theoretical aspects of basic solar wind
properties and their effects on cosmic rays. Such studies are important
analyzing the influence of highly energetic particles transmitted through the
interplanetary medium on the terrestrial environment. The investigation will
include studies of the large scale morphology of the interplanetary magnetic
field and plasma, with particular emphasis on the effect of the field's
structure on cosmic ray and energetic particle acceleration, propagation and
anisotropies. ***//
