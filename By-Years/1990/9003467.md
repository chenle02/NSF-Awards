The research involves the study of estimation in unbalanced multivariate
variance components models using an approach based on a Fenchel duality
formulation of the problem. The effort will be concentrated in estimation and
testing of covariance matrices in multivariate variance component models,
relating the results to appropriate fields of statistics, and studying rates of
convergence of the proposed algorithms. The multivariate random effects model
involves constraints that the covariance matrices of the random effects be
nonnegative definite which leads to a Lowner ordering of matrices. Algorithms
will be investigated find to the restricted maximum likelihood estimators of
such matrices.
