9418192 Derry An integrated stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical
study of thin but laterally persistent "cap carbonate" rocks that overlie each
of two main glacial units in the Neoproterozoic of Australia. The association of
such carbonate rocks with glacial deposits in the Neoproterozoic is now
recognized as a global phenomenon, and in many sections the glacial to post-
glacial transition appears to contemporaneity. The widespread association of
distinctive facies and pronounced 13C excursions that has been taken as evidence
for contemporaneity. The widespread association of distinctive facies and
pronounced 13C excursions argues for a genetic link, a link that has potentially
major implications for biological evolution and environmental change in
Neoproterozoic time, but which is not yet well understood.
