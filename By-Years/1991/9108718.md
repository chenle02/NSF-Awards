The CORF plays an essential role in defending the spectrum related interests of
the U.S. scientific community before national and international organizations
that deal with the allocation and efficient use of the radio spectrum. During
the past year the CORF filed comments before the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) on matters related to the upcoming World Administrative Radio
Conference (WARC-92), and spurious emissions and participation in the national
and international preparations for the WARC. The CORF, through it's liaison
member also participates in the work of the International Radio Consultative
Committee (CCIR). CCIR Reports and Recommendations provide the technical
underpinnings for the protection of radio astronomy from interference from
active radio services.
