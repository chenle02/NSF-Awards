All of computing today relies on an abstraction where software expects the
hardware to behave flawlessly for all inputs under all conditions. However, for
emerging circuits/devices, the cost of maintaining the abstraction of flawless
hardware will be prohibitive due to variations and we may need to rethink the
correctness contract between hardware and software. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The
primary focus of the project is application robustification ? fundamental
algorithmic methodologies to transform arbitrary applications such that they can
continue to make forward progress in spite of errors produced by the hardware.
In this project, our preliminary research effort is focused on a) techniques to
convert different classes of application kernels into robust, efficiently
solvable stochastic optimization problems that can tolerate hardware errors, b)
techniques based on Krylov subspace methods, gradient projection, quasi-Newton
approaches, stochastic approximation theory-based approaches, preconditioning
techniques, and intelligent step sizing to reduce the cost of robustness for
different forms of hardware variations, and c) low overhead checksum-based
techniques robustifying sparse linear algebra libraries and graph algorithms.
Broader impact of this project includes development of a potentially promising
approach to ride Moore's Law and training students in both the hardware and
software aspects of computing in face of errors. Broader education will also be
achieved through research artifacts (e.g., library of error tolerant kernels)
that will be made available for research and education.
