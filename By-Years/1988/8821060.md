The objective of this project is to devise and validate a transport model that
can be used to estimate the spatial variation of solute concentration and the
retardation of solute migrating through channels in a fractured porous medium.
Laboratory experiments will be conducted to determine the effects of both small
and large scale fracture aperture variations on the dispersion and retardation
of solute migrating through a channelized, fractured porous medium. Experiments
investigating small scale aperture variations will be analyzed to determine the
fluid flow and solute dispersion which arises from fluid migration through
regions of the fracture that subjected to a considerable degree of rock-to-rock
contact. Experiments assessing the effects of large scale aperture variations
will investigate the highly mobile flow channels which develop in a fractured
porous medium and provide a basis for estimating the mass transfer of solute
between highly mobile fracture channels and the less mobile areas within the
fractures. The results of these experiments will be combined with a theoretical
analysis of transport processes to estimate the dispersion and retardation of
solute migrating through channels in fractured rocks due to interactions with
low mobility fluids in the fracture and diffusion and adsorption of solute in
the rock matrix. The resulting solute transport model can then be used to
simulate contaminant migration in channelized, fractured media. This research is
likely to improve current models used in describing the process by which fluids
and solutes move through fractured porous media. This is of importance in
predicting the impact of pollutants from storage sites on groundwater quality.
