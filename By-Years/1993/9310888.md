The proposed research is in the area of ``machine learning,` with an emphasis
on the development of efficient algorithms of both practical and theoretical
interest. The problems investigated include: (a) learning in the presence of
noise (searching for learning linear-threshold and parity functions in the
presence of classification noise, and `hypothesis boosting` is possible in the
presence of classification noise); (b) exploration with obstacles (developing
efficient algorithms for exploring planar regions with obstacles and/or planar
graphs, with a view towards integrating these algorithms in larger navigation
systems); (c) coordinating experts/feature selection (developing effective
methods of combining the advice of a variety of experts/features for a given
problem); (d) autonomous learning of causal structures (exploring how active
learning can effectively learn a complex environment, such as a Macintosh window
system); (e) new models of active learning (refining the understanding of the
power and limitations of `membership queries` for learning); (f) learning and
biology (looking at a variety of inference problems motivated by problems in
molecular biology); and (g) teaching in different learning models (focusing on
algorithms for `effective teaching`).
