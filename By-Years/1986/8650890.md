The analysis of digital spectral data obtained by satellite and air- borne
scanners is being used to improve undergraduate education in earth science at
Whittier College. Recent technological improvements now permit image processing
using personal computers so that the digital data can be processed and displayed
on a television screen without the need for large computing facilities. The
digital images thus generated resemble aerial photographs of very large areas
and are of interest to earth scientists, land managers, policy makers, social
scientists, and others. The system is being used as a flexible tool which allows
students to manipulate the data to suit their particular interests. A new course
in the applications of remote sensing has been developed, aimed at science and
non-science majors, and modifications have been made in the laboratory work of
six lower- and upper-division courses. Through these several improvements and
new initiatives, students are being introduced to one of the most recent
techniques of data acquisition and analysis, thus faciliting their appreciation
of regional relationships, of the importance of spatial and space-time
perceptions, and of the connections between geology and other disciplines.
