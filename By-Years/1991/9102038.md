Professor Gutman is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the kinetics and thermochemistry of elementary
reactions involving polyatomic radicals of the second row elements and halogens
or hydrogen halides. Experimental techniques include the use of excimer laser
photolysis to produce the free radicals under controlled conditions and time-
resolved experiments to monitor reactants and products. The radicals to be
studied include halo- and perhalomethyls, oxygen containing radicals, nitrogen
centered radicals and unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals. Studies of reactions of
free radicals of the heavier elements, particularly radicals of silicon,
phosphorus, germanium, and arsenic are of particular interest because it is
likely that new chemical routes are open to radicals of these elements due to
their ability to be in higher valence states than carbon. %%% The objectives of
this research are to gain new fundamental knowledge of the kinetics and dynamics
of elementary reactions of polyatomic free radicals and to determine important
thermochemical properties of these species. The radicals to be studied in this
project are important to atmospheric chemistry and combustion; the halogenated
radicals are relevant to our search for replacements for the ozone-destroying
chlorofluorocarbons. An exciting part of the research is the study of the
chemistry of radicals of phosphorus, silicon, arsenic, and germanium which are
likely to be involved in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors. Chemical
vapor deposition is one of the primary techniques used for growing thin films
and coatings used in the semiconductor industry for the fabrication of
microelectronic devices.
