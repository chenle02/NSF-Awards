1 9403543 White The purpose of this research is to illuminate the origins of
magnetic anisotropy in ultra thin films and multilayers. The primary vehicle for
the investigation will be epitaxial Iron thin films and multilayers and
epitaxial Laves phase iron/terbium thin films, which will be grown by UHV
sputter deposition on single crystal substrates. The various contributions to
anisotropy in Iron thin films and multilayers will be isolated through control
of epitaxial strain by use of alloy or strained layer superlattice underlayers.
The Laves phase iron/terbium compounds are known to have enormous
magnetostriction coefficients, and we propose to capitalize on this to induce
large magnetic anisotropies through control of epitaxial strain. Finally we will
investigate the anisotropy induced by a regular array of steps by growing
magnetic films on vicinal surfaces. We see significant impact of these studies
on the technology of magnetic thin films for use in the information storage,
sensor, and actuator technologies. %%% This program will provide the fundamental
understanding of magnetic anisotropy which is an important characteristic of
films used in the information storage, sensor and actuator technologies. The
results of this program will be used by technologists working in these areas to
design and fabricate new materials with improved properties, allowing for higher
density recording, more sensitive sensors, and more efficient actuators. An
important feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials
and processing research. This research will contribute to improving the general
perform ance of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,
information processing, and tele communica tions. ***
