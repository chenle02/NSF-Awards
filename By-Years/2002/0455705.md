A fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the extent to which
different processes generate biological diversity. One of the most prominent
hypotheses to explain patterns of diversification is that of an arms race
between predators and their prey. The proposed study will determine the extent
to which arms races between crossbills (Loxia) and conifers have contributed to
the adaptive radiation of crossbills. These results will greatly advance our
understanding of how community context and resource characteristics affect the
geographic mosaic of coevolution, and thus provide the impetus for further
theoretical advances. Previously used techniques, including measures of
crossbill feeding rates and cone measurements, will be used to test predictions
concerning the types of changes in cone traits that should arise if crossbills
and squirrels have influenced cone structure, and to test whether crossbills
have adapted in a reciprocal manner to the changed cones. The results of these
tests will determine (1) how resource characteristics and competitor type affect
the form of the geographic mosaic for crossbills and conifers and (2) to what
extent arms races have contributed to the adaptive radiation of crossbills
