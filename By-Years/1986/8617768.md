Many naturally occurring macromolecules, and several synthetic polymers, exist
in their helical conformation. In synthetic polymers, unlike in their natural
analogs, the material consists of a mixture of equal quantities of right.handed
and left.handed helixes and, therefore, does not exhibit the property of optical
activity. This research has as its aim to synthesize and study the properties of
acetal polymers with helices predominantly or exclusively in one screw sense.
These polymers, like helical natural macromolecules, should be optically active.
The research will seek to identify the basic macromolecular structure related to
helicity, examine the influence of various side groups on the helix, and study
various polymerization mechanisms of initiation and propagation leading to
helicity in the products. These types of polymers are virtually unknown, and
this investigation should further extend our ability to synthesize polymers with
great structural precision and to relate their molecular structure to observed
properties of the bulk material.
