This is an International Travel Grant to support the Principal Investigator's
travel to and participation at a series of seminar meetings in Italy: "Italian
Seminars on Reinforced Masonry Structures", Naples, Ancona, Udine, and Vicenza,
Italy, October 7-12, 1991, CONZORSIO POROTON ITALIA in Vicenza. Participation at
the seminars will enable the Principal Investigator to present an invited paper
entitled "Recent Reinforced Masonry Shear Wall Research in the United States".
At the seminar series, the Principal Investigator will be presenting specific
results developed within the NSF sponsored and coordinated "TCCMAR Masonry
Research Program". This effort will also provide the opportunity to further
develop research cooperation between the U.S. and Italy in areas of advanced
technologies involving masonry construction and seismic design.
