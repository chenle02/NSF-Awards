9412381 Knauft / Wardlow This project involves the dissertation research of an
anthropology student from Emory University. The student will study the socio-
cultural repercussions of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in a tribal
society of Papua New Guinea. The project will focus on how women in this society
use this disease category to gain moral social status, by accusing men of
spreading the disease. Using in-depth interviews with two samples of women, 50
who reported STD and 50 women who have not, the project will analyze women's
choices, rhetoric, and social status. In addition the project will analyze data
from records of clinics on the prevalence of STDs. This research is important
because it will provide a valuable case study of the impact of STDs on a tribal
population. By studying the variations in how diseases impact on women's lives
and how women use the existence of STDs to negotiate for more autonomy and
social status, the project will advance our understanding of gender relations in
traditional societies and of the cultural interpretations of STDs. Improvements
in our knowledge of how people interpret the meaning of STDs is a necessary step
towards designing interventions that work to control the diseases.
