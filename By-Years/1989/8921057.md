This three-day conference will explore the ethics, values and interests behind
technology-in-the-making. Researchers from the United States and Western Europe
will focus their attention on the cultural, political, economic and technical
factors that shape choices to develop some scientific and technological
possibilities but to ignore or suppress others. Presenters will provide case
studies of particular scientific and technological developments, and encourage
comparisons and contrasts of these changes in different national settings and
technological sectors (manufacturing, information, military, domestic,
reproductive, scientific). These comparisons should allow for informed
reassessments to several models of scientific and technological choice: from
"technological determinism," where the logic of technical efficiency and
rationality are thought to guide choices that, once made and implemented, have
diverse consequences for society, to the more voluntaristic "social
constructivism," where ethical, political, organizational and economic factors
are thought to be embedded in these choices. These theoretical issues are at the
core of social studies of science and technology today, and this conference
brings key contributors together in an American setting for the first time. A
published volume of the proceedings will result. This project allows a highly
qualified group of researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds in the
United States and Europe to address theoretical issues in science and technology
studies by considering cross-cultural cases of scientific and technological
developments. The principal investigators and conference participants are well
qualified; institutional support is very good. A volume of general interest to
the field will result. The budget request is modest. Support is recommended.
