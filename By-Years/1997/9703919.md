This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
new instrument for evaluation of geologic formations at the drill bit in oil and
gas drilling operations. Radioactive measurement while-drilling (MWD)
instruments are currently in use for measuring formation porosity and density.
However, these have limited capabilities and use active radioactive elements.
This research will develop an electrical neutron/x-ray (N/X) instrument, which
may replace existing radioactive tools. The new instrument is novel in offering:
(1) improved measurement capabilities; (2) lower life-cycle costs; and (3)
greatly reduced safety and environmental risks. Phase II will develop a
laboratory prototype MWD N/X instrument integrated into a 6.75 inch diameter
drill collar. Phase II will conduct: (1) preliminary instrument design; (2)
component development; (3) N/X instrument final design, construction, and
testing (including measurement of neutron and x-ray outputs, response to
simulated formations, testing at high temperatures, and shock and vibration
tests); and (4) experimental evaluation in calibration boreholes at facilities
of Sperry-Sun Drilling Services in Houston, TX. Potential commercial application
of the instrument is expected in low-risk, low-cost MWD operations during oil
and gas borehole drilling.
