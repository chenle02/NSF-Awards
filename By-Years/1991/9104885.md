The melting curves of earth materials places important constraints upon the
dynamic state of our planet. The PI will accurately measure the melting curves
of several geophysically important materials to 100 GPa. The experiments will
involve the use of a laser heating system (already developed) that is capable of
stabilizing and controlling the temperature of the sample to better than one
percent. Past work has indicated the importance of the wavelength dependent
emissivity in determining the temperature using spectral radiometry. The
measurements will include the measurement of the wavelength dependence of the
sample at high temperatures and pressures.
