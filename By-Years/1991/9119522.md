The Federation of American Research Networks (FARNET) will initiate
collaborative programs among mid-level networks aimed at enhancing the national
networking infrastructure, extending the breadth of NSFNET participation,
increasing the usefulness of network connectivity, and providing information for
management and development of the national networking program. The requested
support will permit the assignment of professional management and staff
resources to implement these programs so that the efforts of the regional and
other midlevel network participants can be coordinated.
