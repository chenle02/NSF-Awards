The principal investigator will study the interaction between basaltic magma and
the crust. In particular, he will investigate the possibility that partial
melting of both continental and young mafic rocks as a result of this
interaction coupled with subsequent fractionation during ascent, may be the
dominant processes whereby evolved rocks are generated and magmatism sustained.
This work will utilize properly scaled laboratory experiments, numerical
simulations, and linear stability analysis of the onset of convection to help
geologists better understand processes responsible for the generation of igneous
rocks.
