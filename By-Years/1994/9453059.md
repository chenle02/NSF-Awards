9550710 Miller The primary goal of this RIMI proposal is increased entry and
retention of minorities into the environmental engineering program at Wayne
State University (WSU). The project proposes combining existing research
strengths in modeling and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination
within the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Chemical
Engineering (ChE) in order to reach this goal. Faculty from these Departments
will combine efforts to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to the problem of
soil and water pollution from ruptured or leaking waste containment systems. The
scope of the research is purposely broad, in order to involve the minority
students/researchers in a number of focuses research areas, each relating
directly to pollution resulting from land-based waste containment systems. The
WSU research experience will be enhanced through a summer internship program at
The University of Michigan. In addition, industrial internships will be used to
increase the number of minorities impacted by this program. Such practical
research training will significantly increase student retention in this program.
