This research effort will characterize the composition of household solid wastes
in terms of their potential for contamination of groundwater when placed in
landfills, and in reducing or eliminating that potential by design of
appropriate collection and management procedures. Prior work conducted by the
investigator established procedures for field sampling and statistical
correlation of data from household sources for a determination of information
regarding nutrition, interview survey bias,resource conservation and recycling,
market research and solid waste management. In this project, the investigator
plans to extend this method to include issues in household solid waste
management that relate to their potential for contamination of groundwaater.
