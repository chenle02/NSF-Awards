AST-0307714&lt;br/&gt;Tyson&lt;br/&gt;The Deep Lens Survey (DLS) is a deep
multi-band imaging survey of seven, four-square-degree fields, with all data
made public. The primary scientific driver is weak gravitational lensing, but
the survey also enables other investigations, such as optical transient
phenomena, whose existence is publicized within about an hour of the
observation. It allows the definition of mass-selected clusters of galaxies and
of mass concentrations in three dimensions, and the final combination of cosmic
shear and cluster counting will place sharp limits on cosmological parameters,
and is complementary to other probes. The DLS is the first NOAO Survey to
release both images and calibrated photometric catalogs, is 70% complete, and so
far has been largely privately funded. This specific public support is for
otherwise un-funded team members to complete the Survey and release the final
products, building on the progress so far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms
developed for the DLS have wider applicability, and the released data products
are already in use for both formal and informal education at several levels,
including high schools and museums. The DLS is also a useful learning tool for
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a priority in the decadal survey report
summarizing the astronomical community's consensus of priorities.&lt;br/&gt;***
