This project will provide support for shipboard scientific support equipment
for the NSF.owned research vessels WECOMA, OCEANUS and ENDEAVOR which are
dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to
the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides
support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such
as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of
research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and
satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other
equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from
data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Kennard Palfrey is fully qualified
to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. The project will allow the
institution to acquire a ship.set of spare parts for the bow thruster on the
WECOMA. The spares will be housed at the Oregon State University in preparation
for use as required for the WECOMA or its two sister ships, the OCEANUS and
ENDEAVOR.
