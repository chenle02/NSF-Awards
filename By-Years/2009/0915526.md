Proposal Number: 0915526&lt;br/&gt;Title: T2T: A Framework for Amplifying
Testing Resources&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Sebastian Elbaum and Matthew
Dwyer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtually every
software development company invests in the &lt;br/&gt;construction and
maintenance of testing resources to validate their &lt;br/&gt;products. These
investments, however, can be very costly. &lt;br/&gt;Consequently, not all
testing resources are supported equally as &lt;br/&gt;companies focus their
testing efforts on specific and limited types of &lt;br/&gt;tests, ultimately
sacrificing timely fault detection. The work proposed will address this problem
by investigating strategies for amplifying the power and applicability of
testing resources. The strategies will transform existing tests into new tests
that add complementary testing capabilities to the validation process. The
developed strategies will be unique in their treatment of tests as data. This
will require the development of test representations that can be efficiently
manipulated, and test transformations to realize operations that generate new
and valuable tests. Test representations that are expressive enough to
efficiently encode common forms of software tests will be developed, and
transformations that operate both on and across different test representations
will be explored. These test representations and transformations will constitute
the T2T (test to test) framework and the initial step towards treating tests as
data. If successful, this work will help software development companies lower
product costs and enhance dependability by amplifying their existing testing
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
