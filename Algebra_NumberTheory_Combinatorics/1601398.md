Number theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of the
integers. Two of the fundamental objects considered in this research project are
prime numbers and polynomial equations with integer solutions, both of which
play a central role in cryptography. A theme of modern mathematics is to
consider a family of related questions and to understand how the solution
changes as the question varies within the family, with an eye toward revealing
the structure underlying any individual question. In number theory, the families
are typically discrete -- there is no way to continuously turn one integer into
another without leaving the integers -- but one may take a broad view and ask
about the proportion of questions or objects satisfying a certain property; this
is the viewpoint of the subfield of number theory known as arithmetic
statistics. This project will explore various questions within arithmetic
statistics and number theory in general, often from different angles, with the
goal being to see the extent to which these different approaches complement and
inform each other.

More specifically, the key objects of consideration are primes, L-functions,
number fields, and elliptic curves. This project will study the growth of the
average size of Selmer groups of elliptic curves with level structure using
tools from the geometry of numbers as developed by Bhargava. It will consider
quadratic twists of elliptic curves, in particular the extent to which analytic
and algebraic non-vanishing results can be intersected, and it will consider
similar problems for twists of elliptic curves by nonabelian number fields. It
will also study the distribution of values of Artin L-functions, obtaining
applications to class numbers, extreme value problems, and geometry.
