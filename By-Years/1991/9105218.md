This project will defray part of the publication costs for the Proceedings of a
Symposium on Myelin held in Columbia, Missouri in October 1990. Myelin provides
an insulating sheath around nerve fibers and its integrity is essential for
proper nerve function. Participants in the Symposium discussed aspects of myelin
development and regeneration. Publication of the Proceedings of the meeting will
provide neuroscientists worldwide with an up-to-date appraisal of the research
being done on this important constituent of the nervous system.
