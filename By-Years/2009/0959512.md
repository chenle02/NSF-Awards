Abstract &lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major
Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award provides funds
to support the acquisition of a Zeiss PALM MicroBeam IV Laser Microdissection
Pressure Catapulting System (LMPCS) that enables and enhances life sciences
research at North Dakota State University (NDSU). Research to answer basic
science queries ranging from high-resolution gene mapping of polyploid species
to the intricacies of biocompatibility between cells and engineered matrix will
benefit from this acquisition. The new LMPCS system also improves the training
of graduate students and postdoctoral associates through access to state-of-the-
art technology. NDSU is a Land Grant institution that integrates research with
education in an array of doctoral and Master's degree disciplines, including
biology, biomaterials, cellular and molecular biology, microbiology, immunology,
pathogenesis, pathology, physiology, reproduction, and others. Additionally,
undergraduate and high school students are provided the opportunity to engage in
research at NDSU, and will have access to the LMPCS. The microdissection
technology lends itself to educational efforts and will be valuable for use in
didactic laboratory courses, as well as demonstration in research theory courses
and regional outreach workshops. Results from these studies will be disseminated
by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and
through publication in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;br/&gt;
