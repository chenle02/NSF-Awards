This project will measure the shape of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
(CMBR) at four frequencies, 1.5 GHz, 3.7 GHz, 10 GHz, and 90 GHz. Deviations
from a blackbody spectrum have been reported, which if confirmed would alter our
view of how the universe was formed. The South Pole is the best site for this
measurement due to the extremly cold, and therefore dry, atmosphere, and the
ability of the instruments to view one portion of the sky continuously through a
constant thickness of the atmosphere. It is also the quietest spot on earth for
the radio frequencies chosen. The project will also make quantitative
measurements of atmospheric noise that will be of great value for future
investigators.
