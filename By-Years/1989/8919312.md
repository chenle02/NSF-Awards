In the design and manufacturing of VLSI systems, practical problems are often
characterized by fixed parameter instances. For example, such a parameter may
represent the number of tracks permitted on a chip or the load capacity of a
communications link. By fixing such parameters, attention can be focused on the
physically realizable nature of the system rather than abstract aspects.
Research is concentrated on fixed-parameter algorithmic and combinatorial
problems of IC design. Powerful and, in some cases, emergent techniques from the
fields of complexity theory, graph theory, well-partial-order theory, and
algebraic coding theory are being used in considering such pragmatic issues as
circuit layout, arrangement, embedding, and routing. A second thrust is the
general problem of organizing and utilizing large collections of processors
working in concert. Thus problems of system organization, utilization, mapping,
and emulation are being addressed. The proposed research is on IC design theory,
and is important to our understanding of the IC design process and methodology.
The Principal Investigators are recognized as expert researchers in this area,
have a history of novel ideas, and the potential to continue producing good
research. They have done outstanding research during the first two years of the
grant. This has resulted in fifteen papers published in the archival literature
(refereed journals), ten being refereed, and many in conference proceedings and
books. RESULT FROM PRIOR NSF SUPPORT Reviewers were uniformly very positive
about the results from prior NSF support. They said the research results were of
quality and had already made an impact on the IC theory community. It is clear
that the prior support permitted development of the ideas leading to this
proposal.
