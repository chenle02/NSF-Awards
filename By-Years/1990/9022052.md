This project will study crack propagation in articular cartilage in the
underlying bone of joints using both analytical and experimental techniques.
Finite element analytical models, using layers of two different materials, will
be constructed to study the parameters that influence the fracture process. The
experiments will be used to verify the theoretical predictions and to determine
the morphology of impact-induced cracks in osteoarthritic animals. The work is
expected to provide new basic information on the load bearing capability of
layered soft materials. The eventual benefit will be a new understanding of
fracture in joints, and in using this new knowledge to design novel impact
resistant materials.
