The Pacific Coast Irises are a group of eleven closely related plant species.
That many species pairs form fertile hybrids in the wild makes them an ideal
system for the study of speciation. This is a proposal to study three of the
naturally occurring hybrid zones, analyzing at least eight characters per hybrid
zone, to see (1) if the character's frequency distributions coincide, and (2) if
these distributions are concordant along transects within and between hybrid
zones. To complement these studies of patterns of variation, the following
potential barriers to gene flow will be examined: habitat association, flowering
time, dispersal rate and the fitness of hybrids. The hybrid zone studies will be
placed in the context of a phylogeny of the entire group of irises, relying on
cladistic analysis of morphological and molecular (cpDNA, rDNA, allozymes)
characters.
