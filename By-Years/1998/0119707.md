This project is to build the institutional capacity and partnerships needed to
develop a full center for teaching and learning at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham. A full center as it is envisioned will focus on issues of importance
for teaching middle school science and mathematics in an urban setting. Included
are such issues as the recruitment of second career professionals, upgrading the
knowledge and skills of existing teachers through improved professional
development programs, learning how to take advantage of the abundant resources
of informal science institutions that tend to be located in urban settings, and
improving the undergraduate preparation of science and math teachers. During
this developmental project relationships will be developed with business,
industry, the military and other sources of second-career teachers; a program
will be developed to provide high school students with opportunities to teach
science and mathematics to younger students; a leadership training program will
be established to begin building the capacity to provide professional
development to the teachers of Birmingham; and relationships will be developed
with the McWane Science Center, existing outreach programs at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham, and the Birmingham Public Schools.
