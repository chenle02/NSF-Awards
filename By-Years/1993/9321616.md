9321616 Stuessy The ornamental peonies and their wild relatives, placed in the
isolated genus Paeonia, have fascinated and puzzled botanists for many years.
Combining primitive and advanced morphological features, peonies have been
related phylogenetically to numerous disparate groups of dicots but their
evolutionary relationships remain unresolved. Under the direction of faculty
adviser Dr. Tod Stuessy at Ohio State University, graduate student Tao Sang is
conducting extensive field work in both the New and Old Worlds to amass
materials for detailed morphological and DNA-based analyses of the ca. 30
species in the genus. New molecular data from chloroplast DNA and nuclear
ribosomal DNA promise to yield robust characters for phylogenetic inference. In
turn, a rigorously grounded phylogeny from morphological and molecular evidence
will permit the analysis of intriguing disjunct geographical ranges in the
present distribution of peonies in the northern hemisphere. New molecular and
morphological evidence will be collected to study the phylogeny and biogeography
of Paeonia, a fascinating group of widely distributed shrubs, with ornamental
and medicinal properties.
