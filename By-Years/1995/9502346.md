This proposal has two components, a research proposal and an education plan. The
objective of the research program is to develop innovative concepts and
technologies to fabricate long wavelength (1.3/1.55 micron) vertical-cavity
surface- emitting lasers (VC-SELs) and WDM surface emitting laser arrays for
communication, interconnect, and signal processing. The VC-SELs developed in
this program are expected to outperform the existing devices in terms of
threshold current and spectral purity. Above all, the VC-SELs should have a
substantial cost advantage over conventional single mode DFB and DBR lasers. The
goal of the proposers education plan is to educate future university teachers,
to educate capable and conscientious engineers who can contribute to the advance
of sciences and technologies, and to cultivate engineers who can educate
themselves to fit in the ever changing, increasingly challenging work
environment. Two other important aspects in his education plan are in the
improvement of minority and pre-college science education.
