9260109 Akcakaya The main goal of this project is to produce software that will
combine a geographic information system (GIS), which analyzes and predicts
changes in the structure of a species' habitat, with a population model that
estimates the extinction risk of the species that utilizes the habitat. The
software will enable realistic estimates for the purposes of environmental
impact assessment and conservation biology activities. Examples of areas where
such estimates are important include assessment of the impact of human
activities, such as forestry practices, road building, agricultural expansion,
and dam construction, on the fate of endangered and threatened species; optimum
design of nature reserves (the selection of habitats that will maximize the
survival chance of a particular species); and the optimal choice of wildlife
management practices (such as reintroductions and translocations). The research
will involve development of algorithms to produce, export and interpret habitat
maps, programs to predict future suitability of habitats for particular species
due to changes in land-use patterns, and software for building population models
for species that live in multiple patches that change through time, such as in
fragmented habitats. ***
