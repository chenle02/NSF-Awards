This award will help to fund a conference entitled Conference on Coding Theory,
Design Theory, and Group Theory. The conference will be held from September 13
through September 18, 1990 on the campus of the University of Vermont in
Burlington, Vermont. This conference will bring together the leading
mathematical scientists in the fields mentioned in the title to discuss
mathematics at the forefront of these subjects with a wide group of
participants. These fields have frequently benefitted from a cross-fertilization
of ideas and techniques, so the effect of this interdisciplinary conference
should lead to new advances in the respective fields. The keynote speakers are
J. Conway, J. Thompson, and S. Praeger.
