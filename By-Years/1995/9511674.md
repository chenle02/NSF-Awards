9511674 Northmore The processing of information by neurons in the brain depends
upon their ability to respond discriminatively to the multitude of signals
impinging upon them from sense organs and other neurons. The most important
component of a neuron for this function is the branched dendritic tree that
collects signals at numerous synapses distributed over its surface membrane. In
previous work, silicon microcircuits were developed that modeled neurons with
extensively branched dendrites with simple, passive properties. These electronic
neurons successfully discriminate particular patterns of input when delivered to
the appropriate synapses. The proposed research will build into the dendrites
active mechanisms capable of local amplification of signals. This will be
achieved by mimicking certain chemical- and voltage-dependent processes
occurring at synapses in biological neurons, processes that are thought to be
the basis for learning. As more accurate models, these circuits will improve our
understanding of information processing by neurons, both individually and in
networks. They will also result in artificial neurons of greater processing
power that could be harnessed for robotics. ***
