Heterogeneous reactions have been found to be of crucial importance to various
processes and phenomena in the atmosphere, such as the Antarctic ozone hole.
Currently, there is increasing interest in the role of heterogeneous reactions
in tropospheric chemistry. A unique experimental apparatus will be developed to
study the interaction of particles with gases under conditions simulating
atmospheric conditions. The apparatus will consist of: (1) a system capable of
generating particles of known size distribution, number density, and
composition; (2) a reaction chamber, which can be run in either a static or a
dynamic mode, with temperature and pressure control; (3) an atmospheric pressure
ionization mass spectrometer for measurement of a variety of gases at levels
down to about 1 ppb; and (4) a long pathlength Fourier-transform Infrared
Spectrometer to follow some aspects of particle composition in real time.
Furthermore, incorporated into this new state-of-the-art system will be the
capability of collecting particles for post-reaction analysis using a wide
variety of analytical techniques available in the laboratory. Initial studies
will focus on the interactions of sea salt particles with oxides of nitrogen,
the subject of ongoing research and increasing international interest. Also,
other reactions of atmospheric interest will be studied, including those of
alumina particles emitted by solid fuel rockets. The mass spectrometer component
will provide an important and unique analytical tool for probing experimental
protocols or the sampling and analysis of a variety of species in ongoing
tropospheric and stratospheric field campaigns. This system will play a role in
expanding graduate programs in atmospheric chemistry at the University of
California, Irvine.***
