The EESIER Project provides thirty rising high school sophomores and juniors
with the opportunity to do research at the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods
Hole, MA). The research projects are interdisciplinary in nature and will focus
on the physicochemical and biological characteristics of a salt marsh and a
small ocean cove. The research activities are complemented by training in
writing and reading scientific literature, the use of a research library, and
statistics. Students will also participate in a lecture-discussion series on the
history, philosophy, and ethics of science. The academic program is balanced by
career counseling workshops offered by admissions personnel and faculty from
undergraduate and graduate programs. The three-week residential project is
sponsored by the Simon's Rock College Institute for the Teaching of Mathematics
and Science and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). The first week is spent
at Simon's Rock. Activities include an orientation period and intensive
workshops in the fundamentals of interdisciplinary approaches to research,
experimental design, statistics, writing and reading scientific literature, and
a lecture-discussion program on the history of science. The second and third
week are spent at Woods Hole. Activities include two major research projects,
continued training in statistics, training in the use of library resources,
intensive writing workshops, and a lecture series on the philosophy and ethics
of science. Career counseling seminars or activities are scheduled for all three
weeks of the program.
