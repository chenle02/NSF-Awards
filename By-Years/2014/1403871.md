DNA molecules are building blocks of the genetic code and are detected
frequently to diagnose a range of diseases from cancer to infections.
Understanding of how DNA organizes on the surface of the biosensor is important
in order to develop better, more sensitive and specific diagnostic assays. This
project will gain such understanding through a combination of theory and
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;This project
will combine experimental and theoretical efforts to study interactions of DNA
helices with gold nanoparticles. Nanoparticles emerge as promising new tools for
experimental biology and nanomedicine because of the unusual surface chemistry
and effect of shape at the nanoscale on the nanoparticle-DNA interactions. This
collaborative project is designed to fill the existing void of data by combining
experimental spectroscopic and biophysical studies with atomistic-level
theoretical simulations. Specific efforts will be applied to systematic
investigation of the effects of surface chemistry, DNA sequence, and presence of
ions on DNA-nanoparticle interactions and binding. The experimental studies will
provide an essential feedback for the theoretical models. Taken together, these
studies will provide fundamental knowledge of DNA-nano-interface thus, enabling
further development of nano-biosensors, DNA-based materials, and novel
approaches for gene therapy, ultimately, contributing to improving quality of
life.
