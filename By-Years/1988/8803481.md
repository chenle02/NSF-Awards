The research will begin by examining more than six existing implementations of
design paradigms to isolate and specify the primitive design elements provided
in each. These sets will then be abstracted mathematically to determine their
functional behavior. Function in this context is defined as the controlled
application of power. The input/output characteristics produced will be proven
general within a domain to be determined. An algorithm will be sought for
construction of functional topologies from functional specifications, and the
problem of mapping the elements of such functional topologies onto real design
components will be considered. Several large ancillary problems will be
approached, including the potentials for domain-independent automatic design.
The goal is a method for rigorously examining functional design, providing an
underlying basis for application of existing abstract theories of design. Such a
basis will have the benefit of theoretical soundness, free from the ad hoc
empiricism of existing approaches. A basis for writing and proving theorems in
and about design and designs will be formed.
