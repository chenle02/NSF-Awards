Non-linearities abound in any complex biomechanical simulation. As a human hand
folds into a fist, non-linear contact and material forces give rise to
characteristic bulges and folds. As red blood cells crowd down a capillary,
advection and contact non-linearities cause them to bump and twirl. These
essential dynamics are also the main computational challenges in a simulation.

This project investigates the efficient simulation of these and other
biomechanical non-linearities. It specifically investigates projected physics
methods, also known as model reduction methods, which have been known to
accelerate simulations by multiple orders of magnitude, but also have trouble
incorporating arbitrary non-linearities. The research team explores a variety of
promising approaches, including multidimensional cubature, exponential
integrators, and vector partitioning. Source code is routinely released into the
public domain.

The project is driven by two main applications. The first is high-quality,
virtual humans, which can be used in surgical simulation and training, as well
as visual media. The second is simulating flexible micro-particles in blood
flow, which assists in designing effective shapes that deliver radiation
payloads to cancer sites. The visual results of this research are highly
accessible to non-specialists, so they are packaged into a publicly available
app that is used to engage undergraduate researchers, and used during high
school outreach to encourage involvement in science and engineering.
