The research is aimed at gaining fundamental understanding of non- steady-state
reactive and transport processes. Most chemical and physicochemical processes
are designed, operated and controlled at steady-state conditions. This work will
capitalize on the instabilities during dynamic behavior to study: the
identification and discrimination of reaction mechanisms; the potential increase
of time- averaged process yields under oscillatory conditions; and the
justification and improvement of phenomenological relations through first
principles modeling. The work will include the development, implementation and
testing of new algorithms for the study of dynamic phenomena that have not so
far been systematically studied or understood.
