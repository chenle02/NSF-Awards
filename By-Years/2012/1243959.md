Intellectual Merit. Plant cells employ a cytoskeletal microtubule (MT)-based
apparatus called the phragmoplast to execute cytokinesis during cell division.
In the phragmoplast, MTs polymerize toward the division site and are organized
perpendicularly to the division plane. Vesicles are transported along these MTs
and fuse to give rise to a new cell wall/plate. Concomitant with cell plate
assembly, the phragmoplast MT array expands outward toward the parental
membrane. Although this process is superficially well described, very little
mechanistic detail is known on how it occurs. In this project, the research team
aims to understand how phragmoplast MTs are assembled and reorganized during
cytokinesis, and will use Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system. The work is
focused on revealing an interactive protein network that acts in the
phragmoplast midzone, including participation of spindle checkpoint proteins, MT
crosslinkers, and kinesin motor proteins. Planned experiments will combine high-
resolution live cell imaging, biochemical proteomics, and mutation analyses.
Novelty here lies in development of a paradigm-shifting model for phragmoplast
expansion, for which the PI has solid preliminary data support.

Broader Impact. The phragmoplast mechanism first appeared in advanced green
algae and is considered to be an evolutionary landmark associated with the
development of land plants. Details of its working mechanism are considered
critical to understand plant evolution. Besides sharing knowledge of diverse
mechanisms of cytokinesis with cell biology students, the PI will actively
recruit undergraduates to participate in the designed experiments. The students
will not only receive hands-on laboratory training in biochemistry, cell
biology, and genetics, they will also build competitiveness through bench
research, and oral and written presentations of their discoveries. The
importance of the basic plant biology research will be advocated to local high
school students to spark their interest in biology and encourage them to seek
science-oriented careers.
