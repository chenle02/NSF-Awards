During the last year Scripps Institution of Oceanography has been involved with
SeaSpace, Inc. to install and maintain a weather satellite image receive and
display system in Antarctica and at the Scripps campus. The system was
successfully installed and is fully operational. The system serves two purposes,
1) provides the only real.time imagery of the Antarctic continent for flight
forecasting and 2) records the imagery along with other embedded atmospheric
data sets for play back and analysis by the science community. This proposal
seeks to upgrade the computer systems in McMurdo to reduce processing time, set
up a science work station in Antarctica and to continue operations and
maintenance of the systems including data archive and display for investigators
interested in these data sets.
