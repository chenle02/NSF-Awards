CTS-9710956 John J. McGrath Michigan State University ABSTRACT This is a GOALI
proposal for collaborative research between the Principal Investigator (PI) and
Ford Motor Company. The theme of the proposed work centers on developing a
capability to analyze fogging and defogging problems. The PI plans to spend the
fall semester of his upcoming sabbatical leave to conduct a coordinated
numerical and experimental program at Ford and at Michigan State University
(MSU). Experiments performed at MSU will provide data for examining and
improving Ford's in-house computer software for simulating forced convection
with condensation. Ford and MSU have committed resources to develop the
experimental facility at MSU.
