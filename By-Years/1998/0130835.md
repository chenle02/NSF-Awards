With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma - Norman will
acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: a) studies of nitrosyl and nitroso metalloporphyrins;
b) the synthesis and characterization of group 13 organometallic compounds; c)
the reactivity and synthetic utility of organotransition metal complexes; d)
fast ion transport in solids; and e) synthetic bioinorganic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including the
preparation of more efficient catalysts and biochemistry. In addition, this CCD-
equipped single crystal diffractometer will be the first instrument of its kind
to be available in the state of Oklahoma, and will be used as a state resource
for serving the needs of nearby institutions including several small regional
colleges.
