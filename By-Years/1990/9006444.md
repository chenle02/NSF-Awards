This research is on compiled simulation of IC designs. Topics explored are: (1)
purely compiled methods for unit-delay and multi- delay simulation, (2) event-
driven compiled simulation for multi- delay and nominal-delay simulation, and
(3) hierarchal incremental compilation to reduce recompilation time. Existing
techniques for purely compiled unit-delay simulation are being and extended to
handle cyclic circuits. These techniques are also being used as a basis for
creating a purely compiled multi-delay simulator. Techniques for zero-delay,
event-driven, compiles simulation are being adapted to multi-delay and nominal-
delay simulation. Finally, techniques for hierarchical compiled simulation are
being extended to handle cyclic circuits, and are being adapted to perform
compile-time partitioning of sub-circuits.
