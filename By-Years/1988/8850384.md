The Center for the Liberal Arts, in cooperation with the department of
Chemistry at the University of Virginia, plans a live statewide televised course
for an estimated 300 high school teachers of chemistry on fourteen Saturdays
from January to May l989, and a similar course for eigth grade physical science
teachers in l990. The long range goal of this project is to increase the
scientific literacy among students in Virginia schools through the increased
science knowledge and heightened instructional and career awareness of their
teachers. Modelled after a successful and innovative physics course broadcoast
in l987, these courses will address the needs of the teachers for a sense of
competence in subject matter, updated information in their field, mastery of
demonstration methods and communication with other practitioners of their
discipline. Entitled "The Chemical Web of Life on Planet Earth", the chemistry
course will provide three hours of graduate credit, suitable for recertification
purposes. The course will stress the dependence of terrestrial life on
fundamental chemical processes, the syllabus will be based on responses to a
needs assessment of the participating teachers. Activities will include lecture,
demonstrations, video tours of active research laboratories and discussion with
leaders in their fields. Teachers will meet in one of seven classrooms near
their homes, where they will receive guidance from college-level instructors and
interact with the lecturer and other participants through open microphones on
their desks. During each three-hour session, one hour will be allotted to
activities in the local classroom, where teacher will work cooperatively on
problems related to the lectures and plan strategies for translating course
content to their own classrooms. This should provide the opportunities for
teacher networks to be established in very feasible geographical regions, as
well as to provide access to the the university level staff. The interactive
mode of this model has proven to be successful in the previous physics course.
Outside funding from the University, industry and schools represents about a 10%
ratio of the requested grant.
