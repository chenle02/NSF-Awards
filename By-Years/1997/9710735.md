9710735 Stanton This project is concerned with the design of precast concrete
structural systems for seismic regions. Three linked studies are by separate
groups, covering the design, laboratory testing and analysis of a large scale
precast concrete structure. This project addresses the design, the University of
California at San Diego is conducting large-scale testing and Lehigh University
plans to perform a program of analysis. The overall goals of the complete
testing program are to: o provide design recommendations for precast concrete
seismic framing systems, o demonstrate that seismic performance suitable for the
most severe seismic regions can be provided by precast concrete framing systems,
o use the complete superassemblage of precast elements to investigate features
of behavior that are not induced in the statically determinate bean-column
connection specimens that have been tested to date. The tasks in the study cover
the design of the test structure, limited comparisons of measured and predicted
behavior and drafting of the final design recommendations. The testing program
will provide the final steps needed to equip engineers and code-writers with the
information that they need to formalize suitable design rules and to permit this
form of construction. Significant benefits will accrue. The primary ones are
that excellent seismic performance will be demonstrated to be available from
precast concrete and that design rules suitable for inclusion in a code will be
developed. At a time when steel moment frames have, in their traditional form,
been found wanting in seismic resistance, designers have few options in choosing
a framing system. Development of a viable alternative has the potential for
broadening the range of design alternatives, improving performance and reducing
construction time and cost. ***
