This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State
University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The
request includes six items listed by priority: 1) Data Acquisition Network
Update 2) MK21 USB DAQ System 3) Ultarpure Water Purification System 4)
Meteorological Sensor Enhancement 5) Spectrum Analyzer 6) Backup 12 KHz
Transducer

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The
improvements to both the R/V Wecoma and the NORCOR facility will insure state-
of-the-art operation of both these shared use facilities.
