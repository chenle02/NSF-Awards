Abstract EEC-96-27233, National Society of Professional Engineers, Russell C.
Jones, Principal Investigator This award provides funding to the National
Society of Professional Engineers to help support the 1996,1997, and 1998,
National Engineers Week/Discover E : Reaching Out to the Next Generation of
Engineers Programs. National Engineers Week is a public outreach program
conducted by the U.S. engineering community . Over the last forty years, it has
evolved into a popular and highly visible program with a special emphasis on
student outreach activities. Understanding that young people can develop
positive attitudes about the scientific and technical professions if approached
creatively, the National Engineers Wekk Committee has developed a stimulating
program called Discover E . The National Engineers Week Committee provides print
and audio-visual materials to engineers participating in Discover E Teach-ins
and other public outreach activities. Discover E: engineers share a common
desire: to help grade school and high school students discover the exciting
world of engineering and technology. Their goal is to help students and teachers
realize the practical appplications that math, science, and engineering have to
the world around them.
