9313437 Newell The Science and Technology Division of Shaw University is housed
in Roberts Science Hall which was constructed in 1924. Shaw University is an
Historically Black University with a strong tradition of preparing minority
students through research training for graduate school in the sciences. The
faculty's commitment to engaging students in their research programs is hampered
by the lack of suitable laboratory environments. The building was recently
remodeled (new windows, paint, and flooring) but its electrical, ventilating,
heating, cooling, and plumbing systems are inadequate for research and research
training purposes. The University plans to renovate the building to address
these problems, and to add modifications that will make the building accessible
to persons with disabilities. The renovation of Roberts Science Hall will have
several important effects: 1) enabling faculty research in a number of
scientific disciplines; 2) creating safe and suitable environments for research
instruments; 3) supporting research training as a part of the undergraduate
curriculum; 4) promoting student-faculty research collaboration; and 5)
attracting minority students into careers in science and engineering. ***
