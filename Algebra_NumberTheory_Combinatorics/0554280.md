This project addresses the geometry of spaces of rational curves on smooth
projective varieties, with a view toward understanding the structure of rational
points for varieties defined over function fields. Consider a rationally-
connected variety: Which homology classes contain free rational curves? Very
free rational curves? Is the space of such curves connected? Irreducible?
Rationally connected? Of general type? Is there a workable notion of `rational
simple connectedness' and is this a birational property? How can we distinguish
unirational varieties as a subclass of rationally-connected varieties? These
questions are related to fundamental problems in Diophantine geometry over
function fields: Does a rationally-connected variety over C(t) satisfy weak
approximation? Can the hypothesis of the Tsen/Lang Theorem over C(s,t) be
formulated geometrically? For rationally-connected varieties over C(s,t), to
what extent do cohomological obstructions govern the existence of rational
points?

This award will support research on systems of polynomial equations with
coefficents varying in parameters. Our goal is to solve these equations with
rational functions that depend on these parameters. The case of a single
equation (or of several independent equations) was addressed in the mid 20th
century; the feasibility of finding a solution depends on the degree of the
equation, the number of free variables, and the number of varying parameters.
Recently, a comprehensive geometric approach was developed when there is just
one varying parameter. However, for multiple (not necessarily independent)
equations in two varying parameters much remains to be understood. This work
will also have broader impacts on the education of graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows, the development of web-based collaboration tools, and the
promotion of robust academic networks linking universities across the country.
