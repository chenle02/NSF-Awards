Despite extensive experience, eliciting contributions in an on-line community is
still largely a matter of trial and error. This project will develop theory to
predict contribution behavior in on-line communities and will help transfer that
theory into practice by using it to develop a set of on-line community design
guidelines. The project brings together three teams of researchers (from the
University of Michigan, Carnegie-Mellon and the University of Minnesota) with
diverse areas of expertise (including economics, social psychology, and on-line
recommender systems). The research team will start with existing theories of
voluntary contribution to collective efforts, conduct a set of experiments to
test the validity of these theories in the domain of on-line communities, and
develop a new, synthesized theory. The experiments will be conducted in the
MovieLens community with thousands of active users and an average of 30 new
users joining each day. The key scientific significance of this work lies in
using Social Science theory to guide design. An interesting broader impact of
that approach is the development of a cadre of graduate students with
interdisciplinary research experience who will be ready to guide the next
generation of on-line community research.
