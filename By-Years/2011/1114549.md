This proof-of-concept project is a collaboration of the Museum of Science in
Boston, WGBH's National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM) and Ideum. The
project will demonstrate that the project team can design and develop digital
interactive museum exhibit devices that work for visitors who have a wide range
of disabilities. The outcome will be one "exemplar" exhibit based on an exhibit
scenario where museum visitors learn STEM concepts by manipulating and analyzing
real data. The project will also develop and test the efficacy of a prototype
Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Toolkit that will help other museum professionals implement
the digital interactive strategies. In addition, the project will produce a
white paper on the specific exemplar and a research paper with guidelines for
digital interactive exhibits in museum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses
an innovative workshop approach that brings together individuals from a diverse
range of fields to develop the digital interactive strategies. After developing
the "exemplar" exhibit, the team will develop the DIY Toolkit and test the
efficacy of the Toolkit in museums that do not have the same level of exhibit
development resources as larger institutions. The the project's evaluation will
not only determine if the exemplar works well with a wide range of people with
disabilities, but also determine the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of the
workshop strategy and the ability of other museums to use the DIY
toolkit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will attend to an area
of high need in the informal science education (ISE) museum exhibit community
and provide a resource that will serve a wide range of ISE institutions. If the
project evaluation outcomes are positive, the project will lead to a larger
effort to develop more exemplar exhibits based on different scenarios and an
expansion of the DIY Toolkit.
