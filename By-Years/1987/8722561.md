The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports
research in the fundamental photochemistry of transition metal organometallic
and coordination compounds. The studies described in this proposal on relaxation
dynamics of spin equilibrium complexes have practical relevance to the field of
optical information storage, and the work on detecting and characterizing
reactive organometallic intermediates has practical importance to catalysis and
surface chemistry. It is proposed to investigate the fundamental chemical and
physical mechanisms governing the reactions and other deactivation processes of
excited states and reactive intermediates formed by the photoexcitation of
transition metal organometallic and coordination compounds. A major emphasis is
placed on the use of flash lamp and laser pulse photolysis with time resolved
luminescence and transient absorption spectral techniques to prepare and to
characterize these short-lived species and to study quantitatively their
reaction dynamics as functions of the nature and condition of the reaction
medium. Specific systems proposed as part of these continuing studies include 1)
strongly luminescent complexes of copper(I), platinum(II) and rhodium(III); 2)
iron(II) compounds displaying quintet/singlet spin equilibria and 3)
catalytically active phosphine complexes of rhodium and iridium plus certain
metal carbonyl clusters.
