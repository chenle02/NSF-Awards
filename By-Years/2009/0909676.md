Grzegorz Szamel of Colorado State University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to study the dynamics of
quiescent and driven glassy fluids, using a combination of numerical simulation
and formal statistical mechanics. The research is pursuing three goals: 1) to
obtain explicit numerical predictions for the correlation length in quiescent
glassy fluids; 2) to develop a new theory for the glass transition that goes
beyond mode-coupling theory and 3) to develop a theory for the dynamics of
fluctuations in driven glassy fluids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is
contributing fundamental understanding of several phenomena, such as shear flow,
that are important for materials processing leading to fewer defects and better
performance.&lt;br/&gt;
