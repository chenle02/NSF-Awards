This project builds upon recent work which identified instructional strategies
and teaching behaviors which affect the retention of both boys and girls in
science courses and careers. The primary purpose of this work is to develop an
intervention program which will encourage more girls (as well as boys) to enroll
in advanced science and mathematics courses and to promote their interest in
scientific careers. To achieve that purpose, five groups will be involved in the
intervention program: secondary school biology teachers, students, parents,
community and industrial volunteers, and science education researchers. The
project will proceed through five stages. A preliminary study will determine the
needs of rural biology students, the utility of various intervention materials,
and the validity and reliability of selected assessment instruments. Rural
biology teachers will be recruited to participate. Next, the selected
intervention teachers will participate in a two-week, intensive workshop,
conducted by master teachers, to develop a prototype intervention packet and to
preview and evaluate commercially available materials. The fourth phase of the
project will be actual implementation of the intervention programs in rural high
schools. Finally, the evaluation phase of the project will assess the
effectiveness of the program and develop an intervention packet suitable for
wide and diverse dissemination.
