The discovery of high temperture oxide superconductivity and the related
anomalous properties of the normal phase of these materials has posed a
challenging set of problems for the condensed matter theorist. Called into
question are the traditional concepts and methods of band structure and fermi
liquid theory, the conventional pairing theory of superconductivity, the
fundamental mechanism leading to superconductivity, etc. There are two limiting
approaches to these problems; one begins with a delocalized or itinerant
electron description while the other assumes that to zero order the electrons
are spacially localized. While the physically relevant situation remains
unclear, it appears likely that an intermediate situation is realized in nature.
Their program is designed to understand the full range of localized to itinerant
behavior, although their emphasis is on the itinerant limit, with many other
groups working on the localized limit.
