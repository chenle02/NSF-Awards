The proposed research involves integrating two AI-based prototype systems that
were developed under a previous NSF grant. The two prototypes are 1) A
diagnostic and sensor validation system using a high-level language called CSRL,
and 2) A corrective action procedure synthesis and planning system for emergency
reactor response. Improvements in temporal analysis techniques to include trend
following, time varying data, sequencing of data, elapsed time analysis, and
variable sample-rates is also considered.
