Intracellular digestion is a basic function of cells. The membranes enclosing
the digestive compartments protect the cell from the toxic chemicals,
microorganisms, and extreme acidity, and are involved in transport of nutrients
into the cell's cytosol. In Paramecia, these functions are carried out
efficiently in the digestive vacuoles by the sequential addition and/or
retrieval of several morphologically and functionally distinct pools of membrane
vesicles: discoidal vesicles, which provide membranes for vacuole formation;
acidosomes, which are involved in acidification of the digestive vacuoles;and
lysosomes, which contain the acid hydrolases responsible for macromolecular
digestion. The degraded products are transported from within the digestive
vacuoles to the cytosol, to be used for the cell's growth. These various
intracellular membrane-bound compartments will be separately isolated and
biochemically characterized, using a variety of approaches including monoclonal
antibodies, free-flow electrophoresis, gradient density centrifugation, magnetic
separation, in vitro fusion studies, pulse-chase experiments, and lysosomotropic
drugs. The results of these studies will not only provide us with a better
understanding of how intracellular digestion is carried out and regulated in
phagocytic protozoa, but will also provide important new insights into the
fundamental problem of eukaryotic intracellular membrane trafficking and
compartmentalization in general.
