deterministic and stochastic factors into account are becoming increasingly
important in science and technology. These models, as a rule, are rather
complicated. Oftentimes, they include many parameters characterizing the system
(diffusion coefficients, rates of chemical reactions, time scales, etc). The
parameters often have different scales, so it is natural to consider various
asymptotic regimes in these models. We will study deterministic and stochastic
perturbations of systems with conservation&lt;br/&gt;laws, in particular,
perturbations of Hamiltonian systems with multi-well Hamiltonians. Metastability
and stochastic resonance for systems perturbed by noise will be considered. New
problems on singular perturbations of elliptic PDE's will be studied as well as
quasi-linear parabolic equations which lead to a new class of stochastic
perturbations of dynamical systems. Mathematical models of polymers and models
leading to anomalous particle transport will be considered. We plan to study a
number of asymptotic problems for inifinite-dimensional systems, in particular,
for stochastic PDE's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will develop new methods of
asymptotic analysis for stochas-&lt;br/&gt;tic processes, dynamical systems and
PDE's. New effects related to metastability, singular perturbations of PDE's,
particle and wave motion in random media will be described. The research is
related to many branches of mathematics and has various applications in physics,
biology and engineering. Asymptotic methods can and should play an important
role in educating the new generation of researchers. We plan to work with
graduate students and postdocs, run seminars and organize conferences on these
topics.
