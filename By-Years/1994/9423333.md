9423333 Blaustein An unprecedented loss of the variety and numbers of species
around the world is currently occurring. A continual loss of biodiversity can
have significant ecological, economical, social, medical, and ethical
consequences. Habitat destruction, over-harvesting, chemical pollution,
introduced exotic species, and climatic change are among the major threats to
biodiversity. As part of this overall crisis, numerous recent reports have
suggested that many species within the class amphibia are undergoing population
declines and range reductions. The causes of these declines in some populations
are unclear. One factor implicated in amphibian decline is UV-B radiation. This
research under this conservation and restoration biology award will investigate
the effects of UV-B radiation on amphibian egg survivorship, hatching success,
and larval development in field populations in the Pacific Northwest. In
addition, studies will determine if UV-B interacts with a pathogen to further
reduce amphibian survivorship. Since conditions likely to promote increased UV
transmission are now becoming manifest, it is important to examine the effects
of ambient levels of UV radiation in natural populations of organisms. Knowledge
from such studies will enable us to take steps to reduce a potentially series
environmental threat.
