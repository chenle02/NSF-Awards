In future distributed field production environments, intelligent machines, like
their human counterparts, will need to harness considerable knowledge to plan
and control autonomous tasks in spite of the fact that they will be limited in
their own knowledge. However, no unifying theory and few guidelines exist for
defining and communicating knowledge about designs and field operations in a way
that can effectively be utilized by such machines. Standard researchers are
working toward such a theory in order to support the research of others on
future applications of robotics in field conditions. The research seeks to
discover and formulate a general cognitive and communications core of theory and
software for such machines, and do so in a fundamental way that can enable these
robots to have common modes of "thinking" and communicating that would provide
them with the ability to better deal with unexpected events and exploit the
knowledge in their environment.
