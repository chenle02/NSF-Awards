The phenomenon of "neglect" refers to the fact that following damage to one
side of the cerebral cortex, there is a failure to attend to the opposite side
of the body and corresponding visual space. The sensory and motor deficits that
result in neglect are poorly understood and have not been adequately localized
to specific cortical regions. In this award, Dr. Mittleman will develop a model
system for the separation of sensory from motor deficits as well as for
determining the relative involvement of various cortical area in the phenomenon
of neglect. This research will use behavioral paradigms involving the detection
of visual stimuli either by lateralized or by unlateralized motor responses that
enable a separation and quantification of sensory and motor factors in
sensorimotor neglect produced by cortical damage. An important result of these
studies will be the assessment of the relative contributions of individual ares
of the cortex in sensorimotor neglect following cortical damage. This research
will contribute fundamental knowledge about how the brain reacts to damage in
specific areas.
