Dr. Gregory L. Hillhouse and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Chicago are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
inorganic, organic and physical. A unique feature of this program is targeting
underrepresented groups from the midwest.
