The proposed research deals with the expansion of the Catholic school system in
the United States at the turn of the century. Using archival data from 1870 to
1930 the project will involve the comparison of public and private school
enrollments. Most studies of the growth in education in the United States have
concentrated on the public school system. This research will provide a much more
balanced picture of educational expansion by combining figures for both the
public and private schools. Thus, this study will contribute to an understanding
of the expansion in education, the similarities and differences in the factors
affecting private and public school growth, and the links between the private
and public school enrollments.
