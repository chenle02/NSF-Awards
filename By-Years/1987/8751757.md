This two-year project seeks to increase black students' interest and
achievement in mathematics and science by improving the quality of the
instruction that they receive in junior high school. The participants, who will
be 52 underprepared teachers from the Saint Louis area, will deepen and broaden
their knowledge of mathematics and science content, update their teaching skills
and become familiar with instructional uses of the computer in these
disciplines. During the six-week summer workshops, the 24 science teachers will
take courses in biology, physical science, and mathematics for science teachers,
while the 28 mathematics teachers will take courses in mathematics topics and in
microcomputers. Both groups will also discuss teaching methodology, as well as
participate in a seminar on issues in minority education. During the academic
year there will be monthly seminars for the participants, as well as classroom
visitations by the project staff. Visiting consultants, including black chemists
and engineers, will enhance the participants' awareness of issues in minority
education and assist the Principal Investigator in securing community and
parental support for mathematics and science education. The evaluation will
assess the project's effect on teaching strategies and on students' attitude and
achievement. The project provides a model for other urban areas with large
minority populations to follow in increasing the representation of blacks in
mathematics and science. The university's cost-sharing contribution amounts to
20% of the NSF award. The participants' schools will provide additional support
for the project, including computers and instructional materials.
