Marked fluctuations in the population structure of planktonic foraminifera,
particularly in assemblages from epicontinental seas, are believed to recrod
changes in water-mass properties. The Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway
represented a dynamic interface between widely varying water masses responding
to eustatic sealevel fluctuations, episodic tectonism and subsidence, and
climatic variability. The Cretaceous marine sequences are rich in foraminifera
and represent a rare opportunity to rigorously evaluate foraminiferal
paleoecology. With the assumption that well-preserved foraminiferal assemblages
recrod shifts in water mass boundaries and/or changes in water mass structure of
properties through time, PIs will test the hypothesis that episodic shoreline
migrations of the western margin influenced the paleoceanography of the seaway,
and can be observed as such in offshore mudrock facies. Detailed analyses of
planktonic and benthic foraminiferal population structure, coupled with clay
mineralogy and other sedimentologic and geochemical techniques, will be used to
develop robust paleoecologic models for Cretaceous foraminifera of the Western
Interior Seaway. Such models will be useful for evaluating the resource
potential of unexplored areas.
