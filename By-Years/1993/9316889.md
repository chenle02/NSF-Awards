9316889 Bock The PI and his postdoctoral associate will analyze their 1992 and
1993 GPS regional measurements from Sumatra and other islands in the Indonesian
archipelago to study crustal deformation along the Sumatran fault and the
forearc region to the southwest. Continuous improvements in GPS satellite
constellation, receiver technology and global tracking networks permit
significantly more accurate estimates of surface deformation for these two years
than for any of the preceding three years. In this way, they can assess
qualitatively and quantitatively the decoupling of oblique slip along this plate
margin into normal subduction and shear slip. They will also analyze repeated
GPS measurements collected from 1990 through 1993 along five fault transects.
These small scale linear arrays complement the regional network by providing a
detailed picture of the near-fault strain field at various fault segments. ****
