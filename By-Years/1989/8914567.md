In order to develop realistic theoretical models for quasars and other distant
active galaxies, an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for replenishing
the material which generates the energy released is necessary. This research
combines optical and 21 cm data on the distribution and motion of neutral
hydrogen in nearby active galaxies, taking advantage of the good angular
resolution available for such objects. Extending earlier work by the principal
investigator, quantative kinematic and morphological data so obtained help
elucidate such large.scale mechanisms.
