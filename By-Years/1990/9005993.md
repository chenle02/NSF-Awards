This award is for partial support of a workshop to discuss the current state of
the art in site characterization for the reduction of disasters' toll. The
workshop will be held at the University of California, Davis on March 29 and 30,
1990. The workshop will formulate and document research needs in a number of
problem areas, such as swelling, frost heave, contaminant migration, earthquake
effects on soils, and offshore siting problems. The results of the workshop will
be used to develop a collaborative proposal for the creation of a research
center on "Site Characterization for Reducing Disaster' Toll.
