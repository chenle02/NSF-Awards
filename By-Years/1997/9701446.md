Proposal Number: ECS-9701446 Principal Investigator: William Tourellas/
Washington State University Title: Research Planning Grant: Nonlinear Optical
Near Field Microscopy This is a Research Planning Grant funds to initiate a
program to develop nonlinear optical spectroscopic techniques in a Near Field
Optical Microscopy configuration. Optical surfaces where low frequency
electrical fields are present will be probed. Such electrical fields are
certainly present in VLSI and sub-micron electronic circuits due to the large
electrical current densities present but direct measurement techniques have been
lacking. With the proposed approach it should be possible to probe such fields
with sub-micron resolution.
