This CAREER combines research and educational activities in several areas of
quantum information theory. The principle goals are to develop methods for
accurate, coherent quantum state manipulation of strongly interacting systems in
quantum optics and atomic, molecular condensed matter physics. The main thrusts
are; quantum state control in mesoscopic systems and atom interactions mediated
by optical photons. A graduate course on open quantum systems and the physics of
quantum information will be developed and outreach activities fo high school and
the general public will be developed and presented.
