Nonmarine Mollusca are the most abundant animal macrofossil of Paleocene
continental strata in western North America. Their biochronologic potential,
however, has yet to be realized due primarily to the lack of study focused on
the determination of the biostratigraphic ranges of taxa in thick sequences of
strata temporally-controlled by correlation with fossil mammals. This study will
complete a biostratigraphic zonation of Puercan and Torrejonian Strata (early
and middle Paleocene) in the Crazy Mountains Basin, Montana where the number of
molluscan and mammalian localities are particularly numerous. This zonation will
be biochronologically correlated with mollusk-and mammal-bearing strata of
similar age in the Fort Peck area of Montana, and the Cypress Hills and Big
Muddy areas of Saskatchewan. The Puercan, Torrejonian, and early Tiffanian age
strata composite section will be temporally overlapped with the richly
fossiliferous Tiffanian (upper Paleocene) strata of the Little Missouri River
section in southwestern North Dakota. The composite section will provide the
first overall nonmarine molluscan biochronology for the Paleocene of North
America, and will specifically serve as a reference section for both mollusks
and mammals in the northern Great Plains.
