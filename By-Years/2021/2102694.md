Sarah Marie Bruno is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Johns Hopkins
University. Bruno will develop new instrumentation for the Cosmology Large
Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) telescope array to greatly enhance its
sensitivity. The enhancements will enable sensitive measurements of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) polarization at large angular scales, allowing
stringent tests of cosmological models of the early Universe. Bruno will also
conduct a program of education and outreach for women in physics, middle and
high school students, and science policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruno will
lead the development of two new detector arrays to increase the sensitivity of
CLASS to B-modes in CMB polarization measurements. Detection of B-modes in the
CMB would indicate a quantum origin for gravitational waves, and it would
strongly support the theory of inflation. Bruno will also establish a peer
mentoring group for early-career women in physics, develop modern science
educational modules for middle and high school students, and provide scientific
advice to inform policy initiatives on emerging
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
