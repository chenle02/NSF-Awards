Dr. Myers, although just starting on her own is already a recognized expert on
the subject of this research. She plans to use absolute resonance Raman
intensities and excitation profile bandshapes to explore solvent effects on
excited state solute energy levels and lifetimes. These studies are important
both in evaluating theories of resonance Raman scattering and in helping to
understand solution effects. Dr. Myers will measure the ultraviolet resonance
Raman excitation profiles, absolute cross sections and depolarization ratios for
several small molecules like aniline, ammonia, carbon disulfide, and methyl
iodide in both the vapor phase and in solutions of both conventional solvents
and liquefied rare gases. The experiments will exploit the sensitivity of
absolute resonance Raman intensities and excitation profile bandshapes to
solvent- induced broadening mechanisms. The results will aid in evaluating
theories of resonance Raman scattering in solution as well as dynamics of
solvent-solute interactions.
