The counter propagating beams, Raman laser cooling scheme allows one to study
new types of sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms which may be used as the basis for
steady-state spin-squeezing. If a squeezed state of the radiation field is
coupled into the cavity, efficient transfer of the squeezing to the atoms can
result. The key intellectual issue examined is how this occurs given the
interplay of the Raman population difference and Raman coherence for laser
cooling. Methods for explaining the underlying physical mechanisms involved will
be &lt;br/&gt;developed using dressed atom-field states. This system will also
allow &lt;br/&gt;a study of the fundamental questions related to the interplay
of entanglement and spin squeezing. &lt;br/&gt;
