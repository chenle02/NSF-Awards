Image frames are generated by scanning a scene several times a second. Frame-to-
frame motion estimation in the moving part(s) of the scene are of interest. The
objective of this work is to develop and implement a new iterative and
computationally efficient algorithm for estimating non-uniform frame-to-frame
motion from noisy data. The algorithm is based on the generalized maximum
likelihood criterion and referred to as the GML algorithm. The algorithm is
implemented using 2D fast- Fourier transform techniques using Markovian random
field models to represent the motion vectors. Performance and sensitivity
analysis are made to test the suitability of the algorithm for real world
applications.
