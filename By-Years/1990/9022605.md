The relationship between democracy and economic growth is among the most
important but poorly understood in the field of political economy. Are democracy
and economic growth compatible? Or is the sacrifice of personal freedom a
necessary price people must pay to escape poverty? The central question of this
project is whether democracy promotes, impedes, or is irrelevant to economic
development. However, because economic development probably also influences the
development of democracy, the study also considers the effects of growth on
democracy. This project examines the reciprocal influences between democracy and
development using advanced statistical methods and aggregate data on a cross
section of the world's nation states since 1945. When completed, the study
should help us understand whether there are any conditions under which
authoritarian governments are superior to democracies in producing wealth for
their citizens and whether there is some minimum level of economic development
that is necessary for the establishment of stable democratic rule. These
questions are particularly urgent today as attempts to establish or re-establish
democracy are occurring in numerous countries around the world, including
especially in eastern Europe.
