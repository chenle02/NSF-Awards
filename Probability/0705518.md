The PI is investigating questions in several areas of probability on various
combinatorial structures. Many of these questions are set in a group-invariant
context and the goal is to understand how geometric or algebraic properties of
the group are reflected in probabilistic properties of the processes. The PI is
working to establish basic topological properties of higher-dimensional
analogues of random forests and to establish conjectures that arise by analogy
to percolation. Phase transitions and entropy of other determinantal dynamical
systems are also under investigation. Coupling questions are also at the heart
of some stochastic comparison inequalities being studied. Basic questions
concern comparison of the behavior of random walks in two random environments.
In addition, the PI is investigating whether all groups are sofic by
investigating whether all unimodular probability measures on rooted networks are
sofic.

The field of statistical physics is concerned to a great extent with
mathematical models of phase transitions (e.g., water to ice). Typically the
model of space is a fixed lattice, for example, the square lattice in two
dimensions or the cubic lattice in three dimensions. This lattice is infinite
and possesses the mathematical properties of what is called a group. The
simplest model, known as percolation, originated in the study of fluid flow in
the ground and gas flow through a gas mask. One asks how far fluid can flow, in
particular, whether it can flow arbitrarily far. This, of course, depends on the
density of particles that block the flow; there is a phase transition as the
density increases, whereby after a certain point, with probability 1, fluid can
no longer flow arbitrarily far. One would like to know where that point is and
how the probability changes as this critical point is approached. About 20 years
ago, several researchers began investigating lattices that are quite different
from the usual Euclidean ones that are most familiar and that most closely
correspond to our physical world. These new lattices, called nonamenable, are
also usually based on groups. Such investigations began out of the usual
scientific and mathematical curiosity that drives fundamental research. Within
the last 10 years, this area of research, statistical physics on nonamenable
groups, has seen an explosion of interest. This area of research turns out to be
quite rich and to contain a large number of important fundamental questions
whose answers remain unknown. Already, there have been applications to Euclidean
lattices of some of the new ideas that have arisen in response to the need to
develop new tools for nonamenable groups.
