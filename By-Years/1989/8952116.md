New experiments will be added to our upper division, modern physics laboratory
courses. The junior course serves as an introduction to quantum physics while
the senior course is the culmination of the undergraduate training. In junior
laboratory, we will add an experiment measuring the vibration levels of polar
molecules as a function of temperature and a Compton scattering experiment. In
senior lab, we will add experiments in surface science, including LEED, Auger
spectroscopy, and a tunneling microscope capable of imaging individual atoms on
surfaces. These instruments can be used to study surface disorder, structures of
surfaces, electron screening, and the effects of adsorbates on surfaces.
Magnetic flux measurements will be made using superconducting Josephson
junctions at low temperatures. In addition to studying properties of
superconductors, students will measure a precise value of e/m using a
superconducting loop with a series junction. Finally, students will perform a
nonlinear dynamics experiment demonstrating the new and beautiful ideas of chaos
discovered in classical systems. These new experiments will provide the training
for professional physicists expected by research laboratories in both industry
and graduate school.
