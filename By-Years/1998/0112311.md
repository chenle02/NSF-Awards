This project develops methods that deal with estimation of economic models while
imposing minimum plausible assumptions. In particular, the class of models that
the project examines are defined in terms of inequality restrictions. These
inequality restrictions arise in models with incomplete data (data that are
censored or top-coded), in models with multiple equilibria, or in models with
measurement error, among others. The estimation techniques that are developed
are applied first in estimation problems with interval data with endogeneity.
Second, the methods are used to obtain more robust inference in English auction
models with bids data. Third, the methods are applied to nonlinear models with
measurement error. The project will also examine the issue of constructing valid
tests that enables confidence regions for the estimated components of these
models.
