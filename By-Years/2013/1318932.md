This project will examine characteristics of gravity waves above convective
storms and their relationships to fine-scale spatial and temporal variations in
associated precipitation, with an ultimate goal of improved understanding of the
effects of gravity waves generated by convection upon global climate via their
influence on the general atmospheric circulation. In global models, gravity
waves drive circulation changes in the stratosphere that can affect climate,
particularly on seasonal and regional scales. A hierarchy of tools will be
utilized, including full-physics cloud-resolving weather research models as well
as simpler one-dimensional wave propagation models (parameterizations). Results
from the observationally-validated cloud-resolving models will be distilled to
simplified relationships and linked to current physical process
parameterizations within climate models. Specific objectives of the effort will
include: Prediction of where convectively-generated waves will propagate, break,
and drive changes in the wind; estimation of diurnal and seasonal variations in
the spectrum of waves generated by convection over the continental U.S. by
utilizing the dense network of precipitation radar observations and validated
weather model studies; testing and improving a state-of-the-art parameterization
of these waves generated by convection; and evaluations of indicated
improvements in climate model runs. Broader impacts of this effort will include
training of a female graduate student for a research career in dynamic
meteorology or related atmospheric/climate science, as well as potential
benefits to human safety via improved understanding and potential for improved
prediction of thunderstorm-generated gravity waves and associated clear-air
turbulence as well as broader weather and climate patterns.
