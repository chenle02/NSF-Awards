The principal investigator is studying several related areas. A number of
problems are connected to the classical distributivity formula obtained from the
Hilton-Milnor theorem. Problem one here is a reformulation of the strong form of
the Kervaire invariant, the first step being the analysis of zero divisors in
Dickson's analogues of the Cayley numbers. The second problem is the analysis of
a simpler, stable distributivity law. One direction is a certain stable analogue
of Barratt's finite exponent conjecture. In a related project, he continues some
of his past work on the homology of configuration spaces. These investigations
are mainly attempts to understand and perfect algebraic techniques.
Specifically, the techniques permit calculations concerning qualitative
properties of geometric manifolds, e.g. connectedness, knottedness, the fixed-
point property, and so forth.
