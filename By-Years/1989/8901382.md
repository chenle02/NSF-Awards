This research is in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in
the subfield of chromatography. This research is designed to develop and expand
analytical and numerical solutions for fundamental problems of chromatography at
finite concentrations. The overall goal of this research is to evaluate the
influence of the various experimental factors on the production and yield of a
separation or purification by preparative liquid chromatography. This goal will
be achieved by studies of thermodynamics and phase equilibria. This research is
designed to better understand the separation of materials under non-ideal
conditions such as heavily loaded separation columns. Fundamental chemical
parameters will be examined to better optimize such separations.
