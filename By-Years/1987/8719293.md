The objective of this proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the determination of cell fate in embryonic development. In this
study the engrailed gene of Drosophila, a gene that is essential for the
determination of the anterior and posterior cell lineages of body segments, will
be analyzed. Dr. O'Farrell has proposed to develop a new assay which will enable
him to follow and analyze the fate of individual cells in early development. The
second major specific aim is to investigate regulatory elements of the engrailed
gene as defined by other genes that interact with engrailed. By applying both
approaches this study will define when and where determination of patterns of
engrailed expression occurs and will define events controlling pattern
regulation. Identification of the developmental fate of the descendants of the
cells that express the engrailed gene at the blastoderm stage of the Drosophila
embryo is important for an understanding of the genetic regulation of
segmentation. The method of marking cells will be a useful technique which will
benefit all developmental biologists studying Drosophila.
