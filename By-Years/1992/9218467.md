Stalked crinoids (Isocrinida) represent a major component of living assemblages
and produce modern crinoid- rich sediments along the western flank of the Little
Bahama Bank. Three aspects of stalked crinoid biology will be examined as they
contributed to understanding paleoecological processes: 1) Rates of stalk growth
and sediment production; 2) Distributional controls: what are the relationships
between current flow, temperature, the distribution of living crinoid
assemblages and the nature and amount of crinoidal contributions to sediments?
and 3) Taphonomy: what are the temporal and spatial variations and taphonomic
modifications of crinoid-rich sediments in the study area, and how can these be
applied to the reconstruction of fossil assemblages? Isocrinids have a fossil
record dating to the Triassic and these modern assemblages represent an
excellent analogue for better understanding paleoecological processes and
interpreting ancient crinoidal deposits.
