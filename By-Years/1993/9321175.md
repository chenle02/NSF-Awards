In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, James Lisy of the University of Illinois will study isolated cation
and anion clusters solvated in various solvents using mass-selected tunable
infrared spectroscopy. A triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer will be combined
with tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) or CO2 laser as the
spectroscopic source in the infrared. Molecular dynamics calculations are also
planned for comparison with experiment and to suggest new directions. %%%
Interactions between electrically charged atoms or molecules, called ions, and
neutral molecules are of fundamental importance to a number of areas of study,
including the study of chemical processes going on in the condensed phase such
as liquid or solid solutions. These studies could thus contribute to
understanding ion transport in biological systems. Similarly, examining gas
phase ion-molecule processes is important for understanding chemical reactions
in the upper atmosphere.
