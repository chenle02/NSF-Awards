Entry of heated brines into foreland shelf sediments of the US Midcontinent
accompanied the Ouachita orogeny during the Pennsylvanian and Permian. The water
brought heat and possibly other constituents at the same time to promote
diagenesis in foreland areas and contributed to formation of oil and mineral
deposits. A diagenetic scenario involving lateral motion of hot water at shallow
depths differs from most models. This research will attempt to establish the
importance of this regional heating for Middle and Late Pennsylvanian sandstones
and limestones in southeastern Kansas. Earlier work has shown that limestones
and sandstones there acted separately during late diagenesis, forming baroque
dolomite-like cements from constituents derived from different sources. The
proposed research will develop a diagenetic model for a small pilot area. The
model will assess the importance of regional events and local controls in
diagenesis of the area and will integrate diagenesis and sandstones and
limestones. Research will include optical, cathodoluminescence, and back-
scattered electron microscopy to investigate relations of diagenetic phases and
stratigraphy of the cements. Fluid inclusion, isotope, and trace-element data
will establish conditions of diagenesis and sources of constituents.
