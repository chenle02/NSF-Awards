Bell 9706307 Mechanotransduction is a fundamental physiological process that is
central for such diverse functions as hearing, touch, digestion, and balance. To
understand mechanoreception in the somatosensory system, the investigator
continues developing a detailed mathematical model of one receptor, the Pacinian
corpuscle, an encapsulated nerve ending. One can not remove the capsule without
damaging the nerve, so many questions about the voltage distribution along the
nerve underneath the capsule can not be answered experimentally. Since one can
only take neural measurements where the nerve emerges from the capsule after
applying displacement stimuli to the capsule surface, how does voltage there
depend on various neural parameters along the unexposed nerve? Does one need a
nonlinear current-voltage relation to achieve a threshold voltage at the
emerging end? Can one do extra recordings at the emerging end (overdetermined
boundary conditions) and be able to recover the stimuli to the nerve? The
project undertakes mathematical modeling to address these physiologically
valuable questions. Our bodies receive mechanical stimuli continuously, but the
stimuli must be processed into neural signals that the brain can interpret. This
involves receptors called mechanoreceptors. Be they hair cells in the inner ear,
or Pacinian corpuscles in the skin, there are properties that are nearly
impossible to establish experimentally, so the investigator uses sophisticated
mathematical models to help predict responses to given stimuli, as well as
establish internal receptor properties. For example, the above mentioned skin
receptor is a nerve ending which is protected by a bulb of membranes and fluid.
Physiologically one can not separate the mechanical bulb (the capsule) from the
nerve ending without sever damage to the nerve membrane. But with a good
mathematical model one can determine respective contributions each component
makes to response behavior. Also , the model can suggest ways of taking extra
neural measurements outside the capsule which will aid in finding biologically
unreachable parameter values inside the corpuscle. Analysis increases our
understanding of the transduction process in the mammalian tactile system, and
the analytic methodology transcends the particular model case considered here.
