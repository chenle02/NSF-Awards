Yale University requests matching funds for the purchase of an automated X-ray
powder diffraction system which will replace a twenty-year old instrument. The
equipment is to be housed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and will
be employed in Yale's research programs in chemical sedimentology, mineral
deposits, geochemical kinetics, and structural geology. One-half of the cost of
this equipment will be provided by the University.
