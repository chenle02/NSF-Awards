Since the development of Karmarkar's algorithm for linear programming, interest
is rejuvenated in the interior point algorithms for solving linear and convex
programming problems. Several variants of interior point algorithms have shown
considerable promise to achieve substantial improvement in efficiency over the
simplex method for linear programming problems. Through this proposal, we
request funds to further continue our study of the theoretical properties and
the computational effectiveness of these algorithms. We intend to effectively
integrate the theory developed in our previous work with our experimental
experience to develop a general purpose code for solving these problems.^R
