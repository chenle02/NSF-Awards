9350393 Brisbois The focus of this research will be the preparation of m.n
orthoparacyclophanes using a combination of cycloaddition and organometallic
approaches. The target systems will be 4.4 , 3.3 and the highly strained 2.2
orthoparacyclophanes. The training of undergraduate students through a
combination of research experience and development of new and exciting learning
opportunities involving outreach will be stressed. %%% Dr. Ronald Brisbois is
being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program as a Presidential Faculty Fellow.
He will focus his research efforts on the synthesis of cyclophanes. These
theoretically interesting and chemically useful molecules are used for the
investigation of host-guest interactions and used to probe alterations in the
normal bonding found in hydrocarbon systems. Professor Brisbois will stress the
training of undergraduate students in his research program. ***
