ABSTRACT This project concerns the development of the theory of harmonic
phonology, and proposes a mathematical implementation based loosely on
connectionist principles for the implementation of certain rules in the system.
The goal of harmonic phonology is to elaborate an account of phonological
systems in which a central role is given to the generalization that phonological
rules consistently serve to increase the conformity of phonological
representations to general well-formedness conditions, or phonotactics. The
investigator will study a range of languages throughout the world, and show that
their phonological processes consistently serve to increase the well-formedness
of their representations on one of three distinct phonological levels. Such a
view is compatible with a view of phonology as a system seeking maximal
constraint-satisfaction, a view that allows for computational implementation in
ways that have not been attempted before.
