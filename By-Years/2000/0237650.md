This project responds to a request to manage the NSF 2003 Nanomanufacturing and
Processing Workshop, to be held January 5-6, 2003 in Birmingham, AL. Basic
discoveries and innovations in manufacturing methods and processes will be
needed to achieve the full impact of nanotechnogy. To move forward on this
multidisciplinary issue of national importance, fifteen experts in
nanomanufacturing will be invited for this 1.5 day workshop. These experts will
provide input on research needs for the future. The workshop will be held
immediately before the 2003 NSF Design, Service, and Manufacturing Grantees and
Research Conference, so in addition to reporting the workshop results by
publications, they will be immediately reported to the research community at the
conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic discoveries and innovations in
manufacturing methods and processes will be needed to achieve the full impact of
nano-technology. The multi-disciplinary experts from industry, small business
and academia gathered for this workshop will advise NSF on research needs for
the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
