Biodiversity on Earth is generated through the formation of new species. This
project seeks to understand the role of differences in chromosomal gene
arrangements in facilitating the formation of new species and allowing them to
persist once formed. Recent theoretical work and experimental data suggest that
chromosomal rearrangements can facilitate species persistence because genes
cannot easily cross between hybridizing species in rearranged parts of the
genome but can cross in collinear regions. Two sets of experiments are proposed
to test this hypothesis. The first set compares the genetics of hybrid sterility
in Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis in populations that coexist and
populations that are geographically separated. The second set will evaluate if
DNA sequences differ more between species in rearranged parts of the genome than
collinear regions in two other species groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern
evolutionary biologists have an impressive understanding of how genes evolve
within populations, but a poorer understanding of how one species splits into
two. This research will illuminate mechanisms of speciation, providing insights
into the fundamental evolutionary processes that regulate biodiversity on Earth.
It will also offer insight into genetic attributes that allow different species
to persist together, which has become increasingly important when human
activities threaten the extinction of many species.&lt;br/&gt;
