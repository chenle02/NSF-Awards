Online deliberation seeks to improve group decision making by accessing diverse
expertise and experience, informing and marshaling evidence in a fruitful
exchange of ideas. Successful deliberation environments can bring great
benefits, such as broadening participation, tapping a greater range of
knowledge, testing ideas against each other, and fostering appreciation of other
views. However, for large and complex problem spaces that generate extensive
discussion, it is difficult for would-be participants to find where they could
best make a contribution, to understand how various contributions fit together,
or to grasp the contingencies between needs and contributions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem, this project will develop and
test a system that provides a personalized view of a large information space
that reveals the shape and foci of contributions in a way that reflects the
goals, expertise, and interests of each user. The system will allow participants
to see how their goals and interests match current themes and to find groups of
people and related sets of contributions that would be of interest. To do this,
the research will integrate insights from sociolinguistics with state-of-the-art
latent variable modeling techniques from the field of language technologies to
extend prior work in the areas of perspective and stance modeling in order to
identify the necessary structure in textual data to enable personalized
information extraction, summarization, and presentation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes archival data analysis to develop
algorithms and data representations, experiments to test the value to users of
various ways of representing topics and social networks, a staged series of
deployments for formative and summative evaluation, and the development of tool
architecture and user interfaces to support experimentation and deployment.
Through these activities, the investigators will systematically explore the
effects of design decisions on participation, navigability and the nature of the
deliberation. &lt;br/&gt;
