This postdoc will study the effect of atmospheric tides on winds and temperature
at the mesopause, as well as their effect on the sodium density and nightglow.
Based on a Magneto-Optical Doppler Analysis (MODA) the postdoc has constructed,
the research will be conducted at the Colorado State Lidar Facility. The postdoc
will analyze the seasonal variations of tidal signatures in winds and sodium
nightglow intensity from MODA data set, and temperature and sodium density from
lidar data set. He will also have direct access to new data from lidar
measurements of temperature, winds and sodium density.
