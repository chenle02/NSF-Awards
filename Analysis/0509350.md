The project involves measure rigidity of higher rank partially hyperbolic
abelian actions and applications thereof. It is conjectured that under certain
circumstances there are very few probability measures both invariant and ergodic
under such actions (Furstenberg, Margulis). So far all of the current work
relies on the additional assumption of positive entropy (Johnson, Rudolph), and
sometimes on additional ergodicity along critical directions (Kalinin, Katok,
Spatzier). Substantial progress has been made recently in avoiding unnecessary
ergodicity-type assumptions as well as in applications of measure rigidity
(Einsiedler, Katok, Lindenstrauss). Einsiedler will continue his study of
invariant measures avoiding additional ergodicity-type assumptions, work on
disjointness properties of various higher rank dynamical systems, further
applications of rigidity, and related algebraic topics.

The theory of dynamical systems is a relatively new, but important mathematical
theory with many connections to other parts of mathematics as well as other
sciences such as physics, meteorology, or computer sciences. Historically it
developed from the study of the evolution of a deterministic but complicated
physical process (for instance in celestial mechanics) over time. Especially if
this process is too complicated to predict long term outcomes precisely, the
theory of dynamical systems is important because it can give qualitative
predictions. More recently symbolic dynamics turned out to be crucial to find
efficient and safe coding algorithms in computer sciences. There is also a long
tradition of using dynamics to solve problems in other areas of mathematics. The
study of higher rank dynamical systems (where time has more than one dimension)
has received much attention during the last years, in part again because of its
connections to physics (in particular statistical mechanics) and computer
sciences (higher dimensional data storage methods). The proposed research links
three separate areas of mathematics, namely ergodic theory, Lie theory, and
algebra. The rich interplay among these fields helps to attack problems by using
tools from different areas. The most prominent connection is between dynamics on
homogeneous spaces and number theory, which holds the key to problems in the
theory of Diophantine approximation. However, the theory of dynamical systems
can benefit from this interaction too since dynamical systems of algebraic
origin are often more amenable to a detailed study of their dynamical properties
while the phenomena encountered are interesting in the larger context of general
dynamical systems.
