Drs. Wu and Judge at the University of Southern California will perform
laboratory measurements on the molecular constituents of gases which are present
in atmospheres of planets, in comets, and in interstellar clouds. In particular,
these researchers will measure absorption cross sections of hydrocarbon
molecules, phosphine, ammonia, and others under laboratory conditions which
simulate realistic planetary conditions. There is currently a gap between
available laboratory data on molecular parameters and observational data on
those molecules which are present in the atmospheres of planets. The lack of the
laboratory data is seriously hampering the interpretation of the observations.
The measurements which are being performed by Drs. Wu and Judge will help remedy
the deficiency of laboratory data.
