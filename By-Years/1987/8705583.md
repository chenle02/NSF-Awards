This renewal proposal will continue ongoing studies on the mechanism of
Salmonella histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH), a 4- electron NAD-linked enzyme. The
focus is on the use of primary isotope effects to obtain rates for the two
reaction steps, the chemistry of the steps, and the pK values and nature of the
enzyme residues involved. A high priority is assigned to completing the
stereochemistry of the dehydrogenation reactions. Although important binding
interactions of histidinol with HDH at the imidozole ring and amino regions have
been identified, the relative positions of these two groups in space are not
known. Rigid histamine receptor agonists will be used to determine this
topography. In order to identify the active site residues involved in binding or
catalysis, site directed modification and mutagenesis will be used. Logical
modifiers are being synthesized. In addition to the inherent enzyme mechanistic
interest in HDH, the system is of broad importance in biology. The enzyme is
coded for by the hisD gene of the Salmonella histidine operon, a particularly
well studied genetic system. The known mutants in the system form the basis for
the well known Ames test.
