The Department of Computer Science at the University of Houston proposes a
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site program in the area of Data-
Centric Computing. This is a three-year program in which each year a group of
ten students is selected nationally, with emphasis on underrepresented cohorts
in Computer Science. In order to provide greater focus, the topics are all in
the area of Data-Centric Computing. We have proposed a variety of projects
arranged around this theme. Topics include Cybersecurity (Phishing Detection,
Network Intrusion Detection, and Privacy), Text and Video Mining, and
Bioinformatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU program is to expose
undergraduate students, through carefully selected topics, to data science
research methodologies. The participants will acquire experience in conducting
research through their involvement in the research on their individually
assigned topics, under the guidance of a faculty mentor. This exposes young
researchers to core principles of research, namely objectivity and
verifiability. Participants will also be introduced to specific research
methods, literature review, and ethics in science and technology, and acquire
writing and presentation skills. Additionally, participants will learn about
career opportunities, the graduate application process, and survivals skills in
graduate programs. In this way, the program serves the national interest, by
contributing to the progress of science, through the results obtained by the
undergraduate students in this program and in the future, when the students
enroll in graduate programs and conduct further research.
