This applicant will study DNA mismatch repair, which contributes to maintenance
of genetic stability by eliminating DNA biosynthetic errors and by blocking
recombination between DNA sequences that differ by more than 1% at the
nucleotide level. Specifically, he plans to work on the biochemical basis for
the anti-recombination associated with mismatch corrections in E. coli. This
work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Modrich at Duke
University.
