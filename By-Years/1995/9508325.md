9508325 Trangenstein The Department of Mathematics at Duke University will
purchase a high end visualization machine with ample memory, fast communications
card, video equipment and disk drives that will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including the simulation of surfactant enhanced aquifer
remediation, multiple contact miscible gas injection for enhanced oil recovery,
network models for pore scale modeling in three-phase flow in porous media and
shear band formation and growth in granular materials. The calculations will
involve sophisticated techniques for localizing the computational effort via
high-resolution finite difference methods, adaptive mesh refinement, front
tracking and molecular dynamics. Because of the large size of the computations,
a large amount of computer memory is needed (both RAM and disk), and fast
communications with supercomputers.
