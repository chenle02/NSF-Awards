This work is to investigate the dynamics of quantum well and bulk semi-conductor
lasers. We will study the issue related to the maximum achievable bandwidth and
optimized noise characteristics. Critical damping which may place an upper limit
on the modulation bandwidth of diode lasers will be studied in a variety of
quantum well and bulk lasers. Quantum well devices to be studied include single
and multi-longitudinal mode lasers with single and multiple quantum wells. For
bulk lasers, we will use lasers with record breaking bandwidth (24 GHz). The
work will focus on understanding the physical process (or processes) responsible
for critical damping and in defining the design parameters for achieving high
bandwidth and low noise operation. The question of whether quantum well lasers
intrinsically have higher maximum bandwidth than bulk laser is to be answered.
Our previous studies on intensity noise have resulted in the first understanding
of the cause of low frequency noise in diode lasers. This knowledge will be used
for studying noise translation including the effect of fiber dispersion will
also be investigated. System implications will be explored.
