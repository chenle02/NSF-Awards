9310761 Stivala Since oxidation adversely affects the mechanical behavior of
polymeric materials, the proposed study will add to our understanding the
theoretical basis of the mechano-chemical degradation process. This study will
provide the basis in establishing the thermodynamic relationship for the
mechano- chemical degradative process in terms of the chemical potential, the
driving force responsible for the phenomena. In the ultimate analysis, an
indepth understanding of the transition from ductile to brittle failure
resulting from a molecular process (i.e., stress accelerated oxidation) would be
afforded. ***
