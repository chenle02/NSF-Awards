This work focuses on the stability theory of traveling waves, with an emphasis
on front propagation arising in the continuum and kinetic theories of
compressible flow. This class of problems models key real-world phenomena such
as shock waves in a viscous gas or plasma, detonations in a reactive gas, and
the propagation of phase boundaries in a viscous fluid. The investigator studies
long-standing open questions about the stability of traveling waves in these
areas by exploring the effects of key structural features, such as
symmetrizability and genuine coupling. Through an exhaustive numerical study,
which includes Evans function computation, he seeks a better understanding of
the stability properties of traveling waves in these important problem areas,
particularly in regimes where analytical methods currently provide little
information. In connection with recent work with his collaborators, the
investigator develops better algorithms for Evans function computation. An
additional benefit of this work is the continued development of the
investigator's freely available numerical Evans function toolbox, which also
allows for the exploration of systems beyond our immediate interest. Moreover,
the investigator uses this package as an investigative tool in student-focused
undergraduate research.

Traveling waves are ubiquitous in nature, occurring everywhere from population
models in ecology to the propagation of tsunamis in the oceanic sciences, or
from shock waves of a supersonic jet to the flickering pulses of light in a
fiber optic cable. The stability properties of these traveling waves describe
the degree to which they can persist in the presence of disturbances. This work
focuses on the mathematics of traveling waves and develops computational methods
for exploring the stability properties of waves in a myriad of areas in the pure
and applied sciences.
