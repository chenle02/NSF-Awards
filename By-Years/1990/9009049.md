The principal investigator will continue his work on topics concerning the
statistical behavior of systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. The
principal focus will be on systems which are homogeneously disordered such as
Bernoulli percolation and spin-glasses. However, he will also study some
questions involving uniform systems. These problems will be studied with
rigorous methods rooted primarily in probability theory, making use of
renormalization group ideas and graphical (or stochastic geometrical)
techniques. The subjects range from those which are of purely mathematical
interest to some which have experimental ramifications. This field is at the
interface between mathematics and physics.
