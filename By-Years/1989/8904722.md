This project concerns the possible rigidity of structures which are composed of
bars joined at their ends by universal joints and then reinforced by cables
joining some of these joints to others. The rods are to be incompressible, and
the cables are to be unstretchable. Simple and graphic as this model is, it
embodies deep mathematical principles and calls for subtle analysis. Maria
Terrell and Robert Connelly have been studying such cabled frameworks, asking
questions including the following. Suppose a framework has its vertices and bars
along the natural vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron in 3-dimensional
space. How few cables need one add to render such a framework infinitesimally
rigid? Can one calculate easily which cabled frameworks are globally rigid? To
what extent can group representations be used to study the global rigidity of
cabled frameworks exhibiting certain groups of symmetries? Answers to some
specific questions of this sort may have value for the design of robot arms.
Moreover, the mathematical tools which are called for in attacking questions
about frameworks will be sharpened and thus improved for all possible uses.
