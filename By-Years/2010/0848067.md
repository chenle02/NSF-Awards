Humans routinely reason about the origin of their beliefs, for example, whether
they found out about something through direct perception, communication or
inference. Languages vary in the means they use to encode information sources.
Some languages use lexical means (e.g., "I heard/figured out that John went to
the concert") while other languages use grammatical markers. With support from
the National Science Foundation, Dr. Papafragou will examine how children
learning different languages acquire evidentiality, the linguistic encoding of
information sources, and how the acquisition of evidentiality relates to non-
linguistic reasoning about the origins and reliability of information. Another
goal of the research project is to investigate whether cross-linguistic
differences in the way evidentiality is encoded influence the non-linguistic
representation of information sources. By comparing performance on linguistic
and nonlinguistic tasks by speakers of different languages and across various
child and adult groups, this research could reveal whether the way information
sources are encoded in language affects nonlinguistic thinking. A unique feature
of this research lies in the innovative and systematic comparison between
aspects of linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge within a single domain. Early
career researchers will get training in interdisciplinary research, including
international data collection.
