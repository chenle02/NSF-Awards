9531218 Carmichael Theoretical research on the quantum dynamics of small
collections of atoms interacting with photons is proposed using a number of
theoretical/computational approaches. Two principal physical systems will be
studied. The first involves two state atoms in a high finesse optical cavity
with the objective of understanding entangled atom/photon states. The second
concentrates on the photon statistics of microcavity lasers with the objective
of understanding the optical spectrum of these systems and how they differ from
conventional lasers. ***
