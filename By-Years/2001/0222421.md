Large-eddy simulation (LES) is an important computational method for analyzing
small-scale atmospheric circulations. Depending on the density of the
computational grid, LES can accurately depict eddies and vortices with scales as
small as a few meters. Still smaller eddies become increasingly important at
altitudes close to the ground. A fundamental problem with LES is that the eddies
in the surface layer immediately next to the ground cannot be resolved and must
be parameterized - that is, in calculations of the heat and momentum flux in the
atmosphere near the ground, the effects of subgrid-scale (SGS) processes must be
approximated. The goal of this research is to develop improved models of SGS
processes for use in the atmospheric surface layer. The approach is to analyze
data taken with a specially designed array of sonic anemometers during the
SGS2000 field project conducted in the San Joaquin Valley, California. These
data provide unique information on the time and space structure of the wind near
the ground with high resolution. The objectives of the work are (1) to
investigate the effects of SGS fluxes on resolvable processes by use of joint
probability functions of the resolvable velocity components and the resolvable
temperature and velocity; (2) to understand the relationship between SGS fluxes
and the resolvable velocity and temperature. Together, these will identify
characteristics of the SGS flux that are important for resolvable processes and
contribute directly to LES modeling. Progress in turbulence modeling is
important not only for meteorology but also for other geophysical and
engineering applications.
