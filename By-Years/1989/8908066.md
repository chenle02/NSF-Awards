Funds are requested for a JEOL JEM 1200EX/TN-8500, which is a state-of-art
transmission electron microscope and image analysis system (Tracor Northern)
that is capable of serial reconstruction. All members of the user group work on
different preparations in the nervous system, but have a common need for the
availability of an electron microscope with sophisticated image processing
capabilities, including 3-D serial reconstruction. The projects of 5 of the
users involve the injection of horseradish peroxidase into physiologically
identified neurons and the subsequent ultrastructural analysis of the synaptic
circuitry of the identified neurons. The systems under investigation include the
retina, central visual pathways, neural control of the heart and the spinal
cord. The sixth user is studying capillaries in the central nervous system. The
currently used electron microscopes are old (10 and 15 years), of highly
uncertain continued availability, and not capable of the levels of analysis
required for modern neuroanatomical studies.
