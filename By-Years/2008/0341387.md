The construction and validation of highly dependable
software&lt;br/&gt;currently requires extraordinary effort, especially when
using&lt;br/&gt;multiple threads of control, due to the need to consider all
possible&lt;br/&gt;thread interleavings. This research focuses on the
strong,&lt;br/&gt;widely-applicable non-interference property of atomicity. A
routine&lt;br/&gt;is atomic if its execution is not affected by concurrently-
executing&lt;br/&gt;threads. This non-interference guarantee reduces the
challenging&lt;br/&gt;problem of reasoning about the routine's behavior in a
multithreaded&lt;br/&gt;context to the substantially simpler problem of
reasoning about the&lt;br/&gt;routine's sequential
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work develops both dynamic and static (type-
based) techniques for&lt;br/&gt;formally specifying and verifying atomicity
properties of&lt;br/&gt;multithreaded programs in a cost-effective manner. It is
expected&lt;br/&gt;that atomicity checkers developed will 1) detect atomicity
violations&lt;br/&gt;that are resistant to both traditional testing techniques
and existing&lt;br/&gt;tools focused on race conditions; 2) facilitate code
inspection and&lt;br/&gt;debugging; and 3) encourage a modular design
methodology that avoids&lt;br/&gt;unnecessary interference between
threads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
