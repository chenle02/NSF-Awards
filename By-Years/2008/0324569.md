Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE), will take place in Panama City, Panama, November 2003, on the
topic of rapid system prototyping (RSP) technologies with a focus on
applications to digital signal processing, artificial neural networks,
communications, and instrumentation and control systems. Organized by Dr.
Wilfrido Moreno of the University of South Florida, the institute will involve
approximately 40 students and 7 lecturers in the field from the U. S. and Latin
America. The PASI will feature "hands-on" activities that will enhance
understanding of the theoretical material presented and will build up
participants' interest in pursuing teaching and or research in advanced RSP
development. Course content, laboratory and other course-supported materials
will be available at http://istec.eng.usf.edu. &lt;br/&gt;
