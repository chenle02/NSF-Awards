The Science Department of Iowa Lakes Community College is upgrading and revising
curricula of introductory physical and biological science courses and of the
inorganic and organic chemistry courses through purchase of computer hardware,
software and computer-supported instrumentation. Student learning and lab
efficiency are increased by utilization of computers within the lab setting to
simulate costly equipment and through use of computer-supported instrumentation
to provide hands-on experience. Faculty are revising the lab experiments to
include these new technologies.
