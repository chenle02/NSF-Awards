This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is directed
towards making devices that take advantage of ferroelectric's properties and
overcome the current roadblocks in the way of commercializing ferroelectric
devices. MicroCoating Technologies (MCT) proposes a novel concept that would
enable ferroelectric based capacitors to be integrated with transistor
technology. Ferroelectric devices have potential for applications such as
tunable capacitors, phase shifters, and others. If MCT succeeds in its product
plan, it would enable a smaller, low-noise, high transmission rate microwave
devices and components and successfully commercialize ferroelectric devices.

The market for tunable microwave devices continues to grow as the world
untethers itself from telephone lines, that is the increasing use of cell
phones. An industry leader in wireless technology has expressed significant
interest in ferroelectric materials, and has identified a number of areas in a
cell phone that would benefit from variable capacitor, for example.
