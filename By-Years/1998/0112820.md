The waters and soils of our environment contain naturally-occurring organic
matter (NOM), which helps to regulate soil fertility, pollutant toxicity,
ecosystem behavior and carbon cycling. These in turn affect agricultural
production, public and ecosystem health, and global climate change. However, the
processes which produce NOM from plant and animal matter are poorly understood,
due to the complex nature of NOM and the multitude of possible reactions in the
environment. This project will combine the efforts of ecologists, geochemists
and computer scientists in an attempt to model this complex system using a novel
stochastic approach. In this approach, millions of individual molecules are
simulated and reacted together 'in silico' to provide a computer model of the
complex natural processes. The model will be developed and tested via an
internet collaboration, and ultimately will be accessible to agricultural,
environmental and earth scientists via a simple web browser interface.
