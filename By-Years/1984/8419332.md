Experimental research conducted during the past ten years has tended to indicate
that there is a deviation between experimental behavior and analytical
predictions for double layer grid space trusses. However, in recent tests in an
improved experiment design on a custom designed truss in which imperfections
were minimized, much better correlation was obtained. Most practical space truss
systems do have natural and unavoidable imperfections and, as a consequence,
these results cannot be directly translated to practical space trusses. A series
of tests will be performed on small experimental space trusses to demonstrate
the fundamental load carrying and failure mechanisms of these structures. The
results of the tests will be compared with state-of-the-art analytical
predictions. The experiments will demonstrate space truss failure mechanisms and
fundamental structural behavior.
