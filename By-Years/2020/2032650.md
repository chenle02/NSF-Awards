In this exploratory activity, the Center for Open Science (COS) will create and
pilot a result-reporting workflow for with Open Science Framework (OSF) study
registration that includes reporting study outcomes, archiving study data and
materials with permanent identifiers, and availability of metadata in a public
API such as could be used by a federal agency for consumption (e.g., NSF Public
Access Repository (PAR)). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will conduct community
building around data sharing in the product development process and in the
review and evolution of data sharing standards established with the Transparency
and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines and badges for acknowledging open
practices. The project anticipates maximizing the discoverability of metadata of
NSF-funded research, and increasing scientific rigor by helping link the
products of research (data and software) to their associated publications
through a user experience that supports transformative behavior change towards
open-science aligned research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
