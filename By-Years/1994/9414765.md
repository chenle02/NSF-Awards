9414765 Box The emphasis in this research is the development of a technique that
employs feedback control to collect data on process disturbances or errors which
are caused by unassignable causes and cannot be removed by statistical process
control (SPC) method. The technique is tailored for application by the work
force to make process adjustments to combat the effect of disturbances. Feedback
charts that take into account the cost of being off target, cost of adjustment,
and cost of taking observations will be developed. A wide range of models will
be investigated, their sensitivity to model assumption analyzed, and their
practical utility tested. The feasibility and advantages of employing more
elaborate control schemes will also be considered in the study. The feedback
process control method developed will make it possible to put into the hands of
a much larger workforce and the statistical process community a scientific
procedure that can significantly affect manufacturing quality and productivity.
