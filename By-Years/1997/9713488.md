This research project is aimed to derive and evaluate control algorithms for
rapid adaptation of magnetic bearing dynamics during machining via multivariable
gain-scheduling. The tasks include: formulation of models of the spindle and
cutting process suitable for development of robust gain-scheduled control
algorithms; improvement of the underlying theoretical foundation for the
synthesis of gain-scheduled controllers that are capable of modifying the
feedback of magnetic bearings for stable cutting; development of numerical tools
for the synthesis of gain-scheduled controllers for such systems; evaluation of
the resulting control algorithms using numerical simulation of a magnetic
bearing milling spindle; and experimental evaluation of gain-scheduled
controllers for chatter suppression. This type of magnetic bearing spindle
control is unique in that the cutting process is treated as unknown dynamics to
which to adapt, rather than an uncertainty with which to robust. The project
presents a new and unique approach on magnetic bearing spindle control. The
technology, if successfully developed, could result in significantly higher
metal removal rates than those achievable by conventional spindles or with the
currently available magnetic bearing technology.
