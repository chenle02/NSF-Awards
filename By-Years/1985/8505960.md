The purpose of the research is to characterize and further develop the
fundamental relationships between reaction conditions and the physical
properties of the corresponding products obtained using a buffered ethanol-water
process. The process has several desirable features: high pulp yields, minimum
carbohydrate degradation, pristine lingnin, and low pollution demands. Specific
objectives of the project are: (1) to expand the scope of preliminary
delignification studies in order to obtain a better understanding of the
delignification kinetics, and (2) to identify relationships between reaction
conditions and the ensuing physical and chemical properties of the pulp and
lignin.
