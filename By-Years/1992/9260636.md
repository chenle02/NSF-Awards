Spire proposes to demonstrate heteroepitaxial growth of yttria cubic zirconia
(YSZ) on silicon which can be used for silicon-on- insulator devices and as a
substrate for ferroelectric and high temperature superconducting materials.
Because it offers potential improvements in quality of today's technologies at a
fraction of the cost, its development could overcome a major barrier to
widespread use of silicon-on-insulator substrates. Metalorganic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) will be used to deposit YSZ on hydrogen-passivated silicon.
The deposited films will be fully characterized for composition and crystal
structure. Capacitors will be fabricated to measure the electrical properties of
the dielectric. Phase II research would go on to demonstrate growth of
superconducting films, lead-zirconia-titanate, and epitaxial silicon layers on
VSZ by atmospheric pressure CVD.
