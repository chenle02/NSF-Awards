The conference on Fundamental Problems in Quantum Theory, will be held at the
Baltimore campus of the University of Maryland, June 18-22, 1994. Issues in the
foundations of quantum mechanics are quite timely, and cover a broad range of
research areas, including interpretations of quantum mechanics, mesoscopic
physics, interferometry, geometrical effects, and quantum optics.
