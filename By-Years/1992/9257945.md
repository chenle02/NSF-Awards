This is an NYI award for FY 92. This five year research program focuses on the
micromechanical material behavior of shape-memory single crystals and on
developing an understanding of the role of microstructure in the overall
behavior of shape-memory single crystals. A primary goal is to build an improved
version of a moire microscope that will allow for the measurement of the surface
deformation field near a crack tip during loading. Experimental data arising
from the application of this device will be used to formulate models for
predicting crack growth in, and subsequent failure of, this potentially
important class of materials.
