This grant, in Experimental Physical Chemistry, supports research of Dr. Robert
Weisman, who has developed the technique of transient coherent Raman
spectroscopy to directly study excited state processes in organic molecules.
These experiments enable important photochemical and photophysical processes to
be directly observed. Understanding such processes is important in several
branches of pure and applied chemistry. In the planned research the transient
CARS technique will be used to take "snapshots" of excited sample molecules'
vibrational spectra as their properties change on the nanosecond time scale.
Weisman will trace the nonradiative relaxation pathways of polyatomic molecules
such as pyridine and carbon disulfide and examine the structures of their
excited states. He will also study the vibrational spectra of selected gas phase
radicals such as cyclopropyl and of "hot" (vibrationally excited) molecules.
