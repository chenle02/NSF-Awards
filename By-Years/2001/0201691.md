The investigator and his collaborators study the following topics in arithmetic
algebraic geometry: the uniformity of small points for family of heights, the
arithmetic Kodaira-Spencer class for arithmetic surfaces with applications to
the effective Mordell conjecture, the Gross-Zagier type formula for Shimura
varieties with applications to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the
Andre-Oort conjecture.

This is a project in a subfield of mathematics known as number theory. Many of
these questions are motivated by the philosophy that algebraic information can
be obtained by geometric methods. At the center of this project is the use of a
symmetric group, or algebraic group, which is an object that is both algebraic
and geometric in nature. These symmetric groups arise naturally in physics and
chemistry. It is not too ambitious to say that the solution to the problems in
this proposal will one day affect research in cryptography, theoretical physics,
and quantum computing.
