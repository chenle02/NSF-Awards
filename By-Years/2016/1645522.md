The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will
address an important public health problem - restoring mobility in individuals
with disability. The proposed technology offers a new assistive device for
wheelchair users to improve their upper-body strength and wheelchair mobility.
Adequate strength and mobility are critical for overcoming obstacles,
functioning independently, and maintaining quality of life. Nearly every
healthcare facility provides some form of treatment to the 3 million U.S. adults
who rely on wheelchairs for assistance. The clinical significance of
establishing this technology as a robust and usable assistive device is that it
could be used in facilities where a large number of wheelchair users are
treated. Using this technology to improve strength and mobility could help to
reduce the enormous healthcare costs associated with caring for individuals that
have disabilities.

This I-Corps project will obtain feedback from wheelchair users, clinicians, and
assistive device manufactures to better understand mobility challenges that
wheelchair users face. Engaging in physical activity is a top priority for
wheelchair users and effective interventions that improve strength and
wheelchair mobility deserve widespread implementation. However, there are major
barriers that negatively impact wheelchair user's ability to engage in physical
activity. This technology circumvents several of these limitations. Research
indicates that compared to traditional devices, this technology is wheelchair
accessible and highly adjustable, elicit greater strength gains, and serves as a
safe movement for wheelchair users. Exploring customer needs and motivations
will provide a better understanding of the market opportunity of the technology
to further address mobility related challenges.
