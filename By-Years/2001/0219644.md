0219644 Joyce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided for a two year
continuation of the principal investigator's studies on the long-term
variability of the North Atlantic as an Accomplishment Based Renewal. This
research project builds on the successful field program of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and the analysis of most of the cruise data and
other data relating to decadal variability in the region. The specific topics
that will be investigated are: (1) continued studies of zonal circulation using
in-situ data and inverse methods for the 52W hydrographic section; (2)
understanding of the nature and source of sub-annual energy in the subtropical
gyre, which seems to dominate inter-annual energy both in the long Bermuda time
series and for the altimeter; (3) investigation of the reason for strong
persistence of SST anomalies in the region of the Slope Water south of Cape Cod;
and extending the use of proxy data for the study of wintertime climate
variability extending back into the 19th century to understand long-term cycles
in sensitivity to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).&lt;br/&gt;
