This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a molecular
level electrochemical approach to fabricate semiconductor compounds. It targets
a commercially important electro-optic application, the low temperature
synthesis of cadmium telluride thin-film for solar cells and infrared devices.
Present technology uses expensive vapor phase deposition methods that are
unsuitable for large-scale or low-temperature fabrication. This project will
develop a low-cost, electrochemical process to produce high quality thin-films.
Phase I will identify process parameters, demonstrate the proof of concept and
validate the approach for deposition of cadmium telluride films. Phase II will
extend the method to the other device layers. Method implementation will raise
the photovoltaic efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs of thin-film
modules. Its success will accelerate the large-scale commercialization of this
technology and provide a timely solution to the nation's escalating energy and
environmental problems.

Commercial applications of the Research Applications for the cadmium telluride
thin film technology range from the solar cells to infrared detectors. Lower
cost, higher efficiencies and simpler manufacturing will translate into a wider
spectrum of commercial markets. The nanoscale electrosynthesis method has
applications for fabricating a range of novel quantum well structures and
devices.
