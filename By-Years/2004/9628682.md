9628682 Olsen This research involves the calculation of three-dimensional strong
motion from large earthquakes applied to southern California situations.
Intensive computational requirements earlier in this work have led to the
development of algorithms that run on massively parallel computers. A 3-D 4th
order staggered-grid finite-difference method was used to simulate wave
propagation in a model of the Los Angeles basin including the 3-D structures of
the Los Angeles and San Fernando basins. The results showed that even moderate
earthquakes outside the basins can cause damaging motions within the basin due
to basin effects. This project will further earlier work by comparing the 1992
M=7.3 Landers earthquake simulations with actual data, calculating the effect of
varying rupture complexity of the earthquakes, and calculating the effects of
topographic scattering. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
