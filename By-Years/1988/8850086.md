The objectives of this Young Scholars project are to recruit, prepare and
motivate minority high school juniors and seniors, including women and the
disabled, for college education leading to advanced degrees and/or professional
careers in science, agriculture, and engineering. Summer activities over an
8-week period will include: (1) A 3-day orientation with a roundtable discussion
on career opportunities, involving the students, the project staff and
representatives from academic, public and private institutions involved in
research and/or development in chemistry, physics, engineering, agriculture and
other science-related areas; (2) Pre-college classes and laboratories involving
all participants and designed to enhance their interest in and knowledge of pre-
calculus, chemistry, physics, elementary statistics and computer use; (3)
Research and/or scientific exercises in the areas of agricultural engineering,
plant and soil sciences, agricultural economics and rural sociology, and animal
science; and (4) field trips focused primarily on academic, public and private
institutions involved in research and/or development. Each student will also be
introduced to the philosophy of science with special emphasis on role of
science, research methodology and integrity in scientific research. These
activities will be individually executed under the supervision of an advisor.
Seminars are scheduled to promote interaction among the participants.
