This project will investigate group structures on differentiable stacks and in
bimodule categories of algebras, concentrating on the example of Poisson and
quantum tori. The project will also study complex Lie algebroids to gain insight
into the relative index problem for Cauchy-Riemann structures on contact
manifolds, and to construct holomorphic objects associated with generalized
complex manifolds. Finally, applications of groupoids will be made to general
relativity and other areas where groups are not flexible enough to encode the
natural symmetries of a system.

In classical geometry, the notion of "space" is commonly identified with that of
smooth manifold or some other kind of set with additional structure. But the
study of global and local quotient objects, sometimes arising from concrete
problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering, often leads beyond the world
of smooth manifolds, and even beyond the world of sets, to objects known as
(differentiable) stacks. In this new world, and the dual world of algebra, where
geometric objects may be identified with algebras of functions, stacks become
objects in a new category in which the isomorphisms are what is generally known
as Morita equivalences. The project is devoted to understanding the
corresponding notions of symmetry in these new worlds.
