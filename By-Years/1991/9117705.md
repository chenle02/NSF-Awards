This research will deal with determination of the 3-D seismic velocity
structure in the area of the Southern Great Basin Seismic Network, effectively
covering southern Nevada. The technique involves inversion of P and S seismic
wave travel times from local events and teleseisms. Geologic mapping reveals
that the upper crustal extension has been quite heterogeneous, with highly
extended terranes adjoining virtually unextended terranes. How this extension is
manifested in the middle and lower crust and upper mantle remains in dispute.
This analysis is expected to resolve structural elements of about 10 km size
down to approximately 300 km depth. This analysis bears on the nature of active
normal faulting at depth in the Basin and Range province. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
