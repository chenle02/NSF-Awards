This award is made jointly by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry
Division and by the Division of Materials Research in support of the
computational studies of Dr. David Yaron. Semi-empirical quantum chemistry
models will be developed and applied to the photophysics of conjugated polymers.
Simultaneous fits will be developed based on experimental data on oligomers and
polymers and on different polymeric systems to provide for the investigation of
the operative screening mechanisms. By developing a single consistent approach
for polyacetylenes, polydiacetylenes and poly(paraphenylenevinylene), parameters
will be developed that can be applied to other polymers. Coulomb screening
between electrons and holes in excited states will be included through explicit
calculations of the polarization induced in surrounding polymer chains, and
through explicit calculations of on-chain screning mechanisms. Equation-of-
motion formalisms developed for nonlinear optics will be used to calculate
excited states, providing a size-consistent and computationally feasible
approach to the excited states of long polymer chains. The major advantage of
conjugated polymers over inorganic materials in optical and electronic
applications is the ability to control structure at the molecular level by
synthesis, and at the macromolecular level by self-assembly. The development of
semi-empirical models will allow for the prediction of structure-property
relationships in important classes of materials and provide a basis for the
design of new materials.
