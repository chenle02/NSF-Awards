9625655 Hsu Partial support is provided for a workshop to examine the nature,
properties, and mechanisms of formation of boundary lubricating films. Experts
from a number of different fields which relate to surface properties, surface
reactions, tribochemistry, atomic-scale tribology and similar areas will focus
on an interdisciplinary approach to boundary lubrication film studies and
suggest fruitful avenues for future research. Both academic and industrial
researchers will participate as will some industrial practitioners.
