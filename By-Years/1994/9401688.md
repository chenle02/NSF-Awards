9401688 Hurder The study of geometric properties of open complete manifolds is a
rapidly developing area of research in pure mathematics. Hurder's research
program seeks to gain a deeper understanding of geometric and dynamical
phenomenon on open manifolds by exploring the "structures at infinity" and
asymptotic symmetries of spaces. His investigation combines techniques from
coarse cohomology, cyclic cohomology, buildings, dynamics and spectral theory of
Dirac-type operators. The structure theory for the asymptotic behavior of
actions has become much more sophisticated in recent years, and is an emerging
technology of choice for addressing some well-known problems regarding the
classification of open manifolds and the symmetry groups on these spaces. The
problems addressed in this work are also closely tied to mathematical physics
and explaining natural phenomenon, especially the work relating asymptotic
structures on open spaces to the spectral theory of geometric operators. Other
aspects of the project are currently being applied to the analysis of computer
simulations of tiling maps and random dynamics of motions in two and three
space, with eventual applications to explaining the behavior of gases (the
higher dimensional billiard problem). ***
