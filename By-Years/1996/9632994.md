9632994 Gao In this group project Lehigh University, collaborating with the
University of Maine, is investigating the role of niobium in environmentally-
assisted crack growth at elevated temperatures in nickel-based superalloys. From
this interdisciplinary activity the researchers plan to develop mechanistic
models that quantify the functional relationships between the crack growth rates
and internal variables (e.g., niobium concentration) and external variables
(e.g., environment and mechanical loading). The program is designed to develop a
fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of environmentally-assisted, high-
temperature crack growth and to demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of
predictive mechanistic models, using selected nickel-based alloys as the prime
vehicle for crack growth rate studies in engineering materials. The research
program consists of four parallel activities covering environmentally-assisted
crack growth in the areas of mechanical, microstructural, chemical, and
mechanistic modeling. %%% The research is based on: (l) a recent fundamental
discovery that niobium is the principal element responsible for environmental
enhancement of crack growth (EECG) in Inconel 718 alloy (this finding identifies
correctly, for the first time, the key material variable for EECG and provides a
consistent explanation for the long-known varying degree of environmental
sensitivity among the superalloys); and (2) the need for management of
engineered systems and aging infrastructure and life cycle costs, which requires
mechanistic models for accurate prediction of crack growth rates. ***
