The purpose of this project is to incorporate high technology surveying
equipment into the civil engineering technology surveying classes and labs.
Acquisition of this equipment enables students to perform all surveying
functions and hand calculations electronically. Data is recorded by a data
collector and students supply all field information to a computer, process all
information, and develop a final drawing using CADD software.
