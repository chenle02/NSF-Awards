This project will develop a sophomore course and associated laboratory required
for all engineering students at Purdue-Calumet. It will teach them the
fundamentals of embedded microcontrollers using the Embedded Systems Minion
Teach module. The goal of the course and the significant laboratory component is
to bring to students who have an introductory knowledge of electric circuits and
high level language programming a broad knowledge of the design of turn-key,
embedded microcomputer controllers.
