This projects enhances junior and senior-level civil engineering (Environmental
Engineering) laboratory facitities and provides civil engineering students with
an advanced laboratory experience in environmental quality measurements through
automated or computer-based instrumentation. Combined with the personal
computers currently available through the CAD lab, students in civil engineering
are able to integrate their understanding and knowledge of environmental quality
measurements with the control and automation of modern engineering facility
operations and design.
