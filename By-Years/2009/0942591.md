In recent years the field of ethylene biology has been strongly and positively
impacted by genomics approaches and represents an area with many opportunities
to translate genomics into practical real-world products and solutions. The 8th
International Symposium on the Plant Hormone Ethylene to be held June 21 - 25,
2009 at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY will provide a forum for discussion and
collaboration for the highly interactive and competitive ethylene community and
is anticipated to draw a diverse group of participants that include plant
scientists from the public and private sector and breeders from around the
world. Topics include but are not limited to 1) hormone synthesis and signal
transduction, 2) biotic and abiotic stress responses, 3) ripening and
senescence, and 4) postharvest physiology and applied ethylene biology. The
participation of graduate students, postdoctoral and beginning investigators
will be fostered through travel awards to attend the Symposium. Funding provided
by NSF will be used to broaden participation of young scientists and those from
underrepresented groups from the US scientific community. Symposium program and
abstracts will be publicly available online at the symposium website
(http://www.hort.cornell.edu/ethylene/) and through a program book of abstracts
that will be distributed to meeting attendees.
