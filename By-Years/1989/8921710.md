The Organic Synthesis Program is funding the continuation of the research
program of Dr. Paul A. Grieco. Dr. Grieco will continue his studies of the
influence of the solvent on the course of reactions to develop new modes of
controlling reactivity. This will lead to the production of sensitive new
methods for producing the complex substances needed by our agriculture and
industry. The major thrust of this research is: (1) to probe further the
heterocycloreversion of 2-azanorbornenes, (2) to develop a heterocycloreversion
process for N-oxides derived from N-substituted 2-azanorbornenes for use in
intermolecular and intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions, and (3) to
examine Diels-Alder reactions and Claisen rearrangements in 3-5M lithium
perchlorate in ether. Many of the studies projected will be of a fundamental
nature in order to define the scope and limitations of these potentially useful
new reactions. Applications to natural products synthesis will be conducted.
