Abstract: The investigator is studying the problem of monomalization of
algebraic mappings. The conjecture is to prove that an algebraic mapping can be
factored by a sequence of monoidal transforms, a locally monomial mapping, and a
sequence of inverse monoidal transforms. This problem is being considered in
both characteristic zero and characteristic p. The investigator has recently
solved the local form of this conjecture in characteristic zero. The
investigator is also working on applications to valuation theory. Another
problem is the characterization of normal surface singularities with rational
Poincare series. The Poincare series is associated to the exceptional divisors
of a resolution of singularities.

The investigator's work on monomialization will have important applications in
other areas of mathematics and engineering. An immediate application is in the
solution of systems of integral equations. One of the goals of the project is to
find computable algorithms to transform systems of polynomial equations into
monomial equations.
