This action funds Nicholas Craig von Sternberg of the University of Houston to
conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the
Dynamic Systems and Control Laboratory of National Tsing Hua University in
Hsinchu, Taiwan. The project title is "Further Optimization of a Robot Inspired
by Tai-Chi." The host scientist is Professor Ting-Jen Yeh.

The intellectual merit of this research lies within the research and development
of a power-efficient walking robot. The applied power-saving technique, which
was inspired by the ancient martial art of Tai-Chi, involves motion planning to
use minimal actuation power to maintain balance at each point in the gait-cycle
and disable unnecessary actuators. Further experimental analysis is being
performed to determine additional power saving potential from the use of hybrid
stepper motors and a custom controller in place of servomotors. This experiment
is a result of the collaborative use of theory, hardware, and software developed
by two geographically and culturally independent universities. The results of
these projects could result in more power-efficient, environment friendly,
walking robots with longer operation times; such robots could be used to
increase the livelihood of the elderly or disabled, assist in tasks of daily
life, or enter a hazardous situation in place of a human being.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
