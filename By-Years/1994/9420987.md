Harris Under the direction of Dr. John Harris, Mr Kyara Onesphor will collect
data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct both field and laboratory
analysis and study stone tool assemblages from sites located at Olduvai Gorge,
Tanzania. He will focus on materials included in the Bed II geological strata
which are significant because they document a major archaeological and physical
transformation in human evolution. Stone tools recovered from this interval are
made on a number of different raw materials and archaeologists wish to know what
insight this variety might provide into early human behavior. Mr. Onesphor will
analyze the tools by typology and by raw material. He will also conduct
experiments to determine which kinds of raw materials are best suited to
specific functions. He will then travel to Olduvai gorge, locate raw material
sources, collect specimens and note the distances to archaeological sites. With
the data thus collected he hopes to reconstruct aspects of the cognitive and
land use systems of early hominids. The research will produce data of interest
to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the development of human
capabilities and assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
