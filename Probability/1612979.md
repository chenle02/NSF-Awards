A common thread in the mathematical description of dynamical processes is the
transport of some important quantity -- perhaps electrons in a crystal with
imperfections, or infection in a biological network, or information in a social
network -- by rules that incorporate randomness at the microscopic level, but
result in statistical regularity at macroscopic scales. In many such processes,
the key to understanding this macroscopic order is a careful analysis of the
random motions of individual particles (or bits of information) in the network.
In turn, understanding the random motions of particles in inhomogeneous networks
often requires analysis of the corresponding motions in homogeneous networks. A
major goal of this research is to construct a comprehensive picture of how
random walkers behave in infinite homogeneous networks with tree-like, or
"hyperbolic'' geometry. A secondary goal is to determine the behavior of a
number of specific models of epidemic and information-propagation models in such
networks. Some of the research topics will involve graduate students, who will
benefit from exposure to these cutting-edge problems in mathematical probability
theory and their motivating application areas.

The project aims to settle a number of important open technical questions
concerning the long-time behavior of random walks on lattices of semi-simple Lie
groups and other nonamenable discrete groups. These center on "local limit"
behavior: for which groups do random walks with arbitrary, but finitely
supported, step distributions obey a universal local limit law? Related
questions concern the structure of the Martin boundaries for such random walks,
the support of the exit measure, and the geometry of long random loops. The
project will also devote some effort to the study of SIR epidemics, with the
particular object of describing critical scaling behavior.
