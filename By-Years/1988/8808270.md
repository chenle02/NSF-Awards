This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program. The project is in
the area of bioinorganic chemistry and has as its focus the interaction of small
molecules, especially metal complexes, with DNA. Dr. Sook-Hui Kim will perform
preliminary experiments to evaluate Pt-195 NMR spectroscopy as a tool for the
investigation of the interaction of platinum compounds with DNA. These compounds
are valuable probes of DNA structure.
