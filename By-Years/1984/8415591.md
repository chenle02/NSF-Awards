The problem of designing a feedback controller which results in a system that
asymptotically tracks the desired referece input is a fundamental problem for
control engineers. Procedures for designing tracking controllers are well
established for linear systems with no y. Recently, it has become recognized
that control designs based on a nominal system may not work well in practice
since the system may deviate from its nominal values. This has led to interest
in robust controller design, i.e., the controller must be designed to achieve
desired performance when there are perturbations in the system. This research
will develop techniques for designing controllers which guarantee asymptotic
tracking for all allowable variations in the system parameters. Such a
controller is termed a robust tracking controller. The goal is to derive
conditions which establish the existence of a robust tracking controller and to
determine constructive methods for designing controllers with this robustness
property.
