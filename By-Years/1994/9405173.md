9405173 Rusmore One of the most for reaching tectonic problems of Northwestern
US geology is the discrepancy between contrasting paleogeographic models
suggested by paleomagnetic data (far traveled terranes) and much geologic
findings (more autochthonous terranes). Similarly, there are several structural
elements in the Coast Mountains orogen of western British Columbia and SE Alaska
whose tectonic significance is unclear. This RUI project will address many of
thee issues through field work along the Douglas Channel. British Columbia that
provides a natural cross-strike set of exposures. The work will be directed
towards answering structural questions about the history of the Coast shear
zone, the tectonic affinity and structural getting of metamorphic rocks thought
to be Nisling terrane rocks and the relation of these rocks to Stikinia. Results
will clarify many of the presently poorly known structural elements in this area
and will lead to resolving the question of whether outboard terranes moved
northward by more than 2500 km or if they essentially are near where they
formed.
