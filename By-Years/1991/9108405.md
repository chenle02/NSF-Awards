With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lyle Konigsberg will conduct a
conservation assessment on a large collection of prehistoric skeletons (over
3,600 individuals) which are maintained in the Department of Anthropology at the
University of Tennessee. These materials are derived primarily from prehistoric
archaeological sites in the Great Plains and the state of Tennessee and have
been accumulated over a number of years. Unfortunately, they are not properly
housed and curated. The skeletal remains themselves need to be treated to
prevent deterioration and should be repacked. Ms Shelley Reisman Paine, a
conservation consultant will examine the collection, produce an assessment
report and recommend a plan of action. On this basis, remedial work can be
carried out. Such skeletal collections constitute an important scientific
resource which allow one to address a number of questions which range from
historical origins to human adaptation. These materials form the basis for much
biological anthropology research and thus should be conserved and made available
for study. This grant will assist in these goals.
