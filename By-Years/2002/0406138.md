Professors Caryn Seney of Mercer University and Robin Bright of Fort Valley
State College are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to
optimize surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signals from
antibody/antigen interactions using mixed silver and gold nanoparticles. The new
idea is to use gold nanoparticles to immobilize proteins without the structural
degradation sometimes induced by silver nanoparticles, while the subsequent
addition of silver provides enhancement of the SERS signal.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project links two undergraduate institutions in
Georgia, separated by 30 miles, one (FVSC), an HBCU. Undergraduate students,
including some from underrepresented groups, are being introduced to a timely
combination of nanomaterials, spectroscopy, immunochemistry and bioanalyte
detection. The project provides fundamental background for biosensor
development.
