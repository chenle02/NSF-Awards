Neuritogenesis, the growth of neural processes, is important for neuronal
communication. In order to initiate and sustain neurite outgrowth during
embryonic development, nerve cells must receive a series of signals secreted by
surrounding glial cells in the form of protease inhibitors, protein splitting
suppressor enzymes. Studies using cultured neurons implicate the role of two
classes of multiple protease inhibitors that act on specific internal and
external proteases. One class of protease inhibitors induce neurite outgrowth
and the other maintains the outgrowth of existing neurons once neuritogenesis
has been initiated. Biochemical and immunohistochemical methods will be employed
to identify the different protease inhibitors that migrate into neurons. By
injecting protease inhibitors into neurons, Dr. Shea will be able to determine
which inhibitor is responsible for cytoskeletal stability, the framework that
sustains the shape of mature neurites. This investigation will provide
additional information on the regulation of axonal neuritogenesis.
