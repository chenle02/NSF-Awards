This award will support collaborative research between Prof. James Kolata of
the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Eli Aguilera and Dr. Jaime Vega of the
Mexican National Institute for Nuclear Research (ININ). The goal of the research
is to achieve a basic understanding of heavy-ion fusion. Since atomic nuclei
repel each other strongly due to their electric charge, it is therefore
necessary to supply a substantial amount of energy to the system to make their
surfaces come into contact so that fusion can proceed. However, even if the
surfaces do not touch, fusion may be accomplished through a process known as
"quantum-mechanical tunneling", which forms the basis of several modern
electronic devices. In the nuclear case, simple theoretical models of the
process do not quite predict the strong enhancement accomplished by this "sub-
barrier" fusion. Several complicated and generally mutually incompatible
explanations have been formulated to explain this phenomenon but further study
is needed to understand these effects. The proposed work is of high current
interest because it represents an important way in which the effect of internal
degrees of freeedom on the quantum-mechanical tunneling process can be studied.
The proposed collaboration is an extension of previous efforts and is well
matched to the strengths and facilities at both institutions. Detailed
experimental measurements will be carried out at Notre Dame while the lengthy
data-analysis phase of the work will be done at ININ using a powerful new
computer system at that institute. The proposed work is likely to make a
contribution to the field of heavy ion physics.
