This award is made as part of the FY 2012 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships Program. These fellowships support a research and training
plan at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications
to other disciplines. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to KeerthiShyam MadapusiSampath is "Integral models for Shimura
varieties of abelian type (especially ones attached to Spin groups); their
compactifications; applications of these models to arithmetic problems." The
host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring
scientist is Dr. Benedict Gross.
