This project will be an exploratory study of the dissemination of MathFINDER in
two settings: a university-based preservice teacher education program and a
field-based inservice teacher training program for mathematics teachers.
(MathFINDER is a CD-ROM disc which presents mathematics resources and teaching
strategies based on NCTM standards.) Using qualitative evaluation methods--
questionnaires, interviews and observations--the researchers will provide data
about the role and use of curriculum materials, technological innovations, and
curricular standards that have been acquired from the MathFINDER disc. The
findings should inform and shape the design of a more comprehensive evaluation
and utilization study that (1) conceptually links curriculum materials to a set
of reform standards, and (2) structures access to the materials that will
support local reform initiatives. The findings of the exploratory study will be
disseminated to several mathematics and science education reform networks,
including the Statewide Systemic Initiative and Urban System Initiative
projects. The researchers expect to tentatively identify and describe the
factors that facilitate or inhibit change in reform settings in this study as a
precursor for further study.
