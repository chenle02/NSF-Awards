Regression analysis is a widely-used technique for measuring relationships
between two variables or among a number of variables. This collaborative
proposal will enable a spatial econometrician (Anselin) and a spatial
statistician (Griffith) to address several methodological issues that arise when
regression analysis is used to analyze spatially-distributed phenomena. Some of
the assumptions needed to validate regression analysis are not met when the
technique is applied to spatial data. For example, adjacent spatial observations
are commonly not independent of each other. How such violations of validating
assumptions affect the results of spatial regression are largely unknown. The
applicants will devise measures and tests that will enable scholars who wish to
use regression analysis for spatial data to determine how spatial phenomena
affect regression analysis and its results, and they will formulate procedures
that can be used to test and validate the results obtained from regression when
spatial data are involved. Anselin and Griffith will disseminate the results of
their research by distributing software incorporating the methods they develop
and by conducting workshops to explain their results to interested scientists.
