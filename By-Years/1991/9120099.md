This award will be used at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop
a new generation of photometers based on Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) for use in
observing occultations of stars by objects in the Solar System. When compared
with conventional high-speed photometers that use photomultipliers, a CCD-based
photometer provides much greater quantum efficiency over a broader wavelength
range, the ability to guide the telescope directly from the CCD image, and the
ability to construct a much smaller synthetic photometric aperture after the
fact that tracks image motion and can be optimized for changing seeing
conditions. As a result, the CCD-based photometer provides a substantially
greater signal-to-noise ratio than the traditional photometer for a given event,
and it allows useful observations of the more numerous events involving fainter
stars to be made. The high-speed CCD photometer must be portable in order to be
used with a portable telescope or a fixed telescope that happens to lie within
an occultation path.
