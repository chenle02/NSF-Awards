In this project, the P.I. studies problems in both pure and applied
Computability Theory. The problems in pure computability theory are part of the
ongoing program to understand the structure of the Turing Degrees. As for
applied computability theory, the P.I. applies methods from computability theory
to study the effective content and proof-theoretical strength of various areas
of both classical mathematics and foundations of mathematics. He concentrates in
problems related to linear orderings, but not exclusively, and also works in
effective randomness and computable model theory.

Computability Theory is the area of Logic that studies the notion of algorithm.
Its applications are based on the idea that problems that can be solved using
algorithms are simpler than the ones that cannot. This is used in various ways
to measure the complexity of mathematical objects, theorems, sequences of zeros
and ones, etc.. It is usually the case that this analysis gives a better
understanding of the subject under study.
