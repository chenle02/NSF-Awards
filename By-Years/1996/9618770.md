9618770 Bybee This project, to be conducted under the auspices of the NRCs
Center for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Education (CSMEE) will continue
work in the area of standards-based reform through a three-pronged strategy: 1.
A dissemination strategy will build the capacity on the part of major science
education professional organizations such as the National Science Teachers
Association (NSTA), The Council of State Science Supervisors (CSSS), and the
National Science Education Leadership Association (NSELA). The Center will
continue a speaker's bureau, presentations to the education community, and a
series of articles in non science education journals. 2. A series of addenda to
the Standards will be developed to focus in depth on issues raised in the
Standards; and 3. A process will be developed to determine evidence for the
influence of standards-based reform in mathematics and science. The resultant
framework will be used to make periodic reports on the status and effect of
standards-based reform.
