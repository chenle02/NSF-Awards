Current research in robotic vision is focused mainly on the recognition of two
dimensional patterns. In many applications, however, depth perception capability
is an essential feature. In principle, depth perception can be deduced from
stereoscopic vision or from holographic reconstruction, but the algorithm
required to interpret the information is extremely complicated and requires
substantial computation. This research proposes the development of a much
simpler method of ranging based on the observation that the relative position of
the peaks of a diffraction pattern due to a point source observed through a
grating are found to shift as the distance between the point source and grating
is changed. This phenomena has been observed at visual frequencies and should be
scalable to microwave frequencies. Using millimeter waves, an instrument should
have a range of sensitivity from about 1 to 1000 meters. The proposed research
sill carry out detailed experiments at optical and microwave frequencies as a
basis for developing such a ranging instrument.
