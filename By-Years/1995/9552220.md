To meet the growing demand of industry and academia, the university emphasizes
automated data acquisition, instrumentation, and process control. In addition to
supporting the needs of Engineering Technology majors, the extended
interdisciplinary course offering in these areas provides instructional and
practical training to physical science majors as well. Major equipment includes
four personal computers with data acquisition and GPIB plug-in cards, as well as
visual programming software for analysis and data presentation. These four
networked stations are being used to introduce automated data acquisition, high-
speed instrumentation employing the GPIB bus, and process control. The project
enhances students' theoretical and practical abilities in terms of how to sense
real-world quantities such as temperature, force, motion, sound, light, etc.,
and also how to configure, use, interface, and integrate such sensors to a
personal computer (PC) based system. This also provides students with the tools
needed not only to sense but also to control physical phenomena or devices. The
new use of graphical programming language makes their task of displaying the
results, analyzing the data, and performing mathematical and statistical
calculations less tedious and permits them to devote more time in learning about
instrumentation and control and less time in programming. While performing
experiments, students see the necessity and usefulness of the techniques of
grounding, shielding, signal conditioning, noise-filtering, hardware and
software interfacing, etc., in a unified manner. The integration of theoretical
and practical aspects learned by the students in several courses prepares them
better to meet with the technological challenges of the industry.
