Abstract CTS-0209403 Genzer, Jan North Carolina State U

The PI's propose a method for preparing gradient polymer brushes - structures
with spatial variation of grafting density of polymers end-anchored on
substrates. The PI's believe that the proposed set up is unique as it would
allow one, for the first time, to explore the details of the transition between
the brush and mushroom conformations. Moreover, they predict that this
methodology could have a high impact on designing novel materials and structures
with unique properties. For example, the ability to control the grafting density
of macromolecules enables us to tailor the barrier properties of the materials,
which would make them very attractive candidates for high quality filters or
membranes. Additionally, assembling polymers in brush-like structures is
believed to provide unprecedented means of generating "nanostructured molecular
templates" that can be for example used as molecular seeds governing the
ordering of non-polymeric materials (e.g.,nanoparticles, silicates, etc.) in
polymeric matrices.
