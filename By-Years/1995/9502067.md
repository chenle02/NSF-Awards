This project is applying parallel I/O technology to reduce I/O delay in volume
visualization. Volume images that arise from such applications as computer
tomography and 3D ultrasound are too large to fit within random access frame
buffers. As a result, disk I/O is in the critical path for volume rendering.
This project is exploring the use of a new parallel volume rendering technique
that traverses 3D data sets in an order that eliminates I/O conflicts in a
parallel disk array. Consequently, the entire bandwidth of the disk array is
available to the rendering application. In this project, a high performance
volume visualization server using this idea is being designed, implemented with
off-the-shelf components, and evaluated. A supplement supporting Research
Experiences for Undergraduates will permit advanced undergraduate students to
contribute to the project by implementing and measuring I/O intensive
applications. JUSTIFICATION
