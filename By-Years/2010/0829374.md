Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed here is a three-part-cross analysis and
thematic report on 15 year-olds focusing on knowledge and attitudes about the
science of Earth and its environment done in collaboration between an American
team, consisting of educational analysts and an early-career environmental
scientist, and the PISA Unit of the Directorate for Education of the OEDC. This
project will conduct statistical analysis of a large international survey, PISA,
to describe student understanding of environmental topics. The goal is to advice
the development of curriculum policy, teacher education and science education.
The analysis will include a description in variations in students' knowledge of,
and attitudes towards the environment. The OEDC's PISA 2006, a testing and
survey of 15 year-olds in over 50 nations, is a yet to be analyzed rich source
of information on the outcomes of secondary school education in environmental
sciences.
