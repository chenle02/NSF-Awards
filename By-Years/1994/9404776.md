ATM-9404776 Dwoskin This award is for the United States subscription payment to
the Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Research (SCOSTEP) on the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) for the years 1992 through
1998. The SCOSTEP is a scientific committee of ICSU. The Board on Atmospheric
Sciences and Climate's (BASC) oversight of SCOSTEP and representation of U. S.
interests in that organization are handled through the Committee on Solar-
Terrestrial Research (CSTR). The BASC/CSTR is supported by an inter-agency
agreement in the Committee on Earth and Environmental Science/Submcommittee on
Atmospheric Research (CEES/SAR) for this and other interests in solar-
terrestrial research. Among the many services to the U. S. science community,
SCOSTEP assists the World Data Centers in defining data priorities relevant to
this field of study. It works within the ICSU to encourage cross-discipline
conferences and research. In the 1970's it conducted the International
Magnetospheric Studies (IMS), in the 1980's the Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP),
and now conducts the Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP). ***
