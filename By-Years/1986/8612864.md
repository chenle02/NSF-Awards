Dilute solutions near the critical point of the solvent behave in unpredictable
ways. Such near-critical systems will be used as novel reaction environments.
Under these conditions, the solvent can either envelop and cluster the solute
molecules or repel them. The reactions can be inhibited by operating in this
regime.
