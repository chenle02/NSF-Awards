Engineering-Other (59) The goals of this project are to use distance education
to establish (1) accredited bachelor's programs in chemical, civil, electrical,
and mechanical engineering at four-year colleges and (2) pre-engineering
programs in these four disciplines at two-year colleges. The project builds on
the University of North Dakota's (UND) twenty years of experience providing
undergraduate engineering distance education that is ABET-accredited in all four
of its disciplines. The project expands existing relationships between UND and
other four- and two-year institutions in a collaborative effort to increase the
number of qualified engineers that enter the workforce. Specifically, the
project partners with North Dakota State College of Science and Benedictine
College, in addition to the tribal colleges of Fort Berthold Community College,
Turtle Mountain Community College, and Cankdeska Cikana Community College in
order to stimulate interest in STEM fields among Native American students. The
project implements and evaluates the use of distance engineering education as a
means to establish pre-engineering programs at two-year institutions and to
enhance full engineering programs at four-year colleges.
