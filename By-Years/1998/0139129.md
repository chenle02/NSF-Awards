Auburn University's Physics Department will host 8-10 undergraduate physics
students for 10 weeks during the summer in a "Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site". During that time each student will complete a research
project and then present the results during the subsequent academic year at
either the National Conference on Undergraduate Research or an appropriate
professional meeting. The objectives are (1) to expose undergraduate students to
a thriving research environment, (2) encourage them to pursue careers in
science, (3) reach out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and (4) teach
students to work on team-oriented projects. The research projects are carefully
designed to be challenging but to ensure the possibility of completion during
the 10 week summer period. The projects are integral parts of the research
efforts in the Physics Department guaranteeing interaction and communication
among the faculty, postdocs, resident students, and the REU student(s) working
in the group. Projects span the gamut of research activities in the Physics
Department including many with experimental and some with theoretical emphasis.
The principal areas are solid state physics, plasma physics and space physics.
