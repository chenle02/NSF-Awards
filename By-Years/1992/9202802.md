Application of the coded long-pulse technique to studies of thermal balance in
the ionosphere This project is a collaborative effort involving Geospace
Research Inc. and Utah State University. The research plan has two components
including radar observations of the ionosphere and an assoicated modeling
effort. Incoherent scatter of radar waves produces two distinct signals: an ion
line and a plasma line. Usually, radar experiments are performed using either
one or the other, but a new technique partly developed by Geospace Research Inc.
allows both ion line and plasma line to be measured simultaneously. The radar
experiments are to be performed at Arecibo in Puerto Rico and with the EISCAT
facility in Europe. The resulting data provides a comprehensive set of
measurements of the density and thermal properties of the ionospheric plasma.
When combined with modeling, the measurements will be used to study a number of
different processes that affect the observed behavior of the ionosphere.
