Professor Prasad will work on arithmetic, geometric and group theoretic
questions related to semi-simple groups over local and global fields. He intends
to work on the congruence subgroup problem for anisotropic semi-simple groups
over global function fields. He also intends to study principal bundles over
certain smooth varieties. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
