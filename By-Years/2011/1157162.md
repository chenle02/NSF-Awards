Studying some of the most fundamental scientific problems requires the
development of novel computational methods and their application to very large
datasets. The computing facility is a significant addition to the current
computing resources of the Computer Science program at Lawrence Technological
University, and supports interdisciplinary computer science research in a
fashion that allows to practically apply the computational methods developed at
Lawrence Technological University to scientific questions in various disciplines
such as Astronomy, Biology, Medical and clinical research, Scientific Computing,
Biometrics, Remote sensing, Robotics, Fine Art, and more. The computing facility
also allows involving more Computer Science undergraduate and graduate students
in interdisciplinary Computer Science research. The ability of Computer
Scientists to work in collaboration with other scientists in an
interdisciplinary environment and understand problems in other disciplines is
crucial for the development of the computational methods that can effectively
solve problems in science and engineering. Therefore, interdisciplinary research
experience provides undergraduate and graduate students with the training they
need for effective real-life industry or academic research.
