Women in Cognitive Science (WICS) is an organization created by the Co-PIs of
this proposal in 2001 and is affiliated with the Psychonomic Society. The goal
of WICS is to enhance the success of women scientists who are pursuing careers
in cognitive science, experimental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. The
proposal describes a program which aims to sustain and extend WICS. The planned
activities have the following objectives: * to organize its structure more
formally, * to sustain its presence, * to engage the participation of other
senior women cognitive scientists in its leadership, * to plan events to take
place around the yearly meeting of the Psychonomic Society, * to create a set of
ongoing programs that will promote the advancement of all women in the field, *
to ensure the recognition and representation of senior women, and * to address
the needs of younger women facing the challenges of negotiating the initial
stages of beginning a career.

The program proposed addresses both of NSF.s impact criteria. It encourages the
participation of young scientists in professional meetings, promotes the
mentoring and professional development of women and minorities, and aims to
increase the visibility of senior women cognitive scientists who have been
historically underrepresented in positions of leadership.
