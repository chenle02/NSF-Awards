This grant provides support to the Organizers of the 30th International
Symposium on Archaeometry to facilitate the participation of non U.S. scientists
in the meeting. The Symposium will take place from May 20-24 on the campus of
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Held at different locations
every two years this Symposium is central to archaeometric science and it
provides a venue for scientists from many parts of the world to present the
results of their research and to assess developments in the field. Because
archaeometric research is conducted in an international context and the
archaeological materials which are the objects of study also come from many
places it is crucial to have broad and strong international representation.
However financial constraints for non-U.S. scientists are often prohibitive and
this grant will permit 10 such individuals to participate in the meetings.
