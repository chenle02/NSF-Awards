Funds are recommended for continued analysis of a high quality geophysical data
set collected by the PIs from the northern Gulf of California. The PIs will
undertake a sequence stratigraphic analysis and integrate the results with an
ongoing structural study of the region. It will also take advantage of data from
industry sources that will provide the important stratigraphic control. The goal
is to work out the transition from rifting to seafloor spreading and the history
of extension in the Gulf. The study will also lead to an understanding of the
kinematics of deformation in nascent axial basins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
