Trace concentrations of water and hydroxide which are bound in the structure of
minerals which are normally considered to be anhydrous influence the physical,
and chemical properties of the host mineral to an extent far disproportionate to
the actual concentration present. This program is concerned with 1) identifying
the sites and chemical species of these "hydrous" components, 2) correlation of
the individual hydrous species with the properties of the host mineral, 3)
following the changes which these species undergo in the geologic environment.
