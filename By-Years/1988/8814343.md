This project represents continuing support by the Organic Dynamics Program for
the research of Gerald R. Stevenson and Richard C. Reiter of Illinois State
University. The work involves the establishment of equilibria between neutral
compounds and their negatively charged counterparts. Since the position of
equilibrium varies with particular isotopes, this has led to a new method for
isotope separation. This research is directed at developing a thermodynamic
scheme that can be utilized for the separation of molecular isotopic isomers.
The Illinois State group has previously observed that the solution state and
solid state electron affinities of conjugated organic materials differing only
by the substitution of one or more atoms with isotopically different atoms
experience rather dramatic (up to several hundred cal/mol) changes. This means
that the reduction of organic isotopic isomers (e.g., benzophenone and
benzophenone-O-18) with deficient molar amounts of alkali metal in solution will
result in a competition between the two isotopic isomers for the added
electrons. Since the solution electron affinities of the two materials are not
the same, the partial enrichment of the O-18 isotope can be achieved as easily
as separating the radical anions from the neutral molecules. This method of
isotope enrichment will be explored for a variety of isotopes including C-13,
O-18 and N-15. Further, a statistical thermodynamic model will be developed that
can be utilized to predict the equilibrium constants for electron exchange
between the isotopic isomers.
