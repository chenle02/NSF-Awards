This project is a study of the aldol condensation using zeolite catalysts. The
aldol condensation is an important reaction in the basic chemical industries; it
is usually catalyzed by aqueous base which causes severe separations problems.
This study also represents the most fundamental examination yet of zeolites as
base catalysts. The work has considerable potential from both the fundamental
and applied points of view.
