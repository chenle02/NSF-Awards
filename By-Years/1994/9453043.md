9453043 Lemme The Philadelphia USI (PUSI) is designed as a series of vertical
networks, each of which is built upon a community of students, teachers,
principals, staff and parents centered upon one of the district's 22 K-12
elementary-to-high school feeder pattern clusters. These networks are linked by
cross-cluster (city-wide) networks of discrete interest groups (science
teachers, mathematics teachers, technology specialists, principals) and by
district-wide community partnerships. The PUSI seeks to: (1) implement a
national standards-based K-12 MST curriculum delivered through instructional
methods which actively involve students in their own learning; (2) enact a
systemic professional development program incorporating extant NSF-funded
programs, university partners and school site-based professional development
that employs mentor teachers; (3) produce an extensive student support services
network developed in conjunction with the Philadelphia Comprehensive Regional
Center for Minorities, local informal science institutions and other community
partners; (4) begin the use of performanae-based student assessment to
complement traditional assessments; (5) develop parent and community
partnerships in support of MST education; and (6) work with the Philadelphia
"NSF Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation" to produce future
teachers whose abilities and attitudes complement USI objectives and goals. ***
