This research is a Cooperative effort between Professor Tsu-Shaun Chang,
University of California and Professor Peter B. Luh, University of Connecticut,
ECS-8717167, and addresses the interrelationship that exists in large-scale
power systems between planning and operational activities. This area, termed the
generalized scheduling problem, is emerging as a highly important topic as
system complexity increases. This investigation views the problem from the
perspective of hierarchial decomposition and coordination. While the conceptual
framework is quite general, actual development of optimization techniques for
large-scale systems is problem dependent. This work focuses on the hydro short-
term scheduling and pre-dispatch problem as background for applying the new
techniques.
