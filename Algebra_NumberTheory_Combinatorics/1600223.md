Cluster algebras are a fundamental mathematical structure employed to describe
highly symmetric mathematical objects. In the last decade, cluster structures
have been constructed on spaces throughout representation theory and
mathematical physics, most recently in the theory of scattering amplitudes in
high-energy particle physics. This project comprises fundamental mathematical
research into the combinatorial structure of several crucial cluster algebras,
and the geometric spaces related to them.

This research project addresses several questions concerning the combinatorial
structure of various cluster algebras. Most of these cluster algebras come from
natural spaces in algebraic geometry, such as open positroid varieties, which
occur in stratifying the Grassmannian and generalized Teichmuller spaces. The
first part of the project investigates the coefficients of the Laurent
polynomials that occur in changing from one cluster to another in the
Grassmannian (and other related spaces). The second part of the project aims to
determine the relation between the parametrizations of positroid cells by dimer
configurations on tori and the values of Plucker coordinates as charts on those
cells. The third part of the project investigates the cohomology of cluster
varieties, trying to find presentations for the cohomology ring that are as
explicit and combinatorial as the presentations already known for the coordinate
rings.
