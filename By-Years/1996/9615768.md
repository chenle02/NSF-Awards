9615768 Brigham-Grette This SGER award supports a pilot study of Elgygytgyn
Lake, a large lacustrine basin located 100km north of the Arctic Circle in
northeast Russia. This lake was created by a meteorite impact that generated a
crater roughly 23km in diameter. The lack of glaciation in this basin makes it
highly likely that the modern lake contains a continuous paleoenvironmental
record of at least the last 250,000 years, but probably back to the time of
impact. It is believed that an international, multidisciplinary project to
collect and analyze core materials from this lake will provide a paleoclimate
record unparalleled in northern Asia. The objectives in this project are
intended to test the hypothesis that this large, but morphologically simple
lacustrine system contains a high resolution sediment archive extending through
the Holocene and well into the late Pleistocene. If successful, these cores will
provide the impetus for a major deep drilling program to retrieve the entire
record in the future.
