In June 1987 the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison will host the SRI-5, the 5th National Converence on
Synchrotron Radiation Instrumentation. The conference will emphasize
instrumentation needed for the high brilliance sources currently in operation or
under development. The general areas covered by the conference include new
facilities, unconventional sources of radiation (insertion devices, storage
ring-based FEL's, etc.), beamline instrumentation and detectors, and special
instrumentation for lithography, angiography, etc.
