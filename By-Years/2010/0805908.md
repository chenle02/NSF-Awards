Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0805908&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Genevieve S. Walsh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two n-manifolds are
commensurable if they have homeomorphic&lt;br/&gt;finite-sheeted covers. This
notion is particularly useful for&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. For 3-manifolds which
admit a geometry,&lt;br/&gt;commensurability respects this geometry. In light of
the recent&lt;br/&gt;proof of geometrization for 3-manifolds, classification
into&lt;br/&gt;commensurability classes is a refinement of the classification
of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds by which geometry they admit. This applies
to&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds which have been decomposed along 2-spheres
and&lt;br/&gt;2-tori. Questions concerning virtual properties
of&lt;br/&gt;$3$-manifolds, such as if a 3-manifold is virtually Haken
or&lt;br/&gt;virtually fibered, are also questions about its
commensurability&lt;br/&gt;class. Commensurability also respects certain number-
theoretic&lt;br/&gt;properties of 3-manifolds. A classification of
hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds up to commensurability would be very useful for
the&lt;br/&gt;field. A first step towards understanding
commensurability&lt;br/&gt;classes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is
understanding&lt;br/&gt;commensurability classes of hyperbolic knot complements.
The PI&lt;br/&gt;proposes to work on the conjecture that there are at most
3&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic knot complements in a given commensurability
class,&lt;br/&gt;and to understand how these commensurabilities
can&lt;br/&gt;occur. Commensurability is also a useful equivalence relation
on&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic surfaces, with the definition that two
hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;2-manifolds are commensurable if they have
isometric&lt;br/&gt;finite-sheeted covers. The PI proposes to further develop
this&lt;br/&gt;theory, in particular to understand commensurability classes
of&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with large symmetry
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds are spaces which locally look like a
3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;ball. In particular, our universe is a 3-manifold and we
do not&lt;br/&gt;know which one it is. A deeper understanding
of&lt;br/&gt;commensurabilities amongst 3-manifolds would significantly
refine&lt;br/&gt;geometrization for 3-manifolds. Knot complements are a
naturally&lt;br/&gt;occurring class of 3-manifolds, and thus good candidates
for&lt;br/&gt;study. 2-manifolds, or surfaces, are spaces which locally
look&lt;br/&gt;like a 2-dimensional disc. Hyperbolic surfaces are the
most&lt;br/&gt;common type of surface and are used in an extremely wide
variety&lt;br/&gt;of scientific contexts. The study of symmetry
and&lt;br/&gt;commensurability is very useful for these surfaces. The
PI&lt;br/&gt;regularly speaks on her work to diverse audiences. Any
results&lt;br/&gt;from this research will be described in research seminars,
posted&lt;br/&gt;on the arXiv, and broadly distributed.&lt;br/&gt;
