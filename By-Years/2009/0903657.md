The Fort Berthold Community College proposes the Doka Hóg Wahoo (Where do we
come from): STEM Research and Instructional Improvement at FBCC. The four goals
of the Project are: 1. To provide a baccalaureate STEM degree by developing and
offering a B.S. degree in Environmental Science that incorporates culturally
relevant environmental concepts and utilizes constructivist methods; 2. To
enhance recruitment and retention of students in STEM disciplines including
Environmental Science by using proven cohort strategies and teaching methods
based in constructivism, provide dual credit opportunities in environmental
science for high school students, and provide teacher professional development
to promote STEM interest among elementary and high school students; 3. To expand
research opportunities for students in STEM degree programs to include
environmental internships designed to stimulate students to enter the STEM
workforce or enter STEM graduate programs in Environmental Science; 4. To engage
STEM students in examining environmental issues impacting the Fort Berthold
Indian Reservation and actively participate in community-wide symposiums
examining these issues.
