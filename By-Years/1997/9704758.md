Wahba 9704758 This research involves the development and testing of improved
methods for estimating functions of many variables, given scattered, noisy,
heterogeneous direct and indirect observations and prior information of various
kinds. Theoretical properties of the methods under development are established,
and properties of the methods are also studied in test beds with simulated data
where the `truth' is known. Efficient numerical algorithms are developed which
simultaneously implement statistical and computational objectives. Finally the
methods are tested on real observational data sets. A unifying theme in all of
the research is the exploitation of reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods,
combined with cross validation, unbiased risk and likelihood techniques. The
statistical and numerical methods being developed have applicability in several
broad areas: (1) to the analysis of complicated medical and demographic data
sets for the purpose of risk factor estimation (2) to the analysis of very large
environmental data sets with the goal of extracting and presenting the maximal
amount of information available in the data set; particular emphasis is on
application to climate change (3) to the improvement and better understanding of
methods used in supervised machine learning, and (4) to the analysis of data
that is obtained from dynamical systems such as the evolving atmosphere or
ocean, and the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of mathematical models
(such as numerical weather prediction or ocean models) that are used in the
analysis of such data.
