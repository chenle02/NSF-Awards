9622213 German This award supports the acquisition of two instruments which
analyze oxygen/nitrogen and carbon/sulfur content in engineering materials. The
presence of these four elements can have far-reaching effects on the
microstructure, mechanical properties, thermal properties, and electronic
behavior of engineering materials, especially when they are used as powders.
When dealing with powdered metals and ceramics, the processing, sintering, and
post-sintering properties are often controlled by the surface chemistry of the
starting material. Elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen are
known to concentrate on particle surfaces. Thus, the ability to detect their
presence and quantify the amount of each that is present is crucial to
understanding the final properties of the material. This equipment will provide
envaluable information on many areas of powder processing including: (1) The
effect of sintering atmosphere on the mechanical properties of high performance
alloys; (2) Binder selection for the processing of particulate materials; (3)
The effect of powder chemistry on the thermal behavior of materials; (4) Oxide
growth; and (5) Fundamental microstructural studies. %%% The acquisition of this
analytical equipment will add an important facet to this advanced
microstructural analysis facility. Now, the microstructural and mechanical
property data can be directly linked with the alloy chemistry. Once a database
has been established with this information, it will be possible to design alloys
with very specific microstructures and properties without having to enter into a
detailed experimental matrix; that is, an expert system can be developed that
provides the alloy chemistry and processing parameters that will yield a
material with the desired properties on the first experiment. Currently, such a
system does not exist. ***
