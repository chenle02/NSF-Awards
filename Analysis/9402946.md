9402946 Makarov This project emphasizes mathematical research on a basic concept
in mathematical analysis known as harmonic measure. There are several equivalent
definitions ranging from the probability that a Brownian path hits a fixed set
to the equilibrium distribution of that set as understood in potential theory.
In recent years there has been considerable interest in the study of global
metric properties and characteristics of harmonic measure such as the dimension
of the minimal Borel support, the size of exceptional sets for the boundary
behavior of the Green function, the bounds for the dimension distortion under
conformal maps, etc. At the same time close connections with the ergodic theory
of analytic dynamical systems have been established. Harmonic measure has a
natural characterization in dynamical terms for boundaries which are like Cantor
sets or Julia sets, and ergodic theory provides a powerful tool for the study of
its metric properties. In the opposite direction, the estimates of harmonic
measure describe the geometry of the fractals and certain properties of the
dynamics. The main goal of this project is to explore the fine structure of
harmonic measure for general plane domains as well as for some important
particular classes of fractals. A continuation of studies on various
multifractal spectra that characterize the global metric properties of harmonic
measure. Application to the ergodic theory of Julia sets deal with the problem
of analyticity of the corresponding pressure functions and with the phase
transition phenomenon. Efforts will be made to understand the evolution of
fractality in the structure of harmonic measure on the boundary of diffusion
limited aggregates. Harmonic measure lies at the intersection of several
important areas of analysis and probability. It seeks to measure fine structure
of sets. It provides quantitative information of highly complex object like
fractals and badly disconnected sets with hidden structures arising in the study
of two-dimensional dynamics. ***
