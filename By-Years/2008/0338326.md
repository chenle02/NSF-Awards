This Track 2, GK-12 project builds upon existing relationships and
infrastructure developed in the previous GK-12 project with two school districts
serving diverse students traditionally underrepresented in engineering and the
College of Engineering and Applied Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader
Impact of the project is very high. Fellows, in partnership with cooperating
teachers, are improving STEM literacy in high-needs schools through a grades
3-12 pre-engineering program and are learning to be effective service learning
mentors for undergraduate students engaged in K-12 classrooms. Students are from
seven high needs, suburban and urban schools, with large minority enrollments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the Intellectual Merit of the proposal is that the
Fellows will use engineering as a vehicle to integrate math and science learning
by K-12 students in the seven participating schools. The Fellows will become
"engineering ambassadors," who deliver a hands-on engineering curriculum that
addresses state educational STEM standards and serve as role models for grades
3-12 students to link the study of math and science to future careers in
engineering and technology. This project is receiving partial support from the
Directorate for Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Title: Track 2,
