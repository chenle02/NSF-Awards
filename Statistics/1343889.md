The main objective of this research is to use Archimedean copula models to
analyze survival data. The proposed strategies are useful in medical research
and financial data analysis. The investigator will address three different
problems. The first problem is to solve the identifiability problem for
Archimedean copula models for dependent censored data. The second problem
concerns left truncated bivariate data. The investigator will explore ways to
best estimate the unknown parameters in Archimedean copula models using
truncated bivariate data. A model selection procedure for Archimedean copula
models will also be investigated. The last problem is to establish guidelines
for selecting models belonging to Archimedean copula family based on survival
data. Research will be conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
strategies.

The proposed methods and strategies are motivated by clinical trials involving
dependent censoring problem and the study of the correlated bivariate survival
data in AIDS research. The results of this project will be helpful for
determining the underlying relationship between random variables when they are
subject to different censoring patterns. The theoretic results will contribute
to the advancement of the statistical theory on correlation studies and deepen
the understanding of the dependence structure of Archimedean copula models.
