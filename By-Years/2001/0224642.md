This project involves the incorporation of enzymes or antibodies in sol-gel
processed transition metal oxides with the purpose of producing advanced
biosensor components for the detection of harmful chemical and biological
species. The proposed approach primarily addresses the material-related issues
for creating controlled porous structures in which the biomolecules may easily
"fit" and function. Environmental transmission electron microscopy will be
employed to assess the nature of bio-molecule-sol-gel matrix interactions. A
prototype of a functional biosensor will be delivered at the end of the program.
The operating principle of this device is based on the release of gaseous
ammonia as a result of biochemical reactions occurring between the biological
component and the analyte. The bio-doped ceramics to be developed in this
program are expected to find uses beyond the fields of bio-sensing and medical
diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to detect the presence and monitor
the concentration of harmful gaseous species and biological agents is important
in any setting where humans live and work. This work proposes a novel way to
"mix" ceramic and biological materials together in order to produce novel
composites for use as sensing elements in miniaturized and possibly implantable,
biosensors (such as a urea detector). These novel materials are expected to
allow for faster and more efficient detection of contaminants and dangerous
species. The students working on this project will learn new materials
processing and characterization techniques and will obtain valuable skills on
biosensor development that will be very useful for their professional
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted in response to the
Dear Colleague Letter: Next Generation Chemical and Biological Sensors and
Sensing Systems [nsf 02-112].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
