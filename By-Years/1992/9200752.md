Funds are provided for partial support of the travel of about 20 U.S.
participants in the 14th Congress of the International Primatological Society
(IPS), to be held in Strasbourg, France, on August 16-21, 1992. The IPS is an
international, interdisciplinary society of scientists who study nonhuman
primates. The aims of the IPS are to encourage all areas of primate research, to
facilitate cooperation among workers of all nationalities who are engaged in
such research, and to promote the conservation and judicious scientific use of
nonhuman primates throughout the world. The IPS has approximately 1,000 active
members in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The scheduled
scientific program of the 14th Congress includes plenary lectures, symposia,
paper sessions, workshops, and exhibits. In addition, there are a business
meeting of the general membership, meetings of the Executive Committee, and
numerous opportunities for informal exchange among the membership.
