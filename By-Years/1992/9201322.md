This project consists of a series of laboratory experiments to study mixing in
two-layer exchange flows. The work includes quantitative measurements of the
hydraulically controlled mean flow, study of the coherent structures associated
with instability and mixing, and the effect of mixing on the mean flow.
Continuously stratified systems will be considered once the two- layer flow
experiments are better understood. The study provides an innovative idea in the
study of mixing processes; specifically, the uncoupling mechanism whereby a
fluid layer of intermediate density appears between the two counter-flowing
layers and blocks instabilities and mixing.
