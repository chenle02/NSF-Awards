The proposal is a request for support ($ 73,381) of graduate student attendance
at the 27th, 28th, and 29th Arctic Workshops. These workshops are scheduled to
be held at the University of Ottawa (1997), the University of Colorado (1998),
and probably the University of Washington (1999). The funds requested will
support Graduate Student registration, hotel, and meals for four nights. The PI
anticipates on the basis of prior graduate student attendance in years 1994 -
1996 that each workshop will be attended by 30 - 40 graduate students from the
US, Canada, and several European countries.
