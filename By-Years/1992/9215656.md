The work will conduct experiments to examine piiiezoelectric hysteresis,
piezoelectric material nonlinearities under combined loading. This will
represent an advance over the linear representations currently available. The
effects of manaufacturing processes on actuator performance will be also
explored. The research will include both analysis and experiments to predict
performance of piezoceramic monolothic and array configurations. The development
will increase the reliability and sensitivity of smart material and structure
development efforts.
