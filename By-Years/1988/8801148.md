The photoprotein aequorin (initially isolated by the P.I. in 1962) has been
widely used as a Ca -indicator in living cells. However, the preparations of
aequorin used in the past were undefinable mixtures of isoaequorins containing
impurities. Recently, two improved types of aequorin were prepared in the P.I.'s
laboratory: the first is pure isoaequorins consisting of single molecular
species, and the second is a semi-synthetic photoprotein designated e-aequorin
in which the functional group is modified. The luminescence spectrum of
e-aequorin shows two peaks (405 nm and 465 nm) and the ratio of the peak
intensities is Ä±Ca !-dependent in the pCa range of 5 - 7, thus allowing the
determination of Ca concentration directly from the intensity ratio of the two
peaks. The primary objective of this project is to establish the advantage of
using isoaequorins and e-aequorin in measuring intracellular Ca , compared with
other Ca -indicators; this will be accomplished by the actual use of those
materials by collaborating cell biologists. Sufficient amounts of isoaequorins
and e-aeqourin will be produced for this purpose and also to comply with
requests from other investigators. To increase the yields of more useful types
of isoaequorins, interconversion between isoaequorins will be investigated. The
second objective is to prepare other useful forms of semi- synthetic aequorin
which excel isoaequorins and e-aequorin; this will be done by further
modification of the functional group.
