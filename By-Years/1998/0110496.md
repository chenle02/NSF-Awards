University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR/SY: Non-Deterministic Computations for
Functional Logic Programs&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Narrowing allows the seamless integration of functional and logic&lt;br/&gt;
computations. A narrowing strategy selects from an expression the&lt;br/&gt;
subexpression(s) to evaluate and instantiates variables if&lt;br/&gt; necessary.
Different selection strategies extend from functional&lt;br/&gt; to functional
logic programming computational behaviors such as&lt;br/&gt; call-by-value and
call-by-need. Sound, complete, and optimal (to&lt;br/&gt; varying degrees)
strategies are known for both Haskell-like&lt;br/&gt; programs and programs that
allow some forms of parallelism.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Unfortunately, these
classes of programs do not support&lt;br/&gt; non-deterministic computations.
The lack of non-determinism is a&lt;br/&gt; severe limitation in functional
logic languages. It prevents the&lt;br/&gt; use of familiar logic programming
idioms and, in some cases, leads&lt;br/&gt; to programs that violate the
inherent laziness of a problem. The&lt;br/&gt; research proposes a new
computational framework, a class of&lt;br/&gt; programs, and a strategy for
narrowing computations in this class&lt;br/&gt; that supports non-determinism
without loss of soundness,&lt;br/&gt; completeness or efficiency. Within this
framework, programs become&lt;br/&gt; textually shorter, conceptually simpler,
more modular, easier to&lt;br/&gt; understand and maintain, and arguably more
efficient.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The proposed strategy has the potential to
encompass strategies&lt;br/&gt; for other interesting classes of functional
logic programs and it&lt;br/&gt; is expected to unify various concurrent
disjoint efforts aiming at&lt;br/&gt; integrating different narrowing strategies
within a single&lt;br/&gt; language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
