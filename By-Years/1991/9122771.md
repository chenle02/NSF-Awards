The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory (LDGO) requests
funding for a computer network that will be used to maintain and analyze data
acquired through NSF-funded research efforts and to support geodynamic modelling
efforts. The equipment to be purchased includes a high performance server, three
high performance workstations, a large capacity data storage system and plotting
devices. LDGO will supply matching funds for the purchase of the equipment which
will supplement the existing LDGO computer system. The new system will be used
extensively by students, and databases maintained on the system will be
available to researchers and students nationwide and worldwide via INTERNET.
