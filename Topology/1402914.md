Gauge theory is the study of a particular kind of non-linear differential
equations, that originally appeared in quantum physics. In mathematics, the
solutions to these equations can be used to understand the topology (the shape)
of the underlying space. When studying three-dimensional shapes, the information
from gauge theory is encoded into an algebraic structure called Floer homology.
The project aims to study different versions of Floer homology and their
applications to topology. In particular, although Floer homology is associated
to three-dimensional spaces, by an indirect route it can give insights into the
triangulations of spaces of dimension five or higher; classifying these
triangulations is a major open problem. A triangulation is a decomposition of
the space into polyhedra, and gives a simple combinatorial description of the
space. The project also aims at constructing new variants of Floer homology,
with inspiration drawn from recent advances in quantum physics. In a different
direction, through collaboration with computer scientists, it is proposed to
apply topology to the classification of distributed computing models.

The project concerns Floer theory and its applications to the study of both low
dimensional and high dimensional manifolds. In particular, the PI will
investigate the Seiberg-Witten Floer stable homotopy types of three-manifolds
and the associated Pin(2)- equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology. These
theories can be used to get information about the homology cobordism group in
three dimensions. In turn, homology cobordism gives insight into the
classification of triangulations for manifolds of dimension at least five.
Similar methods will be used to study the intersection forms of spin four-
manifolds. The PI will also work on constructing Pin(2) versions of Heegaard
Floer homology and knot Floer homology, and on the development of new
computational techniques for Heegaard Floer homology. Furthermore, in an ongoing
collaboration with computer scientists, the PI is exploring applications of
topology to distributed computing; there, the solvability of a given task by a
system of several computers can be rephrased in terms of a question in homotopy
theory.
