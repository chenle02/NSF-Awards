This project is to study new xenolith localities recently found in the late
Cenozoic Camargo basalt field, and to continue research on mid-Cenozoic volcanic
rocks. Some of the new sites have crustal xenolith suites containing mafic
hornblende granulites and mafic igneous cumulates, that may represent different
levels of the crust. The objective is to construct the best constrained model
possible for the evolution of continental volcanic rocks. This model will be
based on the volcanic rocks, contemporaneous cumulates, wall rocks, and mantle
xenoliths. This project will test how successful current mathematical models are
in reproducing the isotopic, major-element, and trace-element chemistries of the
various rock types.
