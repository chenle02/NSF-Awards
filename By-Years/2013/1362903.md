With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program A
(CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Jeffrey A. Bartz of
Kalamazoo College in a project investigating the dynamics of photochemical bond
breaking in a series of gaseous molecules. The studies will evaluate the
influence of the shape of the starting molecules on the mechanics of their
dissociation. This research, which will be carried out by undergraduate students
who will receive training in chemical dynamics, vacuum techniques and laser
technology, will contribute to our understanding of processes involved in
atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will involve
photodissociation studies of NO and OH containing molecules in which velocity
mapped ion imaging will be used to measure the dynamics and orientation of the
NO and OH fragments. An important goal of the project is the elucidation of the
role of the conformations of the starting molecules on the dynamics of
photodissociation.
