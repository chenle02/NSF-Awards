Acoustic communication is common among animals, and it has recently been
discovered in bees, which are among the most well- understood of all insects.
The well-known "dance" of the bee in the hive gives information on the direction
and distance of a food source to other foraging bees. Preliminary recent studies
now show that sound communication almost certainly plays a major role in this
dance behavior. This project will use behavioral experiments to clarify the role
of airborne sounds from the dancing bees, and further characterize the ability
of bees to respond to sound. Bees will be trained to respond to artificially
generated sounds, to analyze the frequency sensitivity of their acoustic sense;
ablation studies will be used to identify the acoustic receptor organs. In
addition, collaborating bioengineers have manufactured a small mechanical
dancing bee, controlled by the experimenters, and this device will be used in
the presence of real bees to determine which signals are necessary and
sufficient for successful communication during the waggle dance. Both acoustic
and non-acoustic cues will be given by the mechanical model, and the observed
food-seeking field behavior of the bees that go out to forage will be assayed to
see what parameters were important to communicate site direction and distance.
This novel study will have high impact on an already rich story of a
sophisticated sensory-guided behavior. In addition, there is a strong component
of undergraduate participation in this work, and the work is very likely to have
importance in the continuing use of bees as an important agricultural resource.
