The instrumentation and software development requested will enable a
sophisticated color stimulus presentation system to be coupled with
neurophysiological data collection and analysis in a primate vision research
laboratory. The system will be developed by an established group of
investigators experienced in primate vision research. It will allow the group to
include an assessment of color in their on-going studies of the structural and
functional substrates of form, movement, and luminance processing in primate
visual cortex. The software and other details of the system will be made freely
available and development of the system in conjunction with actual experiments
will ensure "user friendly" operation. Other vision researchers are expected to
find the system readily applicable to their investigations.
