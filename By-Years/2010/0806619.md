This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy engineering students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of
structures and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are
being especially targeted for support. Scholarships are being awarded to
students in their sophomore and junior years with the students transitioning
into paid internships or research experiences for their senior year. One of the
primary project goals is to improve the retention through graduation rate for
the targeted students. The scholarship cohort is being clustered in Academic
Excellence Workshops that correspond to particular sophomore- and junior-level
engineering courses. In these workshops, students form study teams and practice
collaborative learning to solve problems. The workshops are guided by upper-
division peer facilitators. Students are also being provided with career
mentoring through a number of strategies, including regular meetings with
faculty advocates.
