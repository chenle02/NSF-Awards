Inc&lt;br/&gt;Title: Information Technology Educational Pathways of African-
Americans: A Synthetic Study with NELS 1988-2000 Data and Case
Studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to CSR, Incorporated provides support
for a 3-year study to examine the secondary and postsecondary educational
pathways that African-American youth follow to pursue information technology(IT)
careers. The study will distinguish specific factors linked to the successful
pursuit of IT education from other generic predictors of educational attainment.
The finding are intended to guide sound policy and program decisions that will
support an equitable participation of African -Americans in the IT education and
workforce. The study will compare the educational pathways taken by African-
Americans to pursue careers in IT with similar pursuits in other"pre-
professional" careers in law, medicine, and business administration, and the
fields of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
