Crystallization can occur at the boundaries of magma chambers or within the body
of the magma. These processes can lead to convection in the liquid and
differentiation in liquid and solid phases. The basic physical mechanisms for
crystallization at a side boundary have been demonstrated with laboratory
experiemnts. It is proposed 1) to model a binary system crystallizing from a
side boundary and 2) to model crystallization within the magma. The combination
will aid in our understanding of magmatic and volcanic processes.
