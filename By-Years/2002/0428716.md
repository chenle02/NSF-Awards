Abstract 0428716 James Hone Columbia University

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), tubes of carbon as small as 1 nm in
diameter, are ideal candidates for sensing because every atom of a nanotube is
at the surface. The use of SWNTs as high dynamic range fluid flow sensors will
be investigated in this project. This work is based on the recent discovery
[Ghosh et al., Science 299, 1042 (2003)] that flow of an ionic fluid across a
collection of nanotubes produces a voltage in the flow direction. This
phenomenon will be verified and the initial work extend in the following ways:

1. Fabrication of sensors based on thin films of nanotubes. Thin films of
nanotubes with well-controlled geometry will be used for testing. This geometry
will allow for better control and modeling of flow conditions 2. Systematic
variation of relevant parameters, such as flow velocity and shear, sample
geometry, and external variables such as temperature. 3. Fabrication of sensors
based on single nanotubes. Ultra-long nanotubes will be grown using chemical
vapor deposition, and integrated with microfluidics to make flow devices. The
flow-induced voltage will be studied for different types of nanotubes, as well
as for varying electrochemical potentials.

Potential applications of the technology explored in this work include
integration of flow sensors into lab-on-a-chip devices, in-vivo biological fluid
flow sensors, and low-cost, dispersed atmospheric and oceanographic flow
sensing.
