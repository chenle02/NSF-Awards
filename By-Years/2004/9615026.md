9615026 Barnard A simple method has been developed for fabrication of novel
nanostructured magnetic 'networks' which exhibit unique and useful magnetic
properties. The networks are highly unusual in that their dimensionality can be
controlled continuously at the nanometer scale allowing for exploration of
confined geometries ranging from zero dimensional 'dots' to one dimensional
porous networks to two dimensional films (as well as topologies with
intermediate dimensions) depending on substrate nanostructure and network
thickness. In preliminary studies on iron networks, dramatic enhancements in
coercivity have been observed (two orders of magnitude higher than the
equivalent thin film value) which are a direct result of the confinement of the
iron to a network topology with critical dimensions in the range of tens of
nanometers. In this research program the role of both the network material and
the nanostructure of the substrate will be assessed. Comparative studies of
ferromagnets with differing saturation magnetizations will be carried out to
determine whether the strong shape anisotropy of the network is the primary
mechanism of coercivity enhancement. The effect of the topology of the
nanostructured substrate on magnetic properties of the deposited network will be
studied using porous substrates with smaller pore diameters and more variable
porosity than is available commercially. This part of the work will be carried
out by anodically oxidizing single crystal silicon wafers. Electrochemical
process parameters will be used to independently control pore diameter and
arrangement as well as porosity. Magnetic characterization aimed at
understanding the magnetization (and magnetization reversal) process along with
the magnetic domain structure will be carried out using temperature and time
dependent hysteresis studies and magnetic force microscopy. Precise dimensions
of the networks and their crystallography be determined by transmission electron
mic roscopy. %%% The simple fabrication of very thin, magnetically 'hard'
materials is important in the context of the development of the next generation
recording media. The unique network topology under study has important
technological implications. For example, a particularly difficult challenge is
the striction problem encountered when flying a recording head very close to the
storage media. Conventional thin film media are typically roughened by
mechanical or chemical means to minimize this problem. The unique surface
topography of the networks should give rise to low values of stiction without
further processing which will enable lower flying heights and higher recording
densities. ***
