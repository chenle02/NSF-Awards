Support is provided for an International Conference on Separation Technology
whose objectives will be to define the directions for future separation research
and to promote international dialogue and collaboration in various areas of
separation technology. The conference covers almost every major area of
separation technology, and all the invited speakers and session chairman are
noted authorities in their respective areas of specialties. Consequently, the
proceedings of the conference will be a valuable aid in program planning and
assessment in NSF's Programs on Separation and Purification Processes and
Thermodynamics and Transport Phenomena.
