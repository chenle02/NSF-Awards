EIA-0220021 Wei-Hsu University of Minnesota-Twin Cities ITR: DREAM-Dynamic RE-
optimization for Application Migration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
proposes the design and implementation of a common dynamic binary re-
optimization system called DREAM (Dynamic RE-optimization for Application
Migration). DREAM can be used for migrating compatible legacy application
binaries such as moving applications in Intel 486 code to Pentium IV processors,
or moving IA-64/Itanium code to IA-64/McKinley processors. DREAM can also be
used to improve the performance of migrating incompatible application binaries,
such as moving applications in Unisys x2200 code to the new IA-64 processors. In
this case, a dynamic translator first translates the incompatible binaries into
native code and stored in a translation cache. DREAM will focus on speeding up
the native code stored in the translation cache. Furthermore, DREAM can be used
to speed up applications released in intermediate form that may require
generating native code dynamically for higher execution efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;
