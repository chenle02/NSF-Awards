ABSTRACT The current debate as to the status of Black English Vernacular (BEV)
vis-a-vis white non-standard varieties of American English (is BEV converging
with them or diverging from them?) requires for its resolution a richer and more
fully nuanced understanding of the history of BEV. Liberian Settler English
(LSE), the speech of those whose African-American ancestors immigrated to
Liberia in the nineteenth century, lives as a vibrant source of information
about BEV's earlier stages. Within Liberia, the Settler communities with the
strongest tie to the American Deep South are those in Sinoe County, Mississippi-
in African having been founded there by Settlers from Natchez in 1838. Further,
throughout their history of the Sinoe Settlers have resisted integration with
non-Settlers. Thus, both the American roots and the post-immigration history of
the Sinoe Settlers make their speech the optimal choice for the study of LSE as
an African- American linguistic enclave. The present study draws on data from
sociolinguistic interviews from Sinoe as the basis for grammatical analysis. It
also seeks to determine with as much detail as is possible the particulars of
the American past of Sinoe's original Settlers and their LSE and, ultimately, to
relate that speech variety to BEV, both past and present.
