9407268 Ablon This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist
from the University of California studying people and families impacted by a
disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also called "brittle bone disease".
This is a genetic disease which causes extremely fragile bones. Treatment
sometimes involves drilling out the long bones and inserting rods to strengthen
the limbs. The researcher will interview in depth a sample of individuals
affected by the disease, about their life histories, coping strategies, and self
images. The investigator will also observe interactions at OI Foundation
meetings. The analysis will describe the existential issues involved in growing
up in a body so fragile that bones can be broken simply by swinging one's leg;
specifically how one develops a concept of intimacy when even slight physical
touching can break bones. The nature of family adaptations to having a member
with OI will be described, as well as social stereotypes and psychological
consequences of childhood spent undergoing extensive often painful medical
procedures. This research is important because it will help us understand the
nature of stigma, physical disability, body self-images, chronic illness, and
genetic diseases by providing an extensive and careful case study of a
population who can not take for granted the physical protection of their own
skeletal systems, and who must organize their daily lives around physical
fragility. Knowing how sufferers from this extreme condition cope and establish
their lives will be useful to everyone who experiences similar disabilities.
