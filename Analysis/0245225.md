ABSTRACT

Lie Theory is a central discipline in modern mathematics and plays a key role
in diverse areas such as harmonic analysis, differential geometry, number
theory, algebra and mathematical physics. The co-principal investigators will
utilize funding to continue and enhance the Western regional workshop series
"Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations" which is devoted to Lie
Theory and which has been flourishing for over ten years.

The series of weekend meetings that are the main focus of the workshop will
provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to
become acquainted with research and researchers in the western part of the US
who work in Lie Theory. The co-principal investigators will encourage and
facilitate collaborative research, especially between junior and senior
researchers, and provide opportunities for advanced graduate students to confer
with experts at other universities.
