This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the European Set
Theory Conference held in Turin, Italy on August 29 - September 2, 2022. This is
the eighth in a biennial series of conferences that are organized by the
European Set Theory Society. In addition to Americans and Europeans, the
conference will be attended by researchers from around the world, including
Japan, China, the Middle East, and Latin and South America. It is a remarkable
opportunity for students and junior researchers to meet and interact with
established international experts. The conference is also the venue for awarding
the Hausdorff Prize, the premier honor for work in Set Theory. The grant
supports travel for US-based junior researchers (graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars) and a small number of the US-based invited plenary
speakers.

While set theory arose in connection with the foundations of mathematics, in the
last two decades it has begun focusing on applications to neighboring areas of
mathematics. These range from combinatorial methods applied to C*-algebras, to
Ramsey theory, to topological dynamical systems. Two prominent senior set
theorists, Saharon Shelah and Stevo Todor?evi?, are plenary speakers, and the
US-based plenary speakers include two invited speakers from the 2022
International Congress of Mathematicians.
