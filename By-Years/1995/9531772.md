ABSTRACT Buckius 9531772 The proposed work focuses on radiative scattering from
surfaces whose roughness is on the same scale as the wavelength of the incident
radiation. Rigorous and approximate approaches to analysis will be verified by
experimental measurements for a variety of random rough and configured surfaces.
Applications to detection of defects in semiconductor manufacturing and to
improved computer graphics are envisioned.
