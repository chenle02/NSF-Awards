This project improves instruction through use of modern instrumentation in
upper- and lower-level chemistry courses. Experiments will be developed for use
of an atomic absorption spectrometer in the analytical, advanced analytical, and
general chemistry courses. These will further develop the current emphasis on
environmental chemistry in the sophomore- level analytical course. The project
will also strengthen student/faculty research in chemistry and in geology. Three
research projects will be significantly enhanced. The grantee will match the NSF
award from non-Federal funds.
