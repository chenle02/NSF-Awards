The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the
commercialization of content delivery technology which enables a new generation
of video streaming services and emerging services such as virtual reality, as
well as accelerated web performance, media delivery, and cloud networking
services. This commercialization is expected to dramatically decrease bandwidth
usage and operating cost for network operators. It is expected to have direct
and long-term impact on network architectures for content delivery and cloud
computing applications. It will also impact the training of graduate students in
the areas of technology transition, intellectual property management, business
development, and marketing.

This I-Corps project is expected to significantly advance the state of the art
in algorithms and protocols which optimally use bandwidth and storage to improve
content delivery performance in reducing user delay and decreasing bandwidth
costs, in a scalable, distributed, and adaptive manner. Unlike most current
solutions, the algorithms used here are optimized for multi-hop, multiple-data-
source network settings. When properly deployed, they will enable the delivery
of a new generation of data-rich content and cloud computing services.
