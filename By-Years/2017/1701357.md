One of the goals of number theory is to count prime numbers in sequences of
integers. In the last ten to fifteen years there has been a drive to understand
a more general question: Find primes in integer sequences associated to infinite
groups of symmetries of finite-dimensional spaces. Formulation of this general
question followed the realization that many fundamental integer sequences are
connected to groups of symmetries, for example the entries of Pythagorean
triples, curvatures appearing in Apollonian circle packings, and the
denominators of continued fractions formed using only a finite alphabet. In many
important cases, the relevant group of symmetries is 'thin,' meaning that it is
sparser than expected, and hence is not subject to classical techniques. As a
result, new technology that draws on many different areas of mathematics has
been developed to treat questions about thin groups and their associated integer
sequences. The research in this project will study primes in integer sequences
that arise in the study of moduli spaces. A moduli space is a mathematical
object that encodes all geometric structures of a given type on an object, up to
natural identifications. Moduli spaces often have associated groups of
symmetries. These are built from integers, and so invite many intriguing number
theoretic questions. In fact, these symmetry groups are sometimes thin, giving
surprising new applications of the theory of thin groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study two types of counting problems. The
first concerns the number fields associated to periodic orbits of the
Teichmueller flow on moduli spaces of abelian differentials. The PI has recently
generalized Selberg's 3/16 Theorem to higher genus moduli spaces. This result
will be used to obtain a congruence count for periodic orbits of the
Teichmueller flow. In addition, Selberg's Theorem will be extended to affine
invariant submanifolds of moduli space. The second type of problem concerns the
Markoff-Hurwitz affine variety and its automorphism group. The PI will study the
prime factors of the coordinates of integer points on this variety by obtaining
congruence lattice point counting estimates and using sieve methods. This
requires understanding the orbits of the automorphism group on the points of the
variety over finite fields, and extensions of this question to square-free
moduli. Questions about the statistics of the series of permutations obtained by
the actions of a fixed global automorphism on the points on the variety over
various finite fields will be studied. These questions are related to surprising
numerical results obtained in collaboration with undergraduate students.
