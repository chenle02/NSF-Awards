This exploratory research will focus on a set of experiments using the
atmospheric component of the NCAR CCSM to test the behavior of the model using
different parameterizations of deep convection. Annual integrations of the
standard version of CCSM will be carried out, each run using one of the
convective schemes: Zhang-McFarlane, Zhang-McFarlane + (includes physical
triggers and closure modifications for convection), Arakawa-Schubert, Relaxed
Arakawa-Schubert, and Prognostic Arakawa-Schubert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
is important because it should provide a strong diagnostics underpinning to the
CCSM project from a university based group engaged in dynamical diagnosis of
observed climate variability. The results from this project will be useful in
identifying the convection scheme that will be incorporated in the next version
of the model, scheduled for early 2001.
