Abstract Li

The proposal is for partial support of the Young Analysts Meeting of the
Southeast that has met annually since 1995. The primary objective of the meeting
is to bring together graduate students, young investigators, and more senior
researchers. The program features plenary talks by eminent mathematicians, with
parallel sessions of contributed papers by younger participants. The funding
will be used primarily for the travel support of graduate students and young
PhDs.
