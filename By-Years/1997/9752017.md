Increased pressure on natural resources worldwide and shrinking budgets are
causing environmental management organizations to rely increasingly on advanced
technology. There is a clear need for the training of highly-skilled, multi-
disciplinary environmental professionals, able to utilize advanced technology to
achieve environmental management goals. The purpose of Water on the Web is to
contribute to a more scientifically and technologically competent work force
through a comprehensive educational program for high school and community
college students and teachers. This goal will be achieved by developing
curriculum modules that teach basic science concepts illustrated through the use
of real-time remote sensing technology, Geographic Information Systems, and the
Internet. Multi-disciplinary teams of academic, science, and technology
specialists (including representatives from universities, community and tribal
colleges, secondary schools, natural resource and research agencies, and
industry) will cooperatively develop this curriculum. Through this project
students will conduct interactive inquiries of widespread environmental systems
using newly-developed, real-time, remote sampling technology linked with
classrooms through cellular communication and Internet networks and participate
in industry-sponsored internships. Final curricula will be disseminated through
printed materials, and an interactive CD-ROM distributed through the National
Sea Grant network, materials in electronic format available through an Internet
node, in-service training workshops, presentations at professional conferences,
and, finally, a national conference on the use of real time data and emerging
technologies in undergraduate science education.
