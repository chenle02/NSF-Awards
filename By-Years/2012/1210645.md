One of the goals of behavioral biologists is to understand why sometimes there
is close cooperation among in animal societies and why at other times there is
intense conflict. This project will help us understand the shifting balance
between cooperation and conflict by investigating a striking switch from strong
cooperation to stunning conflict inside the nests of a common species of yellow
jacket wasp called Dolichovespula arenaria. The nests of these wasps are the
familiar grey, paper structures about the size of a soccer ball that appear in
trees and on buildings. Inside each one lives a family of wasps that includes a
mother wasp (the queen) and dozens of her daughters and sons. Most of the time,
the daughter wasps cooperate with their mother, helping her by building the
nest, defending it, collecting food, and helping rear the queen's offspring. But
late in the summer, one of the daughter wasps will suddenly sting and kill the
mother wasp and then start laying eggs herself. How such a dramatic switch from
cooperation to conflict can have evolved is the puzzle that this study
addresses. Using novel video recording methods that enable us to carefully
monitor the situation inside each colony at the time of the matricide, the PI
will test several hypotheses for how it can actually benefit a daughter wasp to
kill her mother. One possibility is that the mother wasp has lost her fertility,
in which case the workers have little to lose and much to gain by killing their
mother and taking over the nest. This work will be deepen our understanding of
the biological forces that influence cooperation and conflict, and this is a
matter of great relevance to human society.
