This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Program will demonstrate the
feasibility of model-guided approach for developing spin dependent tunnel
junctions in magnetoelectronic devices. Spin dependent tunnel junctions are at
the forefront of nanotechnology that is under intensive research and development
worldwide. Spin dependent tunnel devices are expected to be commercialized in
about two years in sensor, isolator, and memory. Due to the unique requirements
of the tunnel barrier with a nominal thickness of ~1nm and its interfaces with
two ferromagnetic layers, an experimental approach by itself is inefficient in
developing new junctions. There is a critical need for guidance from a realistic
modeling in the fabrication processing, and this project is specifically
designed to fulfill this need. Realistic atomistic modeling will be established
and experiments will be judicially chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of this
integrated approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magneto-random access memories are
used in reprogrammable logic, read heads, generic magnetic field sensors, and
galvanic isolators and are important components for the electronic storage
industry. They have the potential to be applied in other microelectronic devices
where thin layers and interfaces are critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
