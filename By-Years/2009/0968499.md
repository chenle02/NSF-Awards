The Hilbert transform is an mathematical object intimately related to physical
situations such as charge distribution. It and related objects such as the
Cauchy transform, occur in a range of analytical questions, from orthogonal
polynomials to dynamics, to analytic function spaces and partial differential
equations. The two-weight problem for the Hilbert transform concerns a
characterization of those pairs of measures so that the transform maps Hilbert
space of one measure into Hilbert space of the other. This problem has been
solved by the proposer, Eric T Sawyer and Ignacio Uriate-Tuero, in work
sponsored by the National Science Foundation. This has immediate application to
for instance a long-standing conjecture of Sarason in operator theory. The goal
of this proposal, is to build upon this success, turning to extensions of this
characterization for other natural questions, such as that for the Cauchy
transform, which is fundamental for the theory of analytic function spaces.

This work seeks to detail subtle properties of transforms which closely model
physical situations, such as electrical charge distributions. As such, the
techniques will impact the range of analytical tools that can be brought to bear
on these questions that entail fine knowledge about these operators. In
addition, the proposer carries out a variety of roles in mentoring and training
a next generation of scientific workforce. This includes: (1) The work of the
investigator on an MCTP grant to recruit and train talented undergraduate majors
at the Georgia Institute of Technology. (2) Directing two graduate students in
their thesis work. (3) Mentoring a number of postdoctoral fellows. (4)
Conference organization at research centers in the US, Canada and Europe. (5)
Editorial work for the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society and the
Journal of Geometric Analysis. (6) Dissemination of research accomplishments and
goals, including lectures at venues around the world.
