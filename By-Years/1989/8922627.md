This award supports a Workshop on Superconducting Super Collider experiments,
organized by the University of Arizona in Tuscon Arizona, from February 19 - 23,
1990. The aim of the workshop is to plan future SSC experiments by the various
university groups, who would like to contribute, and will include a discussion
on major elementary particle detector concepts, elementary particle detector
components, including central tracking, calorimetry, muon systems, mechanical
systems and assembly, triggering and data acquisition.
