This study addresses the problem of labor-market stratification, examining the
unequal distribution of earnings across occupations. The goal is to document
trends in wage inequality, and to examine possible structural factors that might
explain changes in the way wages are distributed. Despite the importance of this
issue, much of contemporary scientific research focuses on individual abilities
and work experience to explain earnings differentials, neglecting the effects of
structural labor market characteristics. In contrast, Dr. Raffalovich plans to
use pooled cross-sectional time-series data on employment and earnings in the
United States from 1967 through 1981 to determine the impact of structural
factors on wage inequality. Moreover, he also will examine how changes in the
occupational and industrial composition of the national labor force may foster
shifts in earnings inequality over time. Using Current Population Survey data as
well as other government archival sources Dr. Raffalovich will document trends
in wage inequality over the 1967-1981 period, and evaluate the effects of such
factors as economic growth, industrial concentration, unionization, unemployment
and capital intensity. For example, this study will test whether an increase in
capital intensity will shift employment from high earnings to low earnings
occupations. This focus on change in wage inequalities as related to changes in
labor force composition is especially useful, given the recent shifts that have
occurred in occupations and industries, especially the growth of the service
sector of the U.S. economy and the substitution of capital for labor. By keying
in on change, rather than wage inequality at but one point in time, this study
will contribute substantially to our understanding of the dynamics of social
stratification in the contemporary United States.
