Computational Methods for Mixed-Effects Models Douglas M. Bates, U. of
Wisconsin - Madison Abstract This research extends current computational methods
and software implementations for the estimation of parameters in mixed-effects
models. There is a special emphasis on extensions to models where there are
several levels of random effects nested within each other. Another emphasis is
on models where the within-subject response depends nonlinearly on the
parameters of interest. The primary implementation is in the S computer language
and complements current graphical and analytical methods available in that
language. When a response is measured on several occasions for each of several
"subjects" or experimental units, the resulting data are called repeated-
measures data. If the data on each experimental unit are collected over time,
they are also known as longitudinal data. A statistical model for such data will
usually incorporate both fixed effects, parameters that describe the typical
behaviour in the population from which the experimental units are selected, and
random effects, quantaties that describe the variation within the population.
Models with both fixed effects and random effects are called mixed-effects
models. This research provides new computational methods for fitting mixed-
effects models to observed data. The new methods are suitable for use with
parallel computers and with other high performance computing environments. This
is important because some of the applications of mixed-effects models in
manufacturing (evaluation of integrated circuit designs) and biotechnology
(modelling of genetic effects in animal breeding) involve fitting complicated
models to thousands and sometime millions of observations; a task that pushes
the limits of current computers.
