This research project addresses the design of autonomous agents that are
capable of intelligent behavior in dynamic environments with multiple agents.
The focus is on the development of effective techniques for managing
computational resources, with particular attention being given to meta-level
control strategies, i.e., procedures that allocate and monitor the agent's base-
level reasoning resources. Such procedures trade optimality of performance for
time-efficiency, a trade-off that is essential in dynamic or multiagent
environments. Experimentation is being conducted, using a simulation system, to
determine the relative advantages that result from the deployment of alternative
reasoning strategies in various environments.
