9408619 Grossman This research will examine the behavior of the British stock
market before World War 1. The major goal of the study is to understand how the
development of the market for industrial equities in Britain contributed to the
industrial decline of Britain relative to the United States and Germany. It is
noted that the price-dividend ratio in the pre-World War 1 Britain was much
lower than it was later in Britain, and much lower than in other countries. The
study proposes to construct new indices of British industrial stock prices to
examine the extent to which British industrial firms found it difficult to raise
capital, whether British firms were fearful of "high-tech" firms, and whether
the slow growth of managerial capitalism was due to cultural differences. This
study is important because the results would shed light on the general process
of economic growth, and moreover a fuller understanding of Britain's past would
greatly aid in formulating policy for America's future.
