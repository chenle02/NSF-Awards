Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Wenzl&lt;br/&gt;Wenzl's research on (unitary) braid
representations was originally motivated by giving comparatively elementary
constructions of important examples of subfactors. More recently, it has led to
classification results of braided tensor categories whose Grothendieck semi-ring
is the one of a representation category of a classical Lie group or one of the
associated fusion categories. Wenzl plans to continue this study for the missing
cases of spinor groups and exceptional groups. Such a classification provides a
bridge between different approaches towards subfactors via quantum groups, loop
groups and braid groups, which is useful for a number of constructions. In
particular, this will be applied to constructing additional important examples
of subfactors related to coproduct actions and twisted loop groups. Moreover,
Wenzl's analysis of certain braid representations have already found
applications in other approaches to subfactors, such as planar algebras or loop
group constructions; so similar applications would seem likely for the current
project.&lt;br/&gt;Classically, the study of symmetries in physical systems was
closely linked to representation theory of groups. In recent years, however,
results in areas such as conformal field theory, statistical mechanics and
topology required more complicated mathematical tools. In particular, one has
encountered tensor structures where the usual symmetries given via permutations
of tensor factors are replaced by more complicated braiding symmetries. This has
the advantage that one can read off much more information using the
representation theory of the infinite braid groups than it would be possible
with symmetric groups. So one can construct and classify such tensor categories
in many cases by just using results about braid representations. This has been
exploited in Wenzl's previous research, and he plans to apply this strategy for
more complicated cases. This also has the potential for new results in the
classical cases of group symmetries as limiting cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
