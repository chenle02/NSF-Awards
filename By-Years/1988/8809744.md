The objective of this project is to obtain quantitative values for metal-oxygen
bond strengths in oxides used as selective oxidation catalysts. The initial
systems to be studied consist of a monolayer of vanadium oxide supported on
titania or alumina. Differential heats of reduction are determined using a
calorimeter in order to observe changes in heats of reduction as a function of
extent of reduction. Vibrational spectroscopy (if possible, on the same samples
used for calorimetry) will be used to identify the order in which different
oxygens in the structure are reduced. Hopefully, the spectra will correspond to
known structures whose bonds can be can be assigned from literature values, but,
if unusual bonds appear, X-ray analysis will be used to assign the structures.
Surface oxygen bond strengths should be a key parameter for the design of
selective oxidation catalysts, specifically for specialty chemical production.
The data is also relevant in tribology, adhesion, and passivation of
semiconductors.
