9410182 Matzkin Most existing tests of economic models proceed by first,
specifying the functions in the model up to some parameters. Next, the
parameters are estimated, and a test for the restrictions that the model implies
on the values of the estimated parameters is performed. This procedure suffers
typically from two drawbacks. First, if the restrictions are rejected, it is not
clear whether this is due to a wrong model or a wrong parametric specification.
And second, if the restrictions are not rejected, it is not clear whether this
implies any strong evidence in favor of the model, since the restrictions were
only necessary and not sufficient. This project addresses these problems by
developing new methods for the identification, estimation, and testing of
nonparametric models. First, the project will determine how several types of
restrictions, such as inequality restrictions and optimizing behavior, can be
used to guarantee the identification of functions in systems of nonparameteric
simultaneous equations. The systems that will be considered include those with
unobservable endogenous variables, discrete variables, and nondifferentiable
functions. The results of this research will be useful to econometricians
interested in estimating systems of equations that are either nonparametric or
nonlinear in parameters. Second, the project develops nonparametric restrictions
characterizing the behavior of observable variables in economic models. The
results will be useful to falsify specific theories using observable behavior.
Finally, the project develops estimators for nonparametric functions in systems
of equations using weighted average methods and shape- restricted methods.
