Graph structures are special data types that arise naturally in sociology,
economics, public health, computer science, neuroscience, among other areas. In
this project, we develop an innovative graph neural network architecture that is
theoretically sound, computationally efficient, numerically superior, and
versatile for a variety of graph structures. The development will incorporate
many recent advances in graph embedding, dependence testing, and convolutional
neural network. This project will significantly advance the theoretical
foundation of graph neural networks, enable scalable and better graph learning
for data scientists, and is uniquely poised to accelerate discoveries in a many
graph-based applications. The project also provides research training
opportunities for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, the
PIs will start with graph adjacency, and investigate the difference among
spectral embedding, standard neural network, and a novel graph convolutional
neural network. Then the PIs plan to prove that under certain graph models, the
graph convolutional layer can be asymptotically Bayes optimal in supervised
learning. When the graph data is further coupled with node attributes, the PIs
develop an attributed neural network architecture via a distance correlation
screening layer. The project aims to prove its asymptotic optimality in the
presence of node attributes, investigate the relationship between graph
adjacency and node attributes to enable better machine learning, and demonstrate
its superior performance against existing state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and real data. Moreover, the project designs the algorithm in
linear-time computation complexity, making it efficient and scalable to big data
and sparse graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
