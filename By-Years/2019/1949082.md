This project will support the participation of junior researchers (students,
postdocs, and early-career faculty members) in the Nuclei and Mesoscopic Physics
(NMP20) conference that will be held at the Michigan State University on May
4-8, 2020. NMP20 is the sixth conference in this series. The NMP20 conference
provides a forum for theoretical and experimental physicists working at the
interface of nuclear physics, condensed matter, cold temperature physics, and
quantum computing, to discuss topics of current interests at the forefront of
scientific research in those areas. The interactions fostered by this conference
will lead to cross-disciplinary collaborations as well as new ideas that will
provide new understating of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics problems
relevant to the scientific program at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory (NSCL) and future Facility for Rare isotope Beams
(FRIB).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
