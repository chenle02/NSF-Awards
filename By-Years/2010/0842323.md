This proposal is to organize a national workshop to bring together research and
development communities of nanotechnology and high performance computing to
discuss challenge problems in multi-scale modeling and large-scale simulations
for nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed education components influence the
public education systems in science and technology through Virtual School of
Science and Engineering by NSF-OCI sponsored Great Lakes Consortium Project and
HPC University project initiated by NSF TeraGrid.&lt;br/&gt;
