Studies aimed at establishing new building design approaches which incorporate
innovative concepts relating to force, deformation, energy, and economy will be
conducted. This work will address important problems in the relationship between
ground motion and system resistance in terms of the system's cyclic behavior and
energy absorption, system modeling for both linear and nonlinear responses, and
upgrading of design approaches.
