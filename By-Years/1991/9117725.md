The Pontide range in northern Turkey presents a paleo- geographical paradox.
The geological data available favor the Pontides as part of the Eurasian plate
since the mid-Jurassic closure of the PaleoTethys Ocean, but three independent
paleo- magnetic studies that were unconstrained by fold tests have indicated
paleolatitudes significantly different from that of the Eurasian plate margin.
This study will resolve the apparent discrepancy by field work and the use of
modern paleomagnetic techniques on Jurassic and Cretaceous volcanic and
sedimentary rocks in the Pontides. The results will have important implications
for paleogeographic reconstructions and plate motions since the Jurassic and
will help resolve the tectonic complexities along the margins of the Eurasian
and African plates.
