The Department of Chemistry is acquiring apparatus for thermal analysis.
Experiments focusing on thermal techniques for characterizing chemical systems
are being adapted from the current chemical literature for use in the advanced
undergraduate curriculum. The ability to rapidly obtain experimental information
from differential calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is
substantially increasing the number of students who experience hands-on
laboratory applications of thermodynamics to molecular systems and polymeric
materials, thereby strengthening student research in chemistry, biochemistry,
and inorganic/materials science. Differential thermal methods are useful for
determining composition and identification, for providing thermal information on
fusion, desolvation, dehydration, oxidation, reduction, adsorption, degradation,
and solid-state reactions. From these thermodynamic values, entropy changes and
the rates of reactions and transitions are being determined.
