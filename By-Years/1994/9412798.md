9412798 Pancake This proposal requests support for academic participation at the
first General Meeting of the Parallel Tools Consortium, to be held in early June
of 1994. In addition to general discussions of the Consortium's goals,
directions, and projects, the 2.5-day meeting will include a series of breakout
sessions where joint tool projects will serve as the impetus for structured
dialogue between tool developers and tool users.
