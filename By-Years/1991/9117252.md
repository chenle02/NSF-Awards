Although the indole alkaloid ajmalicine, obtained from Catharanthus roseus, is
not an important product in the U.S., it serves as a useful model for the
development of an "enabling technology" for the efficient production of
potentially more important compounds, such as taxol. Previous work has shown
that combining four treatment strategies can result in a 50-fold increase in the
extracellular production of ajmalicine. These four strategies are: (1)
elicitation; (2) production medium development; (3) calcium alginate
immobilization; and (4) in situ adsorption with XAD-7 resin. They interacted
synergistically, and were accomplished in batch reactors. Attempts with repeated
batch cultivation revealed difficulties in sustaining a high level of
production. This work seeks to answer the following questions: (1) what factors
cause the loss of productivity and alterations in cell physiology during
prolonged culture; and (2) is continuous high-level production using the
combined four strategies possible?
