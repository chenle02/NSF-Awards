0104605&lt;br/&gt;Smith&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Kevin Smith and students
from Boston University in a collaboration with Ralf Nyholm at the MAX-lab
synchrotron radiation facility in the University of Lund, Sweden. The project
will focus on the study of structural properties of wide band gap nitride
semiconductors using photoelectron microscopy, in which area Professor Nyholm is
an expert. The new collaborations will combine the skills of the two labs to
address issues of fundamental importance in nitride semiconductors, and a high
level of productivity is expected from combining the separate but complementary
expertise of the U.S. and Swedish groups. Among the specific goals of the
proposed work are an understanding of microscopic surface electronic properties
of clean binary nitride semiconductors, understanding adsorption of simple gas
molecules on well-characterized nitride surfaces, understanding growth,
structure, and stability of metal contact overlayers, understanding the thermal
decomposition of complex nitride alloy surfaces, and training of
students.&lt;br/&gt;
