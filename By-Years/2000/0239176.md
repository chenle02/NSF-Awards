This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a
unique computational tool for heat transport prediction in industrial devices by
hybridizing our Digital Physics technology based on Lattice Boltzmann Methods
(LBM) for hydrodynamics with efficient partial differential equation (PDE)
solution for heat transfer. The project will start with the development and
implementation of a wide range of physical features including variable
thermodynamic and kinetic molecular properties as well as flow dependent
turbulent/transitional Prandtl number, followed by introducing algorithms that
ensure stable, accurate, and noiseless performance of the full-physics LBM/PDE
algorithm. Upon algorithm optimization and benchmarking, we will focus on full
thermal studies of industrial devices provided by our commercial customers.
These beta tests will be followed by Phase III commercialization. The hybrid
thermal transport prediction tool for development in this Phase II SBIR project
will open major new commercial markets for our current PowerFLOW product,
especially at the engineering design level, as well as open important new
markets for novel technologies in various industrial problems ranging from
classical macroscopic flows to microscopic flows like those in MEMS devices.
This new technology should also establish new markets for computer aided
engineering (CAE), especially in manufacturing industries.
