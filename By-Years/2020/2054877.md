A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
intellectual leadership of TCUP institutions so that they can address scientific
or engineering needs or interests, specifically for their tribes or communities,
or broadly for the Nation. The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers)
strand allows TCUP institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM
instructional and research capacity. This project aligns directly with that
goal, and moreover will extend the body of knowledge and number and credentials
of tribal members who seek to ensure stewardship of the ecology and restoration
of sovereignty over reservation lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aaniiih Nakoda
College embarks on an extensive and interconnected set of studies to learn about
and restore and sustain the native ecology of the Fort Belknap Indian Community
(FBIC). Working with partners from FBIC, the Smithsonian’s Conservation Biology
Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, and Little Dog Wildlife, the TEA Center will
study the impact of reintroduction of several native species to the reservation.
Key among these studies is the effect of buffalo (American bison) on the plains
ecology, including flora, and is paralleled by studies on the curlew, black-
footed ferret, swift fox, and prairie dogs. Project personnel will conduct
ecological research on the Fort Belknap buffalo herd and its associated
grassland habitat and species. Research projects will address identified needs
and priorities of the FBIC and support the sustainable management and protection
of the buffalo herd and surrounding prairie landscapes – now and in the future.
The project will provide academic training and community education to prepare
future caretakers of tribal wildlife and associated natural resources and to
increase community knowledge of, and support for, sustainable management of Fort
Belknap's buffalo herd and its habitat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
