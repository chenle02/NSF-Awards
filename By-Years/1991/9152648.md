Physical chemistry students will be introduced to atomic and molecular
spectroscopy through a series of experiments involving rotational, vibrational,
and electronic transitions. The major components of the requested equipment are
an FTIR spectrophotometer with resolution of 0.5 wavenumbers sufficient for gas-
phase rotation-vibration spectroscopy, and a laser- Raman or laser-fluorescence
set up for Raman spectroscopy and spectroscopy of iodine. Laser-fluorescence
experiments will also be performed in the Advanced Analytical lab course to
teach students the analytical uses of fluorimetry. The grantee will overmatch
the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
