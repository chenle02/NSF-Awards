This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Marcos Salganicoff, will work with Dr. Ruzena
Bajcsy on problems involving robot control and planning. The research will blend
learning, data structures, and parallelism. Planning information will be stored
in binary trees (such a k-D-trees or quadtrees). This information, usually
massive amounts of it, is then used in learning algorithms. A hybrid approach
using distributed workstations for some of the computation and a MIMD computer
for some of the rest will be employed to implement these learning algorithms in
a cost effective manner.
