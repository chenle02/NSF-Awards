Lay Abstract PI: Foster, Thomas Proposal Number: IBN-9723055 Cognitive ability
is dependent on the pattern of connections among nerve cells and the ability to
transmit information between cells. Learning involves the adjustment of this
transmission as a result of experience. There are a variety of mechanisms that
could potentially alter the communication between cells in the brain. This
project examines one of those mechanism, the ability of cells to adjust their
release of the chemical substances important in transmitting information from
one cell to another, in an important part of the brain called the hippocampus.
Behavioral experiments dissociate the different aspects of experience that are
critical for the modification of transmission between cells in the brain, while
physiological experiments at the cellular level test hypotheses about the
mechanism by which the communication between these cells is altered to reflect
this experience. Examination of the role of different aspects of experience in
driving the changes in cell function provides important information about
learning. Combining this with studies of the cellular processes underlying these
changes provides important information necessary to understand fundamental
mechanisms by which the brain learns and adapts to novel environments, as well
as processes important in development, aging, and recovery from injury.
