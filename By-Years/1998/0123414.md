This project supports the travel of U.S. academic researchers to attend the
fifth in a series of major international symposia on bulk power systems dynamics
and control. This particular symposium will be held in Onomichi City, Japan on
August 26-31, 2001 and will focus on "Security and Reliability in a changing
environment". The purpose of this project is to stimulate participation by U.S.
faculty and students by providing a portion of their travel expenses.
