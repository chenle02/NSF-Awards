The quality of plant products which have been frozen for storage can be
compromised by the damaging effects of ice growth within the frozen tissue. A
number of proteins have been identified which can inhibit ice crystal growth
when present in very low concentrations. We will study a gene for one of these
proteins cloned into plants. In addition, the gene will be modified so that the
protein it codes for is larger and more easily detected (by fusion to protein A
from Staphylococcus aureus), and is secreted from plant cells (by the attachment
of secretion signal sequences). The ability of the transformed plants to express
and localise the fusion proteins will be determined. Simple assays which measure
the damage caused by ice crystal growth in frozen plant tissue will be used to
assess the ability of the protein to protect against this damage. This approach
offers a novel way of improving the quality of frozen fruits and vegetables, and
increasing the range of fruits and vegetables that can be successfully frozen.
