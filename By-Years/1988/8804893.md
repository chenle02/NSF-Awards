The research on this grant is in two areas of algebraic geometry, namely,
singularities and invariant theory. In the field of singularities, the main aims
are to construct geometrically meaningful compactifications of moduli spaces for
surfaces of general type, to give a complete description of the versal
deformation space of a quotient surface singularity and to analyze the geometry
of canonical threefold singularities. In invariant theory the aim is to extend
the recent results on the rationality of orbit spaces, namely, an attempt to
prove the rationality of the moduli spaces of curves of genus three and five
will be made. The subject of this research is algebraic geometry, the study of
the geometric objects one obtains as solutions of algebraic equations. The study
of the singularities in these objects (cusps etc) is important for the
understanding of their properties. Moreover the rationality of space of curves
of a fixed type is a topic of much research.
