This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team in theoretical
hydrology to address the problem of defining rigorously the relation between
macroscopic, catchment-scale parameters describing runoff generation, net
recharge, or groundwater flow through scaling procedures applied to the non-
linear mathematical description of the underlying, local-scale physics. The
project objectives are: (1) To drive, using rigorous methods in the analysis of
spatial data, a catchment-scale, process-based model of streamflow generation in
systems that are highly variable at the local scale. (2) To develop improved
methods of conditioning stochastic models of catchment-scale spatial
variability. (3) To investigate the general consequences of scale-invariance in
the local-scale velocity field for predictive models of subsurface water flows
in heterogenous media. The results obtained will contribute to understanding the
scale dependence and scale invariance of fundamental hydrologic processes as
they are resolved from the field plot experiment to the regional or drainage-
basin response.//
