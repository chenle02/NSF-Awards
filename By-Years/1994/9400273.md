9400273 Weinstein The main thrust of the work will be to optimize additives for
example platinum and samarium in the 123 superconductors and study the grain
size effect on the superconducting properties. Grain size of 211 phase, cracking
of 123 grains under magnetic pressure and conversion of the magnetic stored
energy to heat will also be studies. The Principal Investigator also propose to
study development of characterization of superconductors via mapping of vector
trapped field. %%% The effects of additive and the presence of the second phase
on the superconducting and mechanical properties will be studied in the proposed
work. A vector trapped field method will be developed for the characterization
of superconductors. ***
