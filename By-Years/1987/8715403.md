This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemistry. Within the broad area of chemically modified
electrodes, three research themes are being pursued: (1) fundamental
investigations of electrochemical reactions of and in polymeric media; (2)
development of microstructured electrode systems and their applications to
polymer studies; and (3) basic and applied studies of electron transfer
chemistry, electroanalysis, electrocatalysis, and transport processes in polymer
phases. Specifically, electron self exchange reactions that are driven by
intense electrical potential gradients applied to non-ionically conductive,
mixed valent electroactive polymers are being studied, electrochemical
techniques to study transport processes in polymer phases are being developed,
the effects of polymer viscosity and elevated temperatures on the rates of
heterogeneous reactions at polymer/electrode interfaces are being probed, new
electrocatalytic routes for the activation of dioxygen as a useful synthetic
reagent are being devised, and new electrochemical processes for the formation
of thin polymeric films are being explored. This research should yield new
insights into the fundamental physical chemistry of polymers that will enable
their effective utilization in novel electrochemical sensor technology.
Additionally, new electrosynthetic processes that lead to useful materials are
expected to be identified.
