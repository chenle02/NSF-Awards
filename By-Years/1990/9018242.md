With this award, the Chemistry Division is supporting efforts in the area of
curriculum development by sponsoring a two-day workshop for the 51 current
chemistry Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site directors and
interested persons from the Foundation. The aims of the workshop, to be held at
the Foundation during September 19-21, 1990, are: 1) to discuss the role of
chemistry research in the undergraduate curriculum and in the students' career
choices, 2) to assess the impact of the REU Program on undergraduate education,
on subsequent enrollment in graduate chemistry-related research programs and on
ultimate career decisions, 3) to formulate specific proposals for the
enhancement and increased effectiveness of the REU Program and the operation of
individual sites, and 4) to develop strategies for expanding the visibility of
the Program. The concrete results of the workshop will be 1) a "White Paper"
summarizing the conclusions of the workshop, a document which will serve in part
to advise those at the Foundation who are involved in the REU Program, 2) a set
of guidelines for REU site directors, and 3) plans for a future symposium at a
National Meeting of the American Chemical Society dealing with undergraduate
research and the REU Program. It is anticiupated that the overall impact of the
workshop will be an improvement in opportunities for direct student exposure to
research and an increase in the number of people opting for research careers.
