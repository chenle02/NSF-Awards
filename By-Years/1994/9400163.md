Rudnick 9400163 This research is concerned with understanding the asymtotic
distribution of rational points on affine varieties in accordance with
predictions based on the circle of method of Hard and Littlewood. One part deals
with general varieties, proposes a notion of Hardy-Littlewood variety and
defines an invariant for measuring the deviation of such a variety from
satisfying a precise asymptotic of Hardy-Littlewood type. Obstructions of
algebro-geometric and arithmetic nature to a variety being Hardy-Littlewood are
found. The other part is concerned with studying examples which are homogeneous
spaces for semisimple groups, by combining results about the density of points
in orbits of arithmetic groups with versions of mass formulae to obtain
asymptotic results of Hardy-Littlewood type. The research is in the field of
algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which
blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polymonials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. ***
