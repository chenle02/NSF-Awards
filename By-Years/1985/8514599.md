An experimental study is conducted of the phase equilibria behavior of selected
ethane + hydrocarbon binary and ethane + propane + hydrocarbon ternary mixtures,
which can contribute to the understanding of the phase equilibria behavior of
rich gas-enhanced oil recovery systems. Vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid-vapor, and
solid-liquid-vapor phase equilibria of binary mixtures of ethane + n-paraffins
and ethane + n-alkylbenzenes are studied. Also, the vapor-liquid and liquid-
liquid-vapor phase equilibria of a ternary mixture of ethane + propane +
n-paraffin are studied to evaluate how liquid-liquid-vapor phase behavior can
occur in an appropriate solvent mix of ethane + propane for a hydrocarbon which
is not liquid-liquid-vapor immiscible with either solvent species. The studies
are performed with a visual cell apparatus in the temperature range of 0 to
125;soC at pressures up to 1500 psia.
