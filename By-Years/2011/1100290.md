This collaborative research award provides funding for understanding and
controlling the key factors in the local nanoscale thermal reduction of graphene
oxide. In particular, the combination of computational modeling with experiments
will give access to the efficiency and rate of the local thermal reduction
during the thermochemical nanolithography process, and to the ultimate writing
speed and resolution of this technique. The reduced form of graphene oxide (GO)
is an attractive alternative to graphene for producing large-scale flexible
conductors, supercapacitors, mechanical resonators, and for creating devices
that require an electronic gap. Thermochemical nanolithography is a new
nanofabrication technique in which heated probe tips can be used to locally
control and tune the reduction of GO and pattern nanoscale regions of reduced GO
within a GO sheet at speeds of several Âµm/s, with a resolution of 12 nm. The
goal is the transition of this technology to arrays of several cantilevers with
hot tips for parallel writing, and the integration of reduced GO nanostructures
into field effect transistors prototypes.

The research will contribute to elucidate at the atomic-scale the structural
properties of GO, the mechanisms driving the reduction process, and the
physical-chemical transformations resulting from local heat transfer. This novel
understanding will be converted into a modeling scheme to be used to engineering
the nano-patterning process. This study will improve the community?s
understanding of nanoscale processes and potentially provide inexpensive and
robust tools to decrease the cost of nano-manufacturing. Since this project will
be developed in close collaboration with an Italian group of the Politecnico of
Milano, it will enable exchange of graduate students. In the current climate of
outsourcing and globalization of economy, international training is an essential
component for the education of our next generation of leaders.
