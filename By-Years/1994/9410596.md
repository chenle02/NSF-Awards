9410596 Totah University of Iowa New chiral ligands based on the 1,7-dioxaspiro
5.5 undecane ring system will be prepared and evaluated on their ability to
induce asymmetry in organic transformations as well as their ability to serve as
hosts to cationic guests. Enantioselectivity and complex configuration will be
evaluated by GC, HPLC, NMR, and x-ray crystallographic analysis. Computer
modeling will be used to understand enantioselectivity induced by these systems.
This Research Planning Grant from the Chemistry Division supports the research
of Professor Nancy I. Totah at the University of Iowa. Molecules that complex
metal ions and molecules that possess a positive charge will be prepared. These
complexing molecules will also possess an array of atoms that is unique and
related to either a right- or left-orientation. The term chiral ("handedness")
is used for this particular type of array. These chiral complexes will be
evaluated to determine if they will act as catalysts to incorporate chiral into
molecules in chemical reactions.
