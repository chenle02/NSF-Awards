ABSTRACT CTS-9407827 University of Delaware P.I.: N. Kobayashi A combined
modeling and experimental approach to assist in the understanding of beach
erosion will be undertaken. A hydrodynamic model will be developed to predict
the spatial and temporal variations of breaking wave velocities, shear stress
and turbulence intensity in the surf and swash zones. Experiments will be
conducted in a wave flume in which the fluid velocities in the thin bottom
boundary layer on a rough bottom will be measured. Turbulence measurements in
the surf zone will be used to elucidate the processes of the turbulence
generation, advection, diffusion and dissipation in the surf zone as well as to
calibrate and evaluate the turbulence model adopted in the numerical studies.
Velocity and free surface measurements will be used to evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of the developed numerical model for predicting the spatial and
temporal variations of fluid velocities and shear stress under breaking regular
and irregular waves.
