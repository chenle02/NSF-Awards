This project is focused on improving the measurement methods for gaseous
oxidized mercury (GOM) in the atmosphere. Development will continue on a simple,
calibrated system for passive sampling of GOM followed by thermal desorption.
Mass spectrometric analysis will be used to identify specific GOM compounds in
the environment. A variety of collection and pre-concentration materials and
configurations will be tested. A field-ready calibrator for oxidized mercury
compounds will be built that will allow for routine verification of GOM
measurements by Tekran and other measurement systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaseous oxidized mercury compounds are easily converted to
methyl mercury, the form of mercury that is of most concern for human and
ecosystem health. These compounds are also of concern because they can become
efficiently taken up by ecosystems. This project will improve our understanding
of the chemistry and fate of mercury in the environment.
