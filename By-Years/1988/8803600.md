The October 1, 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake generated strong ground motions
that were recorded by numerous accelerograph stations throughout southern
California. One station, located in Tarzana, approximately 44 kilometers west of
the earthquake's epicenter, recorded unusually high peak accelerations. The peak
accelerations, which are high frequency motions, are between 4 and 10 times
greater than the peak accelerations recorded at nearby stations. The Tarzana
accelerograph was calibrated shortly after the earthquake, and no indication of
instrument malfunction was apparent in the strong motion accelerogram. This
research project will investigate this anomalously high acceleration recording,
on the supposition that it was a result of soil-structure interaction between
the accelerograph station and the soil in which it is embedded. Such an effect
was found to exist in an earlier study by the principal investigator at an
accelerograph station that had a number of design features in common with the
Tarzana station. The purpose to this study is (1) to determine the extent of any
soil- structure interaction that may have contributed to the large recorded
accelerations, (2) develop reliable analytical models to predict the soil-
structure interaction effects at this station, and (3) remove the soil-structure
interaction effects from the accelerogram to obtain the free-field motion.
