The proposal is to conduct analytical and experimental research on real-time
distributed digital control systems with time-varying time delays and multirate
sampling. The research will involve analysis of the dynamic performance and
stability of such systems, development of robust design algorithms for real-time
control systems which share a communication network medium, and experimental
verification of the analytical results and design algorithms on a network
testbed. The results of this research will add to the knowledge and technology
base for design of distributed communication and control systems for complex
dynamic processes such as automated manufacturing systems, chemical plants,
interconnected electric power generation systems, and advanced aircraft.
