It is anticipated that subalpine wetlands in the Sierra Nevada of California
will be subjected to hydrological change as a result of water divertion and
predicted climate change. This project will examine the resistance and
resilience to changing water levels. This will be done by monitoring plant and
community responses to changing water levels in a small marsh adjacent to lake
Tahoe and by a series of autecological studies of containerized plants for which
the water regime can be varied and controlled. A variety of measures of plant
resource and performance will be followed both in the field and gardens.
