This program will strengthen middle and high school science and mathematics
teaching by joint efforts of exemplary teachers and college and industry
scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. Twenty exemplary teachers will be
selected for recognition and involvement in an ongoing program of materials
development and teacher enhancement. The knowledge of ten of these teachers will
be expanded through a summer work program in local industries. Industry and
university scientists/engineers will be enlisted to form triads with the
teachers to design and develop classroom materials and activities based on the
industrial experience. Use of these materials in college teacher preparation
courses and for inservice training of other local practicing teachers will
extend the impact of the program. The ultimate objective will be to better
prepare students for the world of work, whether they chose to enter that world
immediately or wait until completion of some further post-secondary education.
Cost sharing by the partners will total 67% of the NSF funding.
