9632395 SULLIVAN As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies,
Phase 2 program this project will conduct laboratory and field studies of
impacts of invertebrate predators on fish eggs and larvae on Georges Bank.
Predation-related mortality is one loss term affecting populations of the target
species of fishes and copepods on Georges Bank. This project will utilize
mesocosm experiments to determine prey selection and feeding rates of the
planktonic hydroid, Clytia gracilis, at times the most abundant predator in this
region, and the ctenophore, Pleurobrachia pileus, the only invertebrate
confirmed to be feeding on eggs and larvae of cod. The field component of this
project will provide abundance data on hydroids and other invertebrate predators
and their prey. These laboratory and field results will be combined to estimate
predation- related mortality in the context of physical mechanisms that act to
concentrate or disperse plankton. ***
