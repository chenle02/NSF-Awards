Perturbative corrections to the Migdal-Kadanoff recursion relations are being
extended to include second order terms in the perturbation. The extended theory
will be used to analyze the Ising Model in a transverse magnetic field as a test
of the method. It is hoped that the extended theory will give improved critical
point predictions as well as improved values for the various critical indices
such as the critical exponents for the correlation length, the magnetization,
specific heat, and the spin-spin correlation function. The phase structure of Zp
gauge theories will then be examined in an attempt to predict theoretically the
results of the Monte-Carlo calculations of M. Creutz and M. Okawa, regarded in
this context as experimental data.
