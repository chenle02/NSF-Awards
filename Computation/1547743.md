Recent developments in software for solving nonlinear polynomial systems may
provide many scientists and engineers the tools needed to solve key problems in
their research. To facilitate the training necessary to make best use of these
powerful tools, the PIs will run a workshop May 23-25, 2016 at the University of
Notre Dame. In addition to training, the workshop will also provide cross-
fertilization between the mathematical sciences and other areas of science and
engineering by bringing together a diverse group of researchers and software
developers to exchange both knowledge and challenges. These interactions will
spur practical research in applications while highlighting needs for future
algorithm development. Since they arise in many areas of science and
engineering, several approaches have been developed for solving polynomial
systems. The software package Bertini, which is being redeveloped in C++ and
Python for modularity and scriptability, implements key numerical algebraic
geometric algorithms for solving and manipulating polynomial systems. This
workshop will bring together a wide range of computational scientists and
practitioners to discuss recent progress and current challenges in software,
algorithms, and applications of numerical algebraic geometry. This
interdisciplinary workshop will include small group discussions, hands-on
demonstrations of Bertini, and sessions focused on developing Bertini modules
related to participants' particular interests.
