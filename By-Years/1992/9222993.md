The International Congress for Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences is the
largest and most important international meeting for anthropologists in the
world and it is held every two years in different countries. This project is a
request for a block travel grant to support American anthropologists so they may
travel to Mexico City to attend the 13th congress in July 1993. The American
Anthropological Association will administer the award by holding a competition.
Selection criteria will include quality of abstract, role of applicant in
congress (e.g., chairing a session), junior scholar status, and the applicant's
ability to broadly represent American anthropology (sex, ethnicity, etc.).
Standard awards will be of $500 and are to defray the costs of travel only.
