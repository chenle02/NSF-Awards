This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: NanO StUdio: An Immersive Ambience for Nano Educational
Experiences", at Ohio University under the direction of Dr. Savas Kaya, will
establish an innovative and immersive educational platform, the nanO stUdio, for
undergraduates at Ohio University. The nanO stUdio is a publicly accessible
showroom run by a team of undergraduates and designed to impress audio-visually
and provide hands-on educational experiences related to nanomaterials,
nanostructures, nanosensors, nanodevices and advanced microscopy techniques. The
nanO stUdio is the product of a vision to bring the nano-scale science and
engineering out of the sterile clean room environments to the public level where
both the students and visitors can explore new developments, and have a
realistic and correct understanding of the materials, devices and capabilities
endowed by nanotechnology.

The proposed learning studio concept goes well beyond the development of a
conventional laboratory component or courseware, which has been the focus of
many NUE proposals to date. In addition to the major objective of undergraduate
student recruitment and training, the project also provides a means for the area
high school students, parents and other interested parties to learn about
principles and tools used in nanoscience and nanoengineering. As a crosscutting
program, it will also provide summer research opportunities and stipends for the
undergraduate students in the impoverished and underserved southeastern corner
of Ohio bordering West Virginia and Kentucky.
