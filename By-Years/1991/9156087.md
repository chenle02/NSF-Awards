Biology teaching should incorporate the process of scientific inquiry, not just
the information resulting from it. Only by involving students directly in
scientific experimentation and intellectual debate can they be expected to
develop the fundamental understanding of biology required for biological
literacy. Engaging students in this process demands a classroom that motivates
learning, teaches analytical skills as well as information, and captures the
spirit of curiosity and questioning. To meet these demands for the broadest
spectrum of students we will address three objectives. First, we will design and
evaluate simple, low-cost experimental exercises that illustrate fundamental
biological principles and can be conducted in an introductory course without a
laboratory. Second, we will construct a set of exercises in scientific study
skills that will address the difficulty, shared by many college students, of
learning scientific material. The innovative aspect of our approach to study
skills is that we will teach them in a forum that is tightly coupled with the
biology instruction, which will provide for exchange between the biology
instructor and the study skills instructor. Finally, drawing on cooperative
learning approaches that are highly effective in other fields, we will develop
exercises that can be used to involve all members of small or large classes in
active thinking and learning. The product of this project will be a published
manual that will explore the philosophy of building community in the classroom
and will describe the exercises in experimentation, study skills, and
cooperative learning that can be incorporated into introductory-level biology
curricula.
