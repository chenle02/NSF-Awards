This award supports cooperative research in the regulation and reaction
mechanisms of key enzymes in photosynthesis to be carried out by Gerald Edwards
of Washington State University along with Marion O'Leary of the University of
Nebraska Department of Biochemistry and two researchers from the Department of
Biochemistry at the University of Rosario in Argentina, Carlos Andreo and
Alberto Iglesias. Photosynthesis is of fundamental importance as a biological
process and this study will focus on carbon-4 photosynthesis and its mechanism
and control by intrinsic and environmental factors. The primary role of the
Argentinian team will be to apply their expertise in enzyme purification,
quarternary structure and the identification of functional groups. The U.S.
scientists will identify cold-tolerant varieties of important crops, synthesize
substrate analogs and locate the position of functional groups on enzymes. Thus
the complementary expertise of three laboratories will study the key enzymes of
the C-4 pathway of photosynthesis which allows crops to assimilate carbon
dioxide at high rates under optimum conditions.
