Recommendation: The project will address the problem of fractionation of stable
isotopes in disequilibrium with seawater by planktonic and benthic species, and
therefore the erroneous environmental signal contain in their isotopic record.
The PIs will use culture populations of the benthic foraminiferal species,
Ammonia beccarri, under controlled experiments to determine what environments
generate isotopic disequilbrium in marine sediments. Up to 2000 individuals at
12 temperature/salinity/sediment-carbon combinations will be cultured. Effects
on shell morphology, stable-isotopic composition of shells and surrounding pore
waters will be determined to quantify the environmental role in
morphology/isotope behavior. Funds are provided for two years and the funding
will be shared between MGG, BP and CO programs.
