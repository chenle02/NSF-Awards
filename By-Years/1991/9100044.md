The first part of the proposal continues a current project: first, NMR will be
used to measure spin transport in a dilute 3He-4He solution, using a spin-wave
technique, in order to test a new theory for polarized quantum gases. In a
second experiment, one will use a vibrating-wire viscometer to directly measure
the effects of polarization upon momentum transport. In addition, attempts will
be made to create nuclear magnetic solitons, and to detect hypothesized spin
fluctuations in pure 3He liquid using an NMR spin-diffusion technique. The
second part of the proposal deals with effects in a quantum liquid confined at
low temperature in a random porous material. First, one will use a 3He-4He
solution to probe random geometries over much longer length scales than is
possible at room temperature. Secondly, a search will be made for effects
analogous to those seen in disordered electronic systems -- conductance
fluctuations and weak and strong localization resulting from quantum or spin-
wave interference within the random pore space.
