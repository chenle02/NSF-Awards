OIA-0116595&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dave&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
and four colleagues in the Mechanical Engineering and the Chemical Engineering
Departments request funding for the purchase of a field emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM). This instrument will be used in their research in
particle technology. It will enhance their capability to characterize particles
at nano and submicron scales. When such data are incorporated into their
predictive numerical model, better results are anticipated. The institutional
support of NJIT is very strong with cost-sharing at ~50% level.&lt;br/&gt;
