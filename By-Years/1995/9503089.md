Quantitative models of the human speech production system are needed for a
better understanding of our cognitive abilities and for the development of high-
quality speech synthesizers and automatic speech recognition systems. In the
proposed research, production models for fricative consonants are developed.
Modeling fricative consonants has always been a challenging problem because of
the complex production mechanisms and the lack of sufficient articulatory and
aerodynamic data for these sounds. In this study, articulatory data are obtained
from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and Dynamic Electropalatography (EPG), and
aerodynamic data, from flow and pressure measurements. MRI reveals the 3D
geometry of the vocal tract while EPG is important for studying articulatory
dynamics. Aerodynamic data are crucial for studying turbulence generation during
fricative production. The modeling approach is based on estimation theory,
acoustics, and signal-processing techniques and uses the data obtained from the
unified set of measurements described above. Although the study focuses on
fricatives, the proposed novel approach can be used to study all speech sounds.
In addition, the study fosters cross-disciplinary activities in Electrical
Engineering, Radiology, and Linguistics. By developing parametric speech
production models and by inferring articulatory dynamics from the acoustic
waveform, better performance of speech synthesizers and speech recognition
systems can be achieved.
