This award supports cooperative research on three aspects of the marine nitrogen
cycle between scientists at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and Dr. K.K.
Liu from the Institute of Earth Sciences, Taiwan. The biogeochemical cycle of
nitrogen in the environment is one of the most important but least understood
topics in the earth sciences. The marine nitrogen cycle is probably more complex
than other biologically essential elements. This study will focus on the
controlling factors of nitrogen isotopic composition of dissolved and
pareticulate nitrogen species; the isotopic imprint of nitrogen fixers; and
isotopic records in the sedimentary column. This research will involve
contributions by an isotopic geochemist, a geochemist, and a biological
oceanographer. The project is jointly sponsored by NSF and the National Science
Council of Taiwan.
