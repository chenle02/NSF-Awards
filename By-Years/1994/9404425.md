This project studies existence, uniqueness and methods for calculating a
smoothly varying singular value decomposition of a smooth matrix valued
function. The smooth singular value decomposition has applications in
differential algebraic equations including time dependent optimal control
problems for descriptor systems. Preliminary work with real analytic functions
is to be extended to a larger class of smooth functions and more efficient
numerical methods for tracking all of or part of a smoothly varying singular
value decomposition are being investigated. This project is also developing
numerical methods for calculating the controllability radius, regularity radius,
and other distances of interest in computational control. It is developing
efficient, provably reliable, numerically stable methods. Success here will
generalize to a means of estimating the distance from a generic matrix pencil to
an algebraic variety of nongeneric pencils and to general condition estimators.
