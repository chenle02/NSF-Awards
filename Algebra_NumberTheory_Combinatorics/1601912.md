This project is concerned with geometric and analytic approaches to the study of
solutions of Diophantine equations, one of the oldest branches of mathematics.
The study of Diophantine equations involves finding whole number solutions to
polynomial equalities, a remarkably difficult problem -- it is not possible to
devise a process with a finite number of operations that can decide whether a
general Diophantine equation has a solution. This area of mathematics is finding
applications in a range of fields in theoretical and practical computer science,
from encryption protocols to error correcting and data management. It is also
driving the development of sophisticated algorithms to test numerically some of
the theoretical predictions. This project aims to deepen and extend knowledge in
this important subject.

Specifically, the project is concerned with cohomological obstructions to the
existence of rational and integral points on algebraic surfaces, investigations
of arithmetic implications of derived equivalence for K3 surfaces, geometric and
analytic approaches to asymptotics of rational points of bounded height on
higher-dimensional varieties, and with the study of variation of arithmetic
properties in families of varieties.
