Farrell 9622744 The investigator, together with colleagues in Ireland and
Russia, develops epsilon-uniformly convergent finite difference schemes for
singularly perturbed equations. Unlike classical schemes, such schemes have the
advantage that the errors do not depend on an inverse power of the small
parameter epsilon, and hence do not become unbounded as epsilon approaches zero.
The aim of this project is to develop methods for a number of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations, and linear and nonlinear partial differential equations
of elliptic and parabolic type, using meshes that are condensed (refined) in the
boundary layers. These meshes usually involve at least one free parameter. They
investigate the influence of these parameters on the accuracy of the
approximation and the speed of convergence of linear and nonlinear solvers. The
investigator implements these methods on parallel (shared memory) and
distributed computers. This involves theoretical work on convergence of Schwarz
type methods of domain decomposition and their parallel variants, as well as
comparisons of the efficiency of various parallel and sequential methods. They
also study efficient solvers for the linear systems arising from these problems,
which can be highly nonsymmetric for small epsilon. Singularly perturbed
differential equations are pervasive in applications of mathematics to problems
in the sciences and engineering. Among these are the Navier-Stokes equations of
fluid flow at high Reynolds number, the drift-diffusion equations of
semiconductor device physics, the Michaelis-Menten theory for enzyme reactions,
and mathematical models of liquid crystal materials and of chemical reactions.
The development of efficient generalizable methods for such equations, which
yield guaranteed bounds on the error independent of the value of the small
perturbation parameter, is thus of considerable significance in a number of
important areas.
