They offer many advantages over traditional mesh-based methods, particularly for problems with complex or moving geometries, large deformations of materials, or other singular behaviors of solutions. The goal of this project is to investigate an innovative approach for designing and analyzing meshfree and particle methods through the study of continuum nonlocal models and their robust discretizations. A central idea is to design ""asymptotically compatible schemes"" with respect to the nonlocal/integral relaxation scale of PDEs so as to advance the stability, accuracy and efficiency of meshfree and particle methods. The proposed research will advance the theoretical understanding of meshfree and particle methods and enhance their practical performance and functionality. Central to the project is an integrated plan of educational goals, and these include promoting the engagement and retention of female and underrepresented groups in math and science, enhancing applied and computational mathematics curricula, and disseminating new scientific discoveries. The PI proposes a variety of activities that aim at promoting computational thinking in middle/high school students and teachers, inspiring and preparing undergraduates for early research experience, and contributing to a more connected and inclusive intellectual environment. <br/><br/>The project primarily focuses on three objectives. The first is the development of monotone meshfree methods for elliptic equations via nonlocal relaxation. This includes the study of linear and nonlinear elliptic equations in Euclidean space and on manifolds. The central theme is to preserve the monotonicity in the discretization while keeping a compact selection of nearby points. The second subject is meshfree methods for systems of equations via the study of nonlocal vector calculus. The study of well-posed nonlocal models through nonlocal vector calculus is crucial for designing of stable numerical discretizations, without which instabilities are often observed (e.g., in the SPH method and peridynamics correspondence model). In the last subproject, we focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of Lagrange type particle methods for nonlinear time-dependent PDEs through nonlocal analysis. The discussion includes aggregation equation, degenerate diffusion, and convection-diffusion equation. The study of Wasserstein gradient flows will also be needed for rigorous convergence studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large swath of modern number theory is concerned with the study of symmetry.  One way in which symmetry arises in number theory is through Galois theory: this is the study of the symmetry of solution sets of polynomial equations over the rational numbers.  Another way in which symmetry arises in number theory is through analysis: there are a class of special functions, called automorphic forms that satisfy a certain set of differential equations and possess an infinite group of discrete symmetries.  The conjectural Langlands Program relates Galois theory to automorphic forms, even though on first appearance the two areas of mathematics have nothing to do with one another.  This project concerns the study of automorphic forms, especially those that exhibit ""exceptional"" groups of symmetries.  The Principal Investigator will investigate the subtle and surprising connections that automorphic forms have to arithmetic.  He will also study L-functions of automorphic forms, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function.  The grant includes funding for graduate students, who will receive training in automorphic forms. While supported by this grant, the Principal Investigator will write a graduate textbook on ""exceptional algebraic structures"", which will fill a need in the literature.  He will also help train the US workforce through mentoring of undergraduates and early-career colleagues.<br/><br/>This award has three related research projects.  In one project, already underway, the Principal Investigator will develop the theory of half-integral weight modular forms on exceptional groups.  It is expected that the Fourier coefficients of these half-integral weight modular forms will be highly interesting arithmetic quantities.  The second project involves the production of modular forms on the exceptional group G_2 with rational Fourier coefficients and development of arithmetic consequences of the existence of such modular forms.  This will lead to a partial database of modular forms on G_2.  In a third project, the Principal Investigator will construct new automorphic L-functions.  Techniques involved in these projects include the theta correspondence and the Rankin-Selberg method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solutions to these problems describe equilibrium configurations of physical systems and provide canonical tools to study the geometry and topology of manifolds.  Physically this can be observed for instance when three soap bubbles merge on a common line forming a corner, or studying the structure of the transition region of an iceberg melting into water.  The goal of this project is to investigate the structure of such singular solutions, which is often the major stumbling block in their application to Geometry, Topology and Physics. Central to the project is an integrated plan of educational activities. This consists in the organization of a REU program and a winter Graduate School <br/>at UCSD on recent trends in Geometric Analysis. The PI will invite experts in the field for five days stays at UCSD to increase the overall activity of the seminar, expose graduate students to the most interesting results and open questions, and encourage collaborations.<br/><br/>This project will focus on two of the most classical and influential Geometric Variational problems: Minimal Surfaces and Free-Boundary problems.  Minimal surfaces provides canonical objects to study the topology of manifolds and are a good model for soap films and partition problems. Free-Boundary problems are fundamental in modeling a wide range of physical phenomena, such as phase transition (e.g. the melting of ice into water), flows with jets and cavities, shape optimization type problems and the pricing of American options.  Solutions to geometric variational problems are known to exhibit singularities.  In the context of Minimal Surfaces, the PI will investigate the regularity of the singular set for Area Minimizing hypersurfaces and for surfaces in any codimension, both in the integer and modulo p cases. For Free-Boundary problems, the focus will be on the structure of the set of so-called branching points for the Two-Phase problem and the Vectorial Alt-Caffarelli problem, and its relation with the set of points of high frequency of solutions to the Signorini problem. This will be achieved refining some new techniques recently introduced by the PI and his collaborators, and by developing new ones, which will have an impact in many other problems in Geometric Analysis. One of the major goals of the REU program and the winter Graduate School is to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to these problems and techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although such learning algorithms have had widespread empirical success, we have yet to find a coherent mathematical foundation that can explain not only why they work and what tasks they provably solve, but also how practitioners can improve their performance either by adjusting the algorithm or even the task itself. The investigator aims to lay this foundation by advancing the design, analysis, and deployment of rigorously justified nonconvex optimization algorithms. This research will create guaranteed procedures for training practical machine learning systems deployed in government and industry, producing more reliable and robust predictive models with fewer data and computational resources. The investigator will incorporate results from this project in education efforts, including course development, local K-12 outreach, and research mentoring of Ph.D. and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator designs and analyzes nonconvex optimization algorithms. The project focuses on simple iterative methods that compute with data in its ambient form, a class of algorithms that are uniquely scalable to modern high-dimensional statistical estimation and learning tasks. The overarching goal of the project is to understand when these methods converge to local or global optima and to provide efficiency estimates of their performance, measured both in terms of data and computational resources consumed. To achieve this goal, the investigation will draw on the techniques of variational analysis, nonsmooth optimization, machine learning, statistics, and high-dimensional probability. The investigator will leverage these techniques to design and equip simple, scalable iterative methods for nonconvex data fitting problems with strong performance guarantees: generic initialization strategies, rapid local convergence near optima, and seamless adaptation to nonsmooth constraints, models, priors. Such performance guarantees guide the practical implementation of reliable and efficient numerical methods for high-dimensional estimation and learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It bridges the gap between microscopic particle system and macroscopic continuum description, and therefore is at the core of multiscale modeling. In addition to its multiscale nature, this project intends to advance the understanding and computation of kinetic theory in new, emerging aspects that involve uncertainties, non-localities, and variational formulations. A parallel educational objective is to prepare and train students at all levels for multi-disciplinary research through advanced courses, topic seminars, and summer programs.<br/><br/>The specific aims of the project include: (1) utilize the variational formulation of macroscopic and kinetic equations to develop scalable, structure preserving, mathematically justifiable methods via advanced optimization techniques; (2) design multiscale computational methods for nonlocal interacting kinetic systems, with emphases on nonlocal collision and connection to fractional diffusion; (3) develop robust algorithms for hyperbolic equations with uncertainty, especially in treating discontinuous solutions; (4) study the inverse problem for nonlinear kinetic systems, including stability analysis with varying scales, numerical regularization and algorithms. The proposed activity is on an interdisciplinary topic and of general interest to both computational mathematicians and scientists from other areas. The variational methods provide a new perspective in overcoming difficulties that are shared among most partial differential equation (PDE) models nowadays: multiple scales, high dimensionality and necessity in preserving physical quantities. The research outcome will have an impact on other disciplines including computational optimal transport, optimal control theory, mean field games, and machine learning. The fractional diffusion solvers will be equally applicable to photon transport through cosmic dust or atmosphere, electron beam dose calculation, and other nonlocal PDEs arising in material science, finance, and plasma physics. Uncertainties that are omnipresent in kinetic equations have a profound influence on the solution behavior and must be carefully quantified. The analysis and algorithms investigated through this project, in both forward and inverse setting, will facilitate the understanding of sensitivity in the system under random perturbations, and largely advance the modern design of device with optimal performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, an infinite sequence of numbers might be compactly encoded as the values of a simple function. One such occurrence relevant to this project is the set of dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The time is right for a deeper study of these structures. This project will develop such a study through targeted applications to new classes of examples which have been selected for novelty, either in settings or technical details.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue several projects that involve different kinds of categorical and classical symmetries in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The general theme of the research is to find and exploit hidden symmetries in a problem to gain new information about it. This information can take the form of a new structural property or a finiteness result about a family of invariants. This research will focus in particular on several classes of mathematical objects for which these properties or calculation of invariants have resisted more traditional means of attack. Among these are: the action of ordered injections on the homology of groups of upper-triangular matrices, the action of surjections on the cohomology of compactified moduli spaces, and Hopf ring actions on syzygies of secant varieties of varieties arising from multilinear algebra. These are three examples of variants of the recently well-studied ""FI-modules,"" which offer new technical challenges and open the door to new paradigms of ""representation stability."""

In particular, geometric mechanics is characterized by the application of symmetry and differential geometric techniques to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and geometric integration is concerned with the construction of numerical methods with geometric invariant and equivariant properties. Computational geometric mechanics blends these fields, and uses a self-consistent discretization of geometry and mechanics to systematically construct geometric structure-preserving numerical schemes. The proposed research will combine theoretical and computational tools arising from Dirac mechanics and geometry, noncommutative harmonic analysis, and uncertainty quantification to dramatically extend the applicability of computational geometric mechanics and geometric control to engineering problems that evolve intrinsically on nonlinear spaces, such as Lie groups and homogeneous spaces. This will provide insights into the canonical discretization of Dirac constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and interconnected systems. In addition, the study of uncertainty in the context of geometric control will improve the robustness and reliability of the resulting numerical and computational tools.<br/><br/>This research will improve our ability to control interconnected systems of autonomous vehicles in a robust and efficient fashion, by explicitly taking into account the uncertainty inherent in our knowledge of the surrounding environment. Our results will be applicable to the control of distributed sensor networks, consisting of an interconnected set of satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and underwater vehicles. Such sensor networks are an exciting new development in the field of remote sensing that has the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency, coverage, and reliability of the information we obtain about our oceans, environment, and climate.  <br/>More broadly, most complex engineering systems can be expressed as an interconnected system of more elementary components, and our mathematical framework will allow us to more readily understand complex systems in terms of the behavior of its component parts and the manner in which they are interconnected.<br/>"

Random matrix theory is a recently developed research area that has garnered much attention in the last two decades.  It beautifully combines many fields of mathematics and has important outside applications, for example to multivariate statistics and cellular communication networks.  Using contemporary techniques from stochastic analysis,    the principal investigator Todd  Kemp will explore the behavior of large random matrices,  realized as concrete infinite-dimensional objects.

Stochastic analysis is the systematic theory of the behavior of  Brownian  motion.  Besides its research value, another, equally central impact of this mathematics research project is through its educational goals, focusing on the creation of a new summer research program, CURE: Collaborative Undergraduate Research Experience.   It is designed to give research experience to groups of primarily local undergraduate students.  The CURE program seeks to introduce novice mathematicians to the community of practice, through situated learning and cooperative engagement in front-line research, based on the more accessible and computational aspects of the research component of  this proposal.  It will also provide mentoring experience to graduate students who will assist in coordinating the research effort; thus the CURE program is vertically integrated across the full spectrum of academic research.  Mathematics has become an increasingly collaborative field; the CURE program will instill the value of research collaboration in its dozens of participants.

Most of the proposed projects are collaborative and involve researchers from a diverse set of universities. The project also contains a well-developed plan of educational activities which will have a major impact on the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students at UC Berkeley in statistical research. In particular, many of the educational activities of the project are aimed towards undergraduate students, a group that is often given less importance at large research universities.<br/><br/>Concretely, a wide range of nonparametric models will be studied, covering both regression and density estimation. In situations where empirically attractive estimators exist, an elaborate theoretical study is proposed focusing on their adaptive risk properties. In other situations, estimators and efficient computational algorithms are proposed together with an analysis of their accuracy. Important practical problems of inference and uncertainty quantification are also addressed. The specific regression problems that are investigated in this project include (a) multivariate convex regression, univariate trend filtering and additive shape constrained regression where adaptive risk properties of the natural estimators will be established, (b) multivariate trend filtering and quasi-convex regression where new estimators are provided along with efficient computational algorithms, and (c) global and pointwise inference in shape constrained estimation where uncertainty quantification will be addressed. In density estimation, the problems investigated include: (a) log-concave and mixture density estimation where maximum likelihood estimators will be studied, (b) distributionally robust optimization and nongaussian component analysis where novel methodology will be proposed based on shape-constrained density estimation, and (c) robust approaches to shape-constrained inference where new procedures will be developed."

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the mathematical understanding of the effects of flow on combustion.  Nevertheless, the inherent complexity and richness of the phenomena continues to present a challenge to our study of this problem.  These models are given by nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations which may also be coupled to equations of fluid dynamics.  One of the goals of the proposed research  is a continuation of previous work on passive combustion in periodic, random, as well as general inhomogeneous media.  The main questions of interest include the effects of flows on mixing and on speed-up of propagation of reaction.  In addition, simplified models will be considered and experience gained from their study will be applied to the original problems.  Another goal of the project is the study of propagation of reaction in a model of active combustion, with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force and gravity-induced mixing.  In many situations this effect cannot be ignored, particularly in highly turbulent combustion regimes.  Although this is a very difficult problem, limited progress has been achieved recently and it is proposed here to build upon these results.  The developed techniques will also be applied to the study of other related models, including systems of reaction-diffusion equations and a model of liquid suspensions.<br/><br/>Reactive processes, such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, and forest fires, are ubiquitous in nature.  Their study is relevant to several branches of science and engineering such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering.  The research proposed here focuses on the influence of the motion of the underlying medium, such as fluid flow, on the speed of spreading of reactive processes.  It aims at improving our understanding of fundamental mathematical models describing such processes, which may provide useful qualitative insights into real life phenomena.  An important part of this proposal is its educational component.  The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop an undergraduate partial differential equations (PDE) course at the University of Wisconsin, mentor undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of advanced topics, and organize a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in analysis and PDEs.  The PI will also teach specialized graduate courses and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."

This project seeks to develop new theory for such random graph processes, in order to better understand their properties, improve existing methods of analysis, and rigorously justify their applications. In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering. The educational component includes annual K-12 math teacher workshops, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,and a multidisciplinary workshop/summer school for junior researchers and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the development of new theory and applications for time-evolving random graph processes with dependencies (that grow step-by-step according to specific rules or structural constraints). One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key idea is to identify network attributes that carry a footprint of a network's past and to exploit them in reconstructing the early stages of a network from its current configuration. This can be used to detect, for example, the origin of a rumor spread, popular individuals and their influence in a social network, or a source of a disease outbreak. The results are expected to have significant applications in national security and public health. Another key research direction is to develop a systematic understanding of how local interactions in a large network influence its global geometry. This knowledge can be used to increase the overall efficiency of a network of servers through cooperative local interactions, with potential applications in improving routing schemes for airport security, supermarket distribution systems, and distribution of vaccines and other medicines. The project aims to develop a robust toolbox across many disciplines in science and engineering. The project involves significant educational activities and integration of research and education.

Jobs arriving at a subset of vertices designated arrival nodes myopically explore the network in search of less busy servers to minimize their waiting time. Optimal placement of the arrival nodes will be analyzed using a new notion of load centrality. Diffusion limits and load balancing based on Dirichlet energy functionals will be used to study systems in heavy traffic.

Deep learning is the predominant approach in modern artificial intelligence that uses multi-layer artificial neural networks to infer complex relations from data. Despite the rapid adoption of deep learning in scientific and industrial applications, a theoretical basis to explain its success and methods to guard against its limits has yet to be established. This project addresses two critical gaps in the current theory of deep learning, namely the effects of working with specific types of data and the behavior of artificial neural networks in practical settings. This research is crucial to developing deep learning methods that are more efficient, reliable, safe, and broadly applicable. Some areas that would benefit directly are accelerating production pipelines, improving energy efficiency, and improving data handling in the increasing number of critical technologies that rely on deep learning. This project involves significant educational, community building, and outreach activities. The research will be directly integrated into interdisciplinary curricula and will generate research project topics for graduate students and capstone projects for undergraduate students. The project aims to prepare a diverse STEM workforce through long-term research and career mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, open seminars and discussion sessions with experts and enthusiasts at different career stages, internship opportunities, and dedicated training sessions.<br/><br/>Artificial neural networks provide specific parametrizations to specific sets of candidate solutions to learning tasks, and parameter optimization procedures introduce specific preferences in the space of possible solutions. This project seeks to illuminate these complex relations in cases of practical interest that are not sufficiently well covered by existing mathematical theory, namely, where the networks have a moderate level of overparametrization in relation to the amount of training data. Importantly, it develops theories and methods that integrate and exploit the properties of the training data and parameter initialization. The research concerns the following three aims: (1) the function space description of moderately overparametrized networks, (2) the data-dependent description of the objective function and optimization, and (3) the explicit form of the bias of gradient descent in function space. The research program advances the state of the art by integrating the properties of the training data and addressing the optimization bias and model bias in interplay, which are challenges beyond the scope of existing methods. The project builds on preliminary work that blends applied mathematics and deep learning, in particular techniques connecting the geometry of parameter space, function space, and data space, as well as techniques based on information geometry, optimal transport, and algebraic statistics.

As a result, data-driven methods are becoming de rigueur nowadays, driving the need for increasingly sophisticated algorithms that find subtle statistical patterns in massive amount of data. This trend however is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, modern statistical learning methods help researchers in various fields to discover unexpected patterns from data and to make better decisions impacting everyday life. On the other hand, the rapid growth in the size and scope of data sets as well as the complexity of the methods used has made statistical models less transparent. Employing the derived models without a proper understanding of their validity can lead to many false discoveries, incorrect predictions and massive costs. For example, suppose the medical records of patients are used to develop a model for providing personalized risk score for a chronic disease. A high-risk score can trigger an intervention, such as incentive for healthy behavior, additional tests, and medical follow-ups which are all costly. This raises the concern about the validity of the outcomes retuned by this model. Should one interpret them at an average level or an individual level? Are the model predictions biased and, if so, how much? The overarching goal of this project is to develop novel foundational perspectives on the emerging inferential and computational challenges in statistics and data science. In addition, the PI plans to develop software packages to implement the proposed methods and make them publicly available. The proposed work will benefit a broad range of researchers from various areas ranging from bioinformatics and machine learning to finance and engineering. The PI will also integrate components from this project into an advanced graduate class and use selected results to motivate undergraduate students to pursue careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). <br/><br/>This project aims at developing statistical methods that are 1) scalable and 2) valid in the sense that in addition point estimation, they also quantify the statistical uncertainty that is intrinsic in the estimation and predications. These issues are among the central topics in modern statistics and it is imperative to develop solid theory and powerful methodology to address them. This project focuses on three interrelated prongs that develop fundamental insights for these ubiquitous challenges: (1) Uncertainty assessment and high-dimensional inference: the PI will develop a flexible framework for general hypothesis testing problems in high-dimensional setting using the so-called debiasing approach, and further study inference for high-dimensional models with adaptively collected samples, such as time series; (2) Online hypotheses testing: the PI will formulate the decentralized false discovery rate (FDR) control where the number of hypotheses to be tested is unknown (possibly infinite) and the decision maker should take an action on each before the next p-value is received; and (3) Optimal iterative estimation for non-linear decision regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance.

These show that many properties of groups or actions can be recognized by looking at their von Neumann algebras. Ioana will develop new methods to study rigidity for von Neumann algebras. Three specific directions of research will be pursued. Firstly, Ioana will expand the scope of super-rigidity for von Neumann algebras by providing new examples of groups and actions that can be entirely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras.

Complex data demand statistical models that are sufficiently flexible to adapt to meaningful, underlying signals, allowing scientists to discover unexpected patterns.  Yet as society relies more heavily on statistical algorithms to make decisions impacting everyday life, it becomes increasingly important for a method's output to be interpretable by non-experts.  This demands parsimony: that simpler explanations be favored over more complicated ones.  For example, the Internet has led to unprecedented quantities of data in the form of text (such as articles, blogs, webpages, consumer reviews, and many other social media products).  Such text data represent a potential treasure trove of insights into the world -- what people are thinking, how this is changing over time, how this varies by location, etc. The investigator develops new statistical methods for overcoming major technical challenges to gleaning useful information from this data.  This same methodology can be applied to the study of the microbiome, the vast community of microbes living in an environment such as the human gut.  Better statistical methods are needed to identify types of microbes in the gut that play a crucial role in human health and disease.  Another problem that is tackled in this project involves modeling data collected over time (such as wind-speed data and wildlife monitoring).  The methods that are developed allow for more accurate forecasting, which is crucial in many areas including health and medicine and the development of lower cost energy systems.  The last major area in this project is devoted to making the process of statistical research more efficient and its software of higher quality and easier to share across the community of statistical researchers.  Finally, all three research objectives are closely integrated with educational outcomes, including the supervision and teaching of graduate students, outreach to non-statisticians and non-scientists, and the release of undergraduate-accessible mini-papers describing the investigator's new research findings.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the design of new statistical methods that balance two important and often opposing needs: flexibility and parsimony.  (1) Building predictive regression and classification models is difficult when the features are highly sparse.  While many methods focus on the challenge of high dimensionality, relatively few have considered the obstacle posed by features that are rarely nonzero. The investigator develops a new framework for feature selection when the features are highly sparse that succeeds where preexisting methods fail.  This is studied both from theoretical and computational standpoints.  (2) High-dimensional covariance estimation and time series modeling are two rich, but largely distinct, areas in statistics, which the investigator combines to develop new methods for modeling locally stationary time series.  The added flexibility in going from stationarity to local stationarity must be carefully balanced with parsimony.  (3) A series of area-specific software modules will be distributed freely online building on the investigator's new platform for streamlining the process of performing simulation studies.  Each module will implement some of the most common models, methods, and metrics used in a given area of statistics research.  The goal is to facilitate the sharing of high-quality, reproducible simulation code in the statistics research community by creating an easily-adaptable standardized format."

More specifically, the CAREER Award will fund Pelayo's investigations on classical and quantum semitoric systems. A classical semitoric system is an integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom for which one component generates a periodic flow. For mathematicians, semitoric systems form the next natural class of systems after toric systems. Semitoric systems retain some properties of toric systems, while at the same time they exhibit a much greater flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in the existence of singularities which are dynamically and symplectically rich.Semitoric systems are commonly found in simple physical models and arise naturally as examples in analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. As a matter of fact, a semitoric system defines a singular toric fibration whose base comes endowed with a singular integral affine structure. These singular affine structures are a central concept in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry. A semitoric quantum system is given by two commuting self-adjoint semiclassical operators acting on a Hilbert space whose principal symbols form a classical semitoric system. One of Pelayo's main goals is  to study the spectral theory of semitoric quantum systems and how it relates to classical systems. Concretely, Pelayo's plan is to work towards verifying that the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system determines completely the system; this is the Spectral Conjecture, widely considered the most spectacular problem in the area.  Proving this conjecture requires establishing a number of results in semiclassical analysis, giving a tool for future research in the field, independent of the conjecture. Another component of Pelayo's research plans is to continue studying semitoric systems in a more general context, in particular as it regards to the study of the convexity and connectivity properties of the singular Lagrangian fibrations which semitoric systems induce, and which are of special interest in mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The research that the CAREER Award will support belongs to the context of  dynamics and geometry.  Dynamics  is the study of the motion of bodies. Geometry is the study of shape (broadly understood) of objects and spaces.More specifically, the CAREER Award will support Pelayo's research at the intersection of symplectic geometry, spectral theory  and dynamics. Symplectic geometry has its roots in physics, and provides an appropriate mathematical framework to study many problems of physics and chemistry and their quantum counterparts. Pelayo's research on this topic exhibits the interplay between mathematical and physical theories. Indeed, several groups of physicists and chemists working on modern quantum spectroscopy have been interested in seeing how mathematical methods can  contribute to advance their research, and predict new physical phenomena. They have been particularly interested in understanding the global structure of joint energy-momentum spectra of small molecules. Even more, they have recognized the pivotal role that mathematical invariants play in this problem. Their works have motivated a large number of mathematical questions. The physicists have asked whether one can single out an optimal set of mathematical invariants that would characterize a physical system and then detect these invariants in the spectrum of the system.  The detection of the invariants in the system spectrum will allow us to reconstruct the system and hence predict new phenomena. The CAREER Award will support Pelayo's investigations into this crucial question.  These applications to quantum molecular spectroscopy are integrated in Pelayo's approach of employing methods from pure mathematics (symplectic and spectral theory, microlocal analysis) to address problems from the applied sciences. More generally,  Pelayo's  research is focused on a fundamental type of physical system, the so called integrable systems. One can find direct applications of integrable systems in numerous contexts. Some such examples are nonlinear control,  locomotion generation in robotics, elasticity theory, plasma physics, field theory and planetary mission design. In order to communicate this relevance of mathematical research to the general public, Pelayo has been interviewed on several occasions by the press (radio and magazines with several hundred thousand audience members). He has commented and advocated for an understanding of the leading role that mathematicians play in the advance of applied science and technology in society. Pelayo will continue actively reaching out to the general public during the tenure of the award, and will continue to take a leading role at Washington University outreach programs. In this respect he will run a  Talent Identification Program at Washington University to encourage and nurture undergraduate research at an early stage."

A rather surprising and mysterious feature of this system is that, in one regime (Euler), it captures the birth and permanence of order in the form of large hurricane ? like whirls ? while in another regime (Navier-Stokes) it describes a disorderly, seemingly random, turbulent soup of eddies. That is, an ideal Euler fluid tends towards order over time through a process of vortex mergers and mixing, whereas a Navier-Stokes fluid with very slight viscosity and forcing tends towards disorder through a cascade of instabilities in accord with longstanding conjectures of Kolmogorov. The project aims to advance our understanding of these fundamental aspects of fluid motion by studying the behavior of solutions both near and far from equilibrium through the lens of partial differential equations, geometry, and dynamical systems.

The investigator not only studies the fundamental mathematics on the scope and depth of linear matrix inequality representability, but also work on designing new algorithms and software solving hard optimization problems.<br/>The following five main topics will be focused in this project: linear matrix inequality representations of rigid convex sets, semidefinite programming representations of convex semialgebraic sets, second order cone programming representations of convex semialgebraic sets, semidefinite programming representations of nonnegative multivariate polynomials, and linear matrix inequality methods for solving nonconvex optimization problems and polynomial systems.<br/> <br/> <br/>A basic problem of science and engineering is finding a global minimum of a function of many variables. As a metaphor one might think of a complicated terrain of  mountains and valleys which stretches for hundreds of miles and one must find the lowest point in the lowest valley.

Many algorithms will find the lowest point of a particular valley but none are known which effectively find the lowest valley itself. This NSF research is to develop global optimization algorithms for various situations. One is the class of problems where the data is given by polynomials. Another is to determine and parameterize convex problems very efficiently; in convex situations one has only one valley.

These spiking patterns exhibit a striking level of variability, even in neural network that are driven by identical sensory stimuli. Owing to this variability, neural networks have been thought to operate in the asynchronous state. In the asynchronous state, neurons fire independently from one another, so that the probability that a neuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. This neglect of synchrony has been further supported by the apparent weakness of spiking pairwise correlations. However, recent experimental and theoretical works seriously challenge this view. Specifically, large-scale spiking recordings have revealed weak but nonzero spiking correlations. At the same time, the levels of voltage variability observed in single-cell recordings cannot be explained without some degree of input synchrony, compatible with weak but nonzero spiking correlation. To address the challenge posed by these recent findings, the PI will characterize how synaptic synchrony can stably emerge in networks that are otherwise plagued with biological noise. Specifically, the PI will (1) model synchrony-based input correlations via jump processes, (2) elucidate how noisy spike-generation mechanisms can propagate synchrony to output neurons, and (3) characterize how synchrony-based correlations can stably emerge in limit neural networks. The payoff of (1) will be characterizing how activity correlations can explain the high degree of observed neural variability. The payoff of (2) will be estimating the temporal information content of a spike. The payoff of (3) will be identifying the network features stabilizing synchrony-based correlations. While reaching for his research goals, the PI will design an original undergraduate flipped course mixing mathematics and neuroscience audiences. Within the research center that he animates, the PI will also kickstart a service offering for affiliates who want to acquire theoretical support in their research project. <br/><br/>Cortical spiking patterns can exhibit exquisite time precision of behavioral relevance. This supports the prevalence of time codes for which neuronal spiking is synchronized. However, the maintenance of spiking precision is at odds with typically observed level of cortical noise. This supports the prevalence of rate codes, for which neurons spike asynchronously. That said, such a coding dichotomy is misleading as the same neuron can jointly acts as a synchronous coder and as an asynchronous coder. The PI will resolve the synchronous/asynchronous coding dilemma as a matter of degree rather than a matter of alternative, by characterizing collective dynamics in idealized neural circuits with nontrivial spiking correlations. Concretely, nontrivial correlations will arise from synaptic synchrony, whereby synapses to a neuron tend to coactivate over small timescales with respect to the neuron?s time constant. This is by contrast with most theoretical approaches which are rooted in mean-field approximations with trivial correlation structure. To resolve the synchronous/asynchronous coding dilemma, the PI will develop a novel theoretical and computational framework to model, quantify, and analyze the impact of synchrony on neural dynamics. The mathematical challenges at stake will be to perform (1) a stochastic analysis of biophysically-relevant neuronal models when driven by synchronous input, (2) an probabilistic analysis of the spike-generating mechanism viewed as a free-boundary problem, and (3) bifurcation and scaling analyses of the nonlinear partial differential equation capturing the so-called Poissonian mean-field dynamics. In all cases, the methodology will exploit modern analytical and probabilistic techniques in combination with advanced numerical methods.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS/DMS Mathematical Biology program and CISE/IIS Robust Intelligence program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are abstract mathematical objects designed to model the universe we live in.  The term locally homogeneous refers to the presence of a high degree of local symmetry which is captured by a Lie group called the (local) symmetry group.  It is this symmetry group which governs the geometry, in the following sense: the meaningful quantities we can measure in a geometric manifold (e.g. lengths or angles) are exactly those which are invariant under the symmetry group.  There are many different possible symmetry groups which lead to different types of geometric manifolds useful in many contexts across mathematics and physics.  There can also be many different geometric manifolds with the same local symmetry group. These all have the same local properties, but can look very different at large scales. The space of all such possibilities is called a moduli space; it is a topological space whose points are the possible geometric manifolds of a certain type and whose topology organizes those geometric manifolds into families whose features vary continuously. While the precise features (e.g. shape, size, etc.) of our universe is a question for empirical physics, a moduli space is the mathematical answer to the question of what possible features could the universe have.  The research component of this project studies geometric manifolds of many types, with focus on flat affine geometry, real projective geometry, and constant curvature pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These geometries have just the right amount of symmetry to allow for large interesting moduli spaces with mysterious but tractable behavior. Core elements of the educational component include training Ph.D. students, a new Texas Experimental Geometry Lab for undergraduate research, and the Texas Winter Workshop on Geometric Structures for early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in the PI's research program is that geometric manifolds of one type may be fruitfully studied by deforming, or transitioning, to a different type of geometry.  For example, the PI?s work studying Margulis spacetimes as geometric limits of anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, has yielded many results about the geometry, topology, and deformation theory of these affine Lorentzian three-manifolds. The PI will develop new tools, following the geometric limit point of view, for new affine geometry contexts in higher dimensions, in order to address questions surrounding important open problems such as the Auslander Conjecture. The PI will also pursue a broad program to study convex real projective structures on manifolds. One focus is to identify which three-manifolds admit such structures and to describe the moduli spaces, with applications to questions in low-dimensional topology. In a more general context, the PI will conduct a thorough investigation of a new notion of convex cocompactness in real projective geometry, generalizing the well-studied notion from the Kleinian groups setting. Educational goals of this project center on expanding and vertically integrating the research training program in Geometric Structures at UT Austin being developed by the PI. The Texas Experimental Geometry Lab (TXGL) will introduce undergraduates at UT Austin to research in geometry, topology, and/or dynamics through computational and experimental projects. TXGL will also provide opportunities for Ph.D. students and post-docs to gain experience mentoring and teaching undergraduates outside the traditional classroom setting. In addition, TXGL will produce visualizations that illustrate concepts from current mathematics research. The Texas Winter Workshops in Geometric Structures will bring together small groups of early career mathematicians in order to learn an emerging new topic at the intersection of different (but related) mathematical fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

In a long-running collaboration with Davide Gaiotto and Greg Moore, he has studied mathematical applications of N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theory. This work has recently led to quite unexpected connections between physics and mathematical subjects such as enumerative geometry, hyperkahler geometry, and cluster algebras, and hence also to purely mathematical connections between these subjects. The proposed research builds on and extends this recent work in several directions. First, in continuing collaboration with Gaiotto and Moore, the PI will investigate new examples of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which ""count"" certain networks of geodesic trajectories on Riemann surfaces. This counting problem corresponds to determining the numbers of stable particles in certain physical theories. Also in collaboration with Gaiotto and Moore, the PI will continue development of a new method for constructing hyperkahler metrics on total spaces of integrable systems. In this new method the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants play a key role; the eventual goal is to produce asymptotic or convergent series representations for K3 metrics. Finally, in solo work, the PI will explore new mathematical structures which appear when the N=2 supersymmetric field theory is studied taking spacetime to be Taub-NUT space. This construction is expected to lead to new insights into the science of nonabelian theta functions. The PI will also produce a library of video clips, explaining concepts from physics for mathematicians at a variety of levels (from undergraduate level to other researchers). These clips will be freely available over the Web. In addition the PI will continue his active program of teaching, expository writing and talks, aimed at disseminating his methods and results more broadly.<br/><br/>The PI studies geometric problems using tools imported from particle physics. Recently, he and his collaborators have devised a new scheme for solving the ""field equation"" which governs the curvature of spacetime. This equation, first written down by Einstein, is notoriously intractable. In particular, it is known that this equation has a large family of solutions describing a closed four-dimensional universe (so-called ""K3 metrics""), but nobody has ever been able to write down actual formulas representing these solutions. The PI and collaborators have found a surprising connection between Einstein's equation and particle physics, which relates the problem of finding K3 metrics (and other similar solutions) to the problem of understanding how subatomic particles can decay. This connection has led to insight into both problems, which the PI and collaborators are now actively developing. The PI will also produce a library of video clips, explaining concepts from physics for mathematicians at a variety of levels (from undergraduate level to other researchers).

These tools allow us to handle data sets that are not merely large, but also dense: varying in time or space, rich with covariates, or deeply layered with hierarchical structure, and indexed in ever more baroque ways. But the field has not progressed nearly as far in modeling discrete data.  Indeed, many common discrete-data models have long been viewed as too difficult to work with on a routine basis, due to the analytically inconvenient form of the likelihood functions that arise.  The investigator will develop inferential tools for discrete-data problems that exploit new data-augmentation schemes as well as recent advances in parallel and distributed computing.<br/><br/>Discrete data sets typically involve either event-count or categorical outcomes (yes or no, this choice or that).  The goal of the investigator's research is to leverage detailed spatial information to better model and predict these outcomes.  In many cases this will involve physical space.  For example, spatial patterns are very important when public health authorities look for excess reports of respiratory infection at a cluster of hospitals, or when law-enforcement officers deploy equipment that detects radiation anomalies at a crowded public event.  But it may also involve a more abstract notion of space.  For example, patients in a clinical trial can be located in a space defined by their genes and behavior.  This information is useful for personalized medicine: that is, deciding whether someone belongs to a special sub-group that is helped by a drug, even if the wider population isn't.  Though the proposed research is in the area of statistical methodology, the work is inherently interdisciplinary, and seeks to provide statistical solutions for pressing scientific problems. The PI has very good ideas how to transform the education of statistics in a more interdisciplinary and more data oriented way so that UT-Austin can become ""one of the most innovative statistics programs in the world"" as the PI writes.

This phenomenon, which acquired the metaphorical name ""mirror symmetry,"" led to extraordinarily prescient mathematical predictions about the geometries (""Calabi-Yau manifolds"") involved in such theories. In 1994, Maxim Kontsevich proposed an organizing framework for multiple mathematical aspects of mirror symmetry in his ""homological mirror symmetry"" (HMS) conjecture, which, he said, would ""unveil the mystery of mirror symmetry.""  At the time, one of the two main mathematical notions invoked by HMS, the ""Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold,"" was new and undeveloped, and it was very difficult both to prove instances of Kontsevich's conjecture and to deduce consequences of it.  Recent developments in the mathematics of Fukaya categories have changed that.  At the center of this CAREER project is a program to realize Kontsevich's vision. The PI and collaborators have formulated a notion of ""core homological mirror symmetry,"" and the program aims to show that if core HMS holds for a particular mirror pair then many other facets of mirror symmetry naturally follow as logical consequences.  The project includes support for graduate students working with the PI, which will assist them at the beginning of their research careers, and support for the development of a coherent honors program for mathematics undergraduates.<br/><br/>The main strand of the research program concerns mirror symmetry, primarily for Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds.  The program (underway in work of the PI and collaborators Sheridan and Ganatra) studies the consequences of ""core homological mirror symmetry"" for a given pair of polarized CY manifolds, which roughly says that one can match the tensor powers of the polarizing line bundle over one of these two with some collection of Lagrangian submanifolds of the other in a way that respects categorical structures. This hypothesis is quite natural in light of geometric approaches to mirror pairs based on the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow philosophy, though currently only proven in a few cases. We aim to show that core HMS implies full HMS and several aspects of ""closed-string"" mirror symmetry, notably the normalization of the holomorphic volume form and the precise form of the mirror map. This has become feasible in light of recents developments, due principally to Abouzaid, relating the geometric ""open-closed string map,"" from quantum cohomology to Hochschild homology of the Fukaya category, to the categorical property of ""homological smoothness"" of the Fukaya category. A key aim is to give a ""conceptual"" proof that the generating function for the numbers of rational curves on a quintic 3-fold equals the Yukawa coupling of its mirror -- a proof that does not rely on calculating the two sides. This research gives key roles to symplectic topology, pseudo-holomorphic curves, and symplectic Floer cohomology. Those techniques are equally important in a second strand, which is to develop Floer-thoeretic 3-manifold invariants on similar lines to Heegaard Floer theory but based not on symmetric products of a Heegaard surface (viewed as a complex curve), but rather on moduli spaces of rank 2 holomorphic bundles with section over such curves. Such invariants may serve to mediate between Heegaard and instanton versions of Floer theory for 3-manifolds."

The PI will develop this perspective to establish conjectures old and new, dramatically advancing our understanding of algebraic K-theory and its deep role in topology, geometry, and arithmetic.

The goals of the proposed research are two-fold. On the conceptual level, it aims to provide a general methodology for the specification of continuous-time asset-price models from the market primitives and to establish a new modelling framework for the analysis and better understanding of incomplete financial markets and their equilibrium dynamics. A novel concept of completeness constraint is introduced in order to capture the fruitful idea that market incompleteness can be interpreted as an exogenously-imposed constraint.  On the technical level, it furnishes tools for the mathematical analysis of the framework described above, based on the existing and new stochastic-, convex- and functional-analytic and PDE-based methods. These tools are, then, used to establish the existence of equilibria and to study their properties.  The mathematical core is the study of the notion of stability for the optimal solutions of stochastic control problems as functions of the modelling inputs. The obtained stability results can be interpreted in terms of the aggregate demand functions and used to grant existence of equilibrium markets with the help of the appropriate (classical and new) fixed-point theorems."

In this geometric harmonic analysis, function spaces are replaced with categories of sheaves, and the spectral theory of operators on these sheaves is analyzed using geometric Fourier transforms.  The investigator is developing applications of these cutting edge ideas to classical questions in representation theory. In particular, in collaboration with D. Nadler, he proposes an enhancement of the geometric Langlands program which performs a spectral decomposition of the categories of representations of real Lie groups. This significantly enhances the Langlands classification of irreducible representations (part of the classical Langlands program) and binds it to the geometric (Borel-Weil) realizations of representations.  The investigator also spearheads efforts to make this material available to a far broader audience, in particular through the organization of GRASP (Geometry Representations and Some Physics), electronically distributed expository lecture series on the fundamental ideas and underlying currents in this rapidly developing area.<br/><br/>A fundamental theme of modern mathematics is the exploitation of symmetry as an organizing principle, linking diverse and potentially baffling phenomena in an elegant overarching framework. Perhaps the prime example of this trend is the Langlands program, which identifies a general pattern in the appearance of symmetry in algebra and number theory, and counts among its successes the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem. In recent years, a new geometric setting for the application<br/>of the Langlands philosophy has emerged, which makes contact with new symmetry principles, in particular those underlying the exciting developments of string theory in physics.  My CAREER proposal is aimed at advancing this geometric Langlands program in two ways.  First, the GRASP (Geometry Representations And Some Physics) program will provide an electronic resource center for students interested in this exciting and varied but potentially intimidating and inaccessible area. At the center of GRASP is a series of expository lectures introducing the fundamental concepts underlying and relating to the Langlands program to a wide audience, via the web. In parallel, the research component of the proposal develops a novel program to apply the cutting edge geometric Langlands technology to more classical problems in algebra. In particular I expect these ideas to have a significant impact on the classification of symmetries arising in linear algebra with real numbers, a question with a distinguished history and origins in quantum mechanics.<br/>"

Knopf<br/><br/>The broad goals of the investigator's research program are to find and<br/>classify optimal geometries using curvature flows. This subject is<br/>currently enjoying a period of intense interest and rapid progress,<br/>inspired by Perelman's landmark results in Hamilton's program to<br/>resolve the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures by Ricci flow. In<br/>applications of Ricci flow, one evolves a Riemannian metric on a<br/>manifold to simplify and improve its geometry. In many cases, these<br/>improvements involve changes in topology that are triggered by<br/>singularity formation. Such improvements are possible because<br/>solutions of Ricci flow (like many other nonlinear PDE) are expected<br/>to exhibit very special, highly symmetric profiles in a space-time<br/>neighborhood of a developing singularity. A thorough and deep<br/>understanding of singularity formation is therefore of critical<br/>importance for extracting topological and geometric information from<br/>Ricci flow behavior. The investigator's immediate objectives focus on<br/>singularity formation for curvature flows, particularly (1) analytic<br/>aspects (asymptotics) of singularity formation, (2) the structure of<br/>singularities in dimension four, (3) singularities of Kaehler-Ricci<br/>flow, (4) the structure of Perelman's entropy and reduced distance,<br/>and (5) applications of geometric flows to problems in<br/>physics. Progress toward these objectives will lead to new<br/>applications of Ricci flow in the geometry and topology of manifolds,<br/>productive insights into parallels between various geometric flows,<br/>and new applications of curvature flows to problems motivated by<br/>materials science and physics. These objectives are well suited to<br/>collaborations with other researchers in geometric evolution equations<br/>and in related fields like comparison geometry, low-dimensional<br/>topology, and nonlinear analysis.<br/><br/>The partial differential equations that arise in curvature flows are<br/>remarkably similar to equations used to model heat propagation, the<br/>movement of oil in shale and thin films, combustion in porous media,<br/>and certain effects in plasma physics. By increasing our understanding<br/>of singularity formation for such equations, the research elements of<br/>this project may contribute to progress in these applications. The<br/>education elements of the project are very tightly integrated with its<br/>research focus. The cornerstone of this integration is a series of<br/>annual workshops: each will contain a graduate education component, a<br/>research component, and an undergraduate outreach component. The<br/>education component includes an organized seminar to prepare graduate<br/>students for participation in the research component. The outreach<br/>component includes invitations to local undergraduate students to<br/>interact with the visiting researchers with the goal of attracting<br/>those students to further studies in mathematics.

In prior work, generalizations of the matrix computations that underlie theoretical physics were developed, and their use was pioneered in creating models from DNA microarray data. These models have been used to predict mechanisms that govern the activity of DNA and RNA, including a previously unknown mechanism of regulation that correlates DNA replication initiation with RNA expression during the cell cycle, the first mechanism to be predicted from mathematical modeling of microarray data. Preliminary experimental results verify this computational prediction, demonstrating for the first time that mathematical modeling of microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown cellular mechanisms. This work will now be extended by creating the first tensor algebra models, integrating and comparing different types of cell cycle data from different studies and organisms and under different conditions. This project will result in innovative mathematical frameworks for large-scale data analysis, as well as new insights into the cellular program of cell division. For example, one preliminary tensor model is the only mathematical framework to date that enables comparison of data from multiple organisms without being limited to similar genes among these organisms. This model promises to reveal universality and specialization of evolutionary, biochemical and genetic pathways that are truly on genomic scales. Another preliminary model enables integration of data from time courses under different perturbations into a coherent picture of the effects of these perturbations on cell cycle progression. This model promises to uncover previously unrecognized causal coordination of cellular activities.<br/><br/>Recently developed high-throughput technologies, such as the DNA microarray, make it possible for the first time to record the complete molecular biological signals that guide the progression of cellular processes, i.e., tell cells what to do and when and where to do it. Biology and medicine today may be at a point similar to where physics was after the advent of the telescope. The rapidly growing number of large-scale data sets holds the key to the discovery of cellular mechanisms, just as the astronomical tables compiled by Galileo and Tycho enabled accurate predictions of planetary motions and, later, the discovery of universal gravitation. Just as Kepler and Newton made these predictions and discoveries by using mathematical frameworks to describe trends in astronomical data, so future discovery and control in biology and medicine will come from the mathematical modeling of large-scale molecular biological data. In this project, mathematical frameworks for large-scale data analysis are developed and used to create models from microarray data, and predict cellular mechanisms. For example, earlier work predicted a previously unknown mechanism of regulation that correlates the beginning of DNA replication with RNA transcription, the process by which the information in DNA is transferred to RNA, during the cell division cycle. This is the first mechanism to be predicted from mathematical modeling of microarray data. Preliminary experimental results verify this computational prediction, demonstrating for the first time that mathematical modeling of microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown cellular mechanisms. This project will now extend this work by creating models that integrate and compare different types of cell cycle data from different studies and organisms and under different conditions. Models such as these may become the foundation of a future where physicians model and control biological systems as readily as engineers model and control physical systems today. In this future, cancer and disease can be stopped or reversed, damaged tissues can be engineered to regenerate, and aging can be slowed or even halted altogether."

It proposes novel approaches for combining laboratory experiments and multiscale mathematical modeling to characterize branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland. Branching morphogenesis is a process by which the female mammary gland develops its tree-like structure during puberty. It governs the formation of other tree-like organs such as the lungs, salivary gland, and kidney. Defects in branching morphogenesis can lead to hypertension, chronic kidney failure, and poor lung function. Mechanisms that control branching morphogenesis are circumvented or altered during the development and progression of breast cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that generate branched organs may identify novel ways to treat breast cancer, regenerate organ function, or design artificial organs to combat diseases. At puberty, branching morphogenesis generates an extensive network of mammary gland epithelium ducts. The epithelium ductal network is connected at its base to the nipple and plays a key role in milk synthesis and secretion for neonates. Molecular and mechanical factors in the tissue environment are important for normal branching morphogenesis. Majority of the research in this area has focused on identifying key molecular factors and the mechanisms by which they regulate branching morphogenesis. How mechanical signaling regulates branching morphogenesis remains largely unknown. The mathematical models proposed in this research will contribute to bridging this gap. This project will build novel multiscale mathematical models to predict how the interactions between mechanical and cellular signaling regulate the formation of the mammary ductal network. <br/><br/>Branching morphogenesis occurs through two stages: the first stage is via successive rounds of elongation and splitting of the tip of individual ducts (i.e., tip bifurcation) and the second stage is via budding along the sides of existing ducts (i.e., side branching).  Increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is known to increase the sites for epithelium ductal branch initiation. However, how the mechanical signaling originating from the ECM affects branch elongation, tip bifurcation and side branching is not fully understood. This project will (1) combine optimal transport theory, agent-based models, and data from laboratory experiments to predict how interactions between ECM and epithelium cells regulate ductal branch elongation and tip bifurcation in the mammary gland, (2) apply topological data analysis and multifractal analysis to predict the role of tensional force and ECM stiffness on ductal tip bifurcation and side branching in the mammary gland. Findings from this research will improve our understanding of how biomechanical forces affect ductal network formation.

Methods for addressing these prediction or estimation questions frequently rely on suitable mathematical models often combined with measurement data. Here challenging issues arise in the form of unavoidable errors or uncertainties in both model and measurements, as well as a limited understanding of the underlying theoretical properties of the model. All such challenges are severely amplified in complex physical systems due to the presence of a large number of degrees of freedom. This project aims to advance rigorous understanding of these problems and develop new techniques in the context of high-dimensional complex systems, particularly arising in fluid dynamics applications. Specifically, the following topics will be addressed: recovery of missing physical parameters from sparse and noisy observations; long-time behavior of stochastically forced models; and investigation of finite-time singularity formation of certain deterministic hydrodynamic models. The research will be integrated with several educational activities to promote learning and professional development opportunities for students and the organization of a workshop on statistical sampling, with participation from both academia and industry. <br/><br/>The research component of this project is subdivided into the following specific projects: 1) Bayesian inverse PDE problems and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This project will expand on a developing theory of MCMC algorithms on general state spaces, including the development of new algorithms and rigorous convergence results. These will be applied in the recovery of infinite-dimensional physical quantities from sparse and noisy data as described by a Bayesian inverse PDE problem, in the context of various fluid dynamics examples. 2) Mixing rates for stochastic PDEs and weak convergence of associated numerical approximations. The PI will show Wasserstein contraction for the Markovian semigroup associated to several stochastic fluid models, a result that implies exponential mixing rates as well as uniqueness of the associated invariant measure. The PI will also consider suitable numerical discretizations of these models and show uniform in time weak convergence and asymptotic numerical bias estimates. 3) Analysis of locally self-similar singularity scenarios in hydrodynamic models. As a means of investigating reliability of mathematical models, the PI will analyze the possible occurrence of finite-time blowup of locally self-similar type in the context of hydrodynamic models.

Examples of such questions include ""will this treatment for a disease improve the quality of life of a particular patient?"" and ""will participation in this academic program increase student achievement?"" Applying state-of-the-art predictive algorithms to inform policy has received tremendous attention over the past decade, with contributions made by econometricians, statisticians, and computer scientists. Despite the successes of machine learning, there exist pitfalls which are not well-understood by practitioners. We argue that the apparent flexibility of machine learning leads indirectly to a sort of rigidity, with the consequence that the results of an analysis may be a foregone conclusion, driven only by the choice to use a flexible model rather than any empirical data. For example, it is a common popular refrain that ""correlation is not causation"" and that one must be wary of common-causes which can explain an apparent causal relation; we show, however, that poorly designed machine learning methods behave much as humans do and are biased in some sense towards attributing correlations as causal relations. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand and correct for the hidden assumptions underlying a particular type of algorithms based on Bayesian inference, to develop robust methodology based on these insights, and to begin the development of an overarching computational framework for implementing policy-oriented Bayesian machine learning methods in practice.<br/><br/>The appeal of Bayesian machine learning is that it promises to marry the predictive accuracy of modern machine learning and the principled uncertainty quantification of Bayesian inference. The indirect nature of prior specification for many problems leads, however, to a phenomenon we refer to as prior dogmatism: due to the inherent properties of independent priors on high-dimensional spaces, poorly designed Bayesian models can exhibit extreme bias towards the hypothesis that the amount of confounding is negligible. The first objective of this project is to characterize when this occurs (and, importantly, when it does not) in the relatively simple setting of an observational study with many potential confounding variables, and develop Bayesian methods which can be proven theoretically to be robust to dogmatism. The second objective of this project is to extend the insights obtained from the first objective to more advanced designs, such as adaptive clinical trials and observational studies with time-varying treatments and confounding variables. The final objective of this project is to begin the development of a comprehensive computational platform for implementing Bayesian nonparametric causal inference which allow for both (i) careful control over prior specification for important causal parameters and (ii) in-depth sensitivity analysis to assess robustness to untestable causal assumptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects. The corresponding equations contain integro-differential operators that are highly nonlinear, singular and with degenerating coefficients. Integro-differential equations of this type have received increased attention recently: well-posedness and regularity theory are being developed since many new applications have emerged, among which conformal geometry, stochastic control and image processing. The project aims at advancing knowledge in the theories of kinetic equations, nonlocal integro-differential operators and degenerate differential operators."

Exploiting this latent structure in sampling and reconstruction strategies can dramatically increase algorithmic robustness to both noise and missing data.  The theory of compressed sensing shows that if a signal of interest is sparse --- that is, well-approximated by some small subset of a dictionary of basis elements, then the signal can be acquired from a reduced number of measurements and reconstructed using efficient convex programming techniques.   However, current compressed sensing theory is limited<br/>largely to finite-dimensional, well-conditioned, and uniformly bounded dictionaries, and these restrictions limit the scope of applications. Using notions such as variable-density and weighted sparsity, the investigator and her colleagues aim to develop a range of structure-dependent sampling theorems that merge finite-dimensional sparsity constraints with infinite-dimensional smoothness constraints, and which naturally extend the compressed sensing methodology to infinite-dimensional and unbounded function systems.  As a related goal of this proposal, the investigator has teamed up with professors in computer science and electrical engineering at UT Austin to develop an interdisciplinary statistical signal processing seminar series.   The investigator has also recently established the first Association for Women in Mathematics student chapter at UT Austin in order to foster the advancement of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, this proposal puts forth theoretical tools that can be used to design strategies for acquiring high-dimensional data as efficiently as possible, given any known lower-dimensional structure of the data and within the framework of the acquisition process at hand. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one driving application.  Here, one would like to reduce the MRI scan time as much as possible while still acquiring a clear image of the brain, neck, or other internal structure. By exploiting the underlying structure of natural images, such as the localization of information content of the image to boundaries between different materials in the brain, MRI scanning technology can become significantly cheaper and faster, and preliminary experiments by the investigator and collaborators suggest that the  sampling strategies put forth in this proposal have the potential to speed up MRI scan timestenfold. Uncertainty Quantification is another application of the proposed research.  Here, one is interested in analyzing the sensitivity of high-dimensional nonlinear models to small changes in input parameters. Applications range from the design of civil infrastructure to be robust in the face of extreme climate, to the assessment of the stability for climate models with respect to perturbations in initial weather conditions. Generally speaking, Uncertainty Quantification involves repeatedly perturbing the initial conditions of the model at hand, simulating the model at each of these perturbations, and analyzing the resulting output statistics.  Since such simulations are expensive for high-dimensional nonlinear models, one would like to derive strategies for simulating perturbed input parameters so as to gain as much information about the model from as few simulations as possible.<br/><br/>"

Many mathematical models of collective behavior rely on partial differential equations with nonlocal interactions to describe the resulting emergent behavior. It turns out that these models are intimately connected to other models traditionally used in fluid dynamics. The goal of this project is to study several models of nonlocal partial differential equations to model collective behavior or fluid flows, and to develop novel and robust analytical techniques to understand the collective behaviors driven by nonlocal structures. The training and professional development of graduate students and young researchers is an integral part of the project.<br/> <br/>This project studies three families of partial differential equations with shared nonlocal structures that can affect the solutions of the equations: existence, uniqueness, regularity, and long-time asymptotic behaviors. The first problem is on the compressible Euler system with nonlinear velocity alignment, which describes the remarkable flocking phenomenon in animal swarms. Global phenomena and asymptotic behaviors of the system will be investigated, with a focus on the nonlinearity in the velocity alignment. The second problem is on the pressureless Euler system, aiming at the long-standing question of the uniqueness of weak solutions. The plan is to approximate the system by the relatively well-studied Euler-alignment system in collective dynamics. The third problem is on the Euler-Monge-Ampre system which is closely related to the incompressible Euler equations in fluid dynamics.

The primary focus of these areas is the study of high-dimensionality; the consideration often focuses around geometric objects such as convex bodies and hypersurfaces, convex and concave functions, as well as random vectors with certain geometric characteristics. Our experience in low dimensions seems to suggest that when the dimension becomes very large, the geometric properties of objects become more and more complicated and difficult to study. However, many nice, and sometimes surprising, properties arise in high dimensions. Such properties are informally called ``high-dimensional phenomenon''. The study of this phenomenon has been crucial for many applications in computer science, in particular in questions regarding the speed of certain algorithms, as well as in data science. The educational component of this project focuses on supporting junior researchers, with the particular emphasis placed on encouraging female mathematicians. The principal investigator will organize two workshops for junior researchers, featuring research discussions during allocated time, and short lecture courses by leading experts in the field. These workshops are designed to help junior mathematicians to develop new interests and create new collaborations. In addition, a seminar for women in mathematics in Northern Georgia is run by the principal investigator jointly with Yulia Babenko from Kennesaw State University.<br/><br/>The principal investigator has been working on several aspects of the geometry in high dimensions. An important direction of this project concerns the study of the inequalities of Brunn-Minkowski type. More specifically, the intriguing question is how those inequalities improve under certain symmetry and convexity assumptions. The techniques involved in studying such questions involve ideas from Harmonic Analysis and Convex Geometry. In addition, the principal investigator shall continue to study small-ball inequalities and their applications to Information theory. One of the important objects studied by the principal investigator in the past is the noise sensitivity of distributions with respect to convex sets, and the principal investigator shall continue to study this quantity and its relations to the central problems in the field. Finally, a different aspect of the project concerns combinatorial properties of convex sets, such as the illumination number. The principal investigator has studied this number in the past, and is working on improving current known estimates on this quantity."

Scientists think of these reactions as forming a network, like a wiring diagram, with connecting wires describing the movement of nutrients and metabolites through a cell's chemical reactions.  Knowing the entire wiring diagram is not necessary for understanding the fate of individual nutrients, but the many interconnected circuits make it difficult to isolate only the part of the diagram important for certain activities, such as maintaining iron levels. This research will use mathematical techniques (specifically, algebraic geometry and dynamical systems) to find the simplest components in a reaction network that allow a cell to exhibit observed behaviors.

Complementing the research projects will be educational activities centered around a Directed Reading Program in which undergraduate students will gain experience reading and presenting mathematics with the help of graduate-student mentors.<br/><br/>The dynamics observed in living systems is much more than the sum of its parts.  Systems biology, therefore, seeks to understand how biological components come together to generate emergent, systems-level behavior.  A current bottleneck in systems biology is the lack of mathematical theory relating system structure to emergent behavior.  Accordingly, this project will develop a theory of reaction systems tailored to biological networks.  The investigator will build on her recent work that has helped clarify how bistability and other phenomena emerge in real-life systems.  The aims here are to discover new criteria for multistationarity in reaction systems, and to answer the question of when Hopf bifurcations are preserved when new components are added to a network.  These results will be used to answer important biological questions pertaining to how cells process information and how iron levels are maintained within cells.

Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to robotics and to the analysis of large data sets, and a recent revolution in the foundations of algebraic topology has broadened its applicability to other fields of pure mathematics. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several well-known questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry. Some of these questions will be investigated jointly with students as part of undergraduate research projects in the Mathematical Computing Laboratory at UIC, which the PI founded in 2015 with David Dumas and Jan Verschelde. This integration will provide valuable opportunities for students to engage in research and impact ongoing research.<br/><br/>The PI will work on several projects at the border of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Three projects aim to use various topological methods to understand the Brauer group and Azumaya algebras as well as the role of higher algebraic structures in algebraic geometry. (1) The PI will study (higher) algebraic representatives of tale cohomology classes, generalizing the connection between the Picard and Brauer groups and low-degree cohomology groups. (2) The PI will explore separate applications of motivic homotopy theory and persistent homology to the period-index conjecture with the aim of finding algebraic counterexamples to the conjecture.

Group actions arise naturally in many areas of mathematics. For instance, group actions describe the possible symmetries of a regular polygon or, more generally, the ways to cut a polygon into pieces and reassemble into the original polygon.

In the 1940s the amenability theory shifted into the field of functional analysis.  Currently amenability theory appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The core part of the project is based on the recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable.

In many cases, the structure of these networks is dynamically altered by the mechanical feedback of lipid membranes and cytoplasmic flows. However, the majority of current modeling and computational approaches focus on computational tractability at the expense of these mechanical feedbacks. A central theme of this project is that the development of physically realistic models of intracellular polymer networks (and other biological matter) requires a computational approach that efficiently integrates the mechanics of the network with the hydrodynamics of intracellular fluid flows and the mechanical interactions with biological membranes. Such integrative computational efforts are key to building a better understanding of intracellular phenomena. In particular, they hold the potential to help diagnose and treat cytoskeleton-related diseases and guide the development of stem cell techniques. The proposed work will help with the scientific and professional development of both graduate students and undergraduate students. It will also integrate excellent educational opportunities including the development of open education resources; promoting computer-coding literacy as a means to investigate physical phenomena through the development of an educational website with specialized computer coding activities pertaining to the proposed project; conducting boot camps to train undergraduate students on ""Mesoscale computational modeling of intracellular soft matter"" and;  working with the Science Centre at Brown University to engage high school students from underrepresented communities in scientific computing and the physics of soft matter.<br/><br/>The PI proposes a synergistic combination of approaches consisting of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations and stochastic homogenization methods. DPD can accurately model the molecular-scale motion of polymers and fluids without the computational burden that normally makes alternative simulations (e.g., molecular dynamics) unviable. Stochastic homogenization methods, on the other hand, provide the means of efficiently extracting bulk mechanical properties from the mesoscale DPD description. Specific aims of the project include (i) the development of specialized particle-based methods for investigating the mechanical interactions between cytoplasmic flows and intracellular matter, (ii) a computational and analytic investigation of stochastic homogenization approaches to developing mesoscopic mechanical descriptions of intracellular matter, (iii) applications of the developed algorithms to the computational modeling of specific examples of biological matter, such as the actin cytoskeleton and DNA macromolecules, and (iv) the clustering and classification of simulation data in order to characterize the dynamics of biological matter in the systems under investigation. Given the recent interest in intracellular polymer networks  (e.g., the actin cytoskeleton) as therapeutic targets in a broad array of pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,  and kidney disease, the proposed computational approach  is expected to advance significant biomedical applications, especially therapeutic perturbations of cytoskeletal dynamics."

The proposed shearlet approach encompasses the mathematical framework of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to combine optimal sparsity (few coefficients to compute), fast transforms through the power of multiresolution analysis (fast computation) and full mathematical justification and framework (great flexibility and versatility).  The sparsity of the proposed shearlet representation is a direct consequence of its genuinely multidimensional multiscale character, and its fast implementation a consequence of its affine mathematical structure.  The project is organized into three main directions of investigation, with several specific goals.  First, the mathematical framework underpinning the shearlets is investigated to set the foundation for the construction and analysis of optimally sparse multidimensional representations.  Next these representations are applied to the decomposition of functions spaces and operators.  More specifically, the shearlets are used as building blocks of anisotropic function spaces.  This step has significant implications in approximation theory, in the study of Fourier integral operators, and for various nonstandard regularity spaces associated to partial differential equations.  Third, shearlets are applied to problems from image processing and image analysis.  Specifically, improved algorithmic implementations are developed and applied to image denoising, edge detection and shape recognition.  Tests are conducted on biomedical data to address specific application-driven problems, including geometric reconstruction of neuronal morphology from confocal images and neuronal classification.<br/><br/>Over the past twenty years, multiscale methods and wavelets have revolutionized signal processing and stimulated an impressive amount of research in mathematics and engineering.  In fact, wavelets provide optimally efficient representations of one-dimensional data and have fast numerical implementations.  As a result, wavelets are successfully employed in a number of strategic applications, including the new FBI fingerprint database and JPEG-2000, the new standard for image compression.  In spite of their remarkable success, wavelets are far from being optimal in general.  Even though they outperform other traditional methods, they fail to capture intrinsic geometrical features of multidimensional phenomena.  For instance, they do poorly at dealing with features such as the edges of an image or the boundary surfaces of a solid object, and, as a consequence, they are unable to handle efficiently the ever larger multidimensional data sets which are required by many modern applications.  By contrast, the approach addressed in this project is truly multidimensional and opens the door to a new generation of highly efficient methods for the storage, transmission and processing of data.  The applications arising from this research facilitate technological advances in sensitive applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data transmission and classifications, video surveillance, and storage of data."

The investigator studies high contrast composite materials that exhibit an additional feature, which is of geometric nature, namely, the heterogeneous domain either has highly concentrated inhomogeneities or contains multiple scales (that is, its inhomogeneities are very small compared to some length characteristic of the material).  Graduate and undergraduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     Mathematically, high contrast media are described by partial differential equations with coefficients that take on an extremely large range of values in the domain.  The investigator studies problems of this type that also have rapidly varying coefficients, meaning that they fluctuate on a length scale that is much smaller than the size of the domain occupied by the composite.  These problems require special efforts in establishing strategies for designing multiscale models.  Recent advances in the field have led to the development of many approaches that were designed mostly for problems with bounded oscillations in problem parameters.  However, problems whose coefficients have high aspect ratio pose additional challenges for developing both analytical and numerical solution methods.  One therefore seeks techniques that are robust with respect to problem parameters.  The investigator develops efficient analytical and numerical tools for describing strongly heterogeneous flows in media with large variations in material properties and complex geometry."

For example, when we roll a pair of dice, they fly and bounce according to physical laws that are non-random, but the outcome of the roll is nevertheless random.  A more sophisticated example is weather; although we understand atmospheric dynamics and can make reliable short-term predictions, the exact behavior of the weather several weeks from now remains largely random and unpredictable.  The theory of hyperbolic dynamical systems studies the mechanism that drives this evolution from predictability to randomness.  When this mechanism operates consistently no matter what state the system is in, the system is said to be ""uniformly hyperbolic"".  Such systems are well-understood, but this uniformity condition is so restrictive that it rarely applies to physically realistic examples.  A more realistic condition is ""non-uniform hyperbolicity"", where the increase in randomness only happens some of the time, but nevertheless appears eventually for typical initial conditions.  Several different approaches have been used to study non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.  The goal of this project is to develop a unified theory of non-uniform hyperbolicity by clarifying and strengthening the connections between these existing approaches; by introducing new tools; and by studying new classes of examples.<br/><br/>Historically, the two most successful approaches to non-uniform hyperbolicity are Pesin theory (introduced in 1976) and Young towers (introduced in 1998).  Recent work by the PI and his co-authors has introduced ""effective hyperbolicity"" and ""non-uniform specification"".  All four approaches study non-uniform hyperbolicity via invariant measures, but the connections between them are not yet clear, and different approaches have different applications.  For example, Pesin theory gives powerful results once an appropriate invariant measure has been selected, but the other three approaches are more useful for finding distinguished invariant measures such as SRB measures and equilibrium states.  Similarly, Young towers yield stronger statistical properties than the other approaches, but construction of a tower may be quite difficult.  Recently Sarig gave a construction of countable Markov partitions using Pesin theory, which allows a tower to be built for any hyperbolic measure, but gives no information on the rate of decay of the tail of the tower, which is necessary for statistical properties such as the central limit theorem.  Preliminary results by the PI and his co-authors give an alternate construction that yields estimates on the decay rate; the PI will develop this approach to obtain strong statistical properties for a broad class of hyperbolic measures, including the SRB measures constructed using effective hyperbolicity and the equilibrium states constructed using non-uniform specification.  As a first concrete example, geodesic flow in non-positive curvature will be considered; these techniques are expected to give rapid decay of correlations for the unique measure of maximal entropy and other equilibrium states, and to give polynomial decay of correlations for the regular component of Liouville measure (subject to geometric conditions on the manifold).  More generally, the connection between the four approaches will significantly strengthen the tools of effective hyperbolicity and non-uniform specification; it will also make the the powerful theory of Young towers easier to apply, and give a precise sense in which all four approaches are equivalent.  A longer-term goal is to extend the class of rigorously understood non-uniformly hyperbolic examples; one important planned application is to Teichmuller flow, which has deep geometrical significance."

A major innovation in the investigator's recent research is the use of non-commutative Iwasawa theory to study p-adically completed cohomology associated to automorphic forms of cohomological type, in particular, those forms that are not necessarily associated to Shimura varieties. One such class of automorphic forms are modular forms over an imaginary quadratic field. In this case, the associated symmetric space quotients are hyperbolic manifolds of real dimension 3, and thus, the study of such forms is not amenable to the usual techniques of algebraic geometry.  Modular forms over imaginary quadratic fields can be thought of geometrically as cohomology classes of certain local systems on arithmetic 3-manifolds. <br/>From a topological viewpoint, the cohomology of arithmetic 3-manifolds continues to be a subject of intense study. The tension between the number theoretical and topological perspectives makes this a fertile area for interdisciplinary research. The ultimate goal of the investigator's research is to formulate and prove a general reciprocity statement relating all Galois representations to the cohomology of arithmetic groups, generalizing the reciprocity conjecture of Langlands. A more specific goal is to establish conditional modularity theorems over imaginary quadratic fields, adapting the method of Taylor--Wiles.<br/><br/><br/>The Langlands reciprocity conjecture predicts a one-to-one correspondence between two classes of disparate objects: Galois representations, which describe certain symmetries of algebraic numbers, and automorphic forms. <br/>Associated to each Galois representation is an automorphic form, which is like the DNA of the corresponding Galois representation: many properties of the Galois representation can be determined directly from the automorphic form. One strategy for establishing this correspondence is a counting argument: show that the number of automorphic forms (of any fixed<br/>type) equals the number of corresponding Galois representations. Wiles used this strategy to prove a special case of the Langlands reciprocity conjecture, from which Fermat's Last Theorem follows. Wiles' proof relies on certain auxiliary geometric constructions (Shimura varieties) that are not always available, and hence, any general argument requires a more robust method for counting automorphic forms. The investigator proposes such a method: by decomposing automorphic forms into their (mod-p) constituents and then gluing the pieces back together. This process (p-adic completion) relates the old counting problem to questions in topology, in particular, to well-known conjectures of Thurston. The investigator's research along these lines is helping to foster new collaborations between number theorists and low-dimensional topologists, which may lead to advances in several open questions in both fields. The investigator plans to organize several workshops for graduate students and postdocs designed to train young number theorists in this rapidly changing interdisciplinary field.<br/><br/>"

A key idea behind harmonic analysis is to express a general function or operator as a sum of simpler parts. Harmonic analysis has countless practical applications in signal processing, tomography, quantum mechanics, etc. It is also a powerful tool to study many theoretical aspects of mathematics. Fourier restriction theory is a subfield of harmonic analysis, which asks if one can meaningfully restrict the Fourier transform of a function onto a hypersurface, for example, a sphere. One then studies how small pieces of a function with different frequencies interfere with each other. Fourier restriction theory is a central topic in harmonic analysis and plays a fundamental role in certain problems in number theory, differential equations, and geometric measure theory. Thanks to the development of new ideas and techniques in restriction theory, several new state-of-the-art results in harmonic analysis and related fields have been established recently. However, a large portion of the new results are still not sharp, or are unknown in the general dimensions. This project will further develop these new ideas and techniques in restriction theory, and push forward the current best results for related questions, especially in the high-dimension case. The project?s multifaceted activities will include a new component for the existing Northwestern Emerging Scholars Program, work with the Math Alliance, involvement in the Chicago Symposium series, as well as the initiation of a summer program: Harmonic Analysis Reading and Research in Summer (HARRIS).<br/><br/>More specifically, in the project weighted Fourier extension estimates (WFEE), and their variants and applications in partial differential equations and geometric measure theory, will be studied. One important case of WFEE is the boundedness of the Schrdinger maximal function. Such estimates are motivated by the recent proof of the almost everywhere convergence problem of Schrdinger solutions, a question which was raised by Carleson four decades ago. The full range of boundedness of the Schrdinger maximal function has been established when the spatial dimension is 1 or 2, but it remains open in higher dimensions. Another special case of WFEE that will be investigated is connected to a difficult problem in geometric measure theory: Falconer's distance set problem. The project will not only apply but also improve various tools and techniques from harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, incidence geometry, combinatorics, and other related areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include geoscience, medicine, climate science, manufacturing, national security, and economics. Inversion is an indispensable tool to infer knowledge from data in a consistent and predictable way, enabling scientific discovery, decision-making, and ultimately dependable model- and data-informed predictions. However, the practical use of inversion remains limited unless uncertainties can be quantified as they propagate through models and algorithms, Uncertainty quantification adds significant mathematical complications and massive computational costs to an already challenging problem. This project will develop a generic mathematical framework for large-scale, statistical inverse problems alongside software infrastructure with algorithms that scale on modern and future computing architectures. It blends mathematical methods and theory with data-intensive applications and good algorithmic practices to advance the frontiers of computational and data-enabled sciences, with the ultimate aspiration to promote data-driven scientific discovery and model-based prediction and by that, science in general. Alongside research activities, an educational and dissemination program is developed to communicate the results under this work to STEM students and researchers, and a broad audience of computational scientists and application specialists. The project will train students in areas that have seen exceptionally high industry demand in the US in recent years, such as optimization, statistical inference, data-enabled science, performance evaluation, and workload characterization. Educational activities include hands-on research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students, explicitly encouraging participation by minorities and underrepresented groups. Public domain software modules will be made available to a broad STEM audience and practitioners. Applications of this work include medicine, imaging, and geosciences.<br/><br/>Fundamental mathematical and computational aspects of optimization under uncertainty, statistical inference, and the solution of large-scale inverse problems will be investigated in this project to promote the progress of scientific discovery and data exploration. The overarching aim is the design of fast computational kernels and scalable, black-box algorithms that rigorously follow mathematical and physical principles, have a sound theoretical basis, and provably converge to an optimal solution independent of the problem dimension. This includes the development of adaptive, hierarchical numerical schemes and mixed-precision algorithms, enabling high-accuracy computations if desired, and low-accuracy approximations when possible, targeting high data-throughput applications. The project explores (i) foundational mathematical aspects and the deployment of fast (scalable) algorithms for transport-based variational inference, (ii) the design of problem-informed regularization schemes for nonlinear inverse problems, and (iii) the integration of randomized algorithms and learning for the construction of low-order surrogate models for optimization, inference, sampling, and preconditioning. Effective numerical techniques and computational kernels for a fast evaluation of gradient and curvature information and their approximation are of paramount importance for the designed methodology.  The performance will be assessed for parabolic (diffusion-dominated) and hyperbolic (advection-dominated) dynamical systems of varying complexity with applications in computational medicine, climate science, and geoscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such operator learning problems arise in various applications in disciplines such as physics, biology, engineering, economics, and hydrography. These kernels/functions represent the intrinsic physical laws of interactions between particles or the inherent structures of the operators. Thus, they are as fundamental as the physical laws of gravity in physics, shredding insight into models in their applications. Therefore, it is paramount to construct robust convergent estimators when the data size increases to reveal the intrinsic laws that are not sensitive to the data. <br/> <br/>This project will develop a unified computational approach for the nonparametric learning of kernels/functions in operators from high- or infinite dimensional data, and the products are scalable algorithms with performance guarantees in a unifying variational framework. It will study four groups of applications where the goal is to recover the kernels/functions in PDE operators, non-Markovian processes, state-space models, and weighted convolution operators. Notably, a systematic learning theory, covering identifiability and regularization, will address the challenges from nonlocal dependence and high-dimensional data. Furthermore, this theory builds the mathematical foundations for a general framework, making the algorithms and theory applicable to inverse problems far beyond those studied in this proposal. Finally, the research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate teaching in multiple disciplines, promote the fundamental role of computational math in statistical/machine learning, and provide many research opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project has two primary goals: to find new constructive methods to realize groups as Galois groups, and to advance the use of technology in the undergraduate mathematics classroom. For the first goal, the study will focus on obstructions to central embedding problems. The project will provide new insights into the role of Galois cohomology and computation in exhibiting explicit polynomials with given Galois groups over the field of rational numbers. One specific aim of the educational plan is to write an undergraduate textbook on Galois Theory which will employ modern algebraic computation to present examples efficiently and will replace ruler-and-compass constructions with recent research in the area of explicit construction of fields as an underlying theme.    The research component of this project is in the general area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems."

An example of the resonance phenomenon is the sound we hear after striking a bell: it has a frequency of oscillation (the tone) and a rate of decay (how soon we stop hearing the sound), which both depend on the shape of the bell. The frequency and the decay rate that we hear correspond to the real and imaginary part of the least-decaying resonance of the bell. Eigenvalues and resonances have innumerable applications in physics and engineering. A major goal of this project is to understand how the distribution of eigenvalues and resonances depends on the system (for example, how the shape of the bell determines how long it will sound); while this topic has seen recent progress, there remain many important open questions. The project includes research projects for graduate students and numerical experiments for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The project employs microlocal analysis, which is the mathematical theory explaining the classical/quantum, or particle/wave, correspondence. For instance, the high-energy distribution of resonances in the simplest model of a bell is related to the classical dynamical system of billiard ball trajectories inside the bell: for bounded times, waves approximately propagate along billiard ball trajectories. However, for long times this approximation becomes worse and eventually breaks down. An especially interesting situation is when the classical system has chaotic behavior; the implications for eigenfunctions and resonances are studied in the field of quantum chaos. Part of the project is centered around the fractal uncertainty principle, which is a new tool beyond the classical/quantum correspondence, established through use of harmonic analysis, fractal geometry, and combinatorics. The fractal uncertainty principle has already seen several applications, including progress towards the conjecture that all strongly chaotic open systems have exponential wave decay. Another part of the project is the study of classical, or Pollicott-Ruelle, resonances, using microlocal methods -- a rare example of the reversal of the classical/quantum correspondence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theory deals with properties of whole numbers, such as quickly factoring large numbers into primes, and underpins computer security and behavior of black holes. Harmonic analysis can be viewed as mathematically making a sculpture out of unformed clay; this field takes a complicated function and breaks it up into simple pieces ? its harmonics ? and is central to medical imaging and quantum states. Imagining and building a new landscape where areas sometimes perceived as disconnected can harmonize is at the forefront of this project: Instead of exploiting known connections, new ones will be created centered around three distinct areas. Firstly, quantitative behavior of discrete operators with curvature will be undertaken; while relevant to many applications, the novelty here will be developing the infrastructure to use both analysis and number theory from the perspective of both fields. The second part will be a continuation of the discovery of hidden number theoretic properties in the framework underlying harmonic analysis, furthering this mathematical grid system in both areas. Finally, determining the behavior of a random object of algebraic interest, such as a polynomial, is a central problem in mathematics. By integrating Fourier analysis into this playing field, will enable a better prediction of this randomness in a wide variety of ways. Undergraduates will be heavily involved in research, especially in the second part, via a summer and semester research and training program. The multifaceted and network-building education plan further includes the teaching of a graduate class intitled ?Widening the margins: the experience of URMs in the mathematical sciences,? which will be developed in collaboration with the institution?s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main programs, all on the intersection between harmonic analysis and number theory. Firstly, operator bounds for discrete operators involving integration over curved submanifolds will be obtained. This is a delicate topic in continuous analysis and the discrete setting introduces new challenges and obstacles. A development of number theoretic tools in tandem with the analysis will dramatically push forward understanding of these objects. Additionally, these bounds are connected to lattice point counts and information on this front will be quantified via refined analysis of exponential sums, including discrete restriction problems for a variety of surfaces that are translation dilation invariant. Secondly, a continued uncovering of a hidden number theoretic structure and techniques in the realm of dyadic analysis will be pursued, leading to a myriad of structure theorems. Thirdly, the program in Fourier analytic techniques in arithmetic statistics will use novel insights from analysis to improve a variety of counts of algebraic interest, such as fields and polynomials. Prior investigations here have already been successful as recent results include a major step in resolving a conjecture of van der Waerden on Galois groups of random polynomials and counting number fields of bounded discriminant.

This versatile framework includes a vast array of models in the natural sciences, for example, the dynamics of populations of animals and plants in an ecological system, and the shape and form of a turbulent wake behind a passing ship. The work in this proposal concerns chaotic behavior of dynamical systems, signified, for instance, by sensitive dependence on initial conditions ? a phenomenon also known as ?the butterfly effect,? in which tiny changes to the initial preparation of an experiment lead to drastically different outcomes as time progresses.  Chaos is nearly ubiquitous in systems of practical interest.  An example from everyday life is weather prediction: sensitive dependence explains, for instance, why the predicted path of a hurricane widens as one forecasts further into the future, as small imprecisions in our measurements of the present weather system are ?amplified? as time progresses. This CAREER grant will integrate the PI?s research work into educational programs, including directed reading programs and research opportunities for undergraduate students; the introduction of new undergraduate and graduate courses on the treatment of chaotic dynamical systems using tools from probability theory; and a summer school for graduate students in mathematics helping to bring them to the research front of this compelling and rapidly evolving field.  <br/><br/>Chaos is a nearly ubiquitous feature of dynamical systems of practical interest, from low-dimensional toy models to high-dimensional systems, including a wide variety of infinite-dimensional dynamics proscribed by evolutionary PDE such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations governing the motion of a viscous fluid.  The tools of smooth ergodic theory provide an abstract framework for understanding chaotic behavior in dynamical systems through the study of their statistical properties, such as the decay of correlations.  However, it remains a major challenge to apply this collection of abstract tools to many systems of practical interest.  For instance, despite considerable supporting numerical evidence, it remains an open problem to prove that the Chirikov standard map has a positive Lyapunov exponent on a positive-volume subset of phase space.  Recent work of the PI and others has uncovered that a small amount of nondegenerate noise is ?amplified? by the presence of stretching in phase space, rendering tractable the problem of determining whether the dynamics is chaotic.  This principle has been applied by the PI to a variety of dynamical systems relevant to practical applications, such as fluid dynamics.  For instance, it was shown by the PI and collaborators that passive tracer (Lagrangian) flow in an incompressible fluid ? such as the motion traced out by a mote of dust suspended in a fluid ? is chaotic in the above sense. This led to a mathematical proof of Batchelor?s law, a quantitative prediction of the formation of small-scale structures in the concentration profile of a solute, such as the billowing patterns formed by drops of milk poured into a cup of coffee.  This project seeks to build off these successes by applying smooth ergodic theory to more complicated dynamical systems, e.g., the evolution of an incompressible velocity field by the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of noise (the so-called Eulerian dynamics of a fluid). A long-term goal along these lines is a detailed, mathematically rigorous investigation into the transition from laminar and ordered behavior to chaotic and unpredictable dynamics seen in many fluid systems as Reynolds? number is increased.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, many questions remain, and these equations continue to be crucially important, as the techniques used to study them have helped shape the foundation of modern cryptosystems. In 1922, Louis Mordell conjectured that equations defining curves of genus at least 2 have only finitely many rational solutions.  Gerd Faltings proved this in 1983, but his proof does not explicitly yield the set of rational points on these curves.  Algorithmically determining this set is one of the most fundamental open problems in number theory.  Quadratic Chabauty is a new approach to determining the set of rational points, and through a combination of theoretical and computational strategies, the PI will give quadratic Chabauty algorithms to determine rational points on new classes of curves. This project also includes several educational and outreach components, including a collection of undergraduate-focused workshops in Guam on the topic of computational tools, aimed at broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. The PI will also co-organize a week-long summer program in mathematical exploration and computation for high school students in the Boston area, as well as a semester program at Mathematical Sciences Research Institute on Diophantine geometry.<br/><br/>The main research themes are centered on algorithms for determining rational points on curves of genus at least 2, using p-adic heights.<br/>They include the following: using p-adic heights to produce a quadratic Chabauty algorithm for modular curves, developing an elliptic quadratic Chabauty algorithm to study twisted Fermat curves, and building infrastructure in Coleman integration and p-adic heights in families. These new algorithms will be run on large databases of curves, and the resulting data will be analyzed and shared with the mathematical community.

Painleve equations will be studied, where the central goal is a classification of the algebraic relations between solutions. The second main area of this project is machine learning. In this area, model theoretic tools will be brought to bear to solve foundational open problems in learning theory.

In-depth understanding of such principles will not just reveal the strengths and limitations of the techniques, but also indicate possible directions for future enhancement and improvement. This project aims to promote understanding of the mathematical principles in non-destructive probing techniques from both theoretical and computational perspectives.

Scientists, businesses, governments and independent organizations want to learn from this data so they can understand basic biological mechanisms, invest capital, allocate aid and design coherent policy in a changing world. Evolutionary contagion (Evo-Con) models seek to identify and predict viral variants with heightened rates of spread by jointly modeling viral contagion and evolution. Analyzing spatial patterns of viral contagion is an area of immense scientific interest, but the task requires accounting for the nature of transportation networks that shape the global economy. As a result, big data applications become computationally intensive and benefit from high-performance computing. The project advances knowledge and utility of Evo-Con models in the context of massive amounts of complex, dynamic and geographically distributed data. In lockstep with these developments, the investigator will develop ""Statistical Learning Goes Viral"", a free-access MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), with concomitant free-access expository textbook and further expand his efforts building bridges between UCLA and key historically black colleges and universities.<br/><br/>The investigator will combine theory, methods and computing in a way that facilitates high-impact data analysis and easy measurement of success. The PI will (1) develop a class of nonlinear and multivariate phylogenetic Hawkes processes that use autoregressive neural networks to maintain both flexibility and scalability. Nonlinear phylogenetic Hawkes process development will capitalize on experience building heavily hierarchical models for joint data, but a pragmatic approach will depart from previous Bayesian implementations to enhance scalability and prediction; and (2) adapt these stochastic process models to complex transportation patterns in a way that responds to spatial data precision by combining nonlinear dimension reduction with convolutional neural networks (CNN). When travel networks explicitly present themselves, the PI will leverage experience building spatial models that account for network structures by incorporating nonlinearities through graph CNNs. More radical within phylogeography, the PI will eschew explicit network representations with the help of spherical CNNs that build implicit representations of global spatial dependencies to model viral contagion with increased flexibility. By hierarchically combining (1) and (2) within the same factor graph, the joint data neural model will fully integrate spatial, genomic, and temporal data. Finally, the investigator will (3) construct high-performance computing techniques that leverage conventional and quantum resources to fit complex, multimodal and high-dimensional model geometries.

Curves are some of the most fundamental geometric objects in mathematics; the simplest examples include such familiar shapes as the parabola and the circle, but on a deeper level, these objects play a crucial role in myriad fields of mathematics as well as the theoretical physics of string theory.  Although mathematicians have studied curves for centuries, a breakthrough occurred in the late twentieth century with the advent of moduli spaces.  A moduli space, roughly speaking, is the collection of all curves of a given type, and it was a groundbreaking realization that one can often more effectively understand curves by considering them in such families rather than studying them individually.  In this project, the PI will undertake several sub-projects that will advance understanding of the moduli space of curves from both a theoretical and a computational standpoint, and she will initiate the study of a new variant of the moduli space that illuminates a connection between the geometry of curves, the combinatorics of polytopes, and the algebra of permutations.  Alongside their intellectual merit, these projects will provide numerous avenues for student engagement: an undergraduate research program through which the PI will recruit and mentor undergraduates at her home institution of San Francisco State University (SFSU) to the Master?s level; the authoring of an algebraic geometry textbook geared toward preparing less-experienced Master?s students for research in the PI?s field; and research projects as well as community-building via which the PI will mentor Master?s-level researchers through the transition to a PhD.  Because SFSU serves a highly diverse undergraduate student body, these steps toward strengthening the pipeline from Bachelor?s to PhD present a unique opportunity for broadening participation and promoting inclusivity in the mathematics community.<br/><br/>More technically speaking, this project is focused on two separate but interrelated lines of research.  The first involves studying the intersection theory of the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of curves.  Although the Chow ring of this moduli space is unwieldy in general, there is a subring known as the tautological ring that carries much of the moduli space?s geometric content while admitting an explicit set of additive generators.  Continuing a longstanding research program, the PI will investigate the relations among these generators, with the long-term goal of using them to determine a formula for the Chow class of the hyperelliptic locus.   The second line of research pursues a new family of moduli spaces constructed by the PI and her collaborators, which parameterize genus-zero curves with cyclic action.  The motivation for these spaces arises from the fact that, in the genus-zero case, the Chow ring of the moduli space of curves admits intriguing parallels to the simpler setting of toric varieties and yet, from a birational geometry perspective, it diverges from the toric case more than was originally expected.  Perhaps the most famous part of this story is Fulton?s F-conjecture, a statement about the Mori cone of the moduli space that remains unsolved.  The new moduli spaces introduced by the PI and her collaborators are not toric, yet their intersection theory generalizes that of toric varieties in that it is encoded by a polytopal complex.  Further investigation of these spaces will shed light on the applicability of polyhedral combinatorial methods outside the domain of toric varieties, and most ambitiously, may give a setting in which the analogue of the F-conjecture can be proven.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This open question has been recently formulated as a mathematical problem that  has challenged the mathematical community but has yet to be solved. The question is related to another one: what is the most ""efficient"" way to encode and transmit given information? For example, a) one can try to  minimize the number of symbols used in encoding the information, or b) one can maintain ""certain structures"" (say by repeating some ""pattern"") in encoded messages in order to avoid loss of information, provided that a couple of errors can be made during its transmission. The goal of this project is to investigate what the best way is to approximate given information or a given signal using only zeros and ones. The principal investigator will involve undergraduate and graduate students in research projects described in the proposal. The PI will organize a yearly summer school in analysis and probability for graduate students. This will be a good opportunity for PhD students to participate in research discussions with leading experts and to learn about emerging areas in mathematics. <br/><br/>The question of quantum algorithms described above can be formulated as an explicit Fourier?analytic question on the boolean cube.

One of the important examples  involves the  Hamming cube, equipped with a product  measure.

But progress in computing is now allowing researchers to measure and store huge amounts of data at once, opening the door to understanding and manipulating much more complex systems than ever before. Indeed, the field of machine learning has been very successful at fitting predictive models to such data sets, but the black-box nature of these methods makes it hard to draw scientific insights from them using the usual statistical approach. In fact, not only do classical statistical methods fail in this modern big data setting, but the questions they answer no longer even make sense because the models they are based on do not hold even approximately. In this research, the PI will first come up with new statistical ways of posing scientific questions that make sense in complex data but still have interpretable answers. Second, the PI will find new statistical methods to answer those questions in a rigorous way, and study the mathematical and computational properties of these methods so that they can be used as effectively as possible. And finally, the PI will work with experts in the areas of genomics, the microbiome, and political science to use these methods to gain new scientific insights in these fields. Throughout the project, the PI will also run a free statistical consulting service to help the broader research community, develop new curricula with high school teachers, and provide enriching educational and research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>To understand the importance of a covariate in a high-dimensional regression, it has become increasingly popular to perform a hypothesis test for conditional independence with the response. The appeal of such a test is that it provides statistically rigorous insight that is well-defined and scientifically interpretable no matter how the response depends on the covariates, including the case when their relationship is highly nonlinear and includes interactions, possibly of high order. However, conditional independence as a model-free inferential target only provides a type of scientific insight that can be of little use in some applications. The PI will extend conditional independence to new model-free targets for two types of data on which it does not provide a useful inferential target, namely, data with highly-locally-dependent covariates and data with compositional covariates. Then, the PI will move past conditional independence entirely to propose novel model-free targets that instead of just identifying (as in variable selection) actually numerically quantify relationships in the data, such as the relationship between a covariate and a response or the interaction between two covariates in the response's conditional distribution. Along with each new target, the PI will develop entirely new methods for powerful and provably valid inference. The novelty of the proposed targets and associated methods will provide for new connections with other fields of statistics including Bayesian computation, measure theory, statistical physics, experimental design, causal inference, and graphical model estimation. Ultimately, this research aims to provide a suite of new tools for researchers to move beyond the constraints of parametric targets and instead leverage state-of-the-art machine learning tools to answer novel and important questions about their data in a statistically principled way.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vast majority of the available data is unlabeled, which makes the modeling problem more challenging. This project will advance the field of modeling big complex unlabeled data.  The focus will be on learning from network data as well as learning dependency structures from regular data. Some of the concrete problems investigated are: What can an epidemic spreading over a network tell us about the structure of the network and the origin of the epidemic? What can the structure of the network tell us about the latent features of the nodes, for example, their grouping, or community in the case of social networks? Are there more refined structures in real networks beyond simple grouping or community structure? Can we learn complex networks from regular data that tell us about the nature of the dependency among the underlying variables (for example, what variables are the causes of a given variable)? How well do these often complex models fit the real data? Advancing on these questions has a direct impact on many scientific domains dealing with data. For example, genomics and computational biology, neuroscience, epidemiology, network security, social sciences and marketing, all benefit from advances in network analysis. Advances in dependency structure learning can improve causal inference procedures with impact on all scientific fields. This project on network epidemics has the potential to be transformative with immediate applications to the public health domain.<br/><br/>This project advances the state-of-the art in inferring complex relations from data in an unsupervised fashion. As a result, network inference and graphical modeling will play prominent roles in our approach. We will consider four main tasks: 1) Developing goodness-of-fit tests for structured network models, in particular those used in community detection and clustering. Despite advances in network modeling, there are concerns that current models are not capturing the complexity of real networks. A first step toward realistic network modeling is developing tools for assessing how well the models fit. 2) Advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling complex networks, presenting ideas on capturing self-similarity in real networks as well as hierarchical statistical models for multilayer networks. 3) Advancing inference based on network dynamics: Many networks are accompanied by dynamics governed by the network structure, e.g., the spread of rumors and diseases. We often observe the result of the dynamics (who gets infected over time) and would like to make inference about the origin of the dynamic or the structure of the underlying network. We will address the challenges in dealing with these questions in real networks where the presence of many cycles and incomplete information about the dynamic pose serious difficulties. 4) Advancing inference of high-dimensional dependency structures: Characterizing dependencies (correlation, causation, etc.) among a collection of random variables is a fundamental task of statistical analysis. The principal investigator will explore learning high-dimensional directed graphical models from data that are suitable for causal interpretations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of rigidity phenomenon is one of the central themes in dynamical systems, with applications to number theory, geometry, and mathematical physics. Roughly speaking, an action is rigid if various properties of the system are preserved under appropriate modifications. So far, systems with strong chaotic properties have been well understood. In many systems of interest however, only weak chaotic behaviors can be observed. The goal of this project is to develop new tools to study such systems and then apply these results to study other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and representation theory. The research plan is complemented by educational and outreach activities involving the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, and fostering collaborations among female researchers in different areas.<br/><br/>The proposed research plan consists of several coherent projects, ranging from dynamical systems, harmonic analysis for Lie groups, representation theory and number theory. The principal investigator plans to establish cocycle rigidity and to study (twisted) cohomological equations for a large class of algebraic partially hyperbolic and parabolic actions by using representation theory. The results and techniques from the study of parabolic actions will be applied to number theory for the study of effective equidistribution for certain unipotent flows and maps on some homogenous spaces of semidirect product groups.

While this method originates in foundational questions, over the years profound applications to the study of many central objects of classical mathematics and computer science were discovered. This project will investigate an emerging connection to the area of graph theory. Graphs are the basic discrete mathematical objects used to model networks and related systems. In combinatorics, one often investigates the asymptotic behavior of various quantitative properties (such as the density of the edges, or the size of a certain regular pattern) for large finite graphs. Model theory provides a method of converting asymptotic quantitative questions about properties of a family of graphs into qualitative questions about the shape, volume or dimension of a certain limiting infinite object (via the so-called ultraproduct construction). Infinitary model-theoretic machinery to study such limit objects will be used to address questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely rich body of results in combinatorics will be used to attack open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>As demonstrated in the previous work of the principal investigator and other researchers, recent advances on pseudo-randomness and Ramsey-type phenomena for restricted families of graphs (e.g. semialgebraic regularity lemma by Fox et al., Tao's algebraic regularity lemma over finite fields, regularity lemma for graphs of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension by Lovasz-Szegedy, etc.) admit a uniform model-theoretic treatment well-aligned with the methods and ideas in Shelah's classification theory. This project initiates a systematic program of investigating these connections, centered around the study of Keisler measures and various model-theoretic notions of dimension (e.g. coming from forking independence or pseudofinite counting) in tame classes of first-order structures (stable, distal, dependent, simple, NTP2, etc.), as well as the finer questions on generalized ""incidence bounds"" and their relation to Zilber's trichotomy phenomena."

The statistical analysis, in turn, relies on assumptions which, if violated, can lead to incorrect or misleading outcomes. In many modern applications, the statistical modeling is further complicated by inherent structural inhomogeneities in the population. Specific examples include the spread of information in social networks, genetic variation among mitochondrial DNA sequences from different species, collisions of particles suspended in a non-uniform medium, and identification of suspicious activity in a criminal or terrorist network. With these applications in mind, the project initiates a systematic study of probabilistic models and inferential principles for data taken from heterogeneous or specially structured populations. Attainment of these goals requires techniques from several mathematical and scientific areas and should lead to progress at the intersection of applied science, statistics, probability, and mathematics. Project outcomes will lead to a better understanding of how fundamental statistical assumptions affect the validity of scientific conclusions. The mathematical theory and statistical methods developed should have a broad societal impact, as combinatorial stochastic processes are used throughout modern applications in physical, biological, and social sciences, national security, and beyond. The PI has extensive plans for training graduate and undergraduate students in the methods to be used, via courses on the foundations of statistics at both levels, the supervision of Ph.D. theses, and conferences and workshops on these topics for these and other early-career researchers. The plans are innovative and the PI will devote significant time and resources to them. In particular, a strong emphasis will be placed on attracting and hiring students from underprivileged backgrounds who are first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The specific technical objective is a rigorous mathematical theory for understanding random structures that exhibit relative exchangeability and other invariance principles.  A hallmark of the project is the in-depth study and rigorous development of theory and applications for edge exchangeable network models, which were first introduced by the PI as a novel invariance principle for network analysis.  Desired outcomes include relative invariance principles, structural properties, and characterization theorems for evolving combinatorial structures. The project will also exploit deep connections between combinatorics, algebra, logic, and probability theory to refine prior work by de Finetti, Kingman, Aldous, Hoover, and Kallenberg, on graph limits and Levy-Ito-type representations of Feller processes on combinatorial state spaces. Theoretical developments should guide methodological advances in specific applications, including climate science, network science, and phylogenetics."

To facilitate statistical learning in real time, there is an urgent need for principled and computationally efficient statistical methodology. Variational Inference methods have recently emerged as a popular choice in this context. The term ""Variational Inference"" refers to a general out-of-the-box strategy to develop statistical algorithms for a wide class of problems. For example, these algorithms are used as a sub-routine in text mining, generation of hyper-realistic artificial text and images, machine translation, etc. This approach is extremely attractive due to the computational efficiency of the proposed methods, and their superior practical performance. Despite these advantages, rigorous guarantees for these variational methods are still in a nascent state. This project will develop statistical guarantees for the validity of this approach in diverse settings. Subsequently, these new insights will be exploited to develop novel statistical methodology for modern data applications. The outcome of the proposed research will allow practitioners to deploy Variational Inference methods with confidence. In addition, the outcomes will add a new set of principled, computationally efficient methods to the statistician's toolkit. The PI will interweave his research and teaching throughout the research period and beyond. In particular, the PI will develop new undergraduate/graduate courses focusing on Variational Inference and mentor students (particularly those from under-represented backgrounds) with the aim of introducing them to opportunities in statistics and data science. The proposed research and educational activities will broaden participation in STEM generally, and encourage careers in statistics and data science.<br/><br/>This project will study statistical inference based on variational approximations focusing on three concrete thrusts: (i) Statistical inference based on the Naive Mean Field (NMF) approximation for regression models, (ii) NMF approximation beyond regression and (iii) Advanced Mean Field approximations. Under theme (i), the PI will develop empirical Bayes methodology for the high-dimensional linear model, and compare Bayesian variable selection algorithms using the NMF approximation. Theme (ii) will focus on the NMF approximation for Hidden Markov Random Fields and Bayesian Neural Networks. Finally, theme (iii) will focus on certain alternative mean-field approximations. Physicists conjecture that if the number of datapoints and features are both large and comparable, the NMF approximation is no longer accurate; instead, the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approximation, an advanced mean-field approximation, should facilitate Bayes optimal inference. The proposed research will establish this conjecture in the context of high-dimensional linear regression under a proportional asymptotic regime. The theoretical foundations of the proposed methodology will rest on disparate ideas originating in non-linear large deviations (studied in probability and combinatorics), spin glasses (studied in probability and statistical physics) and graphical models. In turn, these ideas will be combined with classical statistical ideas (e.g. nonparametric maximum likelihood) to develop computationally efficient methods for high-dimensional inference. This cross-pollination of ideas will generate independent follow up research directions in each domain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research goal is to develop a systematic deep learning analysis serving as the theoretical foundation of numerous scientific problems based on deep learning; cutting-edge algorithms for the efficient solutions of high-dimensional and highly nonlinear partial differential equations arising in various application domains will also be proposed with a theoretical guarantee. The proposed deep learning-based algorithms for high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems will be expected to greatly advance the state-of-the-art simulations of complex physical systems arising in many fields in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The theoretical challenges of deep learning are largely due to the highly non-linear nature of deep neural networks (DNNs). As a function parametrization tool formulated as compositions of non-linear functions, DNNs are highly non-linear and require advanced mathematics to fully understand. Therefore, there is a critical need for new advances in mathematics for a better understanding of DNNs. The theoretical part of this project mainly focuses on the approximation and generalization capacity of DNNs. The central questions to be answered are whether DNN approximation conquers or lessens the curse of dimensionality, what is the optimal approximation rate of various function classes, and how to characterize the Rademacher complexity of various DNNs trained with state-of-the-art empirical regularization methods aiming at optimal generalization error bound. The computational part of this project concentrates on solving high dimensional and highly oscillatory partial differential equations. The specific approach of this project is to propose hybrid algorithms that combine the advantage of deep learning algorithms and traditional numerical techniques for more efficient computation and higher accuracy. The key idea is to treat deep learning solvers as a preconditioner of traditional numerical algorithms. The algorithms designed in the project will also be implemented in deep learning packages for numerical PDEs and made publicly available.

The project will also investigate the maximal functions corresponding to the Hardy-Littlewood averaging operators associated with convex symmetric bodies.  The longstanding question of whether dimension-free estimates may be obtained for these maximal functions is related to the isotropic constant conjecture in high-dimensional convex geometry, which in turn has inspired deep and unexpected connections to many challenging questions in convex geometry, Banach space theory, and beyond.  Describing the optimal constant in the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality in this setting would establish a new link between the dimension-free conjecture and the isotropic constant conjecture, and a new point of view on the latter problem, which has not yet been explored using tools from harmonic analysis. In addition, the project will develop tools in Fourier analysis and additive number theory toward a study of Weyl-type inequalities in the nilpotent setting and their applications to a nilpotent Waring problem as well as to a dimension-free variant of the classical Waring problem for squares.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although these invariants have been developed and used to resolve various longstanding conjectures in recent times, several mysteries remain, and new horizons continue to come into focus. The project aims to complete foundational work related to spectral invariants, clarify how they relate to each other, prove new and more refined results, explore higher dimensions, and study potential new and important applications. A synergistic educational component is centered around building a digital hub for undergraduate mathematical research, supporting mathematics education of incarcerated individuals, and supporting high school education beyond the traditional curriculum through volunteer efforts.<br/><br/>In previous research, the PI proved symplectic analogs of Weyl laws for embedded contact homology, periodic Floer homology, and link spectral variants in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, recovering classical symplectic invariants from the asymptotics of more modern ones.

A ubiquitous feature of such problems is a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, extending all the way up to the scale of observational interest. As numerical simulations are practically impossible on the microscopic scale, a simplified and effective description of the physical quantities, such as the surface height, the density of pollutants, and the wave intensity, is extremely desirable for these problems. The goal of the project is to study the relevant random PDEs, and to lay down mathematical foundations for simplified effective models in various approximation regimes. Organic part of this project is the educational program that is integrated with research. The educational program includes a sustained training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of probability theory, analysis, and applications, through designing advanced courses, supervising undergraduate research, and organizing workshops for early career researchers. The goal is to introduce students to the analytic and probabilistic tools that are indispensable for both academic research and engineering applications.<br/> <br/>The focus of this project is in the areas of stochastic PDEs, diffusion in random environment, and wave propagation in random media. By combining tools, such as asymptotic expansions, functional inequalities and stochastic analysis, the principal investigator will study (i) nonlinear stochastic PDEs modeling interface growth; (ii) behavior of directed polymers in random environment; (iii) effective models of wave propagation in random media. One of principal themes of the project is to analyze the dependence of observables on the random perturbations, and to understand the interplay between the nonlinearity and the randomness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and dynamical systems, which studies the behavior of repeated applications of functions on certain sets of points. A key component of this project is to bring the techniques from each of these disciplines to bear on questions from the other.  The project includes educational components at every level.  At the most advanced levels, the project focuses on introducing algebraic dynamics to new audiences, including graduate students in dynamics and researchers in algebraic geometry.

There has been considerable effort directed at understanding lower bounds on degree growth, and the investigators will use new methods from the Sarkisov program to study this question.  The researchers will also investigate computational questions and improve the capacity of the open-source SageMath system to compute dynamical degrees.

The research project focuses on three dimensional manifolds. A three-manifold is a space that near each point looks like the three-dimensional space we live in. Mathematically, such spaces can be approached from different viewpoints. One of them is topological: considering properties of the space that are preserved by continuous deformations. Another viewpoint is geometric: studying certain rigid structures associated to the space. A three-manifold can also be described by equations and by an algebraic object called a group, which allows tools from algebraic geometry. Yet another point of view is computational: many sophisticated algorithms not only help calculate invariants of three-manifolds, but also raise questions about algorithmic complexity of various mathematical problems. This project includes a study of intrinsic geometric and topological properties of 3-manifolds, as well as the rich interplay between all these approaches. Subprojects stemming from interesting special cases of harder problems are suitable for early-career mathematicians, allowing the educational program to be strongly intertwined with the research goals. The PI will continue research training and mentoring at all stages, from projects with undergraduates to working with postdoctoral researchers.  Through cross-disciplinary workshops, the PI aims to strengthen relations between the above mentioned fields of research. Building on her prior mentoring experience with students from underrepresented groups through the Association for Women in Mathematics and the Garden State LS Alliance for Minority Participation programs, the PI will continue to support underrepresented communities through research involvement.

First, the performance of these methods is usually sensitive to multiple subjective choices of tuning parameters. Second, the methods developed for the purpose of estimation typically cannot be directly used for statistical inference. This project aims to systematically develop a new paradigm of multi-dimensional nonparametric methods under natural shape constraints that simultaneously resolves these two critical issues. In particular, the shape-constrained methods to be developed in this project will not only be fully automated without ad-hoc tuning, but also enjoy simultaneous optimal estimation and inference merits. The project will integrate research with education through course development, research mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and summer programs. <br/><br/>This project will focus on two complementary categories of research problems. Problems in the first category aim at understanding the potentials of a class of non-standard generalized block estimators, and the drawbacks of standard methods such as the maximum likelihood or least squares. Problems in the second category aim at developing fully automated inference procedures for several canonical local and global inference targets using the non-standard methods, in a few related models.

This project is concerned with understanding how the solutions to such equations behave. The Laplace equation is the prototypical elliptic PDE, and it is used to model steady-state homogeneous systems. This equation is studied in the fields of PDE, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, geometry, and engineering; and therefore, the behavior of its solutions (known as harmonic functions) is very well-understood. However, many questions remain regarding the behavior of solutions to more complicated equations like those that model quantum behavior, systems with microscopic structure, and systems that are changing in time. The investigator?s knowledge of harmonic functions will be used to answer these questions, thereby advancing knowledge in the areas of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. Motivated by the goal of increasing participation from underrepresented groups, as well as addressing common issues with retention in academia, this project integrates an inclusive workshop in PDE and harmonic analysis. The target workshop audience will include junior mathematicians who are at difficult transitional stages in their careers, especially those from historically underrepresented groups. Speakers will be chosen to reflect the demographics of the student participants and the potential for greater diversity in our discipline.<br/><br/>The Laplace equation is a PDE that models steady-state phenomena in a truly uniform environment. Since the world that we live in is not an isotropic vacuum, the mathematical equations that govern many natural phenomena are often more complicated than Laplace?s equation. For example, the Schrodinger equation describes the behavior of quantum-mechanical waves, while its generalizations describe even more complex settings. As such, there is a need to understand the properties of solutions to general elliptic PDEs. One component of this research project revolves around using known properties of harmonic functions to gain a better understanding of solutions to elliptic equations. Specifically, the investigator will explore how the presence of variable coefficients and lower-order terms affects the behavior of solutions to elliptic equations. This line of inquiry will be addressed through the perspectives of unique continuation and homogenization theory. Given that parabolic equations like the heat equation model the evolution of systems that are changing in time, it is also important to understand how the solutions to such PDE behave. Therefore, in another direction, the investigator will use elliptic theory to tackle problems related to parabolic PDE. More specifically, the investigator will construct a framework for using elliptic theory in high-dimensional settings to understand the properties of solutions to parabolic equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A classical question in knot theory asks whether two knots can be obtained from each other by continuously transforming the rope. One way to distinguish two knots is to compute their knot invariants. Some of the most powerful knot invariants include the HOMFLY polynomial and its recent generalization known as Khovanov?Rozansky homology. For instance, the HOMFLY polynomial is used in molecular biology to study how DNA molecules are folded in space. In this project, we relate these knot invariants to objects arising naturally in algebraic combinatorics, a field which applies algebraic methods to study discrete objects such as binomial coefficients or triangulations of a polygon. The number of possible triangulations of a polygon is counted by the famous Catalan number sequence. One of the main results of the project gives a natural geometric interpretation of Catalan numbers, by means of relating them to Khovanov?Rozansky knot homology and the HOMFLY polynomial. The objects that appear along the way are interpreted from the point of view of statistical mechanics, which deals with macroscopic observations of a physical system consisting of a large number of particles. For example, the geometric spaces in question are directly linked to the Ising model at critical temperature, which describes ferromagnetic properties of a flat metal plate at the Curie point. The award also provides funding for the involvement of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in the PI's research.<br/><br/>The Grassmannian is stratified by spaces known as positroid varieties. In a joint project with Thomas Lam, the Principal Investigator (PI) studies the mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of positroid varieties. The main result states that the bigraded Poincar polynomial of the top-dimensional positroid variety is given by the (rational) q,t-Catalan number, introduced in the works of Garsia?Haiman and Loehr?Warrington. The proof proceeds by associating a link to each positroid variety, and relating its cohomology to the Khovanov?Rozansky homology of the associated link. The point count of the positroid variety is therefore given by a coefficient of the HOMFLY polynomial of the link. The PI has recently shown that the point count is given by certain observables in the stochastic six-vertex model. Separately, positroid varieties were connected to the Ising model in the joint work of the PI with Pavlo Pylyavskyy. In this project, the PI uses this relation to give a direct formula for boundary correlations of Baxter's critical Z-invariant Ising model. This formula is applied to questions of universality and conformal invariance of the model, studied by Smirnov et al.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere.

These plans include an extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for workshops for building academic communication skills. <br/><br/><br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism. The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S. Sarkar, the Principal Investigator plans to construct one, and to use it to study many situations in low-dimensional topology that possess natural symmetries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, commutative algebra is fundamental to cryptography, which many of us rely on daily, but also to genomics.  This project advances the field of commutative algebra, and also trains junior scientists to develop skills relevant to a variety of scientific careers.

For example, the large scale behavior of the universe is determined by Einstein's theory of general relativity, while the small scale behavior is dictated by quantum mechanics.  A prominent goal of theoretical physics has been to find a mathematical description of the universe which unites these large and small scale descriptions.  This work has led to the discovery of string theory, and a vast array of beautiful and intricate mathematical structures and equations.  The equations of string theory are difficult and complicated, and are expected to connect radically different branches of mathematics and physics. Understanding these equations, and the structure they contain, is the primary goal of these education and research projects.  This research agenda aims to understand mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena in string theories ranging from particle formation and decay to the emergence of gravity in ""holographic"" string theories.  The education plans aim to provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in learning and research projects related to the research program.  Planned activities include sponsored research projects for undergraduates, a bi-annual weekend conference for graduate students, and a two week summer program, including a week long summer school and graduate students and advanced undergraduates vertically integrated with existing summer research programs.<br/><br/>These projects aim to investigate several problems in geometry which are inspired by string theory, and which involve techniques from differential equations, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry. The first project involves studying two equations arising in mirror symmetry: the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, and the special Lagrangian equation.  The goal is to develop a theory that relates the study of these equations to structures in algebraic geometry, using an infinite dimensional version of classical geometric invariant theory.  These equations present exciting new mathematical challenges ranging from the analysis of fully nonlinear systems to understanding the algebraic structure encoded in certain singular geometric objects, in analogy with connections between multiplier ideals and singular, positively curved metric on holomorphic line bundles.  As a result, this project will involve developing new ideas in partial differential equations, as well as differential and algebraic geometry.   These ideas are to be tested in a variety of simplified models, which will lead to the resolution of several open problems in Kahler geometry.  Another line of work will study the phenomenon of emergent gravity in string theory, and in particular the AdS/CFT conjecture, and connection with combinatorial facets of AdS/CFT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop statistical methods for analyzing data resulting in new scientific, sociological, and biomedical discoveries. The research has several fundamental challenges due to the features of the data: (1) large scale, which requires advanced strategies on storage, computation, and quality control; (2) a complicated structure, which makes careful statistical modeling a critical need; and (3) strong noise, which requires sophisticated de-noising techniques. To address these challenges, the PI proposes a universal probabilistic factor modeling approach. The research will provide an array of statistical tools for social network analysis, natural language processing, RNA-sequencing data analysis, and electronic health records analysis.  This project will also help train graduate and undergraduate students on data collection, data cleaning, statistical methodology and theory. In addition, this project will release new software and data sets for network and text analysis providing useful resources for both education and research.  <br/><br/>Probabilistic factor models refer to factor models whose factors or factor loadings are connected to probability mass functions. Examples include the topic models in text mining and mixed membership models in social networks. Due to the nonnegative constraints and the dependent and heteroscedastic noise in these models, statistical estimation and inference are extremely challenging. This project will tackle these challenges and apply the proposed methods to different applications. The first thrust aims to develop a novel framework for exploring sparsity in topic models. It proposes a new notion of ""sparsity"" on the vocabulary, which is different from the conventional notion of sparsity in high-dimensional statistics. The framework will provide a theoretical foundation for dimension reduction in text mining, as well as new word screening methods and new spectral methods for topic weight estimation. The second thrust aims to study the fundamental statistical limits for network mixed membership estimation. It will lead to a new optimality theory of mixed membership estimation, especially for network models with a large degree of heterogeneity, and new random matrix theory for empirical eigenvectors. It will also produce data sets about the networks among academic researchers in statistics-related fields and generate discoveries about the trend and patterns in academic research. The third thrust aims to adapt the above technical tools to biomedical data, including bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data and electronic health care data.

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In statistics, numerical integration is used in virtually all tasks, from parameter inference to model averaging and hypothesis testing.  Among state-of-the-art numerical integration techniques, most methods are randomized algorithms that operate iteratively, generating a sequence of random states, one after the other. Unfortunately, their iterative nature stands at odds with current directions in computing hardware: increasingly parallel architectures and stagnating clock rates.  This research develops new algorithms that provide accurate estimates of integrals as a number of random quantities, that can be generated independently and in parallel, goes to infinity.  The proposed techniques are employed to address long-standing challenges in statistical inference for large models and complex data.  The proposed innovations combine applied probability, computer science and statistical computing, and apply to many fields including machine learning, statistical mechanics, computational neuroscience and epidemiology, where high-dimensional integrals abound.  The project involves the development of software and features an educational program with courses and research opportunities for students, and a broader dissemination program.<br/><br/> <br/>To numerically approximate high-dimensional integrals, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods iteratively generate sequences that explore the landscape described by the integrand. These methods yield estimators that converge to the integrals of interest in the limit of the number of iterations. However, algorithms that rely on iterative asymptotic regimes risk becoming obsolete in the era of parallel computing hardware. The proposed research develops new Monte Carlo estimators that are unbiased for the expectations of interest, while having a finite computing cost and a finite variance. They can thus be generated independently in parallel and averaged over, paving the way for scalable numerical integration on large-scale parallel computers. The proposed estimators rely on faithful couplings of Markov chains, whereby pairs of chains coalesce after a random number of iterations. This project includes theoretical investigations on the efficiency of the proposed estimators, and the design of practical coupling strategies for various applications.  The research connects with topics in numerical methods, stochastic processes and optimal transport. Beyond parallel computing, the proposed estimators are used to tackle statistical challenges such as normalizing constant estimation and modular inference for large models made of multiple components.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.  The results of this analysis provide new tools for equilibrium-based modeling.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

Misalignment of the circadian clock with respect to 24-hour environmental cycles occurs after rapid travel across time zones and leads to symptoms of jet lag including sleep disturbances, digestive problems, and decreased cognitive performance. The circadian clock is highly conserved across animal species, and there are many similarities in the genes and neural circuits involved in the circadian systems of humans and the fruit fly Drosophila. The goal of this project is to obtain a mathematical understanding of the biology underlying jet lag by developing a detailed model of the circadian clock in Drosophila and then systematically analyzing how the clock is disrupted by sudden changes in the timing of the external light-dark cycle.

Specifically, this project will create new data assimilation tools to identify and parameterize neurophysiological models from voltage traces recorded from the Drosophila circadian (~24-hour) clock network. This research effort will address two major gaps in the mathematical/computational neuroscience field: a scarcity of methods for inferring parameters of unobserved ionic currents from measurements of membrane voltage alone, and a lack of models that link molecular, cellular, and behavioral scales. This will be accomplished by developing a method to design stimulus protocols for use in data assimilation algorithms that optimally unmask the dynamics of unobservable neuronal variables and improve inference of electrophysiological models and parameters. The method will be used to build a model of the Drosophila clock network that links circadian rhythms in gene expression to changes in neuronal activity and behavioral outputs. These models will be used to analyze how the internal circadian oscillator re-entrains following phase shifts in the external light-dark cycle.

The research goals center around a deeper understanding of shapes with uneven curvature. The distance between two points in the plane is given by the length of the segment joining them. The segment can be constructed with a ruler, however finding the distance between two points on an arbitrary geometric shape is much more difficult, partly because such shapes don't come with a ruler! Finding this ""ruler"", i.e., the best possible way to measure distances on geometric shapes, is rooted in deep problems of mathematical physics. In mathematics we measure distances using metrics. When trying to find ideal metrics, one often has to find a smooth function that solves a specific partial differential equation. This is an optimization problem with an action functional whose minimizers are exactly the solutions of the partial differential equation. It is possible to plug in non-smooth functions into the action functional, called potentials, opening the door to what is often referred to as the potential theory of the underlying equation. This project deals with problems in complex geometry where the potentials considered can be given a very specific metric geometry, leading to a much more delicate understanding than usual. In addition to the proposed research, the project will pursue a vertically integrated educational program that includes various forms of public outreach popularizing STEM fields (such as creating educational videos and posting them online), conducting undergraduate summer research and the involvement of graduate students.<br/><br/>The research goals of the project can be split in three parts.

The deformation can be elastic, so that when the force is removed the material recovers its original shape. Alternatively, the deformation can be plastic, whereby the material undergoes irreversible changes that may subsequently lead to breakage. Many materials of technological importance exhibit a combination of these two types of deformation depending on the applied force, and are called elasto-plastic. One example are bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys that have an amorphous atomic arrangement in contrast to most metals. BMGs have desirable properties, such as the ability to be processed like plastics, making them attractive candidates for many applications (e.g. next-generation smartphone cases) due to considerable improvements in manufacturing efficiency. However, experimental measurements of BMG breakage properties show wide variations, limiting their usage. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop predictive theoretical and computational models of BMG elasto-plasticity. This project is based on a surprising similarity between the equations for elasto-plastic materials and the equations for incompressible fluids. Using this similarity, computational approaches that were originally developed for fluid flow will be translated to elasto-plasticity. These computational methods will be used in collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture properties of BMGs. The ultimate aim is to provide a practical engineering tool for predicting when elasto-plastic materials will break, and how to best design structures using them. This work will be undertaken as part of an integrated program of research, teaching, and mentorship, and will involve outreach activities in New England, including a local library lecture series.<br/><br/>The projection method of Chorin (1968) is a well-established approach for simulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. This proposal is based on a surprising mathematical correspondence between fluids in the incompressible limit and elasto-plastic solids in the quasi-static limit (when inertia can be neglected). In this proposal, this correspondence is harnessed to translate several modern numerical approaches derived from Chorin's projection method to quasi-static elasto-plasticity, resulting in a practical and powerful set of new simulation tools for a different class of physical problem. Compared to existing techniques, the resultant numerical methods are likely to be especially well-suited to problems involving large plastic deformations. An example type of elasto-plastic material are the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys with many favorable properties such as excellent strength and wear resistance. The numerical methods developed here will be used in a collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture toughness properties of BMGs, with the aim of predicting BMG toughness over a wide range of experimental conditions. The PI plans to expand the graduate curriculum in numerical methods to address a pressing need in this area. Open source software will be released as part of this project, and the PI will train students in best practices to make software accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are currently no methods available for solving these equations except in the very simplest settings. This project will introduce new mathematical and computational techniques for solving GJEs, which will lead to new software that can solve these challenging equations. These new techniques will be used to solve several different lens design problems.

Although the symptoms of epilepsy have been observed for millennia, the brain processes that support human seizures remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding has a profound clinical impact; in one-third of patients with epilepsy, seizures are not adequately controlled. Animal studies provide powerful methods to uncover the potential mechanisms for epilepsy, yet how the results from these studies relate to human epilepsy remains unclear. Although some mechanisms of epilepsy may be consistent in animal models and humans, differences occur, and these differences are critical to understanding and treating human epilepsy. The PI's goal is to improve understanding of the mechanisms that drive human seizures and thereby advance therapeutic management of this disease. To do so, brain voltage recordings made directly from human patients will be analyzed. Motivated by these patient data, mathematical models will be developed that describe the activity of individual neurons and small populations of interacting neurons.  The mathematical models will then be used to study the biological mechanisms that support the different brain voltage rhythms that appear during seizure, and how these rhythms move across the surface of the brain.  Ultimately, these mathematical models will provide new insights into human epilepsy, and help identify novel approaches to improve patient care. The PI will also include integration of research data and methods into an undergraduate course in computational neuroscience, publish a textbook and online course in neuronal data analysis, and provide undergraduate and graduate research training in computational neuroscience, with a specific emphasis on clinical data and computational modeling.<br/><br/>The PI aims to improve understanding of the ionic and neuronal mechanisms that govern the brain's stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics during human seizure. To do so, a computational modeling framework will be developed that incorporates individual neuron dynamics in cortical and subcortical structures and ion concentration dynamics in the extracellular space. Model behavior will be explored through simulation and dynamical systems techniques, and model features will be constrained to match microelectrode array recordings of seizures in human patients. The modeling framework will be used to test the hypothesized scenario that a class of cortical interneurons serve as the first line of defense against the outbreak of seizure, but eventually fails upon entering depolarization block. Concomitant with this failure, another circuit activates to the support large amplitude, spike-and-wave dynamics, which appear as traveling waves that sweep across the cortical surface.  Two main research goals are the focus of the project. First the modeling of human seizure data will provide new insights into the mechanisms of medically refractory epilepsy, and help identify biological targets for novel pharmacological approaches to improve patient care. Second, to understand brain function and dysfunction, a deeper knowledge of cortical and subcortical neuronal dynamics combined with ion concentration dynamics is required. In this project, the stereotyped dynamical state of seizure motivates models that implement these dynamics to examine principles that support spatiotemporal patterns in the human brain. Educationally the PI will develop new interdisciplinary training in computational neuroscience. This will be done through integration of research data, analysis methods and computational technology in the undergraduate classroom, publication of a textbook and development of an online course describing cases studies in neural data analysis, and directed graduate and undergraduate research in computational neuroscience."

For example, the planetary motion in celestial mechanics, the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid, and the motion of a charged particle in an electro-magnetic field are usually treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. One of the most important questions concerning the dynamics of such systems and connected to many other branches of mathematics and physics is the existence of periodic orbits. Corresponding to cyclic motion, this is the simplest dynamical phenomenon after equilibrium, and an investigation of periodic orbits of a system is crucial in understanding its global behavior. To give but a few applications, the knowledge of periodic orbits is crucial in astronomy, particle accelerators, and fluid dynamics or can be used to understand stability of solutions for large times. Hamiltonian systems tend to have numerous periodic orbits, but proving the existence of even one closed orbit often requires advanced and powerful mathematical tools. This research project aims at establishing the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for a broad class of Hamiltonian systems and analyzing the systems that fall outside this class, and the work will advance our understanding of the dynamics of conservative systems and result in the development of new powerful techniques applicable to other questions. Many of the systems considered in the proposal (e.g., magnetic flows) are of interest in physics and engineering, and some of the projects are expected to have applications in mathematical physics, geometric mechanics, and other areas.<br/><br/>The research program focuses on the question of the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits for Hamiltonian dynamical systems in a variety of settings and on new methods to investigate this question that are currently being developed by the PI. The research comprises several interconnected projects addressing various aspects of this question for certain classes of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and Reeb flows and also for specific Hamiltonian systems such as magnetic flows. The project also opens up new research directions such as the study of non-contractible periodic orbits on closed manifolds. The PI will tackle these problems employing symplectic topological methods including Floer and quantum homological techniques, contact and symplectic homology, J-holomorphic curves, and spectral invariants, and will continue to develop new Floer theoretic techniques tailored for the study of periodic orbits. The projects have applications to other questions of interest in symplectic and contact dynamics and topology, classical dynamical systems, and Riemannian geometry."

Manifolds and their geometric properties are not only central to various branches of mathematics but also are ubiquitous as mathematical models in the sciences. Perhaps the greatest example of this is in general relativity, where one of Einstein's great breakthroughs was the discovery that gravity is modeled by the mathematical notion of curvature. This research project focuses on curvature of Riemannian manifolds.  Specific emphasis will be placed on manifolds with density, which can be envisioned as Riemannian manifolds composed of a material with variable, as opposed to uniform, density.  Despite the appearance of manifolds with density in various areas of mathematics and applications, including proof of the Poincare conjecture, they are not yet well understood. This project addresses this gap by helping to develop a geometric theory of manifolds with density.  The project also uses geometry as a theme for a coherent program of educational activities that include: (1) professional development workshops in teaching and learning for in-service secondary education teachers, which will help support teachers in transition to recently developed K-12 standards; (2) innovation in introductory differential geometry curricula at the undergraduate and graduate level that, by emphasizing applications, will also foster new interaction between mathematics and science researchers; and (3) training of mathematics graduate students in best strategies for engaging students in introductory calculus courses.<br/> <br/>Ricci curvature for manifolds with density has been an active area of recent research.  This includes Ricci solitons, which are both fixed points of the Ricci flow and examples of spaces with constant weighted Ricci curvature, and the study of weighted Ricci curvature bounds. The investigator will continue study of the classification of shrinking Ricci solitons in dimension four and higher.  In addition to playing a key role in development of monotonic functionals for the Ricci flow, weighted Ricci curvature bounds also appear in the theory of optimal transport, isoperimetric inequalities, and general relativity and cosmology.   Despite the vast amount of research in Ricci curvature of manifolds with density, there was no corresponding theory of weighted sectional curvature until recently; another goal of this project is to further develop the theory of weighted sectional curvature bounds, including investigating applications and connections to other areas of mathematics.  Recent collaborative work of the investigator also introduces a new geometric approach to manifolds with density that places a certain torsion free affine connection as the fundamental object of study.   This approach not only provides new insight into the weighted Ricci and sectional curvatures but also suggests new natural structures that promise novel results, such as a weighted holonomy group, which will be investigated."

Resolution of these problems depends on development of innovative operator theoretic methods that are expected to emerge from a synthesis of various techniques in analysis and operator theory.

Multigrid methods exploit the geometry of the swimmers and are therefore expected to be more efficient than current numerical approaches. An artificial neural network will be leveraged as a data-driven, reduced order model for the change in a fluid particle?s position. This approach is intended to simulate a fluid particle's trajectory very efficiently, since it does not require calculating fluid-structure interactions, an important aspect in real-time and/or multi-query scenarios. The planned numerical optimization method takes advantage of both the reliability of a genetic algorithm at finding global optima and the efficiency of a gradient-based method when a good initial guess is given.

However, for several natural phenomena, the area functional is only a first approximation. In order to capture microstructures, most models in the sciences use directionally dependent functionals, referred to as anisotropic energies. Ever since the introduction of anisotropic energies by Gibbs in the 19th century to model crystals, they have been extensively applied in material sciences and engineering, motivating seminal works in geometric analysis. However, since anisotropic energies are not invariant under translations and rotations, they don?t enjoy the conservation laws of the area functional, which makes them significantly more complicated to study.

Unlike simple fluids, non-Newtonian fluids often exhibit complex flow behaviors arising from the multiscale nature of the solute dynamics; canonical physical laws break down in general. Conventional hydrodynamic models are often based on empirical approximations of the microscale interactions, which require careful parameter tuning and generally show limited capability to retain molecular-level fidelity.  This gap severely limits both the fundamental scientific understanding of multiscale transport balance laws and the predictive control in relevant engineering applications. This project aims to develop a new machine-learning computational tool to construct accurate and energy-stable non-Newtonian hydrodynamic models directly from the micro-scale descriptions. The models under development will encode heterogeneous molecular-level interactions and enable predictive modeling of multiscale fluids such as soft matter, polymeric liquids, and vesicle suspensions, where empirical models show limitations. The educational part of the project will provide a suite of interdisciplinary training and outreach activities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to promote data science education at the interface of computational mathematics and natural sciences. The direct connection between machine learning and computational mathematics is intended to provide truly interdisciplinary training for the next generation of the STEM workforce in this fast-growing field and to attract and retain a diverse population of students in the mathematics community. The project will also leverage an existing joint program with Spelman College to build a network of support for underrepresented students with interest in this field. <br/><br/>The research project aims to deliver a novel approach for learning high-fidelity and truly reliable computational models of multiscale fluid systems. The main innovation will be the capability to seamlessly pass the microscale interactions to the macroscale dynamics without empirical approximations. In contrast to the results of some machine-learning-based modeling, the resulting model will retain a clear physical interpretation embedded with a fundamental energy form rather than a black-box fit of reduced dynamics and will be guaranteed to be energy stable. Moreover, the learning algorithm will only require discrete rather than time-series samples, and be well-suited for practical applications. The method aims to provide a unique approach to fundamental scientific understanding of the mesoscale transport balance law where the canonical Stokes-Einstein equation breaks down.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is Gdel's program in Set Theory. If an LCA is ""correct,"" then the theories it decides are also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This project contributes to the Inner Model Program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. The educational component includes annual conferences, curriculum development, and outreach and broadening participation activities. <br/><br/>The project fits into the general framework of studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The problem of building a canonical inner model for an LCA is referred to as the Inner Model Problem for that LCA. One of the project's main goals is to identify certain obstructions that may prevent the current approaches to resolving the Inner Model Problem for various LCAs from going further as well as proposing ways of overcoming them. Specifically, the project will study obstacles to the current techniques of the Core Model Induction (one such obstacle is the Sealing of the Universally Baire Sets) and develop new approaches to the Core Model Induction that overcome these obstacles. One main application of the above analyses is in constructing canonical inner models of large cardinals from various strong extensions of ZFC, like the Proper Forcing Axiom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the data may have structure such as graphs, functions, strings, and sets, but is not Euclidean. To analyze these data sets and address various statistical applications arising in these fields, efficient learning and inference procedures that can handle high-dimensional and non-standard data are needed. The functional analytic paradigm involving reproducing kernels, also known as the kernel method, provides a unified framework to handle such data and has been applied to a variety of non-parametric statistical problems with great empirical success by the machine learning community. However, its theoretical understanding in terms of statistical optimality has been limited, and computationally it scales poorly to large data. The key focus of this project is to explore various foundational research questions associated with the kernel method to achieve a statistically optimal and computationally efficient paradigm that can handle high-dimensional non-standard data. This research will significantly impact scientific development in all areas of science and engineering that intersect with statistics, and will be integrated with the PI's  educational activities of mentoring students, developing new courses and forging new collaborations. Methods and code developed under this project will be made publicly available for ready use. <br/><br/>The core idea behind the kernel method is to map the observed data (could be high-dimensional and non-standard) to exotic function space, called the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and apply the standard methods developed for Euclidean data on the mapped data. Ironically, the RKHS is usually higher dimensional (even infinite-dimensional) than the dimensionality of the observed data, and is characterized by a kernel function called the reproducing kernel. The main advantage of the kernel method is its ability to explore nonlinear relationships in data by simply exploring linear relationships between the mapped elements in the RKHS through the kernel function. Despite its superior empirical performance, the statistical theory of learning algorithms based on the kernel method is not well understood except in a few cases such as classification, non-parametric least square regression, principal component analysis and goodness-of-fit testing. In tise project, the PI will explore various foundational research questions associated with the kernel method and associated learning algorithms to address this gap. The project consists of four related research themes that overall seek to deepen the mathematical understanding of the kernel method so as to exploit its full power in constructing inference procedures that can efficiently handle non-standard data. The project will also shed light on the advantages and limitations of the kernel method over other non-parametric methods in the literature. The aims are to (i) Develop statistical optimality results for kernel-based hypothesis tests and non-linear canonical correlation analysis, (ii) Develop computational vs. statistical trade-off analysis for various kernel learning procedures using approximation schemes such as Nystrom method, random features and their variations, that speed up these procedures, (iii) Develop new methodologies with concrete mathematical guarantees using the kernel method for learning and inference on functions and probability distributions, with applications in functional data analysis, and (iv) Generalize the kernel method using multi-scale kernels to obtain wavelet-like representations and investigate its statistical and computational behaviors in various learning procedures. Overall, the project will develop a comprehensive mathematical theory for computationally efficient kernel-based learning algorithms with applications in statistical learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are used to model mechanical, chemical, biological, social and financial systems. Given a polynomial, we want to find its solutions.  How these solutions depend on the coefficients is one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in math.  The purpose of this project?s research is to use the full power of modern mathematics to develop a new understanding of this question. The education component of this project will build on the PI?s ongoing collaboration with choreographer Reggie Wilson and his Fist & Heel Performance Group to develop innovative STEAM curricula for middle school students on the interactions between math and black/Africanist dance. <br/> <br/>Given a polynomial, we want to find the simplest formula for its solutions, and to prove no simpler formula exists. Since the 17th century, ?simplest? has meant a formula using functions of the least number of variables. While solutions in 1-variable functions exist for low degree polynomials (up to degree 5), no such formulas are known beyond this.  At the beginning of the 20th century, David Hilbert conjectured that for polynomials of degree more than 5, no 1-variable formulas exist (his specific conjecture for degree 7 is 13th on his famous list of mathematical problems). Call RD(n) the minimal number of variables needed to write a formula of the general degree n polynomial.  In joint work with Benson Farb and Mark Kisin, and also in solo work, the PI has been working to revive the study of RD(n), to produce simpler formulas for high degree polynomials, and to develop methods capable of showing that RD(n)>1 for some n. By broadening the focus of investigation to encompass analytic and continuous analogues, the PI and his collaborators aim to bring the full suite of modern methods to bear on this problem, and shed new light on solutions of polynomials.

Domain experts throughout the sciences (e.g., quantum physicists or data-scientists in bioinformatics) are now equipped with powerful regularized algorithms that leverage the structures hidden in this high-dimensional data.  This regularization enables prediction and estimation of unknowns where classical statistical methods are inefficient. On the other hand, these newly developed regularized algorithms often lack automatic inference capabilities in the form of confidence intervals.  The project's goal is to develop automatic confidence intervals on top of differentiable regularized estimators, with no or little constraint on the type of regularization used. This goal is algorithmic-centric: Develop methodologies and software that, given a differentiable regularized estimator chosen and favored by a domain expert, empower that estimator with confidence intervals comparable to those available in classical statistics.  The training component includes graduate and undergraduate course work, graduate student mentorship, and participation of the Rutgers REU program.<br/><br/><br/>The common regularization techniques that leverage structures in high-dimensional data incur a bias that is incompatible with the confidence intervals provided by classical statistical theory. Given a regularized estimator, the goal of the statistician is to provide a valid confidence interval, for instance by removing this bias and standardizing the variance.  Such inference scheme is currently only possible for a few specific regularized estimators, and one goal of the project is to extend such capability to almost any differentiable estimator. The motivation is that, if the estimator of interest is a differential function of the data, gradients of that estimator with respect to the observed data provide rich information that can be leveraged to construct valid confidence intervals in high-dimensional models where the literature has, so far, focused on prediction.  The challenges related to this approach span Statistics, Probability Theory, and Computer Science: The project aims to develop new, flexible asymptotic normality results for provable Type I error control, to understand new relationships between gradients and bias and between gradients and variance, to explain the role of degrees-of-freedom or their proxies in high-dimensions, and to develop algorithms and software that efficiently compute the gradients required for inference.

Systems with noise/disorder are often studied by probabilistic methods and assume that the noise is random. The main scope of the project is to study systems where the noise has additional structure and has deterministic (non-random) nature. In physics, strong random disorder often implies that the system becomes an insulator and prevents electrons in it from moving freely. Would it also be true for some systems with non-random disorder? If yes, which properties make non-random systems behave like random and can it be measured? Are there any additional effects if the disorder is not strong? The main goal of the project is to address these questions on many levels, which will include work with undergraduate and graduate students, development of graduate courses on dynamics and spectral theory, and developing a course for high school students that would illustrate connections between basic linear algebra and physics, providing them skills and motivation for possible further education in STEM.<br/><br/>This project incorporates teaching and research activities on the analysis of a class of models of mathematical quantum physics, including developing abstract techniques of operator theory and establishing rigorous results on more concrete systems. All proposed models involve disorder, however, unlike usual probabilistic view on disordered systems, the main goal will be studying the disorder in a completely deterministic setting, or with a very small number of random/ergodic parameters. An example of such system would be a Schrodinger operator with dynamically-defined potential, where the underlying dynamical system has small dimension and low degree of mixing (for example, irrational rotation). Typically, quantum systems with large random disorder tend to prevent electrons from moving freely (Anderson localization). To answer even basic questions about electron transport in deterministic disordered systems, one must replace usual probabilistic methods by methods of number theory, ergodic theory, semi-algebraic geometry, and other deep areas. The main directions of the project involve analysis of localization/delocalization for systems of interacting quasiperiodic particles and the effect of interaction, perturbative methods for single-particle operators with rough potentials, perturbation properties for spectral bands of periodic operators, and abstract methods of operator theory applied to almost commuting operators and matrices, with applications to quantum systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices).

A fundamental question, for example, is how many whole number solutions does a particular system of equations have? This is often a very difficult question and engages with techniques from a wide variety of different areas of mathematics. Galois theory, introduced in the 19th century, studies groups of symmetries of polynomial equations and is central to modern number theory. In the 1970s, Langlands introduced a far-reaching web of conjectures which connects Galois symmetries with other symmetric structures appearing in analysis (modular forms). Building bridges between the arithmetic world (Galois theory) and the complex analytic world following Langlands conjectural framework has been a formidable task and a driving force in modern number theory. This project aims to prove new instances of Langlands? conjectures. This project will open up and engage a number of new questions and concrete problems that will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. The project will also provide mentoring and online training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, a major breakthrough in the Langlands program was the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem which was accomplished by proving a two-dimensional conjecture connecting arithmetic objects (elliptic curves) to analytic objects (modular forms). A key idea in the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem and in many other important results is the study of congruences modulo a prime p between modular forms. This proposal will systematically construct congruences in higher dimensions by connecting them to new geometric structures in Galois theory. This circle of ideas led to the resolution of Serre?s conjecture for modular forms in the early 2000s, another major achievement in the progression of the Langlands program. The weight part of Serre?s conjecture, which classifies congruences between modular forms, has been generalized in a number of directions as part of the growing field of the p-adic Langlands program. This project will resolve major gaps in progress on these generalizations including the lack of a conjecture for wildly ramified representations and the branching problem for potentially crystalline deformation rings in dimension greater than three. The project will also prove new modularity lifting theorems by studying the geometry of moduli spaces of Galois representations in intermediate weight.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenges posed by the increasing complexity of forward models and dynamical systems in inverse problems and data assimilation can be mitigated by the development of computational methods that are derivative-free and require few model evaluations. This project is concerned with two important families of cost-efficient, derivative-free algorithms: ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization. Rigorous mathematical analyses will established which will contribute to the understanding of these algorithms, determining their potential and limitations in high-dimensional inverse problems and data assimilation. Methodological contributions will focus on the design of novel algorithms and computational frameworks to merge derivative-free optimization with machine learning. Numerical implementations of these new algorithms will be made publicly available. Beyond inverse problems and data assimilation, the principal investigator will also investigate the potential of ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization in large-scale scientific computing problems where gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute, and in data science applications where privacy is a concern. A central component of the project is the integration of education and research. The principal investigator will engage in the new Preceptor Program, a collaborative initiative to build data science curricula at minority-serving community colleges in Chicago. This program will create pathways for community college students from underrepresented groups to transfer to the University of Chicago. In addition, the investigator will complete two books aimed at graduate and upper-level undergraduate students that will incorporate topics drawn from this project.  Mentorship of graduate students and development of graduate-level courses is a core part of the project.<br/><br/>The project will consist of two interrelated research thrusts on ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization. Ensemble Kalman methods are popular algorithms in the geophysical  sciences, where they are often used with a small ensemble size to keep the number of model evaluations low. The first research thrust of the project will develop a new comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of ensemble Kalman methods that rigorously explains when and why a small ensemble size may suffice. Previous analyses have focused instead on large ensemble asymptotics that cannot explain the practical success of these algorithms with a small ensemble size. Methodological contributions of this research thrust will be focused on deriving principled frameworks to blend ensemble Kalman methods and machine learning, as well as novel regularization techniques based on hierarchical formulations of inverse problems and data assimilation.  The proposed non-asymptotic theory will establish ensemble size requirements for these new methods. The second research thrust of the project will advance Bayesian optimization in graphical and manifold settings by developing new geometry-aware kernels, acquisition functions, and convergence guarantees. The PI will use tools from computational harmonic analysis to obtain approximation guarantees for stochastic processes on manifolds and tools from information theory to obtain regret bounds under mis-specified models. Finally, the investigator will explore synergistic ways to combine ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization, leveraging the strengths of both families of algorithms to mitigate their weaknesses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As society relies more heavily on statistical modeling to make decisions, it becomes imperative for statistical methods to be able to model heterogenous data so that different decisions that will lead to better outcomes for different subgroups can be made.  This is appealing in the big data era as data-rich settings allow statistical models to be trained to be more flexible and robust to heterogeneous data. This project focuses on developing a new class of statistical methods for modeling large-scale heterogenous data based on the super-quantile (tail average), also referred to as the expected shortfall or conditional value-at-risk. The methods under development will have the potential to answer questions that cannot be directly answered previously using existing tools in different fields such as climate science, neuroscience, finance, and health disparity research.  The project will allow undergraduate and graduate students to work on cutting-edge methods for modeling data heterogeneity.  In addition, a graduate-level course on data heterogeneity will be developed.  The investigator will also engage in K-12 educational outreach in collaboration with the Center for Educational Outreach at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/><br/>With the abundance of data, there has been growing interest in modeling large-scale heterogeneous data for decision-making.  Quantile regression is one representative statistical tool for modeling heterogeneous data, but one limitation is that it focuses on a specific quantile level and may not be the best approach for answering scientific questions that involve aggregate information of the lower/upper tail of the distribution of interest.  The investigator studies the development of a new class of super-quantile-based tools to help practitioners answer such questions.  There are three aims in this project: (i) establish theoretical foundations and develop scalable computational algorithms for fitting super-quantile regression in the big-data regime, high-dimensional regime, and data with outliers; (ii) develop super-quantile regression methods in the presence of unmeasured confounders; (iii) develop a series of super-quantile-based methods for analyzing different data types. The investigator will create a comprehensive platform, including software and e-book tutorials, to encourage using super-quantile-based methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making use of this data to gain insight into complex phenomena requires characterizing the relationships among a large number of variables. Graphical models explicitly capture the statistical relationships between the variables of interest in the form of a network. Such a representation, in addition to enhancing interpretability of the model, enables computationally efficient inference. The investigator develops methodology to infer undirected and directed networks between a large number of variables from observational data. This research has broad societal impact, as it affects application domains from weather forecasting to phylogenetics and to personalized medicine. In addition, the PI is one of the initial faculty hires in a new MIT-wide effort in statistics. As such, the PI has major impact on creating new undergraduate and PhD programs in statistics to train the next generation in big data analytics, crucial for taking on challenging roles in this data-rich world.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study probabilistic graphical models using an integrated approach that combines ideas from applied algebraic geometry, convex optimization, mathematical statistics, and machine learning, and to apply these models to scientifically important novel problems. The research agenda is structured into three projects. In the first project, the investigator develops methods to infer causal relationships between variables from observational data using the framework of directed Gaussian graphical models combined with tools from optimization and algebraic geometry. The end goal is to apply this new methodology to learn tissue- and person-specific gene regulatory networks from gene expression data such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In the second project, the investigator develops scalable methods for maximum likelihood estimation in Gaussian models with linear constraints on the covariance matrix or its inverse. Such models are important for inference of phylogenetic trees or cellular differentiation trees. The third project is an application of graphical models to weather forecasting; the investigator develops new parametric methods based on Gaussian copulas and also non-parametric methods for the post-processing of numerical weather prediction models that take into account the complicated dependence structure of weather variables in space and time."

Ubiquitous in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory, and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to encourage the participation of students and young researchers.   <br/><br/>The project will address two main types of research problems. Hodge theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry but it is fundamentally transcendental in nature.  Recent work of the PI and coauthors has demonstrated that techniques from model theory and complex geometry can be used to bridge this divide systematically, and the first goal of the project is to develop the application of these techniques more deeply. Secondly, the project will develop a more detailed understanding of the moduli of certain varieties which are particularly closely related to Hodge theory, including abelian varieties and hyperkahler varieties.

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. In this project, the PI will further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. This project also has a substantial educational component: The PI will develop a research experience in data science for first year undergraduate students at Louisiana State University (LSU). This program will prepare participants for a career in STEM, solidify their knowledge of basic mathematics, and give them an opportunity to learn about data science. <br/><br/>In the research part of this project, the PI will study bounded domains in complex Euclidean space and relate intrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the geometry of the Kaehler-Einstein metric) to extrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the CR-geometry of the boundary). Many classical results in the subject consider bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth, and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of conditions on the boundary.  Using this approach, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems, but also many new and interesting examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematically, many such wave propagation phenomena can be described in terms of nonlinear dispersive equations. While waves typically spread out and decay, a striking feature of these nonlinear evolution equations is that they may admit particle-like solutions, often called solitons, whose shapes persist as time goes by. The mathematical understanding of their dynamics is still far from complete. The main research goal of this project is to investigate, in the context of classical topological field theories that arise in mathematical physics, how nonlinear waves can form particle-like structures and how these structures interact with each other. The educational component of the project seeks to enhance the training of graduate students and postdocs by organizing minicourses and workshops related to the research of the project and by providing professional development opportunities with an emphasis on presentation skills.<br/><br/>This project focuses on soliton dynamics for several well-known classical topological field theories in mathematical physics. Three prime examples of topological solitons are at the center of the investigation: kinks, vortices, and skyrmions in one, two, and three space dimensions, respectively. Heuristically, these solitons owe their stability to their topological underpinnings. However, the mathematical justification of this intuition is still rather poorly understood and mostly open. The overarching goal of the project is to establish asymptotic stability results for these classical topological solitons, and thus to rigorously justify the heuristics for their stability. Over the course of the project the investigator also plans to move towards studying multi-soliton configurations in these and related settings. Beyond the intrinsic interest in the fundamental problems at the center of this project, their resolution will have significant impact on the analysis of strong nonlinear interactions between solitons and radiation in the context of many other nonlinear dispersive equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central in this subject is the study of knotting and linking of circles in three-dimensional spaces, called knot theory. For instance, knots and links can be used to construct three- and four-dimensional spaces. Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various connections to cosmology and physics (the shape of the universe and string theory), and biochemistry (the knotting behavior of DNA molecules). Unintuitively, many classification questions in topology are harder in dimensions three and four, and over the past three decades, topologists have developed modern tools (with roots in physics) for studying these questions. Two examples of such tools are Heegaard Floer invariants, which grew out of gauge theory, and Khovanov homology, which has roots in representation theory. This project will further develop these invariants and investigate their similarities and relations. Moreover, it will harness their power to study symmetries of surfaces (two-dimensional spaces), in connection with hyperbolic geometry and dynamics, and will investigate several fundamental questions in low-dimensional topology such as finding the minimum number of times a knot must cross itself to become unknotted. In parallel, this project aims to make mathematics and in particular topology accessible to a broad audience, through educational activities at all levels with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion. These activities include, establishing a Math Circle program in the Athens-Clarke County public library and organizing summer Math Camps for high school and middle school students, running a summer research experience project for undergraduate students and a topology summer school for graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The major goals of this research program are organized around four areas. First, developing new invariants for studying spatial graphs and graph concordance. The main tool will be a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology called, tangle Floer homology. Studying spatial graphs up to concordance has applications in studying equivariant concordance between knots, and strong concordance between links. Second, studying mapping class group and extensions of surface diffeomorphisms over handlebodies using another generalization of Heegaard Floer homology, called bordered Heegaard Floer homology. Third, further developing the bordered Heegaard Floer homology tools by generalizing and refining the contact invariant defined by the PI and her co-authors and use it to address open questions in contact topology. Lastly, the PI focuses on connections and similarities between Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer invariants, with the three major goals of defining new concordance invariants to study smooth 4D Poincare conjecture, finding new lower bounds for the unknotting number and developing new invariants for transverse knots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work describes a ""synthetic"" approach to the theory of infinity-categories in contrast to prior ""analytic"" approaches. A second proposed project, joint with Shulman, will develop a parallel synthetic theory of infinity-categories in homotopy type theory, a new univalent foundations for mathematics that conjecturally expresses the internal logic of an infinity-topos. The third proposed project, again joint with Verity, is to generalize from infinity-categories to higher infinity-categories by investigating the various infinity-cosmoi whose objects are complicial sets, a particularly economical model of higher infinity-categories that the PI suspects will ultimately lead to a model-independent theory."

The first area in this project concerns Szemerdi's regularity method. Within this area, one of the main goals of the project is to obtain new bounds on the triangle removal lemma and its various extensions and variants.

Specific problems include optimizing the pseudorandomness conditions needed to obtain sparse counting lemmas, proving analogous sparse regularity results in other combinatorial structures such as cubes, and providing new applications in number theory and discrete geometry such as extensions of the Green-Tao theorem on long arithmetic progressions in the primes. The second area in this project is estimating Ramsey numbers. The PI will work on proving new bounds for classical (complete) graph and hypergraph Ramsey numbers, and to prove linear bounds for Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs.<br/><br/>This project studies fundamental problems in combinatorics related to the structure of large networks. Examples of large networks include the Internet, Facebook, the brain, imperfect crystals, and designed chips. The structure of these networks can be critical in understanding how the networks function. Previous work has shown that the subjects under study in this project have a wide range of applications. Furthermore, this work has led to the development of powerful methods that have been used in many branches of mathematics and computer science. For example, previous progress on estimating Ramsey numbers led to the development of probabilistic techniques that have had a tremendous influence on computer science, such as in the design of randomized algorithms. It is expected that further work on these problems will lead to new methods and applications."

The human genome project has  accelerated the growth   of these data. Multiple observations of homologous protein or  nucleic acid sequences from   different organisms are often available.  However, since  mutations and sequence errors   misalign these data, multiple sequence alignment has become an  essential and  valuable    tool for  understanding the structures and functions of these  molecule, aiding efforts at   protein modeling,  structure prediction and engineering; and   shedding light on molecular   evolution and phylogeny construction in molecular systematics.  Traditional algorithms for   finding such alignment are either too computationally expensive  so as to limit their   applications or too heuristic so that the sensitivity to subtle  patterns is lost.  We recently   presented new local  alignment algorithms (Lawrence et al. 1993,  1994) based on a    probabilistic model of the sequences and a  stochastic simulation  technique  called the   Gibbs sampler.

For the first class of methods, the data will be assumed to have an underlying low-rank structure that is perturbed by both additive noise and linear filters. New results from random matrix theory will be developed for signal recovery problems in this setting, including the estimation of covariance and distance matrices. The second class of methods will exploit geometric structures in data.

This problem, known as Nielsen realization, dates back to the work of Nielsen in the early 1900s and has connections to dynamics, foliation theory, and the geometry of manifolds and fiber bundles. The moduli spaces of interest in this proposal relate to low-dimensional topology and nonpositive curvature.

(1) Solve Nielsen realization problems for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. (2) Study finite groups actions on aspherical manifolds with exotic smooth structures using rigidity results related to the Borel conjecture.

Statistical inference from a sample of molecular sequences such as DNA poses a series of fundamental challenges. These challenges include complex modeling of the sample's ancestry and past evolutionary history, large and noisy data. The ongoing large-scale increase of genetic data has led to a situation in which current methods are not applicable to the amount of data available and researchers are forced to down-sample available data or to infer parameters from insufficient summary statistics.  This research project will address the need for optimally designed coalescent modeling for inference from modern molecular data. The coalescent is a probability model on genealogies, that is, the trees which represent the ancestry of the sample. Coalescent models are used for inferring parameters of scientific relevance such as effective population size, migration patterns and selection. The research goals of this project are to expand the class of coalescent models and to design novel efficient statistical algorithms, allowing us to address many practical problems that advance science. Furthermore, the outcomes of the projects will foster the development of new statistical theory and tractable methods that contribute to biological solutions. This project also outlines an active plan for a broad range of educational and outreach activities that will broaden participation in statistical sciences and will enhance more inclusive atmosphere in science. The undergraduate and graduate students involved into the project will be offered a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary hands-on research training at the interface of statistical sciences and biology, allowing them to contribute to progress in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, population genetics, phylogenetics, cancer genomics, probabilistic modeling, statistical inference, and related fields. The PI will actively participate in multiple outreach activities such as the Stanford undergraduate summer research program, which will allow for recruiting more diverse pool of future data scientists and for fostering more inclusive climate in science.

Church<br/><br/>The physical distinction between bosons and fermions explains why photons can cohere into a laser, or helium-4 nuclei into a superfluid, whereas neutrons resist each other, as is necessary for the stability of neutron stars. Mathematically, this distinction is explained by the shape of their configuration space, which describes all possible ways that a collection of indistinguishable particles (such as photons or neutrons) can be configured in space. The investigator studies configuration spaces via their symmetries, proving that no matter what space the particles move within, the topology of configurations will stabilize, yielding identical behavior no matter how many particles are present. Configurations in restricted spaces have widespread applications: when electrons are confined to 2-dimensional surfaces as in field-effect transistors, new topology on the configuration space predicts new types of quasiparticles, which manifest in the fractional quantum Hall effect; in robotics, the topology of robots configured on a factory floor describes when one robot can be trapped by others. The proposed project would extend this stability to new types of configuration spaces possessing even more symmetry, whose stability cannot currently be understood or proved.  The investigator will also develop and teach Math Discovery Lab, a new discovery-based course for undergraduates which develops critical skills in independent research. Students in MDL will investigate open-ended problems, collect data via computer experimentation and simulation, formulate conjectures, and prove theorems about their results, presenting their findings through written reports and lectures.<br/><br/>The investigator's research focuses on representation stability, a technique applying representation theory to stability problems in topology and algebra. Representation stability has been very successful, leading to 20+ papers since its introduction by the investigator three years ago. The investigator proposes to extend and strengthen the power of representation stability by undertaking a long-term project to develop the combinatorial, categorical, and homological properties of FI-categories. These provide a coherent framework for studying a wide variety of symmetry groups, including many which could not be handled using previous methods. The proposed project will unify four distinct strands of stability as facets of the same theory: representation stability, homological stability, twisted stability, and central stability. A key advance is that the dependence on representation theory is removed, replaced instead by the combinatorial and homological properties of FI-categories, so that representation stability can be applied even to integral or modular representations."

This has on one hand made algebra and geometry extremely valuable in particle physics; and on the other hand has allowed powerful physical intuition to be used in the development of pure mathematics. Continuing in this tradition, the research goals of this project fit into a broader effort to incorporate modern mathematical ideas and methodology in quantum field theory and vice versa.

The PI and his collaborators have established the beginnings of a deep relation between mirror symmetry in 3d supersymmetric gauge theories and symplectic duality. Symplectic duality is an equivalence of geometric categories associated to pairs of algebraic-symplectic varieties that was conjectured by Braden, Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster, and that generalizes many classic results in geometric representation theory (such as the Koszul duality of Beilinson, Ginzburg, and Soergel relating categories of modules for simple Lie algebras). In this project, the PI and his collaborators will use new techniques in gauge theory to establish a systematic construction of objects in the categories relevant for symplectic duality, and an explicit duality map between them. He will also define and investigate yet another category, of Fukaya-Seidel type, that gauge theory predicts to be equivalent to the usual categories in Symplectic Duality, but which seems to make many subtle aspects of the duality manifest. Finally, he will extend the methods developed to study 3d gauge theories to 4d supersymmetric gauge theories, where they lead to a construction of the categories of line operators -- with far-reaching implications for categorification of wall-crossing fomulas and of cluster algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second research component in the proposal investigates the statistical properties of thresholded matrices in finite samples, with a view to obtaining a positive definite covariance estimation method which is highly scalable. The third research aspect of the project investigates quantifying the variability and uncertainty of estimated graphical network models.

The theoretical and methodological work proposed in this project is motivated by applications and interdisciplinary collaborations in fields as diverse as the earth and environmental sciences, genomics and cancer research, and the social sciences. In genomics for instance, one is often interested to know how various genes are associated, and how these associations differ between an experimental (diseased) and control group. Gene regulatory networks also serve as important tools to study the evolutions of diseases. In the context of the climate change debate, modeling temperature at different points on the globe requires parsimonious modeling of the way in which these variables are related. Modeling correlations also arises naturally in material sciences and engineering where one is interested in seeing how different atomic particles interact when new materials are produced.  Hence the proposed project for estimating correlations in very high dimensional settings will  have widespread applications, since understanding associations/relationships between many variables is an endeavor that is common to many scientific disciplines. The proposed work, though firmly rooted in the statistical sciences, is very much interdisciplinary, and involves collaborations and partnerships between statisticians/data scientists and biomedical scientists, engineers and earth scientists."

Properties of moduli spaces are ``universal facts'' about the objects in question. Ideas behind moduli spaces are quite old, dating back to the nineteenth century (at least). In the last thirty years, we have learned a powerful way of studying moduli spaces, thanks to the insights of Grothendieck's school. The last decade has opened up powerful new ways of understanding these spaces. Surprisingly, the impetus often came from other fields, such as theoretical physics or combinatorics. This proposal seeks to approach many pressing problems using techniques from algebraic geometry, highly motivated by insights from other fields. The results in turn should have strong applications in other fields. The investigator also seeks to attract talented high school and undergraduate students into the mathematical sciences, by exposing them to exciting and advanced yet accessible ideas, for example through problem solving; this will be done primarily through the Stanford University Math Camp, a problem solving seminar at Stanford, the Berkeley Math Circle, and various writings. In particular, the goal is to attract students from previously untapped pools of talent. Second, at the graduate level, the investigator will build a center for algebraic geometry at Stanford, by providing resources for graduate students and postdoctoral students, developing new courses, inviting visitors, and sponsoring seminars and conferences, often jointly with other institutions. Third, the investigator will continue to bring sophisticated mathematical ideas (of all levels) to a wider audience through expository writing. The investigator is an algebraic geometer whose primary interest is in intersection theory on moduli spaces. The investigator's goal is to approach many open and classical questions in geometry and related fields using both insights from other fields and modern machinery. The investigator proposes to broaden and deepen his research, by undertaking two longer-term projects, dealing with two of the most important moduli spaces in mathematics: the moduli space of curves, and the Grassmannian and its generalizations. The first project will use modern techniques to illuminate the conjectural and known combinatorial structure behind the ``geometrically natural'' part of the cohomology (or Chow) ring of moduli space of curves (the ``tautological ring''). The second project will use algebro-geometric ideas to solve classical open questions about the structure (algebraic, arithmetic, geometric, enumerative, and more) behind Littlewood-Richardson rules, Schubert problems, and generalizations to other groups. The first project relates to physics, topology, combinatorics, integrable systems, and symplectic geometry; the second involves combinatorics, representation theory, and arithmetic geometry.  Thus both will involve developing a base of knowledge in a broad array of different fields, as well as lifelong working relationships and collaborations with researchers in these fields.<br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Among all methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms stand out as the most widely used class of sampling algorithms with a broad range of applications, notably in high dimensional Bayesian inference. While MCMC algorithms have been proposed, studied, and implemented since the foundational work of Metropolis et al. in 1953, many convergence properties of algorithms used in practice are not well understood. Practitioners in Bayesian statistics are often faced with a series of key challenges to be addressed rigorously: the choice of algorithm hyper-parameters, the estimated computational cost and the choice of the best algorithm, etc. This project focuses on developing theoretical guarantees of MCMC sampling algorithms that arise in large-scale Bayesian statistical inference problems.<br/>The project will also offer numerous interdisciplinary research training, outreach and mentoring opportunities for the next generation of statisticians and data scientists at all levels, from undergraduate to doctoral students.<br/><br/>This project will address three specific research problems centered around MCMC algorithms in high dimensional inference. First, the project intends to rigorously rank the efficiency of MCMC algorithms for sampling log-concave distributions and to provide succinct non-asymptotic mini-max analysis of mixing time. Log-concave distributions in sampling are as important as convex functions in optimization, and one cannot expect to build a foundational theory basis without determining the fundamental limits of sampling algorithms on log-concave distributions. Widely-used algorithms such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Gibbs sampling and hit-and-run will be studied rigorously. Second, as concentration inequalities constitute an essential component in understanding the efficiency of MCMC sampling algorithms, the project will develop a fine-grained understanding of concentration of high dimensional log-concave distributions via new technical tools such as stochastic localization. Finally, the project will unify the existing theoretical tools for studying discrete-state and continuous-state sampling algorithms through localization schemes. The proposed research aims to advance the field with a comprehensive understanding of MCMC sampling algorithms and their optimal settings in both discrete and continuous cases. The project will provide a wide range of interdisciplinary initiatives to enhance professional development of undergraduate and graduate students in statistical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, liquid crystals enable the fine-scale manipulation of matter.  The goal of this research project is to create new mathematical methods/algorithms for simulating liquid crystal phenomena, and for designing new materials that utilize liquid crystals.  In other words, the research will provide the groundwork for developing functionalized and switchable materials that are ""driven"" by liquid crystal physics. The research will impact local communities, education, and liquid crystal scientists: (i) Middle School Science Fair Projects.  The PI will mentor science fair projects on liquid crystals at minority serving middle schools (the visual appeal of liquid crystals makes them ideal for project topics).  PI will involve post-docs and graduate students in the mentoring. (ii) Public Library Engagements.  PI will interact with middle/high school students through local libraries by creating a ""sit-with-a-scientist"" program.  Each session takes place at a library branch location and includes a short, introductory presentation followed by hands-on activities to allow the students to actively learn about the physics and mathematics of liquid crystals.  PI will involve post-docs and graduate students by having them assist during the sessions. (iii) Education. PI will continue to mentor undergraduates through REUs and senior projects, and create a graduate course ""Computational Methods For Liquid Crystals"" based on this research. (iv) Open Software. PI will create software implementations, tutorials, and demos of the research.<br/><br/>The research will create new mathematical algorithms to correctly and efficiently simulate liquid crystal (LC) phenomena above the scale of molecules. Current algorithms do not do this.  They either make ad-hoc changes to the underlying model for mathematical convenience, or they are expensive to compute (or both). Efficiency is crucial to facilitate ""plugging"" these methods into high level design and optimization procedures for, say, material design. Molecular simulations of LCs are too expensive for iterative design work.  The Q-tensor model is better, but can still be expensive and hard to solve.  The research does the following: (i) creates new methods for the Q-tensor model that are cheaper to solve and more faithful to the physical model by taking advantage of the discrete maximum principle (DMP); (ii) extend our method to handle arbitrary geometry through a ""cut"" finite element method (cutFEM); (iii) extend our cutFEM to do optimal shape design of LC systems, including self-assembly of colloidal inclusions.  The research will create new methods to simulate and optimize liquid crystal systems that capitalize on delicate mathematical tools, such as Gamma-convergence and the DMP.  This fits well within our core expertise, such as prior work in LCs, 3-D mesh generation/implementation, multi-physics geometric flows, and shape optimization.  Consulting with LC modeling experts will help validate our results.  An added benefit of the research is that it will further the development of finite element methods for non-linear degenerate partial differential equations, and combine shape optimization with cutFEMs."

For example, taking into account phylogenetic diversity in the restoration of natural vegetation can lead to restorations that establish quicker and are heartier, while understanding the phylogenetics of pathogens can aid in back-tracing the spread of a disease and guiding epidemiological interventions.  While trees are a natural choice for representing evolution combinatorially, by restricting to the class of trees, it is possible to miss more complicated events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. For more complete descriptions, phylogenetic networks, directed acyclic graphs, are increasingly becoming more common in evolutionary biology. This project focuses on phylogenetic networks and their parent models, phylogenetic mixture models, and will use applied algebraic geometry, in particular, algebraic statistics, to develop novel techniques for their inference. The project also has research training of graduate students and educational activities that introduce algebraic statistics and algebraic biology to undergraduate and K-12 students. In addition to hosting and running a series of one-week long graduate student research workshops in algebraic biology with follow-up small group collaborations, the PI will design a data-centered undergraduate mathematical biology course and organize annual collaborative and problem-based mathematical events for 6th graders with island-focused challenges.<br/><br/>Since network-based Markov models and their mixtures are specified with a polynomial parameterization, they are amenable to analysis using algebraic and geometric methods. This project will utilize their algebraic properties to establish identifiability, a property necessary for meaningful statistical inference, and then utilize their geometric properties to develop a procedure for network inference.

This project is concerned with the numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of constrained systems in mechanics.  The model equations of numerous problems in mechanics take the form of DAEs, not of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  The numerical integration of these DAEs is notoriously difficult, mainly due to the presence of geometrical and/or kinematic constraints.  The main research and development objectives of this project are to develop, analyze, implement, and apply numerical methods and techniques related to the numerical integration of these DAEs.  The methods proposed, which are based on Runge-Kutta type methods, make great use of the structure of the DAEs considered and they are perfectly fitted to preserve their <br/>underlying properties.  Several applications in the following areas will be considered: rigid and flexible multibody dynamics; flight formation of multiple coordinated spacecraft; classical molecular dynamics.  The educational and research aspects of this project are intertwined. Graduate students will write their M.Sc. or Ph.D. thesis as part of the project.  They will spend part of their time with partners in industry and in research laboratories/centers. New courses closely related to the project will be created.<br/><br/>What is common between a spacecraft, a DNA loop in a gel, the landing gear of an aircraft, the suspension system of a truck, and a molecule colliding with another one?  They are all examples of systems in mechanics (a branch of physics) whose motion can be mathematically modeled by certain sets of equations called ""differential-algebraic equations"".  Being able to simulate these systems on a computer can have various impacts depending on the applications considered. Vehicle-system simulation can help improve research in vehicle safety and vehicle development.  Mechanical system simulation software enables users to relatively quickly analyze multiple design variations, thereby reducing the number of costly physical prototypes, improving the quality of the design, and reducing product development time.  The concept of having multiple coordinated spacecraft has been identified as an enabling technology for many of the NASA's 21st century missions. The accurate simulation of coordinated spacecraft before they are actually sent can help reduce the risk of mission failure. Understanding the mechanics of DNA, which is at the heart of life, can have some fundamental potential medical benefits.  Understanding the collision dynamics of molecules can help to delineate the parameters that are important in the energy transfer process, so that unwanted byproducts and pollutants in chemical reactions can be reduced.  Those are all examples of possible impacts that this research can have in the different application areas that will be considered.

For example, Heegaard Floer homology was used to obtain obstructions to a knot having unknotting number one. This allowed for a classification of all unknotting number one knots of crossing number up to ten. At the same time, Cho and McCullough defined the tree of tunnel number one knots that gives an indexing of all knots whose exterior has a genus two Heegaard splitting. Fundamental properties of these knots can be deduced by where in the tree the knot is located. The PI is currently in the process of developing new techniques to study surfaces in closed manifolds and in knot complements. She proposes to use these techniques together with the aforementioned results to address two important and long-standing problems in 3-manifold topology: establishing the additivity of crossing number of knots, and generalizing the work of Cho and McCulough to all knots. For her educational component she proposes a program with a principal goal to  identify mathematically-gifted high school students whose previous mathematical achievements do not represent their potential, and nurture their talents, initially through a two-week summer program and later via existing support systems.<br/><br/>The topology of 3-manifolds is at the core of many of the current questions of interest in the natural sciences. Results about 3-manifolds and knots often allow us to gain better understanding of the world we live in. Protein folding, DNA knotting and string theory are just a few of the areas where low dimensional topology is a key research tool. The variety of applications of this field has served as a catalyst for increased research in the area and a plethora of new results and techniques. In spite of these developments, many of the oldest and simplest-to-state questions remain unsolved. A stark example of this is the behavior of crossing number of knots under connect sum. The crossing number is the minimum number of self-intersections in a diagram of the knot. More than a century ago mathematicians asked the following question: if two knots are ""fused"" into a single knot, what is the crossing number of this knot in terms of the crossing numbers of the original pair? The fact that little progress has been made on this question is evidence of the difficulty of this field. The significance of the work of the PI will be greatly enhanced by integrating her research with her educational efforts, particularly in terms of developing innovative programs that address forecasted future shortages of mathematicians and scientists by recruiting and supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. A principal goal of the PI is to identify mathematically-gifted high school students whose previous mathematical achievements do not represent their potential, and to nurture their talents, initially through a two-week summer program and later via existing support systems."

The overarching goal of this project is to develop scalable statistical methods for learning such dynamic relationships using high-dimensional time series (HDTS) data sets, and provide a rigorous analysis of their properties. These methods, upon successful completion, are expected to aid data-driven testable hypothesis generation in systems biology, imaging-based biomarker search in computational neuroscience, and inform regulatory policy for financial risk management and monitoring.The research outcomes will be integrated into a number of education and outreach activities, including development of a modern data science curriculum with an accompanying online textbook as well as training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Existing algorithms for analyzing HDTS data sets rely primarily on using modern regularization in machine learning coupled with a squared error loss designed for independent data. This is in sharp contrast with the core modeling philosophy of classical time series, where temporal dependence among observations is explicitly encoded in the likelihood or loss function to increase the accuracy of structure learning and prediction. This project will narrow the gap by designing new algorithms where temporal dependence and regularization inform each other using dependence-aware machine learning methods. In particular, impulse response and quantile-specific graphical models in the time domain, adaptively regularized graphical models in the frequency domain, and random forests that explicitly incorporate temporal dependence in building regression trees, will be developed. These methods will be validated on real data sets from genomics, neuroscience and financial economics in consultation with domain experts.

The PI plans to develop a training program based on applications of the proposed research to recruit and retain talented high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups for potential careers as innovative data scientists. <br/><br/>Modern data matrices present two challenges to their analyses: (1) they are transposable in the sense that both their rows and columns are often of interest and may contain non-trivial dependencies among them, and (2) they may be very large. The first challenge has only partially been addressed by existing biclustering or co-clustering methods. These methods can identify only very simple coupled structures that organize the rows and columns. In order to flexibly model and extract more complicated patterns in large data matrices, in which both rows and columns are high-dimensional, one requires a new co-manifold learning framework that can discover a wider range of intrinsic geometries of the rows and columns. To meet the first challenge, this project develops a framework for performing joint nonlinear dimension reduction on the rows and columns.  The proposed methods construct multiscale distances that are invariant to row and column permutations, equipping practitioners with a means to estimate the intrinsic organization of the rows and columns of a data matrix without prior information on any row or column orderings. To meet the second challenge, this project formulates the key computations as optimization problems that admit distributed parallel algorithms with nearly linear speed-up. The framework also generalizes naturally to the higher-order generalization of matrices, multiway arrays or tensors. Finally, the estimated intrinsic geometries possess stability guarantees, namely small perturbations in the data due to noise or adjustments to input parameters cannot lead to disproportionately large variations in the estimated intrinsic geometry. The proposed procedures have the potential to enable practitioners to extract complicated patterns stably from massive data tensors with non-trivial dependencies along their modes or axes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphs are combinatorial objects that have been extensively studied in mathematics and used for modeling systems in engineering, statistics, biology, economics, and many other disciplines. Graphs can be used to represent spaces or networks and to encode distance between points in spaces or machines in networks. Asymptotic dimension is a notion that concerns large-scale behaviors of such spaces or networks studied in metric geometry, geometric group theory, and distributed computing. The PI and his collaborators recently used tools from structural graph theory, a central research area in combinatorics, to establish results about asymptotic dimension, showing possibilities for attacking open questions in different areas in mathematics. This project aims to further explore this direction by developing novel structural theorems about graphs motivated by their potential applications to computer science and metric geometry, including but not limited to questions about asymptotic dimension. This project contains an education component, including student mentoring, research opportunities for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, and course development, with outreach activities designed for K-12 students and the public.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop novel graph structural theorems and apply them to solve open questions in combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and other areas in mathematics. The first direction is to study metric spaces supported by minor-closed families of graphs. Embedding problems and related applications in computer science for such metrics have attracted wide attention. One goal of this project is to develop new structural theorems for minor-closed families to attack those problems. The second direction is to study graph classes with polynomial expansion. Such graph classes have been extensively studied in computer science and geometric graph theory due to its tight connection to separator theory.  A goal of this project is to develop decomposition theorems for such classes without involving separator theory to pave a novel way for studying those classes. A potential application is to determine the sparsity hierarchy for graph classes with finite asymptotic dimension. The third direction addresses the emerging induced graph minor theory, which combines graph minor theory and induced subgraph theory, two major directions in structural graph theory. An objective of this project is to study this area by extending the existing graph minor theory for sparse graphs to theory for dense graphs via notions inspired from asymptotic dimension and metric geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such integrals can also be used to understand integer solutions of equations, and to express solutions to differential equations such as the wave and Schrdinger equations. Central to this area is a good understanding of the size and decay properties of oscillatory integrals. The project seeks to develop new tools in the field that will be used to investigate more challenging questions.

The mathematical structures known as contact and symplectic manifolds have their origins in the study of classical mechanical systems from physics, which allow one to describe systems such as planetary motion and wave propagation.  The equations of motion can be described in terms of mathematical objects known as flow lines of Hamiltonian and Reeb vector fields.   Understanding the dynamics of these vector fields led to the development of global Floer theoretic invariants of symplectic and contact manifolds.  By developing foundations and applications of these invariants, the PI's work will illuminate the interconnectedness of dynamics, embeddings, knot theory, geometry, and topology.  The PI will expand her efforts to increase the access and success of underrepresented students in mathematics and academia more broadly.  She is conducting, jointly with others, two national studies to delineate forms of antiracism in academic advising in STEM fields and to examine the effect of academic advisors' practices on BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) PhD student psychological experiences and outcomes. Based on the results of the studies, she will construct a set of best practices and effective behaviors in academic advising. To train future generations, the PI will co-organize two international conferences with professional development programming for early-career mathematicians, including a panel discussion on academic jobs for graduate students.  She will also develop and implement summer research programs for undergraduates that will include graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The project concerns Floer theoretic invariants and Reeb dynamics of contact manifolds.  The dynamics of Reeb vector fields are subtly related to the underlying contact structure as well as the topology and geometry of the underlying manifold.  Reeb vector fields realize distance minimizing flow and arise as the restriction of Hamiltonian vector fields to contact type hypersurfaces and boundaries of symplectic manifolds. Reeb dynamics additionally govern embeddings between symplectic manifolds with contact type boundary as well as the topology of symplectic fillings of contact manifolds.  The PI's research has a particular emphasis on the study of closed periodic Reeb orbits (circular flow lines) by way of the development of various Floer theories, so as to capture different dynamical, geometric, and topological phenomenon.

There is enormous potential in integrating that concurrent information from the distinct vantages to better understand between-view associations and improve prediction of health outcomes. Existing tools for data integration are sensitive to outliers, and are not designed for mixed data types (e.g. continuous skewed glucose measurements, zero-inflated activity counts, binary indicators of sleep/wake).

SRE enhances students written communication, software development and reproducible research skills, all of which are lacking in traditional curriculum.

These spaces play important roles in the mathematical areas of topology and geometry, as well as in models of important physical systems. Because humans cannot visualize four spatial dimensions, it is necessary to develop mathematical and diagrammatic tools to study these spaces.  Historically, 4-dimensional spaces have displayed unusual phenomena, distinct from spaces of either lower or higher dimensions. A persistent theme in the discovery of such phenomena is the role of symplectic geometry. Although symplectic geometry was initially formulated to encode the equations of Hamiltonian physics, it has grown into an important abstract mathematical topic that is particularly powerful for studying 4-dimensional spaces. This project aims to use cutting-edge tools to make novel advances in 4-dimensional symplectic geometry. Because this is a rapidly growing field, training a well-prepared and diverse next generation is particularly important. To that end, the PI will create a new undergraduate course, run speaking workshops for graduate students, develop a paired graduate-undergraduate reading program, and organize workshops, summer schools, and conferences.<br/><br/>The project will study symplectic 4-manifolds and singular symplectic surfaces. The first primary goal is to create diagrammatic methods to study the subtleties of diffeomorphism classes of symplectic 4-manifolds.

The third goal is to perform new calculations of existing symplectic invariants and to define new invariants for symplectic 4-manifolds and their submanifolds. The project will employ four mathematical methods to study symplectic 4-manifolds and surfaces: branched coverings of braided surfaces, trisections, (de)singularization, and Weinstein handlebodies.

R. A. Fisher formally discussed the value of randomization in experiments: it balances observed and unobserved covariates on average and serves as a basis for statistical inference. Classical results, however, are limited to simple experiments without rich covariates and complex time and hierarchical structures. Modern applications stemming from the social sciences and technology companies have richer covariates and more complex time and hierarchical structures. Motivated by these new applications, the PI will advance the theories and methodologies for the design and analysis of modern experiments for robust treatment effect estimation in various settings. Highlighting the role of the design of experiments, the PI will take a coherent design-based perspective of causal inference. In particular, the PI will propose various new experimental designs that can better balance covariates across experimental groups and develop statistical methods for these designs that are robust to model assumptions on the outcome generating processes. These theoretical results for experiments will also shed light on principled analyses of observational studies where controlled experiments are infeasible. The training component includes graduate and undergraduate course work as well as the development of software through the help of both undergraduate and graduate students.

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via A) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and B) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. The main focus is on the study of the so-called ""non-equilibrium behavior"" of nonlinear dispersive equations. Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves or in the transmission of optical signals, to mention only a couple. While this turbulence is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor and the mathematical justification of the involved phenomena based on the model equations is rather difficult and is mostly still open. This project is aimed at rigorously proving turbulence phenomenon for certain nonlinear dispersive models.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the long-time behavior of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDE) on compact domains is out-of-equilibrium behavior or long-time instability. This means that solutions do not exhibit long-time stability near equilibriums solutions or configurations. Such questions can be addressed from a dynamical systems perspective and from a statistical physics perspective, in what is often called in the physics literature as ""wave turbulence theory"". The proposed projects address this broad problematic from both perspectives. In terms of dynamics, the aim is to construct solutions exhibiting the so-called ""energy cascade"" phenomenon, in which the energy of a dispersive system moves its concentration zone between characteristically different length scales. On the statistical physics perspective, projects aimed at justifying the fundamental equations of wave turbulence are proposed. These are effective equations for the dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations, and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive PDE, provided they are rigorously justified. The project also includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc."

In many practical applications of unsupervised learning methodology, nonconvex optimization based estimation methods are convenient due to their scalability to large data. This scalability is crucial in various applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, nonconvex optimization is computationally unstable or even infeasible in general due to unfavorable local minima that may exist. In consequence, statistical properties for global minimum based estimates may not provide meaningful guidelines for practitioners. This project aims to study the statistical properties of local minimum based estimates for nonconvex optimization methods in a range of unsupervised learning problems. The proposed research projects are significant in identifying reliable nonconvex frameworks by understanding the trade-off between computational feasibility and statistical efficiency. A new platform will be provided for collaborations across different fields such as statistics, mathematics and computer science. The activity is planned to engage female and underrepresented minority students in the study in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields through both theoretical and computational training and hands-on data analysis. <br/><br/><br/>Since nonconvex optimization methods are known to be adaptive to missing data and various parameterizations, the proposed projects are focused on the statistical analysis for low-rank factorization based unsupervised learning, such as matrix completion, robust PCA, pairwise ranking and network representation. Recent developments in landscape analysis for nonconvex low-rank factorization reveal that there could be no spurious local minima if (i) the ground truth satisfies strong structural assumptions; (ii) model mismatching is not permitted; (iii) the sample size is large. In contrast, the proposed project is focused on conducting the landscape analysis in more general settings: First, model-free frameworks will be proposed to study the geometric properties of nonconvex optimization without requiring structural assumptions on the data or exact model matching; Second, the effects of model mismatching on the landscape of the nonconvex objective functions will be analyzed; Third, statistical efficiencies for local minima based estimates and their relationship with the intrinsic dimensions and sample sizes will be established; Fourth, algebraic structures of general parameterized low-rank factorization will be exploited in order to establish a unified landscape analysis for a broad class of unsupervised learning problems. Moreover, in order to test the empirical behavior of the proposed methods, the activity is planned to identify appropriate benchmark datasets in learning-to-rank, predictive network analysis and recommendation systems in order to compare the empirical performances of the proposed approaches with baseline methods in the literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since most mathematical objects can be represented as a structure, its subject matter is very broad and it interacts with several areas of mathematics. However, whereas other fields of mathematics are interested in specific structures, or classes of structures (for instance arithmetic studies the structure of the integers with addition and multiplication), model theory takes a step back and studies structures in general, looking for dividing lines and common properties. It singles out large classes of structures defined by combinatorial tameness conditions (which imply that the structure is in some sense not too complicated) and then attempts to understand the structures in those classes. One such class is that of NIP structures, which can be thought of as structures that have a geometric flavor. This class has received a lot of attention in the past decade. Another class is that of homogeneous structures, which are structures that have a lot of symmetries. Those are objects that belong to combinatorics and have been largely studied outside, or at the border of model theory. The main goal of this project is the investigation of new model-theoretic tools to understand homogeneous structures and in particular those that are NIP. There are few general theorems on homogeneous structures and at the same time no evidence that there cannot be any: we do not know how complicated homogeneous structures can be and this project hopes to shed light on this.<br/><br/>The starting point of this project is the classification of the primitive rank 1 NIP homogeneous structures obtained by the PI. One goal is naturally to generalize this result to all finite rank NIP homogeneous structures. A more long-term goal is the classification of all NIP homogeneous structures. This would require understanding omega-categorical linear orders, which is an interesting project in its own right. A more general goal of the project is the development of model-theoretic tools to study homogeneous structures. This will build on the work mentioned above as well as on a previous work with Itay Kaplan on finitely generated dense subgroups of automorphism groups. Projects include finding model-theoretic consequences of the Ramsey property and clarifying its link with distality, finding necessary and sufficient conditions for admitting homogeneous expansions with nice properties (including having a stationary or canonical independence relation, being linearly ordered, Ramsey etc.). Finally, a more speculative project is the understanding of random-like behaviors in homogeneous structures and finding ways to measure the complexity of homogeneous structures, in particular those that lie outside the usual model-theoretic tame classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This last step is often very difficult, as there are multiple ways of gluing the pieces of the solution together.  The mathematical area of K-theory studies different ways of putting such solutions back together, as well as the relations behind differently-assembled pieces.  The invariants constructed by K-theory can be found in many fields, from number theory to algebraic geometry to topology.  This National Science Foundation award investigates novel connections between fields through a K-theoretic perspective, by studying how geometric objects, known as polytopes, varieties and manifolds, can be cut apart and reassembled.  By analyzing these geometric cut-and-paste problems using traditional K-theoretic techniques found in algebra, the project hopes to shed light on longstanding conjectures relating geometry and algebra.  The PI also intends to establish a K-12 math circle available to all local children, and the organization of a district-wide math club for 3-5 graders.  Currently, math clubs at schools are heavily dependent on parental involvement and are therefore only available when interested parents have students at the school; organizing such clubs under a central organization would help with institutional memory and make it available to more students.  <br/><br/>The research project consists of three parts. The first is an in-depth exploration of the scissors congruence of polytopes as it relates to the algebraic K-theory of the real and complex numbers.  Using Rognes' stable rank filtration the PI and collaborator Jonathan Campbell intend to construct maps between the filtered parts of Rognes' filtration and the derived scissors congruence of polytopes; the long-term goal of this project is to investigate the connections between scissors congruence groups and the Beilinson--Soule conjecture.  The second part of this project investigates the construction of derived motivic measures on the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties.  There are two main flavors of motivic measure: the cohomological measures, which involve structures on the cohomology of the variety, and the Hermitian measures, which involve enriching the Euler number.  These measures have proven extremely fruitful in studying the Grothendieck ring of varieties; the project proposes to lift these to the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties and use them to study the higher invariants of cut-and-paste problems on varieties.  The cohomological project is joint work with Jonathan Campbell and Jesse Wolfson; the Hermitian project is joint with Kirsten Wickelgren.  The third part of this project is an investigation of ""squares K-theory"", which uses four-term (instead of three-term) relations.  Such relations---for example, the principle of inclusion-exclusion [P] + [Q] = [P u Q] + [P n Q]---appear frequently in geometric cut-and-paste problems such as SK-invariants, Bittner's presentation of the Grothendieck ring of varieties, and the definitions of McMullen's polytope algebra.  The project proposes to extend the definition of K-theory to such relations, thus allowing the construction of higher derived invariants for these (and similar) problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, in precision health, identifying differential treatment effects serves as an essential step towards materializing the benefits of precision health, because it provides evidence regarding how individuals with specific characteristics respond to a given treatment either in efficacy or in adverse effects. In social science research, evaluations of the effectiveness of government programs or public policies across different individuals inform more effective policy-making. As reliably designed randomized experiments often provide evidence of the highest grade for verifying the effectiveness of a treatment or an intervention, this research project aims to develop three randomized experimental design strategies for better learning causal effect heterogeneity. These design strategies are broad and will be applicable in clinical trials, social experiments in biomedical sciences, public health sectors, and online controlled experiments in technological enterprises. Since the project will develop modern experimental design strategies and new statistical methods with many applications, this research project will provide opportunities for integrating research with teaching and training students across different stages. The project will impact STEM education through the training of undergraduate and graduate students and the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups into (bio)statistical fields. Activities to achieve these education-related goals include introductory reading groups, course developments, university undergraduate research programs, and outreach activities to underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This research project will develop three novel response adaptive experimental design strategies and theoretical insights toward learning treatment effect heterogeneity from a frequentist viewpoint. The first strategy will focus on designing randomized experiments to sequentially allocate experimental efforts so that subpopulations mostly harmed or benefited from a particular treatment can be efficiently identified. The second strategy will focus on learning treatment effect heterogeneity measured by the variability of the conditional causal effect variability. The learned heterogeneity allows the development of a new efficient covariate-adjusted response adaptive framework whose estimator may attain the best achievable efficiency. The third strategy aims to further materialize the benefit of treatment effect heterogeneity by designing randomized experiments to maximize participants' overall welfare. The research project is thus expected to open a new research connection between adaptive experiments and social welfare improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to study the Schrdinger equation on fractals. In 1925, the physicist Erwin Schrdinger introduced an equation describing the behavior of quantum particles in terms of waves. The Schrdinger equation is usually studied under the assumption that the particle moves in an idealized, smooth environment. However, natural phenomena often occur in non-smooth settings such as highly porous media (for example, sponges or filters) or intricately branching structures (for example, large networks). Some of these features can be replicated using mathematical models called fractals. This project addresses the significant mathematical challenges posed in these non-smooth settings. The project will lay mathematical groundwork to study widely open questions, such as the behavior of electrons in a fractal environment. The educational component of the project seeks to bring topics such as fractals and probability to the attention of students as well as pre-service and in-service teachers. The project emphasizes service to the local Hispanic community and outreach to under-served secondary schools in Texas. The use of visually appealing models such as fractals will attract the attention of the broader public to the mathematical aspects of the proposed research.<br/><br/>The research aims to produce mathematical tools to study the Schrdinger equation in fractal settings. The results obtained will contribute new knowledge to the fields of analysis and probability on fractals and will serve, for instance, in the mathematical modeling of quantum particles traveling in a percolating system. New techniques at the crossroads of probability, potential theory, functional analysis, and partial differential equations will be developed to construct suitable heat-semigroup based function spaces, to prove novel estimates for products of eigenfunctions, and to derive non-trivial dispersive (Strichartz) estimates of solutions to the linear Schrdinger equation on fractals. The project will also analyze the effects of random initial data on the existence and regularity of solutions, and will explore possible notions of quantum probability and quantum dynamics on fractals. The educational component seeks to integrate research and education at graduate and undergraduate levels. A new sustainable seminar course involving graduate students, undergraduate students, and pre-service and in-service teachers will result in innovative teaching materials on the subjects of probability and fractals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous problems across mathematics and its applications are global in this sense, ranging from data science to economics. The research supported by this grant will develop new topological and geometric methods to tackle problems further afield, primarily discrete, non-continuous problems. This promises new insights at the confluence of combinatorics, geometry, and topology.

The application of topological methods brings about geometric generalizations of combinatorial problems. To understand the limitations of topological techniques one has to study those types of problems, where geometric results deviate considerably from their combinatorial special cases. A central goal will thus be to delimit rigid combinatorial results from their flexible geometric counterparts. In addition to showing the existence of a solution to some combinatorial problem, one is often interested in quantifying how rich the space of solutions is.

The project studies the properties of surfaces, which fall into two categories: finite-type and infinite-type. The theory of finite-type surfaces has been historically more developed than that of infinite-type surfaces, partly because there is a simple classification of all finite-type surfaces. The primary goal of the research project is to significantly deepen understanding of infinite-type surfaces, which are ubiquitous in topology, geometry, and dynamics. The first part is aimed at characterizing their geometric symmetries (isometry groups). The second and third parts concern their topological symmetries (mapping class groups), with the long-term goal of completely classifying the different types of topological symmetries.  The educational component of this project consists of three parts. The first part is a research training and professional development graduate student workshop for members of groups underrepresented in algebra, geometry, topology, and number theory. This workshop is aimed at early-career graduate students and intended to serve as a bridge between successful programs like the EDGE summer program and research-focused workshops for advanced graduate students. One of the goals is to support the participants in their transition between coursework and research-based mathematics. The second part of the educational component is the expansion of an existing high school outreach program in Salt Lake City that will serve students from the most diverse districts of the city. The third part is a speaker series featuring prominent individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>The research focus of this project is on infinite-type surfaces and their groups of symmetries. Infinite-type surfaces arise naturally in many contexts, such as in the study of group actions on the plane, and are intimately related to the study of quasiconformal maps. The first part of this project, aimed at characterizing isometry groups of infinite-type surfaces, is inspired by Felix Klein's suggestion from 1872 that groups of geometric symmetries be used to better understand the geometry of Riemann surfaces. The results regarding isometry groups are used in-turn to produce algebraic invariants of the mapping class group. This group can be thought of as the group of topological symmetries of the surface and is the focus of the second and third parts of the project. In particular, the second part is aimed at producing algebraic invariants of the mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces via subgroup constructions, and the third part focuses on using the actions of mapping class groups on hyperbolic graphs to produce a Nielsen-Thurston type classification for these surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the last few decades, this conversation has led to a fruitful exchange centered on the role of higher algebra (such as category theory and homotopical algebra) in quantum field theory (QFT). It has transformed and enlarged our view of QFT, and thus it plays an active role not only in the farther reaches of particle theory, but also in the concrete discoveries of condensed matter physics, notably in topological states and phases of matter. A recent innovation from this exchange is factorization algebras, which appear naturally in physics as the observables of field theories (both classical and quantum) but originally appeared in mathematics. This project explores the power of this tool  in the setting of 4-dimensional gauge theories. To pursue goals of this research, the Principal Investigator will collaborate with both mathematicians and physicists. This kind of interdisciplinary effort is an inspiring and motivating aspect of this area of research,  but effective communication is often difficult because, despite the long-running relationship of mathematics and physics, each community has its own prerogatives and modes of discourse. A key component of this project is thus to offer chances for researchers at all levels to become fluent in speaking to both disciplines and, moreover, to build direct personal bridges. At the graduate and postdoctoral level, the project will run annual summer schools for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists, focused on topics of mutual interest. In addition, each academic year, it will produce high-quality, online masterclasses by experts about such topics, with lecture notes and exercises. Finally, the project will support summer research for undergraduates, tackling problems between mathematics and physics,  from the University of Massachusetts and nearby Five Colleges.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project orbits around two foci. The first is the study of holomorphic theories on complex surfaces, particularly those related to moduli of holomorphic G-bundles.  The PI will pursue analogs of relationships between affine Lie algebras, moduli of bundles, and chiral CFT, which involve holomorphic theories on Riemann surfaces.  The long-term target is a holomorphic version of Seiberg duality (arising from N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories), which bears natural analogies to mirror symmetry. This first project uses a toolkit, developed by the PI with collaborators, for constructing BV quantization of holomorphic field theories and then analyzing their factorization algebras of observables. The second focus involves topological theories on manifolds with boundaries and corners, where the long-term target is a rigorous demonstration of the Frenkel-Gaiotto conjecture about how vertex algebras and ribbon categories arise from the Kapustin-Witten gauge theories, which play a key role in the physical approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence. This second project will approach the conjecture using both global methods (by developing, via derived algebraic geometry, the AKSZ procedure with manifolds with boundaries and corners, and thence a higher categorical deformation quantization) and perturbative methods (building upon an extension of the BV/factorization package for field theories on manifolds with boundary, which yields stratified factorization algebras of observables).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although some remarkable bijections to algebraic objects such as random matrices, Young diagrams and so on have led to a series of breakthroughs in the mathematical verification of some of the predictions, many of the current techniques  based on integrable probability are not sufficient by themselves to analyze some of the fundamental geometric properties of such systems. Continuing an ongoing program to couple the integrable approach with a primarily probabilistic and geometric perspective, the PI lays down a comprehensive  plan to investigate several aspects of such models which will fundamentally improve our understanding and initiate new research directions. The program also has a strong education component including mentoring graduate students and postdocs, and curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, aiming to create multiple advanced research topics courses, and design the probability content in foundational undergraduate courses. Various educational and dissemination strategies including workshop organizing, writing survey articles, teaching summer courses will be carried out as well.  <br/><br/>A canonical model of growth predicted to be in the KPZ universality class is the model of planar Last Passage Percolation (LPP) which puts random weights on the vertices of a planar lattice and considers paths between vertices which accrue maximum weights. Such maximal paths called geodesics are fundamental objects of study. Besides further developing the picture of coalescence of geodesics in LPP models, the project aims to study the entire energy landscape of paths and their associated weights, with a focus on the geometry of almost maximal paths or near geodesics.  The PI will also investigate  interlacing properties of geodesic watermelons (collections of disjoint paths with maximal cumulative weight) and their consequences with connections to various line ensembles and determinantal point processes, as well as large deviation behaviors of geodesics. Finally the program will initiate novel research directions concerning fractal geometry and noise sensitivity, drawing inspiration from seminal works of a similar nature in the context of critical planar percolation and spin glasses. Particular topics include studying Hausdorff dimensions of  various endpoint pairs admitting exceptional geodesic behavior as well as computing exponents marking the onset of chaos in natural dynamical versions of LPP.  As necessary tools, several new theories including discrete harmonic analysis for models in the KPZ universality class will be developed. In particular, this is expected to create a bridge between various communities in probability, mathematical physics and theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common theme that unites the proposed methods is scalability and identification of their limitations. A popular approach to identifying sparse inverse covariance matrices is through penalized likelihood methods. We propose a novel approach for solving the penalized Gaussian log-likelihood that is faster than its competitors by many orders of magnitude. The second research component in the proposal investigates the statistical properties of thresholded matrices in finite samples, with a view to obtaining a positive definite covariance estimation method which is highly scalable. The third research aspect of the project investigates quantifying the variability and uncertainty of estimated graphical network models. A methodology that takes advantage of a convex pseudo-likelihood formulation of the graphical model selection problem is introduced. This allows for the development of a highly scalable uncertainty quantification method with theoretical safeguards. The fourth research aspect of the project examines the use of the methodology proposed in the previous three sub-components to an application in the area of climate change, where high dimensional covariance estimation is required. The proposal also has a significant teaching and outreach component which aims to introduce statistics to aspiring young scientists at various stages of their undergraduate and graduate studies.<br/><br/>The availability of high-throughput data from  various applications, including genomics, environmental sciences and others,  has created an urgent need for methodology and tools for analyzing high dimensional data. Extracting and making sense of the many complex relationships and multivariate dependencies in the data and developing principled inferential procedures is one of the major challenges facing statisticians and data scientists. The theoretical and methodological work proposed in this project is motivated by applications and interdisciplinary collaborations in fields as diverse as the earth and environmental sciences, genomics and cancer research, and the social sciences. In genomics for instance, one is often interested to know how various genes are associated, and how these associations differ between an experimental (diseased) and control group. Gene regulatory networks also serve as important tools to study the evolutions of diseases. In the context of the climate change debate, modeling temperature at different points on the globe requires parsimonious modeling of the way in which these variables are related. Modeling correlations also arises naturally in material sciences and engineering where one is interested in seeing how different atomic particles interact when new materials are produced.  Hence the proposed project for estimating correlations in very high dimensional settings will  have widespread applications, since understanding associations/relationships between many variables is an endeavor that is common to many scientific disciplines. The proposed work, though firmly rooted in the statistical sciences, is very much interdisciplinary, and involves collaborations and partnerships between statisticians/data scientists and biomedical scientists, engineers and earth scientists."

Contact structures are the underlying geometric structures reigning the behaviour of light wavefronts in semiclassical ray optics, the evolution of thermodynamical systems and, in general, the study of real-valued functions and their first-order variations. In conjunction with its classical applications to control theory and Hamiltonian dynamics, contact topology has also recently found surprising applications to fluid mechanics and chemistry, including the study of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals. This project aims at providing an understanding of these contact structures through the manipulation of Legendrian wavefronts. These wavefronts are geometric in nature and part of this project aims at systematically describing efficient algorithms to manipulate these fronts. This will significantly enhance our ability to qualitatively study many dynamical systems in terms of the combinatorics of front diagrams. Phrasing problems in terms of front diagrams allows us to bring the strength of the theory of singularities into the study of contact structures. Thus, classical questions such as the stable behaviour of a given Hamiltonian system, the number of periodic orbits and the presence of surfaces of section will potentially be answered through the front-end development perspective offered by the combinatorics of front diagrams.<br/><br/>In technical terms, this project shall be studying the classification of codimension-2 contact submanifolds and developing the study of Legendrian Kirby Calculus and Weinstein structures in all higher dimensions. The project addresses existence and non-uniqueness questions in higher-dimensional contact knot theory, the construction and manipulation of Weinstein handlebodies and their higher-dimensional Legendrian wavefronts. The project includes new applications of these goals to complex geometry, through the study of Stein structures, mathematical physics, including applications to Homological Mirror Symmetry, and singularity theory. The techniques proposed in this project will also have immediate applications to the computation of Floer-theoretic invariants in higher-dimensional symplectic topology and the study of Lagrangian fillings and the wrapped Fukaya category.  The central tools in the project combine higher-dimensional geometric topology, the theory of h-principles and Legendrian invariants. The project includes a central conjecture on the classification of Lagrangian fillings for algebraic Legendrian links and an existence and uniqueness h-principle for higher-dimensional contact submanifolds. The techniques to be employed in the study of these conjectures include explicit constructions obtained via the manipulation of Legendrian fronts and wrinkled singularities, and the use of pseudo-holomorphic curves in order to compute their contact invariants. In addition, the project will also incorporate the development of invariants for higher-dimensional contact knots and the use of microlocal sheaf theory as a guiding connection to the theory of cluster algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scale-independence and locality are two favorable and tenable features of quantum observables.  Scale-independence lends to stable phases of matter that can be codified via a field of mathematics called topology.  Observables possess locality if each observation on a large region of space-time is determined by those on smaller domains, such as by point- or line-observables.  Point-, line-, plane-, ? -observables organize as a mathematical entity known as a higher category, which is a higher-dimensional graph.  Factorization homology is a device that assembles such localized observables to global observables on space-time and it possesses several structural features that give a theory advantage once cast as so.  Generally, it offers conceptual and combinatorial access to long-distance/long-time quantum theory, notably even to ones that are not determined by their point-observables.  To integrate research and education between students and researchers, and to increase mathematics and physics activity in the EPSCoR State of Montana and its surrounding states, the PI will organize two conferences.  These conferences will bring together renowned researchers in mathematical physics, and will draw regional participation.  The PI will compile and disseminate literature for bias-sensitive selection processes for such events.  The PI will produce and publicly post two video series.  One series will behold research-level mathematics generated through activities related to this award.  The other series will be for experimental in-class instruction for upper-division mathematics classes.  <br/> <br/>The project continues the development and explicit identification of the theory of factorization homology for higher categories, partly in collaboration with John Francis.  Factorization homology can be conceived as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications, much like Beilinson-Drinfeld?s construction of conformal blocks in terms of sheaves on Ran spaces.  One goal is to fulfill an essential aspect of this theory: the exact relationship between orthogonal groups and higher categorical adjunctions.  A consequence of such a relationship is a proof of the cobordism hypothesis, of Baez-Dolan and Lurie, after Atiyah.  Another goal is to recover known, and establish new, manifold and tangle invariants from representation theoretic data.  Expected examples of such include the Jones polynomial, and Reshetikhin-Turaev's invariant.  Now, factorization homology depends continuously in diffeomorphisms/isotopies; it possesses subtle functoriality and local-to-global principles; it is expected to carry natural filtrations as well as a general form of Poincare/Koszul duality.  Such a goal thusly lends advantage for computational access to manifold and tangle invariants arising through representation theory.  Such a goal also lends to surprising dualities between state-sum type topological quantum field theories and sigma-model type field theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The probability densities are solutions of wave kinetic (WK) equations, whose nonlocal interaction operators are of kinetic type.

Change-point analysis is a crucial early step in analyzing these data sequences, such as, to raise an alarm when an abnormal event happens in online data monitoring, and to segment a long sequence into more homogeneous parts for follow-up studies.  To accommodate modern applications, the ability to deal with high throughput data and data with complicated structures is becoming a necessity.  Parametric methods usually cannot be applied to very high dimensions unless strong assumptions are made to avoid the estimation of a large number of nuisance parameters.  This project focuses on developing non-parametric change-point detection methods that are free of strong assumptions and computationally scalable to high dimensional and complex data.  This project provides students and researchers with exciting new research problems that have both statistical and scientific importance.  The training component for undergraduate and graduate students will prepare new researchers with inter-disciplinary education.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new scan statistic framework through a novel adaptation of graph-based methods.  The PI has shown that the graph-based approaches scale to high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data, and allow for universal analytic permutation p-value approximations that is decoupled from application-specific modeling, facilitating their applications to large and complicated data sets.  Despite the good properties of the graph-based methods, there are still some gaps between its current versions and many modern applications. This project aims to fill those important gaps.  In particular, this project will (1) develop new graph-based approaches to effectively integrate information from multiple sources, which is common in many application areas, such as smart homes and smart cities, and seek ways to distribute the new approaches to local centers to avoid the excessive transmission of raw data in a distributed system; (2) develop treatments from the level of constructing the graph to deal with dependent data, which is more effective than a circular block permutation framework developed by the PI earlier; and (3) develop a new framework to provide analytic power approximations to the graph-based methods that kick in for sample sizes in hundreds and thousands even for high-dimensional data and non-Euclidean data, facilitating researchers to make better decisions in real applications.  These methodological and theoretical developments will provide better understandings of modern complicated data sequences from diverse fields, which will further advance the understanding of major scientific problems in these fields.  The tools developed in this project will be distributed as open source software packages with detailed documentations.  This will enhance the collaboration between the statistics community and researchers from broader scientific fields, and make data analysis procedures more transparent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, geometric objects described by polynomial equations. To study algebraic varieties, it is often convenient to divide them into different classes according to their geometric properties. An important class of algebraic varieties is given by those whose first Chern class, a basic invariant of algebraic varieties, is zero. A fundamental result from the 1980s, called the Beauville-Bogomolov theorem, states that there are exactly three kinds of building blocks for smooth compact algebraic varieties with zero first Chern class: complex tori, strict Calabi-Yau manifolds, and irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. This project focuses on the last of these three building blocks, which traditionally has been the least studied. Thanks to some fundamental theorems in differential geometry, irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds admit a special metric called a hyper-Khler metric. The geometry of holomorphic symplectic manifolds is relevant not only to algebraic and differential geometry, but also to representation theory and mathematical physics. As part of this project, the PI will organize activities to strengthen the hyper-Khler research community in the United States, activities for undergraduate students from under-represented minorities in math, and K-12 activities in the broader community around Columbia University.<br/><br/>K3 surfaces constitute one of the most studied types of algebraic surfaces, and irreducible symplectic manifolds are arguably their higher dimensional analogues. In this analogy, Lagrangian fibrations on compact hyper-Khler manifolds are the natural generalizations of elliptic K3 surfaces.

The PI aims to advance the current knowledge of (compact) hyper-Khler manifolds through the systematic study of Lagrangian fibrations. More specifically, the PI will introduce new techniques to compactify quasi-projective Lagrangian fibrations and will study the cohomology, derived categories, and Chow groups of Lagrangian fibered compact hyper-Khler manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They parametrize different geometries on surfaces, so that a point in the moduli space encodes a shape which a surface can assume. Classically, one considers the evenly curved shapes, with richly different points of views arising from hyperbolic geometry, complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and matrix groups. More recently, singular flat geometries have gained prominence because of their relationship to the classical moduli space as well as their connections to important examples in the theory of dynamical systems (systems that evolve over time). This project will advance the study of moduli spaces in five interrelated research programs tied together by shared techniques and analogies. Progress on these research programs will advance the understanding of the geometry of surfaces and higher dimensional spaces and will unlock applications to dynamical systems. The nature of the topics makes their simultaneous investigation synergistic and allows for their integration into educational activities, including the training and mentoring of graduate students, vertically integrated research with undergraduate students, and the development of a new course for the bridge to PhD program. The research with undergraduates program will include a proactive recruiting strategy designed to improve participation of members of groups historically underrepresented in mathematics. Undergraduate participants will be encouraged to participate in the MathCorp summer outreach program, and the more senior participants will receive training on mentoring.<br/><br/>The five research programs that will be undertaken are as follows. First, the PI will build quasi-convex co-bounded planes in Teichmller spaces, and eventually convex cocompact surface subgroups of mapping class groups, by gluing together components obtained via dynamics. Second, the PI will determine if there is a non-trivial orbit closure of translation surfaces of rank at least 3, by classifying special constructions and investigating low genus moduli spaces. Third, the PI will show typical high genus surfaces are good spectral expanders, using the trace formula and work of Mirzakhani.

These objects, like configuration spaces, mapping class groups, and matrix groups, are extensively studied and have deep connections to different areas of mathematics and physics. Although the objects in each sequence tend to get progressively bigger in many senses, the goal of the project is to show that some aspects of their structure stabilize. To engage the public on her research, the PI will partner with her university?s Museum of Natural History to showcase her work through the Science Communication Fellows (activity booths), Scientist in the Forum (public talks) and Research Station (display case) programs.  These Museum programs have an established record of reaching hundreds of members of the public and inspiring interest in STEM topics. The PI will also organize a public lecture series on mathematics topics of popular interest.  To support graduate education, the PI will continue to support the department?s Marjorie Lee Browne program (a 2-year ""bridge to the PhD"" math Masters program for under-served groups) by supervising students, and designing a new Masters-level differential topology course (implementing inclusive teaching practices) as a stepping stone to the department?s PhD-level differential topology course. The PI will organize a 4-day graduate summer school/workshop in Representation Stability, and will continue co-organizing her department?s research and learning seminars in the area. The PI will continue to assist with a new qualifying exam study support program for Michigan PhD students. The PI will run a semester-long professional development workshop for her department?s grad students on ?the art of mathematics research talks"". To support undergraduate education, the PI will continue teaching in inquiry-based learning format, an evidence-based active learning model related to the flipped classroom. The PI will run an REU with two students and will continue to co-organize and speak in her department?s undergraduate Math Club.<br/><br/>This project focuses on four broad programs. The first program concerns representation-theoretic stability behavior in the homology of the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class groups of genus-g surfaces, and the analogous subgroups of the automorphism groups of the free groups on n letters, as g and n grow. Both families are central objects in geometric group theory and their homology is not well understood, but its long-term behavior may be studied using tools from the field of representation stability. The second program concerns the algebraic structure of the homology groups of configuration spaces of connected manifolds. Configuration spaces have a long history of study in fields ranging broadly from topology to algebraic combinatorics to physics. The PI aims to expand the scope of the existing stability literature by establishing higher-order stability patterns among the ?unstable? homology classes, extending her existing work with Miller on configuration spaces of surfaces. The third program concerns the principal congruence subgroups of the general linear groups?objects fundamental to number theory?and aims to adapt machinery developed by Galatius?Kupers?Randal-Williams to prove higher-order stability patterns in their homology. The fourth program will study the high-degree rational cohomology of the special linear groups of a number ring. Conjecturally, these homology groups do or do not vanish in a range below their virtual cohomological dimension, depending on ring-theoretic properties of the number ring. These cohomology groups are governed by their Bieri?Eckmann dualizing module, the Steinberg module. The PI will approach these conjectures by constructing resolutions of the Steinberg module, by studying the topology of certain simplicial complexes related to the associated Tits buildings. These conjectures have implications for the K-theory of the integers. The project also includes a broad educational component and broader impact activities which include a partnership with the university's Museum of Natural History, a public lecture series (Scientist in the Forum), a bridge-to-PhD program for Masters students, organization of summer schools and seminars and a semester long professional development workshop for graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports an integrated research program on partial differential equations and an educational program promoting scientific computing and applied mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate level. The research component of the project is concerned with mathematical models from physics and engineering, specifically models used to describe long-range forces and mass transport/kinetic effects, and seeks to answer a number of fundamental questions. Answers to these questions will aid in the creation of practical and reliable algorithms for computer simulations of complex physical systems (such as those found in plasma physics, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, material science) and in the creation of practical and reliable autonomous systems (including but not limited to robotics and control theory). In mathematics, long-range forces and heavy-tailed distribution are often modeled via a class of equations known as integro-differential equations. The mathematical theory for such equations is not as advanced as that of ordinary or partial differential equations, but integro-differential equations are becoming increasingly common in theory and applications. The mathematical analysis of mass-transport, understood in the broadest sense, deals with dynamics of masses of ""particles"" moving in reaction to both background forces and collisions between said particles. Depending on the context, these ""particles"" may represent actual physical particles or intelligent agents interacting with their environment and with one another. As such, transport models cover many situations: from dynamical formulations of models in statistical mechanics to the study of optimal or stable matchings in economics, and the mathematical results of this project may be of use to such disciplines. The project explores interconnected questions in these two fields (many of which are relevant to the modeling of plasmas) and in particular will explore the use of transport methods to analyze problems involving long-range forces. The activities in this project also provide substantial support for the recruitment, training, and mentorship of mathematically talented undergraduate and graduate students at Texas State University. These activities include campus-wide events with guest speakers from academia and industry, specialized advanced courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and research mentorship of graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. A prime objective of this project's educational efforts is increasing the numbers of graduates entering careers in industry and/or academia that require state of the art mathematical and computational training.<br/><br/>The research activities in this project fall, thematically speaking, in one or more of the following areas: high dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations, kinetic equations with nonlocal terms, integro-differential methods for interface problems, and Jacobian equations/transport problems. A common thread connecting these diverse topics is the search for pointwise estimates and regularity estimates for solutions of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, and as such questions about estimates makes for a considerable portion of this project's research efforts. While a few of the problems considered in this project lie squarely within one of the categories above, they are motivated by a potential application in a different category - such as the Nonlocal Jacobian equation, which is motivated by the question of obtaining Aleksandrov-type estimates adapted to integro-differential equations. Positive outcomes in the various lines of inquiry could potentially lead to a mesh-free algorithm for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, an optimal transport formulation of solutions for nonlinear kinetic equations, new regularity results for two-phase free boundary problems, and new Harnack inequalities for nonlocal equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two storylines have been highly fruitful, but have yet to cross-pollinate. This project aims to construct a long-sought-after bridge, to not only produce spectral methods for studying symplectic geometry, but to establish symplectic tools for studying spectral algebra.

Which cancer treatments are best for which patients?  Does incarceration impede or encourage recidivism? Causal inference is concerned with formulating such questions mathematically, exploring whether answers can be obtained from data, and if so, determining how well and with what methods. The classical setup in causal inference explores effects of simple interventions, and presumes confounding relationships are straightforward enough to estimate with relatively low error. However, simple ""all-or-nothing"" effects may mask underlying heterogeneity, and can be practically unrealistic or nearly impossible to estimate, for example if some subjects have no chance of receiving treatment. Further, in modern contexts, confounders are often high-dimensional and relate to exposures and outcomes in unknown and possibly very complex ways. Accommodating realistic confounding and heterogeneity are two of the most central challenges in modern causal inference. These pursuits yield myriad open questions, from understanding fundamental limits of causal inference in high dimensions to exploring entirely new effects altogether. This project aims to help address these questions by developing novel theory and methods and advancing the application of causal inference in fields such as public policy and medicine. Outreach is also a major component. New software will be made freely available in R. The PI will design an undergraduate course on quantitative causal reasoning, to help push data literacy forward from association to causation. A textbook will be written, and there will be numerous opportunities for broad participation, including summer programs, workshops, and short courses.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new theory and methods for the study of more nuanced - yet practical - effect measures, accommodating the complex data structures often found in practice. The research will focus on (1) adjustment for high-dimensional confounding and (2) flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects and optimal treatment regimes. Extensions will also be pursued for multivalued time-varying exposures subject to unmeasured confounding. For (1), the PI aims to develop novel non-asymptotic risk bounds for both classical and new propensity-based effects, as well as minimax lower bounds. This is accomplished in a high-dimensional discrete model (new to causal inference) as well as with continuous data. For (2), the PI plans to determine the fundamental limits of heterogeneous effect estimation in flexible nonparametric models, develop and analyze novel heterogeneous effect estimators, and study optimal treatment regimes under novel ""contact constraints."" This work has the potential to help transform our understanding of causal inference in the modern big data era. The projects will also directly contribute to research on specific applications in sociology, criminology, and medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The agents may be investors, drivers, or viruses, and the large systems may be financial markets, highways, or epidemics, for example. The most widely used framework for modeling competition between many interacting agents, known as ""mean field game theory,"" is fundamentally limited in scope to symmetric models, in which each agent interacts equally with each of the others. Many important phenomena, on the other hand, are governed by networks---such as those formed by social ties or financial obligations ? that determine which agents interact with each other. Network structures have important implications that the standard theory cannot capture. This project tackles this limitation by developing new mathematical frameworks to handle large-scale models of competition with heterogeneous interactions governed by networks. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the research activities, and local K-12 outreach efforts are designed to foster an interest in applied mathematics and continued education.<br/><br/>This project builds a rigorous foundation for a new era of network-based mean field game theory and applications. The first goal is to identify the range of network structures for which the standard mean field approximation is valid, in order to substantially extend the scope of the mean field paradigm. For those network structures for which the standard mean field approximation fails, the second goal is to identify and analyze tractable alternatives. Certain important features of mean field approximations, such as asymptotic independence, fail in sparse (as opposed to dense) networks, and the third goal of the research is to identify precise sparsity thresholds for this and other phenomena. This project adapts and extends recent methodologies of graph limit theories and large deviations, which have a strong track record of solving network-based problems in statistical physics. New mathematical challenges arise in the game-theoretic setting due to the long-range dependencies induced by competitive equilibrium, and new techniques must be developed to address these challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The simplicity and intrinsic beauty of these problems, and the disproportionate depth and effort of their resolution, has inspired their study since ancient Greece.

However, next-generation modeling and analysis is computationally challenging using existing tools.  Tailored numerical methods have the potential to address such limitations.  For example, projection-based reduced order models decrease computational costs associated with many-query scenarios (such as engineering design or uncertainty quantification) by replacing a high fidelity model with a less expensive low-dimensional surrogate.  Similarly, high order accurate schemes are particularly effective at resolving fine-scale features in transient vorticular flows.  Unfortunately, when applied to the equations of fluid dynamics, these numerical methods experience non-physical instabilities which can cause simulations to fail unexpectedly.  The goal of this project is to enable robust and efficient simulations using discretely ""entropy stable"" schemes.  By building fundamental energetic principles directly into a discretization, entropy stable methods retain accuracy while inheriting verifiable properties which improve ""out-of-the-box"" robustness. <br/><br/>Discretely entropy stable high order discretizations for nonlinear conservation laws have seen rapid development over the last 7 years.  This project will extend this methodology to three areas where existing approaches are suboptimal or unavailable: (1) high order methods on non-conforming meshes, (2) high order physical-frame discretizations for domain boundaries with fine-scale features, and (3) reduced order modeling.  Additionally, the PI will integrate aspects of the proposed research with an educational program aimed at promoting computational science and improving retention among college students and K-12 teachers.  Specifically, the PI will (1) design and supervise senior capstone research projects for engineering undergraduates, and (2) organize a summer research program for K-12 teachers centered around numerical modeling and discovery-based learning.

Several problems in imaging sciences are modeled as integral geometric problems like the one just mentioned. Examples include: the X-ray/Radon transform used in Computerized Tomography, with applications to medical imaging and homeland security; the travel-time tomography problem in seismology or geophysical prospection; and more recently, the Neutron Spin Tomography problem, where a magnetic field inside a material must be recovered from its 'non-abelian' integrals. In this project, the Principal Investigator will address core questions in integral geometry, on both theoretical and applied levels. For such problems where the complexity lies in the geometry of propagation, the representation of the unknown parameters, and sometimes the non-linear aspects of the problem, the feasibility of reconstruction from available data will be first assessed at the level of the continuous models. In cases where inversion is possible, theoretical inversions will be validated by proof-of-concept implementations which will address practical issues of noisy data, sampling/resolution, regularization and Uncertainty Quantification. This research project is integrated with opportunities for training, research experience and career development for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for a postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the theoretical and applied analysis of integral geometric problems, where unknowns are modeled as functions, tensors, connections over bundles, or sections of these bundles. The measurements are linear or non-linear integral functionals of said unknowns. In addition to the usual injectivity, stability and inversion assessments, focus will be turned toward sharpening the mapping properties of integral geometric operators and obtaining range characterizations for certain non-linear operators. The proposed methods combine deep theoretical tools (microlocal analysis, harmonic analysis, Clifford analysis and partial differential equations on manifolds) with a concern to produce explicit routes toward the reconstruction of the unknowns, some of which already exist in non-explicit form. To complement this theoretical agenda, addressing practical issues such as noisy data, sampling and Uncertainty Quantification will require methods from theoretical statistics and signal processing.

As an example in the latter case, suppose a lab is trying to develop a cure for a disease like Alzheimer's. This is a complex disease for which it is unlikely to find a single cure that works for everyone. It is much more likely that research on the drug will continue for years, if not decades, and every few months a new drug may be tested for its efficacy using a clinical trial. When we are testing whether a particular drug is any better than a placebo, we have no idea how many more drugs (hypotheses) we will test in the future, but we do know the results of the earlier tests. This is the setup considered by online multiple hypothesis testing, the topic of this project --- a large sequence of hypotheses are tested over time in an online fashion, and we would like to ensure that there are not too many false discoveries in this process just due to chance. A false discovery results not just in false hopes, but in millions of wasted dollars in follow up clinical trials, and possibly worse outcomes for patients. This project aims to develop novel methodology to test such a sequence of hypotheses so that certain common error metrics are controlled at any time.

The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.  When the objects of interest are highly complex or not easily parametrized, these problems are difficult to approach, and the PI's program centers on several new techniques to render rigidity problems tractable.

This project builds on this success of this program, extending this theme to new contexts and applications.

The work of this project involves the application of recently developed approximation theory results in the computational arena, targeted advances that extend theoretical mathematics for computational purposes, and the development and implementation of algorithms for large-scale computations.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this project are designed to provide feasible computational algorithms and concrete mathematical guarantees for tasks in high-dimensional approximation. The three major core components for the completion of this task involve the design, implementation, and analysis of algorithms that leverage optimality characteristics of (1) random and deterministic experimental and sampling design, (2) computational algorithms for identifying efficient sampling schemes, and (3) strategies and techniques for emerging approximation paradigms such as sparse approximation and dimension reduction. A crosscutting theme is application of these methods to problems of modern interest in scientific computing. This project involves fundamental contributions to the fields of applied approximation theory and computational approximation methods through the development of applications-oriented sampling designs with provable near-optimality. Theoretical investigations of this project connect classical techniques in approximation and linear algebra with emerging algorithms in data reduction and reduced order modeling. The implementation of these algorithms will significantly enhance theoretical understanding and computational feasibility for goal-oriented design, parameter study and reduction, sparse and compressive representations, model verification and calibration, and data-driven simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electronic structure theories, particularly represented by Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), have been developed into workhorse tools with a wide range of applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology.  High fidelity electronic structure simulation requires the solution of increasingly larger and more complex problems.  Efficient, accurate, and scalable numerical methods can transform the range of applicability of electronic structure theories and enable scientific applications that are beyond reach today.  The education component of this project focuses on introducing electronic structure theories to graduate students, early career researchers, and advanced undergraduate students with mathematical backgrounds. Efficient techniques developed in the applied mathematics community, after adapted to specific computational problems, can be valuable tools to reduce the cost of electronic structure calculations. Electronic structure theories can also offer new ideas and application areas for the development of general mathematical and numerical techniques. Currently there is a high language barrier between the applied mathematics community and the electronic structure community. This project will develop new education activities, such as new topic courses and summer school activities, with the goal of reducing the language barrier and bridging the gap between the two communities.  <br/><br/>The research component of this project aims at significantly reducing the computational cost for KS-DFT calculations with high fidelity hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. Mathematically, hybrid functionals involve the Fock exchange operator, which is generally nonlocal and full-rank, and its treatment is computationally very challenging.  This project will develop an adaptive compression strategy for treating the Fock exchange operator, and accelerate two important types of calculations with hybrid functionals: ab initio molecular dynamics, and real-time time dependent density functional theory.  The new methods will be transferred to community electronic structure software packages used by chemists and materials scientists, and be validated by simulation with real materials. The goal is to transform how hybrid functional electronic structure calculations are performed for large, complex systems."

As one such candidate, it has become increasingly common to use decision trees, a hierarchically organized data structure, for building a predictive or causal model. This trend is spurred by the appealing connection between decision trees and rule-based decision-making, particularly in clinical, legal, or business contexts, as the tree structure mimics the sequential way a human user may think and reason, thereby facilitating human-machine interaction. To make them fast to compute, decision trees are popularly constructed with an algorithm called recursive partitioning, in which the decision nodes of the tree are learned from the data in a greedy, top-down manner. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a precise understanding of the strengths and limitations of decision trees based on recursive partitioning, and, in doing so, gain insights on how to improve their performance in practice. In addition to this impact, high-school, undergraduate, and graduate research assistants will be vertically integrated and benefit both academically and professionally. Innovative curricula, workshops, and data and methods competitions involving students, academics, and industry professionals will facilitate outreach and encourage participation from a broad audience. <br/><br/>This proposal aims to provide a comprehensive study of the statistical properties of greedy recursive partitioning algorithms for training decision trees, as is demonstrated in two fundamental contexts. The first thrust of the project will develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of oblique decision trees, where, in contrast to conventional axis-aligned splits involving only a single covariate, the splits at each decision node occur at linear combinations of the covariates. While this methodology has garnered significant attention from the computer science and optimization communities since the mid-80s, the advantages they offer over their axis-aligned counterparts remain only empirically justified, and explanations for their success are largely based on heuristics. Filling this long-standing gap between theory and practice, the PI will investigate how oblique regression trees, constructed by recursively minimizing squared error, can adapt to a rich class of regression models consisting of linear combinations of ridge functions. This provides a quantitative baseline for a statistician to compare and contrast decision trees with other less interpretable methods, such as projection pursuit regression and neural networks, that target similar model forms. Crucially, to address the combinatorial complexity of finding the optimal splitting hyperplane at each decision node, the PI?s framework can accommodate many existing computational tools in the literature. A major component of the research is derived from connections between recursive partitioning and sequential greedy approximation algorithms for convex optimization problems (e.g., orthogonal greedy algorithms).  The second thrust focuses on the delicate pointwise properties of axis-aligned recursive partitioning, with implications for heterogeneous causal effect estimation, where accurate pointwise estimates over the entire support of the covariates are essential for valid inference (e.g., testing hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals). Motivated by simple setting where decision trees provably fail to achieve optimal performance, the PI will investigate how the signal-to-noise ratio affects the quality of pointwise estimation. While the focus is on causal effect estimation directly using decision trees, the PI will also investigate implications for multi-step semi-parametric settings, where preliminary unknown functions (e.g., propensity scores) are estimated with machine learning tools, as well as conditional quantile regression, both of which require estimators with high pointwise accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In medical imaging, computed tomography (CT) scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are often best represented with models that are complex, beyond the scope of most available computational approaches, as existing methodology and theoretical analysis are mostly restricted to simpler classes of optimization problems. Since CT and PET scans come with a cost of a small radiation dose to the patient, better models for the data obtained by these imaging devices would result in a better tradeoff between the risk due to radiation and the benefit of obtaining a precise image for effective diagnosis and treatment.

One of the main goals of this project is to take advantage of some recent mathematical advances to develop and implement fast algorithms for fitting data by smooth functions.

The project will open new research directions for students and researchers; and it also will enhance our understanding of mathematical theories such as harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, and nonlinear programming.<br/><br/>This 5-year integrated research and education project focuses on solving variational problems with boundary and/or obstacle constraints on arbitrary subsets in Euclidean space. The approach that the PI proposes is unorthodox: Rather than seeking exact minimizers of energy functionals, the PI will look for functions that minimize the energy functionals up to universal constant multiples. In contrast to the conventional approach to solving variational problems, which involves the solution of a partial differential equation, the PI will construct the solutions directly. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete theory revolving around the belief that any variational problem that can be solved using PDE theory can also be dealt with using extension theory. The special problems the PI will focus on are the obstacle problem, which requires the minimizers to lie above a certain barrier; and the Plateau problem, which seeks a surface of least area with prescribed boundary. Solving variational problems using PDE methods often requires the boundary of the set to have some kind of smoothness. In practice, this is a severe limitation. The novelty of the proposed approach is that there is no need to make any assumption on the geometry or the regularity of the set on which the PI prescribes the boundary conditions or constraints."

In order to aid in the treatment of reduced sperm motility, it is important to understand interactions of the sperm flagellum with different regions of the reproductive tract. In particular, fluid flow helps bring the egg to the uterus (in the opposite direction of sperm progression). Recent experiments have shown that a large percentage of sperm exhibit positive rheotaxis, the ability to reorient and swim against a background flow. Additionally, sperm will bind and unbind to the oviductal wall and the role of a background flow on sperm detachment is not known. The main scientific goals of this project include further analyzing existing experimental data (through image processing techniques) and developing new computational models to understand the clinical importance of migration through the female reproductive tract and sperm binding and detachment from walls in a background flow. Several new computational modeling frameworks will be developed to allow simulations of sperm in the presence of a background flow and a wall. The PI will provide interdisciplinary training for several students (undergraduate and graduate) as well as one postdoc in the areas of computational biofluids, image processing of experimental movies, and model development. In addition, the PI will work to develop image processing and modeling modules to be used in area High Schools and at summer programs for High School students at WPI. <br/><br/>The sperm flagellum is an elastic structure that propagates waves of bending along its length to propel itself through the female reproductive tract. Understanding the behavior of the interaction between sperm, dynamic elastic structures, and their surrounding fluid will shed light onto the biophysics of their 3-dimensional motion and will help determine the clinical importance of migration through the female reproductive tract in a background flow.  Models will be able to delineate the importance of factors such as sperm rolling, types of flagellar waveforms, biochemistry, and fluid viscosity for forward progression of the sperm.  In this project, the PI will model the sperm flagellum as a Kirchhoff rod that is able to bend and twist.  The rod is able to achieve both planar and nonplanar waveforms and the rotation of the rod can be captured via an orthonormal triad associated with each material point along the centerline of the flagellum. Through this work the PI will focus on the following objectives: (1) Understand the types of emergent waveforms and trajectories of sperm in a background flow at different viscosities; (2) Determine if rolling is due to calcium mediated changes in flagellar waveforms, background flow, wall interactions, or hydrodynamic interactions with other sperm; (3) Investigate the role of background fluid flow on attachment/detachment of sperm to walls; (4) Extend current numerical methods. The PI's research will lead to the development of two new numerical methods to study interactions near a wall and increase accuracy of force calculations through parametric representations of the structure.  These newly developed methods can also be used for other slender elastic structures such as cilia and bacterial flagella."

For example, in medicine, accurate visualization of tissue is needed to diagnose and treat tumors. A key step in imaging technologies requires one to solve an inverse problem in order to transform measured data into detailed image reconstructions of the quantities of interest. However, image reconstruction is inherently uncertain, in part, due to noisy measurements from sensors. Ignoring the uncertainty in the imaging process can lead to undesirable outcomes, such as misjudging the location and spread of a suspected tumor. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in imaging is in its infancy and hence, the potential for impact in research contributions is high. UQ for imaging is computationally challenging since thousands of inversions are needed beyond the initial inversion to generate accurate statistics of the uncertainty. Current approaches for UQ are inadequate because they either fail to deliver solutions in a reasonable computational time or they lack the applicability across a broad range of imaging technologies.<br/><br/><br/>The project is on the development of fast algorithms for UQ in large-scale inverse problems that are applicable to a broad range of imaging technologies. These algorithms are expected to bring down the computational cost by at least an order of magnitude while maintaining the accuracy of the solutions. More specifically, the project will (1) Advance image reconstruction and UQ techniques for incorporating prior information based on fractional partial differential equation (PDE) and Bayesian level set approaches; and (2) Develop new algorithms and analysis for data-driven dimensionality techniques for UQ in Bayesian inverse problems, using randomized and Krylov subspace methods. The algorithms developed here will be rigorously analyzed and validated on several model problems and applications, including diffuse optical and photoacoustic tomography (in biomedicine) and hydraulic tomography and satellite data fusion (in geoscience). The algorithms developed here are also applicable to other imaging-based inverse problems in biomedicine, geophysics, materials science, etc. Outside of imaging applications, these mathematical advances will be of interest to scientists working in many areas of computational science, for example, fractional partial differential equations (PDEs), model reduction, tensor decompositions, and principal component analysis. Lastly, the PI's education and outreach activities will make UQ and imaging technologies more modular, accessible, and easier to understand for pre-service and early career K-12 educators, undergraduate students, and graduate students. Specifically, the educational program of this project will: (1) Strengthen STEM education through teacher training workshops and practical research experiences for pre-service and early career K-12 teachers, which will result in reproducible teaching modules for use in K-12 education; and (2) Enhance undergraduate and graduate curriculum at North Carolina State University by creating accessible seminar talks and new course content.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A second objective is the classification of higher Fano manifolds, the study of their connection to higher rational connectedness, and the study of their complex differential geometry.

This is relevant to the open problem of proving existence of non-unirational Fano manifolds.<br/><br/>Quite frequently in science and engineering one wants to solve a system of polynomial equations in some set of variables, and depending on some set of parameters.  An optimal case is when there is a solution to the system of equations whose coordinates are themselves polynomials (or more often fractions of polynomials) in the parameters.  There are some sufficient conditions for this optimal solution which involve the geometry of the solution set for a general choice of the parameters.

In a different, but related direction, the PI aims to construct geometric compactifications for certain classes of surfaces via the KSBA approach inspired by the minimal model program. The PI is actively involved with the training of undergraduate and graduate students, and in recent years he has organized several activities with a strong educational component. He will expand these activities. In particular, he will run a summer research activity for undergraduates. Also, as part of the thematic program on Calabi-Yau varieties to be held at the Fields institute (Fall 2013), the PI will organize an introductory school for graduate students and other training activities. Additional planed activities include developing new courses for undergraduates and students in the teacher education program, organizing a workshop on Hodge theory and moduli spaces, and writing a monograph.  <br/><br/>The general area of the proposal is algebraic geometry with connections to complex geometry and arithmetic geometry.  Algebraic Geometry studies the geometric properties of objects defined by algebraic (or equivalently polynomial) equations. Within Algebraic Geometry, the PI is interested in the study of moduli spaces. A moduli space is a geometric object that parameterizes the shapes of objects within a given topological class. By studying a moduli space, one obtains important information about geometric objects of a given kind, in particular about the existence or non-existence of objects with prescribed special properties.

This shearing motion causes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and other poorly understood phenomena. Vortex sheets are produced by sharp corners of solid objects moving in a fluid, such as wings of accelerating aircraft or by interacting shock waves in compressible flow. Vortex sheets generally end in a spiral. Since computer simulation of vortex spirals is notoriously unstable, it is especially important investigating them with analytical tools from the theory of differential and integral equations. The project is aimed in particular at understanding and construction of certain classical spirals, followed by a generalization to compressible and viscous flow models.<br/><br/>Recent numerical experiments by the principal investigator and analytical results by others suggest that the Euler equation, a mathematical model of fluid flow that neglects viscosity and heat conduction, may suffer from non-uniqueness: the initial state of the fluid does not determine the state at later times unambiguously. This project will put these unclear results into a more satisfactory state by finding rigorous proofs for flows that have simpler structure and are physically relevant, namely Pullin's separated spirals. The non-uniqueness phenomenon surfaces not only in theory, but also in computer simulation and in physical experiments which are crucial for designing aircraft and other sensitive applications. Understanding non-uniqueness is important because it indicates that the theoretical predictions are less reliable than previously thought, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Broader impacts of this project include combining education with hands-on research in order to attract students, especially at the critical advanced undergraduate stage, to the fluid dynamics research. Classroom innovations and several undergraduate projects on computer simulation of compressible fluids, with emphasis on extensive independent study instruction, are planned; PhD students will be trained."

These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Understanding how dynamical systems change with different parameters is a very complicated and delicate question which is not even completely understood in the simplest of mathematical models. The research outlined in this proposal explores connections between different perspectives on parameter spaces associated to particular dynamical systems. For example, one of the most intriguing ways to view these parameter spaces is algebraically; that is, these parameters spaces are intimately related of roots of polynomials, an area of mathematics that, a priori, has no obvious connection to dynamics. Investigating these mysterious and somewhat surprising connections is one of the main research goals outlined in this proposal. This proposal also contains a substantial outreach component to share mathematics with high school students through mathematical fieldtrips to the Mathematics Department at the University of Michigan, and to give graduate students and postdocs opportunities to learn from each other through a series of workshops, which will be followed by companion conferences at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/><br/>A major goal in the field of complex dynamics is to understand dynamical moduli spaces. The most successful endeavor in this regard has been the study of the moduli space of quadratic polynomials where the Mandelbrot set lives; the Mandelbrot set is a universal object in complex dynamics. Much of the structure of the Mandelbrot set can actually be revealed through algebraic data; that is, there are distinguished algebraic integers in the Mandelbrot set (ie, roots of a certain collection of polynomials with integer coefficients), and these points are dense in the boundary. In the first part of this proposal, we consider collections of algebraic integers (or roots of collections of polynomials) arising naturally in the parameter space of an iterated function system. We take the topological closure of these roots and (following some work of others) develop a dynamical theory of the iterated function system to better understand the structure of this set. Much of the discussion unfolds in a way parallel to that for quadratic polynomials except there are some surprising differences and still many interesting questions to explore which link geometry, dynamics, algebra, and Galois theory. The second part of this proposal is centered around algebraic data and Thurston's Topological Characterization of Rational Maps, one of the most important theorems in complex dynamics. Associated to a postcritically finite rational map on the Riemann sphere, are three different kinds of linear operators. These operators naturally arise in the setting of Thurston's theorem, each acting on a finite-dimensional vector space. The characteristic polynomials of these operators have rational coefficients, so the corresponding eigenvalues are algebraic. This proposal explores possible connections that these operators (and their eigenvalues) have with each other, and connections that these operators (and their eigenvalues) have with the geometry and dynamics of the original rational map."

Dense suspensions of deformable particles in viscous fluids are ubiquitous in natural and engineering systems. Examples include drop, bubble, vesicle, swimmer, and blood cell suspensions. Unlike simple Newtonian fluids, the laws describing their flow behavior are not well established, owing to the complex interplay between the deformable micro-structure and the macro-scale flow. For instance, interactions between soft particles modify their trajectories and cause shear-induced diffusion, and interaction with confining walls controls the spatial organization of the suspensions. Besides experiments, direct numerical simulations are often the only means for gaining insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of such complex fluids. Hence, there is a need for robust and optimal algorithms that are scalable. Integrated with the research effort, this project will undertake educational, mentoring, and outreach activities including a new interdisciplinary graduate-level course on computational methods for complex fluids and an interactive education module illustrating the non-intuitive phenomena observed in complex fluid systems that is accessible to high school students.  <br/> <br/>The specific aims of this project include (i) highly accurate algorithms to compute the nearly singular integrals that arise within the context of boundary integral methods when particles approach very close to each other when subjected to flow, (ii) fast, high-order, and adaptive algorithms to simulate multiphase flows through arbitrary periodic geometries, and (iii) stable time-marching and reparameterization schemes for the coupled systems of stiff, nonlinear, time-dependent differential and integro-differential equations governing the evolution of particles and some material concentration on their surfaces (e.g., surfactants or multi-phase lipids). The proposed computational infrastructure will lead to better predictive capabilities for blood flow through complex geometries, margination of platelets and targeted carriers, and new design tools for microfluidic devices. They can be applied to a large class of particulate flow problems. Besides fluid mechanics, the proposed numerical methods and the computational infrastructure can be applied to solve partial differential equations that arise in various other disciplines.

Efforts are directed toward the  study of bubbly fluids.  A goal is to develop effective equations  for such fluids.  The first step is to derive the equations of  motion for a finite collection of interacting bubbles.  The  behavior for an infinite number of bubbles is deduced from kinetic  theory, which gives rise to a kinetic equation that is a  coarse-grained description of the mixture.  This procedure has been  implemented to derive two sets of effective equations that  describe concentration and sound waves in an ideal bubbly flow.  In both situations it is observed that the spatially homogeneous  solution may be unstable.  In the first case the instability  results in the bubbles clustering and in the later case it  indicates the bubble oscillations will synchronize to each other.  A damping mechanism similar to Landau damping is found in the  stable case.  This is connected to the spectral theory of linear  operators with a continuous spectrum and has no finite-dimensional  analogue.  The investigator extends this work to investigate the  interaction of acoustic modes with convective modes.  The theory  will also be broadened to include the effects of gravity, liquid  viscosity and bubble size distribution.  With a view towards a more  general theory of bubbly flow, the investigator examines the  effects of a small, slowing varying vorticity field on an ideal  bubbly flow.  It is anticipated that the studies will be performed  in collaboration with a graduate student.  In addition to its  relevance to engineering problems, this project contains  substantial educational aspects.  The student will be exposed to  fluid mechanics, potential theory, Hamiltonian mechanics, kinetic  theory, spectral theory of linear operators, and numerical  methods.  A new graduate level mathematics class is also developed  on the numerical solution of interface problems with level sets.  The advantage of this  approach is that it handles topology changes  naturally and easily.  This class is expected to attract not only  mathematics students but science and engineering students as well,  because interface problems have wide-spread interest.       An important emphasis of this project is to further enhance  the applied mathematics program in the mathematics department at  the University of Michigan and promote education at the interface  between mathematics and engineering.  One aspect of this project is  to develop effective equations for bubbly fluids.  A bubbly fluid  is a dispersion of gas bubbles in a liquid and can be found in a  variety natural and industrial settings.  The effective equations  will give a bulk or coarse-grained description of this mixture.  At  the present time computer resources do not exist to numerically  simulate directly a bubbly fluid.  For this reason considerable  effort has been made in the development of models for bubbly  fluids.  The other aspect of the project is to incorporate  applications of mathematics in a significant portion of  mathematics classes.  At the undergraduate level, the investigator  plans to develop an enriched calculus course that focuses on  applications for engineering students.  The investigator plans to  continue redesigning a senior level partial differential equations  class to include more physics, applications, and computer-related  assignments."

The goal of this project is to study how the rigidity of these associated geometric objects is reflected in the algebraic properties of the groups in question. More concretely, the PI will study the relations between the number of generators of a Kleinian group and geometric observables of the associated hyperbolic 3-manifold, such as the volume or the spectrum of the Laplacian. In order to do so, it will be necessary to develop some so-far unexplored aspects of the deformation theory of Kleinian groups. The PI will also study to what extent the Margulis superrigidity theorem holds for homomorphisms between mapping class groups. This problem will be approached via combinatorial methods and also via the study of harmonic maps between moduli spaces. Tools from dynamics will also be applied to study the rigidity of certain actions of mapping class groups. Finally, the PI will study the existence of minimal spines for locally symmetric spaces and their geometric, homological and algebraic properties. In this case, the main tools are going to be a combination of classical arguments in algebraic topology and in the theory of algebraic groups.<br/><br/><br/>A group is an algebraic object of fundamental interest. Perhaps the most interesting groups appear as symmetries of some geometric structure, such as a crystal, a physical model, an object in space, etc... For instance, Kleinian groups play an important role in the study of fractal objects. Arithmetic groups are groups of matrices and hence have applications in all branches of mathematics. Finally, the mapping class group, the group of symmetries of a surface, plays not only a central role  in mathematics, but is also important in for instance theoretical physics. All three classes of groups are known to have useful rigidity properties but it is unknown how this rigidity is effectively interlocked with the algebraic properties of the groups. It is an integral part of this proposal to obtain effective and, at least in principle, computable rigidity results. Besides advancing the state of knowledge in an important area of mathematics, educating graduate students to do independent research is one of the main goals of this project. This will be greatly facilitated by the broad spectrum of tools and methods that the PI intends to apply. This breadth will also facilitate the disemination of the obtained results among the mathematical community.<br/>"

One such problem is to find a conceptual moduli-theoretic interpretation of the Coleman-Mazur eigencurve. The investigator also proposes to study the problem of incorporating conditions such as semi-stability (in the sense of Fontaine) in the deformation theory of Galois representations, continuing a line of development growing out of the work of Wiles.  In a somewhat different direction, Buzzard has recently observed in numerous examples that the slopes of eigenforms seem to possess much more structure than conjectured by Gouvea-Mazur.  These surprising observations do not fit into any general framework, and the investigator proposes to determine the general nature of such phenomena.  In addition to studying these problems, the investigator continues his efforts in the direction of supporting active student interest in mathematics at the high school level.  Through personal contacts at a local school, he arranges regular meetings in which he leads informal group discussions with students on an assortment of interesting mathematical ideas (taken from a wide variety of disciplines:  number theory, geometry, probability, etc.).  The idea is to expose students to important and interesting concepts which are not usually encountered in the classroom but which can be presented in an elementary context.<br/><br/>The investigator also provides these students with information about summer math programs and research opportunities, in order that they can experience mathematics as a living field of scientific inquiry.  Number theory is the branch of mathematics which is concerned with the properties of whole numbers.  It abounds in deep and unsolved problems, particularly concerning properties of prime numbers and geometric objects called elliptic curves.  Prime numbers and the theory of elliptic curves also lie at the heart of modern cryptographic systems, without which secure diplomatic transmissions and Internet commerce would be impossible.  The RSA cryptosystem and the elliptic curve factorization algorithm are two such prominent applications in this context.  Improvements in our theoretical understanding of elliptic curves is expected lead to further applications along these lines.  The investigator's scientific work is concerned with several questions naturally arising from the theory of elliptic curves, and partly aims to continue the development the techniques that were used to recently settle the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture, one of the most important problems in the theory of elliptic curves.  The investigator also regularly visits with local high school students, showing them important mathematical ideas that are not usually encountered in school, such as the inner workings of the RSA cryptosystem and the role of probability in the design of medical tests for rare diseases.  The investigator also provides these students with nformation about summer opportunities for education, research, and work in mathematics, and offers guidance for students who wish to take part in several prestigious high school science research competitions.  The Faculty Career Development Program makes it possible for the investigator to continue his scientific work while at the same time enabling him to give some high school students a deeper appreciation for mathematics and its important role in modern society.<br/>"

The project advances graph compression schemes that are universal and independent of the application to summarize massive graphs at large scales.  These algorithms should be highly efficient, using a small amount of space and time to produce a compressed representation.  Furthermore, these algorithms should be provably correct.  In addition, the tools should be adapted to dynamic graph data.  They should learn a model of the graph from historical data.  Finally, this project will design tools that can infer graph properties from samples of a massive graph, since such a graph cannot be observed in its entirety.  In applications where sampling schemes can be devised, we strive to do so as effectively and as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/><br><br><br/><br/>We live in an information age.  Behind many of our technological, scientific, and economic forces are large volumes of data.  An increasingly important type of data is relational data or graph data. These data capture how entities are related to one another, how they interact with one another, or how objects are linked together.  All forms of communication amongst entities give rise to graph data, including the communication of source and destination IP addresses via IP packets in the Internet, people sending email to one another, web pages referring to one another, or proteins interacting with one another in large biological systems.  Many scientific, engineering, and medical applications depend on our abilities to model, to analyze, to process, and to synthesize this type of data quickly, in the face of changes to the data, and under imperfect information.  Indeed, our security and the security of the Internet may hinge upon our understanding of how entities (be they people or IP addresses) interact with one another.  Our current statistical and algorithmic tools for relational data are not adequate for massive graphs.  They have not kept pace with our ability to collect enormous amounts of data and our need to accurately and efficiently analyze that data.  We must be able to model, to compress, and to highlight the important features of graphs that are gigantic, that evolve over time (perhaps quickly), and that may capture a limited view of a larger graph.  This project aims to develop robust, highly efficient, and provably correct methods for managing massive graphs. <br/>"

Objects associated to sets of polynomial equations, called algebraic varieties, are fundamental in many areas of mathematics and model numerous real-world phenomena. This project studies invariants arising from algebraic varieties, especially how certain invariants are distributed when considering large families of them. For example, if the invariant is an integer, one may ask how likely the invariant is, say, zero for a ""random"" object. Such results then translate into a better understanding of the solutions of the given polynomial equations. Along with the research proposed, the PI will organize a range of outreach activities, including after-school and weekend activities for school-age girls, workshops for graduate students, and regional workshops for students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The research in this project is at the intersection of algebraic and analytic number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, and focuses on distributions of arithmetic statistics. One may ask for not only theoretical results but also heuristic predictions, as well as computational data to predict or verify conjectures.

If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.  The results of this analysis provide new tools for equilibrium-based modeling.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

A second component of the research program will develop novel numerical algorithms for efficient computation of the motion of multiple phases under geometric motions arising as steepest descent for energies that contain bulk and surface tension terms. These interfacial motions are frequently encountered not only in fundamental image processing and vision procedures such as image segmentation, but also in materials science where they can describe grain boundary motion in polycrystalline materials. A number of numerical ideas will be utilized in this direction, including the level set method and some novel alternatives to it. The algorithms will be tested on large scale computations of high scientific interest, such as three dimensional simulations of grain growth in materials, using many grains. In addition, the investigator will continue his research program in extending successful image processing models to the context of surface processing in computer graphics.<br/><br/>The image processing and computer vision tasks that will be impacted by results from this research program include image denoising and segmentation, which are fundamental preliminary operations that are needed whenever useful information is to be extracted from images or video automatically.

The goal of segmentation is to identify parts of an image occupied by distinct objects. <br/>Examples of practical applications where these procedures play a primary role include medical imaging, face recognition, and target identification and tracking.

The numerical issues from computer vision that will be targeted by this research program have a lot in common with numerical issues seen in some central problems in materials science. This connection will in particular make it possible to apply the new computational methods to large scale simulations of the motion of grain boundaries in materials; this computational capability is highly desirable and would be invaluable in predicting the performance and reliability of materials.<br/>"

Despite valuable advances made in the past decades, there are several widely recognized and emerging problems. First, even as these models are increasingly applied to large data sets and complex domains, a statistical theory for inferential behaviors of the hierarchy of latent variables present in the models is not yet available. Second, local inference methods based on sampling, although simple to derive, tend to converge too slowly, thereby losing their effectiveness. Third, most existing methods are incapable of handling highly distributed data sources, which are increasingly responsible for the influx of big data. Addressing these challenges requires fundamentally new ideas in theory, modeling and algorithms that must account for the contrast and interplay between the global geometry of an inference problem and the need for decentralization of inference and algorithmic implementation.  This project aims to make fundamental contributions toward advancing hierarchical model-based inference. They include a statistical theory for the latent hierarchy of variables and for analyzing the effects of transfer learning. They also include variational inference algorithms based on the global geometry of latent structures and geometric analyses of the tradeoffs between statistical and computational efficiencies. Both the algorithms and theory are unified by the use of Wasserstein geometry, which arises from the mathematical theory of optimal transportation.  Moreover, scalable hierarchical models will be developed that can exploit highly distributed data sources and decentralized inference architectures.<br/><br/>This research will improve our ability to manage, analyze and make decisions with large-scale, high dimensional and complex data, especially in the research and applications of networks and the environment. The decentralized detection algorithms for highly distributed data sources have the potential of advancing the state of the art technologies that support data-driven and high-performance distributed computing architectures. As such, this research has the potential of extending the capabilities of the real-time detection and tracking devices currently deployed in the health-care and security domains. The optimal transport based theory will deepen our understanding of hierarchical Bayesian inference, a fundamental concept of modern statistics. The algorithms and geometric analyses will provide useful tradeoffs between statistical and computational complexity, an important issue lying in the interface of Statistics and Computer Science. This research will also provide support for broadening the current statistics curriculum at the University of Michigan. The PI will integrate the teaching of statistical and computational tools with modern applications, by developing synthesis courses which interact closely with research topics of the project.  This provides an excellent opportunity to train students with a broad base of knowledge and cross-disciplinary skills in the fields of statistics, probability, machine learning, distributed computation and networked systems."

One of the main aims of the proposed research is to derive a complete theory for the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves displacing test masses permanently. This will include answering the questions whether there exists such an effect for neutrino radiation as present in binary neutron star mergers and if there is a cosmological memory effect. The goal is to give a detailed geometric-analytic description in the various scenarios and to apply the mathematics to experiments. The PI has already made contributions in this direction in the recent past. The emerging results of the project are expected to answer fundamental physical questions about gravitational radiation, the source objects in astrophysics and the very early period of our universe. Since the pioneering article by D. Christodoulou, where he derived the nonlinear memory effect (also called the Christodoulou effect), it had been an  outstanding problem if electromagnetic fields coupled to the Einstein equations affect this nonlinear phenomenon. The PI with collaborators P. Chen and S.-T. Yau solved the problem, proving that the electromagnetic field in the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) equations enlarges the Christodoulou effect. Working with Christodoulou's geometric-analytic approach for the Einstein vacuum equations and N. Zipser's analysis of the EM equations, the PI, Chen and Yau established novel results and methods in the geometric analysis of the EM equations. The geometric-analytic investigations by Christodoulou as well as by the PI with Chen and Yau allowed the authors to deduce exact solutions describing the related effects precisely and for all data. In particular, the results hold for large data such as binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers. Geometric analysis has since proven to be the most powerful method to tackle these problems. In the study of the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves, null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian geometry play a crucial role.  This is due to the fact that gravitational waves travel along such null hypersurfaces and experiments are performed at null infinity.  Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of the latter has to be understood. D. Christodoulou and S. Klainerman in their work ""The global nonlinear stability of the Minkowski space"" developed new techniques to investigate those. The PI generalized their work and established the borderline case from the point of view of decay of the data. In a research monograph of 300 pages the PI obtained numerous new results that can be applied to other problems in geometry and analysis. The main method and its developments have recently led to the solution of some of the most challenging problems in mathematical physics. The new project will use new ideas from the PI's recent work and it is expected to yield further new results in general relativity (GR), geometry and PDE analysis.    The educational component of the proposal focuses on disseminating knowledge of mathematics, physics and astrophysics as well as historic background to the public. Aiming at the creation of an exhibit at the Museum of Natural History at the PI's home University combining geometry and analysis with astrophysics, the educational project will include student work at undergraduate and graduate levels. Together with the PI and the museum staff, they will  be involved in teaching at high schools working on the project. At public events organized by the museum the PI will collaborate with the museum staff to present activities to enhance learning. Research results will be presented in a simplified way and adapted to the audience. The project is designed as to reach out to a very broad public including minority groups, families with small kids, schools at all levels and will have an appealing component for everyone. Some of the long-lasting impacts will be new activities for high school classes to teach mathematics by introducing concepts of physics combined with history and art.    <br/><br/>The geometric nature of general relativity singles out geometric analysis to be the perfect research field to answer the many physical questions.  The laws of GR are the Einstein equations, linking the curvature of spacetime to its matter content. Exploring these equations will lead to a better understanding of the universe as a whole and of isolated systems such as galaxies, binary black holes or binary neutron stars. To unravel the complex interplay between geometry, analysis and physics is one of the main goals in GR. This project aims to investigate this beautiful interaction. Along the way, the mathematical tools developed promise to bear fruit in the  analysis of the many structurally similar nonlinear PDEs. Through the educational component, the PI's research will also have direct impact in a broader sense via the afore-mentioned activities. The PI will complement the outreach by attending conferences to communicate her results. She will also make her results available via internet and publications."

This long term research and educational project includes plans for a  new graduate course at the University of Michigan stressing the use of  computers in algebraic geometry, and for a junior level seminar for  majors in mathematics and computer scien ce in which teams of  undergraduate students led by a graduate student learn projective  geometry through self-discovery.  The research begun in this seminar  will be expanded to a full scale research project on computer algebra.  This project will culminate in a conference in which students present  their findings to a broader audience.     Part (IV) addresses the educational and human resources aspects of  thePIs career goals. A program to bring real-life practitioners of  mathematics in business and industry to the undergraduate classroom is  proposed. The objectives are to simultaneously motivate the curriculum  and introduce students to people like themselves who have used  mathematics to create a successful career."

A cornerstone in the analysis is to encode singularities in terms of functions and measures on suitable valuation spaces, that is, sets of valuations on an appropriate ring. In the case of singularities at the origin in the affine plane, the valuation space has the structure of a tree with infinite and dense branching. In more general cases, it is expected to be a building, or projective limit of simplicial complexes. Being fundamental objects in complex analysis, positive closed currents may be approximated by varieties. <br/>As an analogue of Hironaka's theorem, the investigator will study whether every positive closed current admits an approximate resolution of singularities. He will also investigate the corresponding question for dynamical systems defined by holomorphic fixed point germs. Other problems to be addressed are semicontinuity of multiplier ideals and degree growths of iterates of rational maps of projective space.  The investigator will design an undergraduate course and continue his development of a masters course to suit the needs at the University of Michigan (UM). Additionally he will engage middle and high school students in mathematical activities, in particular through a summer camp at the UM.<br/><br/>Singularities play a prominent role throughout mathematics, even when the primary objects of study are regular (smooth) objects. An example of a singularity is that of a curve in the plane that does not look like a line on a small scale, but rather as a cross or cusp, or even more complicated.<br/>It is known that plane singular curves can be viewed as ""shadows"" of nonsingular curves in space. This provides a way of understanding complicated object thorugh simpler ones. Other examples of singularities appear in dynamical systems, when studying the speed at which iterative algorithms converge. Working with students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, the investigator will undertake a unified study of singularities in different branches of mathematics. In addition he will develop a new undergraduate course and continue the redesigning of a graduate course. Finally he will work with K-12 students, in particular by continuing the development of a course in the framework of the Michigan Mathematics and Science Scholars summer program for high school students.<br/>"

These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world, and from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different from those in higher dimensions.  Many of these techniques used to study these phenomena involve combinatorics, the study of discrete structures.  A central goal of this research project is to advance the combinatorial aspects of these techniques with a view towards concrete problems in the field.  Alongside the research component, the PI proposes activities that integrate his research interests with education and training initiatives that reach audiences from the high school level to postdoctoral researchers.  For instance, the PI is actively involved with mathematics enrichment at the high school level through the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics and Mathematical Staircase, Inc.  In the context of these programs and in other mentoring activities, he seeks to inspire the discovery process and aid in the exposition of beautiful mathematics.  A chief outreach activity in the project is a graduate summer school that will showcase several different perspectives on one central theme in low-dimensional topology, Dehn surgery.<br/><br/>Amongst the various techniques that come to bear on low-dimensional topology are graphs of surface intersections, exemplified by the work of Gordon and Luecke, and Heegaard Floer homology, defined and developed by Ozsvth and Szab.  Both techniques have led to sensational progress on the main problems in low-dimensional topology.  The two approaches lend very different perspectives on the subject, and they have complementary strengths and weaknesses.  The surface intersection techniques are more direct and rely on the development of graph theoretic tools in order to draw topological conclusions.  Floer homology methods are less direct but apply heavy machinery to a vast collection of problems. The PI specifically seeks to blend the combinatorial ideas stemming from these techniques and others with a view towards some of the driving problems in low-dimensional topology, spanning topics including the study of knot diagrams, Dehn surgery, and the curve complex."

This project studies invariants arising from algebraic varieties, especially how certain invariants are distributed when considering large families of them. For example, if the invariant is an integer, one may ask how likely the invariant is, say, zero for a ""random"" object. Such results then translate into a better understanding of the solutions of the given polynomial equations. Along with the research proposed, the PI will organize a range of outreach activities, including after-school and weekend activities for school-age girls, workshops for graduate students, and regional workshops for students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The research in this project is at the intersection of algebraic and analytic number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, and focuses on distributions of arithmetic statistics.

But in order to make sound decisions, understanding how large the most severe events are likely to be is imperative. The PI will focus on developing statistical tools for understanding the spatial structure of the most extreme events. These new tools will improve on existing models because they will be both more realistic and more computationally tractable.  The PI will also apply these tools to help scientists and policymakers study risks posed by severe environmental phenomena like inland floods, wildfires, and coastal storm surges. Furthermore, the PI will organize workshops to foster closer integration of statistical and Earth science research, as well as develop graduate courses and a textbook focused on modern statistical methods for Earth science.<br/><br/>The PI will develop stochastic models for extreme events in space that are 1) flexible enough to transition across different classes of extremal dependence, and 2) permit inference through likelihood functions that can be computed for large datasets.  It will accomplish these modeling goals by representing stochastic dependence relationships conditionally, which will induce desirable tail dependence properties and allow efficient inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The first research component will develop sub-asymptotic models for spatial extremes using max-infinitely divisible (max-id) processes, a generalization of the limiting max-stable class of processes, based on a conditional representation.  The second research component will develop sub-asymptotic spatial models for extremes based on scale mixtures of spatial Gaussian processes.  The PI will conduct closely interwoven computational development and theoretical explication of the joint tail dependence that the proposed hierarchically specified max-id and scale mixture processes induce.  Finally, the PI will apply these models to problems of high societal impact, such as extreme precipitation risk, wildfire susceptibility, and coastal storm surge exposure.  The PI will enhance connections between extreme value statisticians and communities of climate and atmospheric scientists, mitigation researchers, and stakeholders, through 1) biannual international workshops on weather and climate extremes, 2)  a Ph.D. level course in spatial statistics which will include new advances and applications of spatial extremes, and 3) writing the textbook Modern Statistics for Earth Scientists.  The PI also will add modules on extremes to Penn State's Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) summer school, and contribute to SCRiM's electronic resources and interactive teaching materials for educators, decision makers, underrepresented groups, and the general public.

This proposal aims to further develop the toolbox of available approaches, through investigating central problems in extremal combinatorics.

The proposed work on Ramsey theory includes specific problems which may lead to the development of new probabilistic approaches, and new connections with the theory around Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma.

Particularly natural spaces to study in topology are the so called smooth manifolds. An example of a smooth manifold is the universe we live in, which we think of as 3-dimensional, but if we include time is actually 4-dimensional. A fundamental question is: what manifold is our universe? A goal of a geometric topologist is to list possibilities and most importantly to develop tools to understand the structure and distinguish the overall topology of manifolds. Low dimensional topology mainly refers to the study of 3-and 4-dimensional manifolds, where the theory of such spaces, in particular in 4-dimension, is significantly more complicated and exhibits many unique phenomena that are not seen in any other dimension. A particularly successful and rich way to understand the topology of manifolds is to introduce certain complex analytic structures on them, such as Stein structures and/or geometric structures, such as symplectic and contact geometries. The PI will study questions and conjectures that sit at the intersection of symplectic/contact topology and smooth manifold topology in low dimensions, and complex geometry. Alongside the research component, this project also includes activities that integrate the PI?s research program with education and training initiatives for student research, at both graduate and undergraduate levels. To that end, the PI will maintain an active topology group at the University of Alabama by organizing seminars, workshops, REUs and conferences. More broadly, the PI will use funds from this award to organize a week-long research and professional development summer workshop for talented undergraduate students from underrepresented colleges in the state of Alabama. He will also initiate a collaborative, multi-dimensional, long-term educational and research program for geometry-topology graduate students and faculty in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools, initially including the University of Alabama, Louisiana State University, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Arkansas.   <br/> <br/>This project involves studying interactions between complex geometry, symplectic geometry and contact geometry, and low dimensional topology with a focus on various notions of convexity. The first long-term research objective will be to consider constraints on the topology of closed 3-manifolds embedded in 4-space from the perspectives of symplectic topology (e.g. contact type hypersurfaces) and complex geometry (e.g. the boundaries of holomorphically/rationally/polynomially convex Stein domains).  Specifically, the PI will work towards a complete resolution of Gompf?s conjecture that predicts no Brieskorn sphere bounds a holomorphically convex domain in complex 2-space, determining the topology of contact type hypersurfaces in 4-space and in complex projective space, and exploring their implications for the exotic nature of smooth 4-manifold topology. The second long-term research objective concerns two outstanding problems dealing with the existence and classification of tight and fillable contact structures on closed, oriented 3-manifolds. The PI?s various joint works provide a framework and new constructions to study the existence question of tight and fillable contact structures from the point of view of Heegaard Floer homology. The PI and his collaborators will investigate to what extent invariants coming from Heegaard Floer homology detect tightness completely. The PI will also work to complete the classification problem for tight structures on small Seifert fibered spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At first glance these words and ideas seem foreign and unrelated to the natural world.  However, pure mathematics is the language of modern physics.  Broadly speaking the main intellectual merit of this proposal is to create new mathematics which will add to the language of physics.  More precisely, the theory of quantum groups associated to Lie algebras is widely and productively used in low-dimensional topology, in particular with the creation of quantum invariants.  Within this context, the PI and his collaborators have given new systematic strategies to define re-normalized quantum invariants arising from non-semi-simple categories.  The focus of this proposal is to describe and explore the geometric and physical meanings of these re-normalized invariants, while concurrently using the unique properties of these invariants to gain new information about well-known problems in low-dimensional topology.   The broader impacts of this proposal can be arranged in two main categories: mentoring and outreach.  The PI will create a mentoring system for the students of the Mathematics Department at Utah State University, with the aim of providing students skills to help them succeed in future academic pursuits.  The outreach component of this grant is to organize a Moab Topology Conference which will allow students and postdocs to attend and present their research, while also interacting with leading experts. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The first main theme of the proposed research is further exploration of the PI's re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev 3-manifold invariants in the context of the Volume Conjecture.

The proposed research will also focus on continuing the PI's creation and study of new Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) arising from re-normalized invariants.  A final theme of the proposed research is to widen the PI's development and inspection of the Levin-Wen models.  He proposes to continue to use known mathematical techniques to interpret physical properties which were not previously detected in the L-W models."

Networks allow us to create mathematically tractable models that preserve important features of the underlying systems and avoid problems associated with high dimensionality and complex geometry. In particular, networks have demonstrated a strong promise as a modeling and analysis tool of complex physical processes such as protein folding, self-assembly of clusters of interacting particles, and walks of molecular motors. The development of computational methods for analysis and construction of complex networks has a potential to advance the understanding of crystal growth and lead to industrial self-assembly based design of structures consisting of interacting particles. The proposed work will help in the scientific development of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students as well as help in the enhancement of the curriculum at the PI's home institution. The project will also make originally developed software through a website for public use. <br/><br/>The proposed research program is concerned with the development of computational tools for analysis and construction of stochastic networks with exponentially small pairwise transition rates. The parameter in the formula for the pairwise transition rates is the absolute temperature in the physical context which is usually small relative to important energetic barriers present in the system under consideration. Typically, networks coming from modeling complex physical systems are large (e.g. a million states), sparse and unstructured, and their pairwise transition rates vary by tens of orders of magnitude. As a result, their analysis is difficult due to their complexity and severe issues associated with the floating point arithmetic. The goal of the research program is the development of computational methods for the following four problems: (1) asymptotic analysis of large stochastic networks (in particular, finding asymptotic estimates for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, extracting quasi-invariant and metastable subsets of states, and building coarse-grained models); (2) finite temperature continuation of specific eigenpairs describing particular transition processes of interest in the considered network; (3) building stochastic networks representing aggregation processes of interacting particles; and (4)finding the quasi-potential, the function quantifying the dynamics of time-irreversible systems driven by small thermal noise and allowing to convert continuous non-gradient systems with multiple attractors to stochastic networks. The analytical components of the proposed research lie in the interface of the Large Deviation theory and the graph theory. The numerical components involve network algorithms, numerical linear algebra, optimization methods, methods for finding saddle points, Monte-Carlo methods, and solvers for the Hamilton-Jacobi type equations."

Current EIDs like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) and antibiotic-resistant superbugs have the potential to make devastating impacts on public health. The methodologies under development in this project can be used to translate real-time data on EIDs into recommendations about where, when, and to whom to apply interventions so as to minimize negative impacts of the disease while reducing overall resource consumption. Furthermore, these recommendations are designed to be immediately interpretable in a subject matter context, thereby empowering decision makers to incorporate information from complex and heterogeneous data streams into disease management. Application of these methodologies has the potential to reduce mortality and morbidity at lower cost than existing management plans. Furthermore, models underpinning intervention recommendations will generate new knowledge about EID dynamics. <br/><br/>This research project aims to make fundamental contributions to online sequential decision making and to create a new statistical framework for data-driven management of EIDs. We conceptualize the EID as spreading across a finite set of locations, which might be physical locations in space or nodes in a network. An allocation strategy formalizes management of an EID and is represented by a sequence of functions, one per intervention decision, that map up-to-date information on an EID to a subset of locations recommended for treatment. An optimal allocation strategy maximizes some mean utility function over the duration of the EID. Construction of an optimal allocation strategy from data on an EID is challenging because: (i) the number of allocations is exponential in the number of locations; (ii) estimation and management must occur simultaneously; (iii) spatial proximity induces causal interference; and (iv) an allocation strategy must be interpretable to subject matter experts. We integrate ideas from statistics, computer science, optimization, and disease ecology to overcome these challenges. We combine simulation-optimization with policy-search algorithms to construct an online estimator of the optimal allocation strategy; this strategy trades off exploring allocation choices that improve estimates of disease dynamics with exploiting current estimated dynamics to immediately slow spread of the EID. We show that the treatment allocation problem can be recast as an infinite-dimensional bandit problem. We leverage this connection to derive estimation algorithms that scale to very large allocation problems and are amenable to theoretical study. We combine our policy-search and bandit-based estimators with a novel class of allocation strategies that can be expressed as a sequence of if-then statements that are immediately interpretable to subject-matter experts and can be readily adjusted based on expert judgment. We derive a non-parametric lower bound on the approximation error of an estimated allocation strategy within this class; this bound is used to perform goodness-of-fit tests for the estimated optimal allocation strategy."

With sufficient data and the appropriate statistical tools, researchers can now hope to recover structures in the data that were once deemed too intricate to identify with traditional ""small"" data.  Extracting complex hidden structures in massive data often requires flexible nonparametric methods; however, there are several fundamental challenges that make existing nonparametric methods impractical or inadequate.  At the core of these challenges is a conflict between two essential aspects in big data analysis: (i) the need for flexible methodology for capturing complex features and (ii) the cost, both computational and statistical, associated with this additional flexibility. Effective resolution of this fundamental conflict requires new paradigms of nonparametric inference. The long-term research objective of this project is to develop inference paradigms, including theory, methods, algorithms, and software, for nonparametric inference and learning that effectively resolve this fundamental conflict.  The research will lead to the development of statistical tools that meet urgent needs for scalable nonparametric data analysis in a wide range of fields, including biology, economics, astrophysics, chemistry, and information technology. The project will address the integration of research with educational activities through teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to students from local colleges.<br/><br/>This project will develop and investigate a particularly promising paradigm, multi-scale divide-and-conquer, to address the fundamental conflict between flexibility and cost.

Beyond addressing these specific objectives, the proposed research will introduce theoretical and computational devices for evaluating and improving the statistical and computational efficiency of multi-scale divide-and-conquer methods in general.

The inclusion of random effects can serve a number of distinct purposes. On one hand, randomness can be used to compensate for elements of a system not fully modeled or for insufficiently resolved scales in the system. This research proposal concentrates on the analysis of how randomness spreads through large dimensional, extended dynamical systems.  One of the central questions is how passing through many nonlinear interactions or scales shapes the randomness. Stochastically forced partial differential equations (SPDEs) such as stochastic fluid equations or stochastically forced reaction diffusion equations will be a focus of the proposed work. These systems are often agitated at one scale and it is of both mathematical and modeling interest to understand the effect of this agitation at other scales. In particular, this proposal hopes to shed light on the transfer of randomness between different scales in turbulent fluid flow. In addition to SPDEs, the proposal will study related questions in large chemical networks arising in cell regulation and nutrient flow in forest environments. The emphasis will be on the pathwise dynamics, novel stochastic numerical methods, and estimation problems.<br/><br/>Quantifying and modeling uncertainty is increasingly important in our attempts to understand and predict our complex and changing world.  From the financial markets, to weather prediction, to environmental engendering, to neuroscience, to aeronautics, models including random influences have become central to the physical sciences, to the social sciences and to engineering.  Of particular significance is understanding how pure randomness is shaped into the structures we observe, especially when the randomness is transferred across disparate spatial scales. This understanding is the key to producing effective models with which to predict complex real systems. This proposal specifically addresses questions central to turbulent water flow and complicated biochemical pathways in cells. More broadly, applied mathematicians are on the leading edge of<br/>our scientific and technological future.  Because of their broad training, they are the best equipped to move into new, non-traditional fields as they appear, build the bridges between classical disciplines, and disseminate the understanding gained in purer mathematical studies to larger scientific and social endeavors.

This proposal includes an undergraduate research component to encourage interested students to choose a science-related career.

Class numbers have been studied for 200 years, but still remain largely mysterious, although precise conjectures have been developed. Seemingly far away on the mathematical spectrum,  Radon transforms quantify the distribution of the ""mass"" of functions along lower-dimensional surfaces; they are a critical part of the theory underlying Computed Tomography medical imaging. The study of Radon transforms is a central area in harmonic analysis with far-reaching connections both to the Carleson operator, which was instrumental in answering a historic question on Fourier series, and to the new world of discrete arithmetic operators, which blends harmonic analysis with number theory. This project, which is at the intersection of number theory and harmonic analysis, explores and connects all of these themes. During the course of the work, the project will contribute to the mathematical community through training postdocs, a graduate summer school, and mathematical outreach activities for children.<br/><br/>The major aims of this research center on five projects at the intersection of number theory and harmonic analysis. First, new bounds relating to the divisibility of class numbers of number fields of arbitrary degree will be obtained. Second, new bounds will be obtained for short character sums, which historically provided an important subconvexity result for L-functions, and now in a multi-dimensional setting have the potential to impact problems involving counting integral solutions to Diophantine equations. Third, in the realm of Diophantine equations, new variations on the circle method, and closely related questions on multi-dimensional oscillatory integrals, will be developed. Fourth, new results for discrete operators will be proved by adapting number-theoretic methods to the setting of harmonic analysis. Finally, a systematic investigation of Carleson operators with polynomial phases and Radon-type behavior will be carried out."

The causal inference literature has heralded the role of randomization in getting answers to such ?what if?? questions, treating randomized controlled experiments as a gold standard for testing simple causal hypotheses. However, hidden behind this powerful tool are a series of assumptions and design decisions that are difficult to control for and are untenable in the context of complex and changing social processes. The PI will develop novel theory and methodology that will directly address the role of these social processes in causal inference. The new tools can be used across disciplines to study interventions whenever social processes are present such as in the study of important societal questions relating to vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions, implications of different education policies and the like. The PI's education plan integrates the research products from this project into courses that will engage students from a wide range of academic backgrounds, presenting and linking the methodological contributions to substantive applications. Research products will be widely disseminated to the scientific community and the general public through popular and scientific publications, presentations, and open-source software.<br/><br/>This project addresses the nascent areas of causal inference in the presence of network information and text data. While much of the work in these areas has concentrated on the analysis of existing experimental designs, little work has gone into designing experiments specifically for such complex social processes. The research will demonstrate the inadequacy of classical designs and the importance of developing specialized experimental designs that adapt to underlying complex social processes. For network and text data, the PI will provide a comprehensive framework for defining causal quantities of interest that exploit the structure in such data. The PI will work on three main thrusts: (1) Conditional design in the presence of network information: this thrust will develop restricted randomizations to target the testing and estimation of peer effects, total effects and other network quantities; (2) Unconditional design where the experimenter can control the social process: this thrust will draw on results from graph sampling to develop experimental designs that simultaneously design an interaction graph (that can represent how study participants will be allowed to interact) and a treatment allocation; and (3) Text as a social process: this thrust will provide guidance and tools for extracting causal quantities from text data that can play the role of treatment, outcome, confounder or mediator in a causal analysis.

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in tale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

A related goal is studying the smooth topology of low-dimensional objects (e.g., knots and three- and four-manifolds) via the Symplectic Field Theory of cotangent bundles. The Principal Investigator has previously used this strategy to introduce a knot invariant called knot contact homology, which has partially understood connections to string topology. This project will develop the theory of knot contact homology by studying its generalization in Symplectic Field Theory and extending it to invariants of low-dimensional manifolds. Possible applications include relations to similar homological invariants such as Heegaard Floer homology and Khovanov homology, and new approaches to problems in low-dimensional topology such as knot concordance and distinguishing smooth structures on manifolds.<br/><br/>Low-dimensional topology, or the study of shapes in three and four dimensions, is a classical subject of paramount importance in mathematics and of natural interest to other sciences, especially physics.

Much of this progress has involved the study of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds, which has close ties to string theory in physics. The Principal Investigator will use his past work on holomorphic curves within the framework of Symplectic Field Theory to develop new invariants of topological structures such as knots and three-dimensional spaces. This will likely have interesting applications to low-dimensional topology, including a long-term goal to resolve the still-unsolved smooth four-dimensional Poincare conjecture using symplectic techniques.

Clyde  Institution: Duke University  Project: Mode Uncertainty, Model Selection, and Robustness, with   Applications in Environmental Sciences    Abstract:    Finding models to describe data and relationships among  variables is a fundamental problem in statistics and science. Linear   regression and its generalizations are some of the most commonly used   statistical methods for data analysis.  As scientists collect   increasingly larger data sets, the fear of over-fitting the data by   using all measured covariates leads to the standard approach of  selecting a single ``best'' model based on a subset of the  covariates, and then proceeding with scientific inferences and  predictions as if that were the true model.  This typical analysis  ignores the uncertainty about which variables should be included in  the model, potentially leading to overconfident inferences.  Model  uncertainty often significantly outweighs other sources of  uncertainty in problems, but is generally ignored in standard  statistical practice and teaching.    This research focuses on Bayesian methods for incorporating model  uncertainty into data analysis and decision making.  In Bayesian  model averaging, predictions and inferences are based on a set of  models rather than a single model; each model contributes  proportionally to the support it receives from the observed data.  Novel methods of identifying promising models for use in Bayesian  model averaging are studied.  These can increase the applicability  of Bayesian methods to realistic problems that involve a large  number of variables.  One of the major applications of the  research is to estimate the effect of particulate matter on  mortality in the elderly population and assess the potential  impact of the EPA's new National Ambient Air Quality Standards  for particulates.  This and other case studies will be used to  develop a new course in modern Baye sian statistical methods for  environmental and biological science students at Duke University."

Funding for this project will help to develop an interest and talent in mathematics among high school students, both local and throughout Indiana.

Four projects are proposed relating dynamics in several complex variables to Thurston theory, the Ising model from statistical physics, the spectra of certain operators arising from self-similar group actions, and complex time ordinary differential equations (the Painleve equations). The proposed research projects are designed around three principles: (1) exploring connections between two or more different areas of mathematics can lead to surprising new results, (2) dynamical systems having an additional context from another field can be studied significantly more deeply, and (3) a study of concrete examples often leads to statements and proofs of more general theorems.  Partnered with the main research goals are several educational goals: (1) leading local high school students on specially tailored research projects, (2) helping to run and improve the Indiana University-Purdue University High School Math Contest, (3) leading Ph.D. students on the main research projects mentioned above, and (4) organizing two workshops on dynamics in several complex variables which have a training component for Ph.D. students."

The second type of stochastic dynamics which the PI will study has to do with stochastic interacting particle systems.  Specific systems to be studied involve random motion, growth, and selection, as in models of evolution, population genetics, adaptive dynamics. The PI will study continuum limits and large-time limits for such systems. In particular, this will illuminate new relations between interacting particle systems and continuum free boundary problems.<br/><br/><br/>When viewed at a certain scale, many physical and biological systems seem to behave randomly or are influenced by small random fluctuations. Mathematical models of such systems involve probability theory.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to use these mathematical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over a long period of time or over a large spatial region.  Therefore, a fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how random dynamics or interactions at one spatial or temporal scale influence a system at another spatial or temporal scale. This research project develops mathematical tools for predicting and describing the macroscopic behavior of certain systems which behave randomly at a microscopic level.  The specific systems to be studied are motivated by problems in chemistry and by models of biological evolution. One common feature in these systems is the appearance of random, perhaps rare, transitions: a chemical reaction occurs or a cell produces a mutation. The educational component of the project includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of probability, analysis, and applications, preparing them for careers in STEM-related disciplines."

The considered problems are nonlinear variational<br/>or partial differential equations, and the degeneracy in question<br/>can take various forms: loss of dimension, loss of regularity, or<br/>unboundedness.  The first set of questions relates to the<br/>mathematical theory of nonlinear elasticity, which studies large<br/>mechanical deformations of three-dimensional elastic bodies.  The<br/>investigator undertakes a long-term research program, with the<br/>scope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell theories through the<br/>methods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their connections<br/>with the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the<br/>(infinitesimal) isometries of surfaces and the effects of<br/>rigidity on the derived theories, studying nonlinear phenomena<br/>such as buckling and blistering for a given shell under<br/>compression (one application is related to plant growth).  The<br/>second set of questions in this project relates to fluid<br/>dynamics.  Boundary irregularities of various structures and<br/>scales are considered in the limit when the boundary behavior<br/>becomes degenerate.  Other problems concern traveling fronts in<br/>combustion in unbounded channels, and the dynamics of solutions<br/>with large initial data under the Navier boundary conditions in<br/>thin three-dimensional shells. <br/><br/>     Because elastic thin (or otherwise ""degenerate"") objects of<br/>various geometries are ubiquitous in the physical world, the<br/>precise understanding of laws governing their equilibria has many<br/>potential applications.

A related long-standing<br/>problem in the mathematical theory of elasticity is to rigorously<br/>predict theories of such lower-dimensional objects starting from<br/>the nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.  For<br/>plates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification<br/>of a hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of<br/>the applied forces and resulting in stretching, crumpling,<br/>bending, or a combination of these.

Many of the most classical algorithms, and particularly those with applications in linear algebra, have been extremely useful for decades, if not centuries. Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail catastrophically, but rarely do. In other words, the worst-case behavior is poor, but the average-case behavior is good. This research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding field of random matrix theory (RMT). In turn, this research gives rise to new questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive educational component that integrates research and education. This integration is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student mentoring.<br/><br/>Two natural ways to employ RMT within numerical linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found great utility in the big-data age. This research will employ both of these themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.

Examples in humans include wound healing, tissue development, tumor growth, and some bioengineered diagnostic tools. Experiments have shown that molecules in cell-cell interfaces experience forces (squeezing, pulling) and that these forces influence cell behavior and cellular decision-making. One important example is offered by immune cells, which must attach to the surface of other cells in order to decipher information about disease. Their nanometer size and inaccessible geometry make cell-cell interfaces challenging to explore experimentally. The investigator will develop mathematical equations that predict forces on molecules at cell-cell interfaces, using immune cells as a prototype. Results will have direct implications for understanding immune function, impacting research on autoimmune disease and immunotherapy. Additionally, these mathematical models can be readily generalized to abstract, generic cell-cell interfaces, thereby highlighting the biophysical similarities between  biologically disparate systems to help understand the general principles of the cellular tactile sense. In coordination with his research goals, the investigator has an educational goal of using cell mechanics (i.e., forces in cells) as a venue to teach mathematics, biology and physics with tangible, accessible examples to audiences in K-12, undergraduate, graduate and general public education. Unlike cell biology based on biochemistry or genetics, many cell-mechanical phenomena have direct analogies with everyday life that are useful in establishing a three-way correspondence between cell phenomena, everyday intuition of mechanical forces, and their mathematical representation.<br/><br/>Of many ways in which cells interact, an increasingly recognized interaction is through the establishment of transient, dynamic cell-cell interfaces. The investigator will develop mathematical models of cell-cell interfaces to describe and predict mechanical forces and their influence on cell signaling. The dynamics at cell-cell interfaces involve an interplay between transport, mechanics and chemical kinetics, and play out over a range of length- and time-scales, necessitating a combination of mathematical techniques: Coupled systems of elliptic, parabolic and stochastic differential equations; computational fluid dynamics of fluid-structure interactions including thermal fluctuations in 3D; Brownian dynamics; and Bayesian statistics to leverage quantitative experimental data from the investigator's collaborators. Specific aims of the investigator through this research are to: (1) Understand how cells overcome and exploit the physical constraints to cell-cell contact, by developing a model that integrates motion of the intracellular and extracellular fluid, Brownian motion of molecules embedded in the cells' membranes, and active forces. (2) Explore the mechanism and evolutionary advantages of molecular clustering at interfaces to address the large class of molecules that aggregate into clusters containing tens to hundreds of molecules.  (3) develop, validate and use mesoscale models of large flexible biomolecules to decipher their mechanical properties and biological role. In mesoscale models, individual molecules are represented as combinations of rigid bodies such as rods, spheres and semi-flexible joints undergoing Langevin dynamics. The biological novelty lies in new hypotheses that will emerge from the models, including the hypothesis that within-cluster load sharing can allow for nontrivial kinetics, such as co-operativity, multi-stability and ultra-sensitivity - regulatory modules that have classically been assumed to arise from biochemical reaction networks. The mesoscale models will allow us to access timescales that all-atom molecular dynamics cannot, while capturing details that particle-based simulations miss.

The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.  We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory.  Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.

Some proposed problems have significant connections with the Aubry-Mather theory and weak KAM theory, which are important for understanding nonintegrable dynamical systems.  So far there are very few rigorous analytical results on turbulent flame speeds in flows of more than two dimensions. A long-term goal of this project is to understand how chaotic structures in three-dimensional flows (e.g., the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow) affect turbulent flame speeds. <br/><br/>Turbulent combustion plays the main role in important industrial issues such as energy production and engine design. The so-called G-equation and its variants are popular models in turbulent combustion due to their simplicity, efficiency, and robustness in fitting experiments. All the research components of the project are closely related to one of the most important unsolved problems in turbulent combustion; namely, to predict the turbulent flame speed and, in particular, to understand how it depends on the turbulence intensity (e.g., think of the relation between the spreading velocity of a wild fire and the strength of the wind). A very important part of the project is its educational component. Besides supervision of graduate students, the principal investigator also plans to participate in several well-established educational programs at UC-Irvine, ranging from the K-12 to the undergraduate levels: California MathCounts, a 6-8th grade math competition; the Irvine Area Math Modelers (IAMM), which is a training program that prepares local high school students for the National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling (HiMCM)); the SURF program, which is an undergraduate summer research program; the  Freshman Seminar Program, which provides introductory lectures on research to undergraduate students at UC-Irvine. The project will generate broad impact on combustion science and engineering, with implications for clean energy, as well as further the education of the next generation of STEM scientists."

These benefits occur through interactions of each individual with the flows produced by others and may take the form of energy savings or speed enhancement. Also to be explored are more subtle aspects of flow interactions such as maintaining or holding together a group, preventing collisions, establishing natural formations or patterns of individuals, and communication through motions that spread across the group. The research work will combine mathematical descriptions of the motions of individuals and the surrounding fluid (water or air), laboratory experiments on ""robotic flocks"" of motorized swimmers or flyers, and the analysis of video footage of birds flying in formations. The different approaches will allow for a complete understanding of the fluid-dynamical interactions in a group as well as insights into how animals exploit or modify such mechanisms. The work thus stands to clarify the role of flows in animal groups and in so doing also suggest how such effects can be exploited in applications such as flow energy harvesting and efficient propulsion. Additionally, education and outreach programs will train high school students, university undergraduate and graduate students in STEM research and especially the important role of mathematics in the natural and engineering sciences.<br/><br/>Specifically, physical experiments on mechanical swimmers, flow-locomotor interaction models and simulations, and crowd-sourced biological data will be combined interactively and applied towards understanding formation swimming and flying. Research will start with the detailed interrogation of few-body systems in order to cross-validate all approaches and to understand fundamental mechanisms. Experiments and simulations will inform models based on vortex-body interactions, and comparison against biological measurements will inform behavioral models in the context of formation flight of birds. Many-body systems of in-line arrays will then be studied, with all methods used to understand principles, for example through analogies to conventional states of matter, in which aspects such as group cohesion, crystallization or other patterning, dynamical instabilities, and information transfer will be explored. Biologically-relevant issues including self-organization and collective advantages will also be studied, and structural and dynamical metrics will be established and tested. The educational effort will include a graduate course on the constructive interaction of experiment with math modeling and a summer research camp that will engage underprivileged NYC high school students in STEM research. Students at all levels will be recruited from courses to become directly involved in research, and the wider public will be engaged as citizen-scientists through crowd-sourcing campaigns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PAD is caused by a blockage (often due to atherosclerosis) of a major systemic artery such as the femoral artery that supplies blood to the leg.  Due to reduced blood and oxygen delivery to their calf and foot, PAD patients often develop pain when walking that progresses to pain at rest and eventual tissue loss, requiring surgical grafts or, in severe cases, amputation.  In addition to lost productivity and reduced quality of life for patients, the annual health care costs for PAD are estimated to be 160-300 billion dollars.  Currently, only two medications have been approved by the FDA for treating PAD-associated walking impairment, and both treatments are minimally effective.  The lack of sufficient data and understanding of the impact of different blood vessel adaptations on restoring normal blood flow following an occlusion motivates this research work.  A combined theoretical and experimental model will be used to design more optimal experiments, provide a mechanism for understanding the significance of adaptations to arterial occlusion within distinct vascular segments, and assist in designing more successful PAD therapies.<br/><br/>After a major arterial occlusion there is an immediate drop in flow, followed by a short (minutes), steep flow increase and then a gradual (hours to days) flow increase. However, the ability of the vasculature to regulate flow is significantly altered following a major occlusion, preventing full restoration of normal perfusion.  Vascular adaptations such as new vessel formation (angiogenesis) and existing vessel growth (arteriogenesis) have been observed to occur in response to a major arterial occlusion, but the relative roles and timing of each adaptation are unclear, making it difficult to extrapolate an optimal strategy for blood flow compensation.  In this project, a mathematical model will be developed to predict how short- (acute) and long-term (chronic) vascular adaptations impact flow after a major arterial occlusion.  The work will use a multi-scale differential equation model to couple the dynamics of the acute and chronic time scales and to assess the effects of hemodynamic and metabolic stimuli on the collateral and distal microvasculature following an occlusion.  Experimental data from the mouse hindlimb will be used to optimize model parameters.  To date, no theoretical model has been able to capture both the short and long term dynamics of flow following a major arterial occlusion based on mechanical factors affecting vessel diameter and number.  Such work will truly transform the current understanding of peripheral arterial disease by pinpointing the correct targets and timing for therapeutic agents that will help to restore normal perfusion in PAD patients.  The project also provides direct exposure of this interdisciplinary research work to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, thereby promoting the study of STEM disciplines among future generations and enhancing the scientific culture of our nation."

The project explores the computational modeling of fluid-solid interactions from suspensions phenomena obeying simple rules between interacting solids, to flows where key features can be effectively approximated by distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) techniques.  In studying suspensions, the ""sort-and-sweep"" simulation method developed by the PI will be employed and extended to investigate sedimentation instabilities, including some analogous to classic fluid instabilities (e.g., the Rayleigh-Taylor heavy-over-light instability) and others that appear to be special to suspensions (e.g., in electrophoretic levitation and breakup of particle-laden drops).  A main goal is testing macroscopic models of sedimentation processes. Model DLM calculations will be extended to explore important hydrodynamic phenomena at the scale of interaction between small numbers of rigid, jointed, or deformable solids, including investigation of natural and artificial modes of propulsion in liquids at small but non-zero Reynolds numbers.  Research and mentoring activities are bridged in this project through Research Experiences for Undergraduates in networks science, including tools for identifying hierarchical community structures and the application of such tools to novel datasets, including the potential of investigating effective networks of hydrodynamically-interacting components.  The project also includes extensive curriculum development aimed at optimizing the set of mathematical tools covered in courses for undergraduate students majoring in biology and the health sciences.<br/><br/>Continuing advances in capabilities for developing micro- and nano-systems and machines lead to design questions about fluid dynamics at small scales that must be addressed with different tools than those used at large scales.  At small scales viscosity plays an increased role (an air pump doesn't do a good job pumping more viscous maple syrup), and external boundary conditions become more important (the walls of blood vessels).  Also important are interactions between solids and the complex viscoelastic fluids in which they are suspended, a common occurrence in biological situations.  Developing computational tools for more efficiently and effectively handling such interactions is a goal.  Other fundamental fluid-dynamic phenomena are further investigated, both for their own importance and for the validation of the proposed computational approaches to these regimes.  For instance, the investigation of general questions about propulsion of small-scale objects through liquids leads to computational techniques that can be used to study scenarios of potential biological and medical importance.<br/>"

Structure-preserving methods, which provide numerical solutions that preserve a certain continuum property of the underlying models exactly, are recently demonstrated to be more efficient with limited computational resources.

The objective of this project is to establish a detailed study of novel high-order structure-preserving methods for the linear and nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws arising in various applications, and to educate students at various levels about the potential and challenges of utilizing numerical simulation to solve important practical problems.

Specifically, this project intends to achieve the following three objectives: (i) Identify optimal designs for GLMs under non-homogeneous subjects. In this study, optimal designs are derived for models in which the subjects are divided into two or more groups using one or more factors, allowing the intercept or slope to vary from one group to another. Random subject effects can also be allowed for differences among subjects within groups. (ii) Identify optimal designs for GLMs with multiple covariates. There are very few optimality results for GLMs with more than one covariate. The PI will study optimal designs for GLMs when multiple covariates exist. These models can also account for subject heterogeneity. (iii) Identify optimal designs for some other nonlinear models. In nonlinear models, most optimal results were derived under D-optimality for all parameters. The PI will investigate a general approach to identify optimal designs for nonlinear models with three or more parameters under commonly used optimality criteria when all or some of the parameters are of interest. The proposed research will have a tremendous impact because it will fill several gaps in the literature: the models in the proposed research accommodate heterogeneity among subjects and multiple covariates; general solutions for optimal designs of nonlinear models with three parameters will be provided. The technique in the proposed research is innovative in that it yields very general results that go beyond solving problems on a case-by-case basis. It helps to identify the support of locally optimal designs for many of the commonly studied models and can be applied for all the common optimality criteria based on information matrices. It works both with a constrained and unconstrained design region. Furthermore, it can be applied to multistage experiments, where an initial experiment may be used to provide a better idea of the unknown parameters.<br/> <br/>GLMs and other nonlinear models have been used in a wide range of social and natural science fields, such as biological sciences, pharmaceutical research, agricultural science, economics, marketing, etc. The results of this study will have a deep impact on the application of GLMs in these fields. For example, when the findings are applied to the design of clinical trials during new drug discovery and development, they will significantly reduce the time, money, and number of patients needed in these trials. In fact, this research can help the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to improve its guidelines for clinical trials. To effectively disseminate the results of this research, the PI will develop a user-friendly software package targeting non-expert users. To successfully integrate research and education, the PI will develop advanced experimental design courses at the University of Missouri-Columbia incorporating findings of this project. Graduate students will be trained to study optimal designs in the new fields, under the PI?s guidance.

Important examples include the Einstein equations of general relativity (which form the basis of modern cosmology), the Euler equations of fluid mechanics, the equations of elasticity, and the equations of crystal optics. Despite hundreds of years of mathematical progress, major gaps remain in our understanding of solutions. For example, although it is expected that solutions often ""become infinite"" there are few cases in which mathematicians have found a proof. Moreover, in other contexts, it is not even known if the equations have solutions. Thus, we still do not have a definitive understanding of the physical predictions of many equations of classical physics. The main obstacle is that the aforementioned equations are extremely difficult to study except under unrealistic simplifying assumptions. However, there have been some recent advancements in resolving some of these difficulties. For example, recent results provide a detailed description of Big Bang formation in solutions to the Einstein equations and shocks in solutions to the Euler and related equations. A major goal of this project is to extend these results to apply to other physically relevant equations and regimes. This work will provide new insight on the long-time behavior of waves and on the ways in which various physical theories can break down. <br/><br/>This research project involves the rigorous study of quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs and has three main research goals. The first is to provide a detailed description of singularity formation in various quasilinear wave-like equations of physical significance, with an emphasis on avoiding symmetry assumptions whenever possible. Examples include various Einstein-matter equations, the Euler equations, and the equations of elasticity. This research will expand our understanding of singularity formation by enlarging the class of equations and the class of initial conditions that are known to lead to blow-up. The second research goal is to prove local well-posedness for a class of physically relevant quasilinear hyperbolic problems with a free boundary along which the hyperbolicity of the equations degenerates. The third is to develop new tools for understanding the behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs with multiple characteristics in contexts where knowledge of the precise characteristics is essential. An ultimate goal is to use these tools to prove that for such equations, under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearities and data, shock formation occurs and is stable.  This proposal has several educational components that are intimately connected to the research problems. Many of the problems have components that can be investigated by advanced undergraduates, and the PI plans to supervise undergraduate research projects. There are also components suitable for PhD students. Moreover, the PI is organizing, with three co-organizers, a pair of summer schools targeted at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students from across the US and beyond. The PI will also develop curriculum materials that will be made freely available to the public online."

The goal of this project is to advance the efficiency and fidelity of local time-stepping algorithms for multiscale multiphysics systems with application to multi-resolution simulations of large-scale geophysical flows. The developed algorithms will efficiently capture the wide range of scales in both space and time to produce accurate and robust simulations of these systems over a long period of time. The research plan is closely integrated with the educational activities of the project which include (i) developing curricular modules in computational mathematics at the Auburn University Summer Science Institute, an educational enrichment program for high school students, to provide young students early exposure to applied mathematics and inspire them to pursue a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); and (ii) providing interdisciplinary applied mathematics education and research training for both undergraduate and graduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Technically, the Principal Investigator will develop accurate and effective hybrid local time-stepping algorithms based on nonoverlapping domain decomposition: on the one hand, explicit schemes with local time steps are used to model processes at small time scales without suffering a severe restriction on the time step size dictated by the global CFL condition. On the other hand, localized exponential time integrators are employed to enable large time step sizes for processes occurring at slow speeds, and to accelerate the computation of matrix exponentials and their products by performing these calculations locally and in parallel. Three main research objectives will be pursued: (i) development and analysis of nonoverlapping localized exponential time differencing methods for stiff nonlinear equations; (ii) study of hybrid local time-stepping algorithms for various heterogeneous problems; and (iii) application of these algorithms to the three-dimensional primitive equations for modeling ocean/atmosphere circulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The computational tool and the methodology developed in this project can also be used efficiently in a wide range of physical and biological problems. For the educational component, this project will provide an excellent research and outreach platform for promoting female and under-represented groups in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields in a range of educational levels from middle school to young researchers post graduate school.

Specifically, the computational domain is composed of three subregions: the fluid (blood) simulated as incompressible Newtonian flow, the fracture thin structure (damaged heart valves) modeled by the nonlocal peridynamic shell theory, and the thin structure (undamaged heart valves and aortic walls) described by a classical hyperelastic shell model. These three subregions will be numerically coupled to each other with proper interface boundary conditions. Novel constitutive models and corresponding numerical schemes will be developed, and new local-nonlocal coupling strategies will also be designed.

Many celebrated results in logic from the first half of the 20th century concerned the existence of objects considered wild. Gdel's proof of the undecidability of arithmetic established that this structure is complicated (or wild) from a logical viewpoint. Such results are negative in spirit as they point to the limitations of mathematical reasoning. However, in the second half of the last century the focus changed. Model theorists found a vast number of tame mathematical structures that exhibit no such wildness, and for often very different reasons are amenable to model-theoretic methods. This program of identifying and analyzing tame classes of structures whose model theory can be understood came to be known as the geography of tame mathematics, and in its various forms has dominated model theory throughout the last thirty years. Although arising as a program of foundational importance, it has led to striking applications of model theory to other areas of mathematics, most recently to the Andr-Oort conjecture in number theory. Since this program is to explore areas of tame mathematics, these connections are not coincidental at all. The development of such interactions has proven again and again to have far reaching applications outside of logic that could not have been envisioned beforehand.<br/><br/>This project continues this line of research in the setting of expansions of the real line. It aims to settle important open questions within model theory, but also naturally develops new connections between model theory and other areas in logic such as neostability and descriptive set theory, and outside of logic such as geometric measure theory and geometric group theory. The investigator will lead a large scale investigation of dividing lines between tame and wild behavior arising in the study of the geometry of definable sets in ordered structures. Building on early advances, the investigator will determine far reaching consequences of various logical tameness conditions on the topological and metric tameness of definable sets. Furthermore, the project comprises new challenges in the classification of classes of structures considered tame. The educational component of this CAREER grant ties together the investigator's research with his teaching and outreach efforts. This project involves undergraduate and graduate students and young researchers in the investigator's research program, strengthens the ties between model theory and other branches of mathematics, and continues the investigator's outreach efforts in the Urbana-Champaign area."

This research will extend the scope of these high-dimensional inferential methods, which currently remain restricted to more stylized statistical models, to address a broader range of scientific problems having complex latent structure.

The first focuses on K3 surfaces: building on earlier work of the PI and his collaborators, and with a view towards arithmetic applications, the PI will pursue systematic, conceptual and practical methods to explicitly construct unramified Azumaya algebras representing transcendental Brauer classes on K3 surfaces. The second project focuses on del Pezzo surfaces:  proving new cases of a conjecture of Colliot-Thlne and Sansuc that Brauer-Manin obstructions suffice to explain failures on local-to-global phenomena for del Pezzo surfaces, efficient computation of these obstructions on low-degree surfaces, and statistics on failures of the Hasse principle.<br/><br/>An overarching theme in arithmetic geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations in many variables, with the constraint that the coordinates of the solutions be rational numbers or integers (for example, 11/17, or -9). When no such solutions exist, one tries to understand the phenomena behind the absence of solutions. The geometry associated to a system of polynomials bears on the possible obstructions to the existence of solutions, and this project seeks to make such an intuition precise in some cases when a system of polynomial equations defines a surface. Although this project studies fundamental questions from a theoretical point of view, the structure of solutions to certain kinds of polynomial equations has well-documented applications (for example, in establishing secure protocols for the transmission of information between two parties that have never met). In addition to research activities, the PI will run a two-week program each summer for the duration of the grant. The goal of the program is to foster enrollment and persistence rates in STEM majors at the college level. The target demographic consists of rising 8th and 9th graders from the Houston Independent School District, including students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

The task of extracting useful information from such data sets typically leads to solving a large-scale optimization problem.  The sheer size of such problems poses great challenges for optimization specialists.  The investigator aims to advance the reach of large-scale optimization in such settings, with vital applications throughout science and engineering.  The resulting methodology and algorithms create a systematic approach to discover trends and phenomena underlying the observed data, and lead to a well-grounded mechanism for making predictions about unobserved data.  The project lies firmly at the interface between theory and computation.  Therefore, an effective mix of numerical experimentation, teaching, and discovery is central to the proposal.  Graduate students participate in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     The investigator's strategy rests on three interrelated pillars: structure, computational complexity, and conditioning in nonsmooth optimization.  Efficiency of numerical methods is best judged through rigorous rates of convergence.  Convergence guarantees of an algorithm become much more potent, however, if they match best possible guarantees that any algorithm can have within the problem class.  The search for such ""optimal methods"" underpins computational complexity.  Measures of the problem's conditioning -- an indication of its difficulty -- play a central role in the subject and are intimately tied to stability of the underlying problem.  The theory and algorithms, moreover, benefit greatly from exploiting rich underlying structure prevalent in applications, such as separation of smooth and simple nonsmooth functional components, smooth conjugate representations, saddle-point reformulations, etc.  Convex optimization techniques and variational analytic insight guide the investigator's approach.  Pervasive large-scale problems in data science and engineering can directly benefit from this work.  The project integrates research and teaching in all aspects.

These methods are particularly advantageous in the presence of uncertainty originating from measurement errors or randomness inherent to the data collection process itself. The principal investigator (PI) will pursue a research program to develop statistical and machine learning methods possessing two important characteristics, robustness and efficiency. Robust algorithms are characterized by their ability to perform well even when some of the data are not accurate and clean but instead are ""outliers,"" such as completely irrelevant or grossly corrupted measurements. Robust techniques can help to reduce the amount of resources spent on human-supervised data cleaning and preprocessing. On the other hand, methods that are efficient are able to extract most of the useful information contained in the data, therefore reducing the amount of uncertainty in the data-guided decision. This research program will be integrated with educational activities that, among other things, will expose undergraduate and graduate students to cutting edge approaches in statistics and machine learning, and give students an opportunity to serve as individual tutors and mentors at local K-12 schools.<br/><br/>One part of the research program is devoted to investigation of the connections between self-normalized sums and robust statistical techniques. In particular, the PI will demonstrate that, unlike many existing approaches, algorithms based on the self-normalized sums often give rise to efficient methods, for instance in the context of univariate and multivariate mean estimation. Analysis of such algorithms is closely related to the theory self-normalized processes. Another part of the research focuses on the asymptotic properties of U-statistics of growing order, and the implications of these properties for robust and efficient empirical risk minimization (ERM), one of the key principles underlying modern mathematical statistics and machine learning algorithms. The PI will introduce a new approach to robust ERM and will relate questions about efficiency of resulting algorithms to purely mathematical questions in the theory of U-statistics. Finally, the research will address uncertainly quantification in robust statistics using Bayesian methods. Specifically, the PI aims to develop new robust analogues of the standard posterior distribution based on U-statistics of growing order, and will investigate the asymptotic behavior of these robust posteriors as well as the asymptotic frequentist properties of the corresponding credible sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the Continuum Hypothesis (that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers) is independent of the standard axioms, as shown in 1963 by Paul Cohen through the breakthrough method of forcing.  Since then, a longstanding project in set theory has been to use forcing for relative consistency results and to study strengthening of the ZFC axioms. This constitutes the broad motivation of the project: What is possible in strengthening of ZFC, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC itself? The educational component of the project features organizing two workshops and support for undergraduate and graduate student research.<br/><br/>The main candidates for ZFC strengthenings are large cardinal axioms and strong forcing axioms.  Forcing over a model with large cardinals is also the most powerful tool for showing consistency results. Combinatorial principles, especially at singular cardinals are used to understand both the nature of these extensions, and how much we can do with forcing and large cardinals. Jensen's square, Shelah's approachability property are ""anti-compactness"" type principles that hold in models that sufficiently resemble L. In contrast, the tree property is a reflection property that resembles large cardinal properties, but can hold at successor cardinals. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with the singular cardinal hypothesis and Shelah's PCF theory. The latter is mostly decided in ZFC, and provides certain ""canonical invariants,"" against which one can test new axioms."

Stochastic differential games are optimal decision problems involving several players in interaction, acting in a random, uncertain environment. In such games players try either individually or collectively to optimize a given objective, while their decisions influence that of their peers. This type of game is widespread around us. For instance, in financial economics when considering the systemic risk of default by a large number of banks engaged in inter-bank borrowing and lending, in urban planning when modeling commuters trying to find the shortest path while avoiding congestions, or in epidemiology when all members of a society come together to reduce the spread of a virus. Several examples can also be found in biology, economics, and engineering. When the size of the population becomes large, (stochastic) differential games become notoriously intractable, and cause serious analytical and computational challenges. A basic mathematical heuristic suggests that when the size of the population is sufficiently large, it suffices to analyze the behavior of a ""typical"" or average player that represents the entire population. The goal of the proposed project is to develop mathematical techniques allowing one to make this heuristic rigorous and to understand its scope and consequences as they relate to computational issues and applications in the financial modeling of bubble formation and investment among competitive agents. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this work. An extensive outreach program helping to increase the participation of minorities in engineering graduate school will be established.<br/><br/>The present research project will lay down a rigorous and systematic framework for understanding the mean field game limit in stochastic differential games by purely probabilistic arguments, while explaining the physical (thermodynamic) intuition at the root of the theory. As the main tool to achieve its objectives, this project will introduce and analyze a new form of propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems evolving backward in time, and functional inequalities in this setting. This novel approach will have interesting consequences as it will allow to provide both large deviation principles and non-asymptotic convergence rates to the mean field limit for competitive as well as cooperative games. We will also consider the consequences of these results as they relate to numerical simulations and applications in quantitative financial modeling. The proposed research endeavor will not only advance the currently active area of mean field games but will be of great interest in the study of interacting particle systems in general. We foresee that backward propagation of chaos and the techniques used to analyze convergence of empirical processes will find numerous applications. For instance, we will employ such techniques to analyze (large scale) optimal transportation problems, and to the estimation of financial risk measures. In fact, we will develop model?free, fully data-driven approaches for the estimation of general convex risk measures based on empirical process theory and propagation of chaos.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our primary goal is to understand the nature of these waves and structures in the presence of disturbances.  The overarching question is: will a given wave or structure persist when it is disturbed, or will it instead bifurcate into something else?  Our aim is to develop quantitative mathematical tools to aid in the exploration of these phenomena, particularly methods that will be of practical use in engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and manufacturing.  The majority of the direct costs in this program go to funding graduate student research as part of a larger vertically integrated interdisciplinary mentoring program seeded by NSF Grant No. 0639328.  Under the investigator's supervision, graduate students conduct their own research, while also assisting in the mentoring of undergraduate researchers in our program.  This gives the undergraduates more opportunities for help and guidance, while also giving the graduate students a chance to reinforce their understanding by teaching, and also to develop leadership skills.  The goal of this model is to produce a strong and vibrant pipeline of young scholars in the mathematical sciences who will be well equipped to meet the challenges of a globally competitive scientific workforce."

This project will provide mathematicians, physicists, and other scientists invested in quantum science with a deeper understanding of how tensor categories are structured, new examples of tensor categories, and their concrete data related to these examples. The PI will look for interesting examples via classification and constructions, which would be useful not only to the theory of tensor categories itself but also to related areas of mathematics, such as topological quantum field theory and the study of vertex algebras.

The PI will organize collaborative research workshops at Indiana University (IU) for junior mathematicians start a 4-week long summer program at IU for underrepresented incoming graduate students. <br/> <br/>In more detail, the PI will study the cohomology of tensor categories, classify modular categories, and find new tensor categories via constructions, which would be useful not only to the theory of tensor categories itself but also to related areas of math, such as topological quantum field theory and the study of vertex operator algebras. In the non-semisimple setting, the PI will incorporate geometric techniques in the study of the cohomology, via support varieties, to learn about the structure of these categories. The PI will utilize Lie theoretic techniques to construct Hopf algebras and Nichols algebras in some symmetric tensor categories in positive characteristic with the aim of advancing their classification. To deepen the understanding of the structure of fusion and modular categories, the PI will focus on perfect fusion categories and on the classification program for ""small"" fusion categories.

Vast stores of information can efficiently be analyzed for underlying patterns by machine learning algorithms, leading to remarkable progress in applications ranging from self-driving cars to automatic drug discovery and machine translation. Underpinning many of these exciting practical developments is a class of computational models called neural networks. Originally developed in the 1940's and 1950's, the neural nets used today are as complex as they are powerful. The purpose of this project is to develop a range of principled techniques for understanding key aspects of how neural networks work in practice and how to make them better. The approach taken by this project is probabilistic and statistical in nature. Just as the ideal gas law accurately describes the large-scale properties of a gas directly through pressure, volume, and temperature without the need specify the state of each individual gas molecule, this project will explore and identify emergent statistical behaviors of large neural networks that provably explain many of their key properties observed in practice. The project will also provide research training and educational opportunities through organization of summer schools in machine learning for graduate students.<br/> <br/>At a high level, a neural network is a family of functions given by composing affine transformations with elementary non-linear operations. The simplest important kind of neural networks are roughly described by two parameters called depth and width. The former is the dimension of the spaces on which the affine transformations act and the latter is the number of compositions. The technical heart of this project is to understand the statistical behavior of such networks when the affine transformations are chosen at random. The starting point is an analytically tractable regime in which the network width is sent to infinity at fixed depth. In this infinite width limit, random networks converge to Gaussian processes and optimization of network parameters from their randomly chosen starting points reduces to a kernel method. Unfortunately, this concise description cannot capture what is perhaps the most important empirical property of neural networks, namely their ability to learn data-dependent features. Understanding how feature learning occurs is at the core of this project and requires new probabilistic and analytic tools for studying random neural networks at finite width. The basic idea is to perform perturbation theory around the infinite width limit, treating the reciprocal of the network width as a small parameter. The goal is then to obtain, to all orders in this reciprocal, the expressions for joint distribution of the values and derivatives (with respect to both model inputs and model parameters) of a random neural network. Such formulas have practical consequences for understanding the numerical stability of neural network training, suggesting principled settings for optimization hyper-parameters, and quantifying feature learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, one might find the optimal configuration of robots in a factory by studying the ""space"" of all such configurations of robots, as the geometry of the latter can lend insight as to which particular configurations are problematic in a given situation (such as when robotic arms might jam or interfere with each other).  Such ""spaces"" of geometric structures are called moduli spaces. The investigator's project is dedicated to a study of moduli spaces of surfaces, a key feature of the work being the interaction of geometry and algebra in the study of moduli. Some of this work will be conducted with the assistance of graduate students. The investigator will develop a graduate topics course in moduli spaces to stimulate interaction between students working in geometry and topology and those working in algebra. The investigator will also run biennial workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to moduli as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.<br/><br/>The investigator will study the moduli of Riemann surfaces.  The proposed research naturally falls into three projects.  The first is concerned with profinite aspects of mapping class groups of surfaces. In particular, the investigator will further develop profinite Teichmueller theory as initiated by Boggi, and will also pursue a study of centralizers in profinite completions of mapping class groups.  The second project concerns the geometry of surface bundles and their relation to topology and algebra.  In particular, the investigator will study distinctions between a number of geometric properties of subgroups of mapping class groups in analogy with more classical work in Kleinian groups, and will also continue a search for atoroidal surfaces bundles over surfaces.  The third portion of the proposed work is dedicated to a study of the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In particular, the investigator will continue study of certain analytic functions between Teichmuller spaces introduced by Thurston in his approach to his Geometrization conjecture, which come to bear on problems related to making Geometrization effective, as well as toward understanding certain pathology in the study of general deformation spaces of 3-manifolds."

Investment decisions are based on prices, updated every microsecond, for thousands of securities; atmospheric scientists use multiresolution satellite images to understand climate change; and internet companies exploit massive music collections to infer trends in tastes and preferences. Rigorous analysis of these large datasets requires a balance between computational constraints and statistical performance, and operationalizing such tradeoffs involves a combination of algorithmic and design-based approximations. For example, decreasing the resolution of an image or subsampling high-throughput data enables faster computations but removes potentially valuable information. At the same time, elaborate explanations of the scientific process are credible because they account for real-world complexity, but estimating complex models requires both more data and larger computers. The proposed work investigates the viability of modern statistical and machine learning methodologies for answering applied scientific questions. The project will create new algorithms and open-source software for combining computational approximations with regularization for analyzing large datasets as well as providing theoretical justification for their statistical properties. A more complete picture of the interplay between statistical regularization, computational approximation, and scientific parsimony will enable fundamental scientific advancement. The PI will employ the methodologies developed in this project to facilitate novel science with large datasets in climate science, biology, music analysis, astronomy, economics, and chemistry. Furthermore, the PI will carefully integrate the research aims with educational and outreach objectives to engage elementary and high school music students, introducing them to modern statistics and computer science, as well as integrating underrepresented populations in research.<br/><br/><br/>Computational tractability and statistical efficiency for large datasets necessitate approximation or regularization, either of which heuristically balances fidelity to the data with scientific goals like parsimony, smoothness, sparsity, or interpretability. The PI seeks to elucidate the dual roles of regularization and approximation as tools for better scientific understanding. Current research in computer science has focused on improving algorithms so as to enable computation with minimal approximation. Meanwhile, statisticians have developed regularization techniques in order to take advantage of simple structures - graph topologies, sparse linear models, smooth functions - that, if representative of the truth, will improve inference and prediction. The challenge is to understand the consequences of this coupling for scientific interpretability. The PI seeks to address two important issues (1) how do we select tuning parameters when computations are at a premium? and (2) how does the accuracy and stability of scientific conclusions relate to the approximation/regularization methods used to obtain those conclusions? This project seeks to enable fundamental scientific progress by understanding the connections between computational approximations and statistical regularization, thereby facilitating improved inferences. The PI will fill this gap by deriving practical algorithms with accompanying theoretical justification under more reasonable statistical assumptions. These tools will be tightly coupled with applications in neuroscience, genetics, atmospheric science, and music.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both  invariants associate chain complexes to knots whose chain homotopy types (and consequently, homology groups) are knot invariants. This project has two major research goals. The first goal is to extend various aspects of these homological invariants to stable homotopy types, i.e., construct new knot invariant topological spaces (well-defined up to stable homotopy equivalences) whose homology groups are the existing invariants. This will produce higher structures on the homological invariants which will be useful for studying certain geometric properties of knots, such as their four-ball genus. The second goal of this project is to study the relationship between the homological invariants. The project seeks to find new spectral sequences, and combinatorial reformulations of the existing spectral sequences, from the Khovanov homology invariants to the knot Floer homology invariants. This will lead to a better understanding of why these two invariants coming from very different origins share so many similarities.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes of spaces; and low dimensional topology concentrates on spaces up to dimension four. Knot theory is an important sub-field of low dimensional topology where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, for example, knotted pieces of strings inside the (three-dimensional Euclidean) space that we live in. In addition to being an extremely valuable tool in low dimensional topology, knot theory has also proven to be useful in real world applications: from analysing knotting in DNA to studying mixing in liquids, and from estimating energies of orbits inside a magnetic field to creating new data encryption schemes. A fundamental problem in knot theory is the knot isotopy problem: to determine if a given knot can transform into another one without tearing or crossing itself (such a transformation is called a knot isotopy). Knot invariants are mathematical objects, such as numbers or groups, that one associates to knots, and which remain unchanged during such a knot isotopy. Therefore, knot invariants are used extensively in the knot isotopy problem: if one finds some knot invariant that takes different values on the two given knots, then one concludes that the two knots are not isotopic. The current project is based on knot theory, and it seeks to study properties of certain previously known knot invariants, and to extend them to construct new knot invariants. The project will lead to dispersion of mathematical knowledge, particularly in the area of low-dimensional topology, via a variety of means. This project will fund undergraduate students for summer research, week-long workshops on low-dimensional topology, and a wiki-based website on knot theory."

Questions of this type appear in various contexts including in analysis, partial differential equations, number theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. The principal investigator introduced a new technique, called the ""polynomial method"" to the study of problems of this kind and used it to give a complete solution to the finite field Kakeya conjecture of Wolff. This project will continue developing the polynomial method in various ways and use it to attack other problems. In Sylvester-Gallai type problems, one wishes to convert information about local dependencies in a point set into global bounds on the dimension of the entire set. The principal investigator developed a technique to study questions of this form by bounding the rank of ""design-matrices"". This project will develop this method further and use it to make progress on several central questions in incidence geometry and additive combinatorics."

The realization that drag forces exerted on a body moving through air (or water) take place on a thin layer around the body lead to the development of boundary layer theory. The practical importance of boundary layer theory in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics is immense: computing the drag on an object and the energy dissipation rate nearby, with implications for fuel efficiency; understanding the problem of wing stall, the dependence of the lift on the angle of attack; and even the enhancement of heat transfer near solid walls. Mathematically, these questions concern the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the vanishing viscosity limit, and the stability of the ensuing boundary layers.  This project will develop new analytical tools to study the validity of the vanishing viscosity limit, the formation of singularities in boundary layers, and to explore the nonlinear stability mechanisms by which these lead to dynamic boundary layer separation. This theoretical information will lead to more accurate reduced models and finer predictions about real fluid flows. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers, in modern research problems in applied mathematics and the tools to study them.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical tools that will further our understanding of the vanishing viscosity limit: the question whether solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the incompressible Euler equations as the viscosity approaches zero, in the presence of a characteristic physical boundary.

The PI and collaborators will address the emergence of singularities in the Prandtl boundary layer equations by establishing more robust finite time blow-up scenarios. The stability of nearly laminar boundary layers will be studied via a hypocoercive analysis of the Prandtl system and of higher order models.

Typically, the analysis of such data sets begins by modeling the data as a high dimensional system, and so an understanding of the behavior of such systems (and techniques for dealing with them) has become equally important. This award supports a mathematical investigation of the behavior of such systems using techniques introduced by the researcher in previous work with collaborators. These techniques have led to the resolution of a number of open problems across various mathematical fields, including the Kadison-Singer problem and the existence of Ramanujan graphs of all sizes and degrees. This project aims to further develop substantial connections with research across numerous fields of science, including convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, functional analysis, combinatorics, and probability. The award also supports plans to focus interdisciplinary activities of particular benefit to students associated with the project.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the project focuses on two areas of research: (A) to develop a theory of ''finite free probability,'' a collection of ideas lying in the intersection of random matrix theory, convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, and polynomial geometry, and (B) to generalize the previously mentioned techniques so as to widen their potential application. This includes extending the ideas to bivariate polynomials as well as a non-Hermitian setting. In the direction of (B), the project aims to address some of the obstacles that hinder the application of the current techniques (for example, the need for real rootedness of associated polynomials) by investigating analogous behaviors in more general settings. This would be a necessary part of extending (A) to non-Hermitian settings, for example, as such objects no longer satisfy the conditions necessary to apply the current techniques. Extensions in this direction would also open the possibility of application to new areas such as quantitative geometry."

In many of these fields, the application of probabilistic and statistical methods has had a long history. A lot of effort has been spent on the development of plausible stochastic models and techniques to maximize expected values, minimize variances or control ruin probabilities. Considerably less work has been devoted to a systematic investigation of the concept of risk, its quantification and the implications for regulation and behavior. In particular, the study of consistent aggregation of risk, attribution of risk, or optimal management of risk in dynamic setups has only started recently. The goal of this project is to provide a mathematical framework for the quantification and management of risk in different contexts. Formally, a risk measure is a functional on a space of random variables or stochastic processes. An important aspect of the project will be the study of the mathematical structure of such functionals with a view towards important properties like monotonicity, convexity or time-consistency. But also the tractability of related optimization problems, practical applications and numerical implementations will be investigated. This will involve methods from probability theory, statistics, convex analysis, locally convex vector spaces and numerical mathematics.<br/><br/>The project explores the quantification and management of risks faced by individuals, companies and society in different situations of uncertainty. The main focus of the project is to provide mathematical tools for the assessment, control, mitigation and minimization of risk. Practical problems to be addressed are optimal portfolio allocation; the pricing, hedging and design of financial derivatives; the valuation of complex insurance products such as equity-linked insurance contracts; the determination of capital requirements for banks and insurance companies; coherent attribution of risks; optimal risk transfer between financial institutions; the securitization of risks; integrated risk management; the valuation of energy contracts; the optimal operation of power plants; and the assessment of risk faced by society through financial crises, under-funded pension plans or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. The general treatment of risk and the investigation of different concrete problems are expected to motivate new concepts and the transfer of expertise between different fields. <br/>"

Higher Teichmueller<br/>spaces are connected components of the variety of representations<br/>of the fundamental group of a surface into semisimple Lie groups,<br/>which share essential properties with Teichmueller<br/>space. Classical Teichmueller space plays an important role in<br/>various fields of mathematics due to its rich structure and the<br/>fact that it is a smooth cover of the moduli space of Riemann<br/>surfaces.  For higher Teichmueller spaces many potentially<br/>interesting structures are yet to be discovered and the relation<br/>to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces still needs to be<br/>clarified. The proposed research focusses on identifying the<br/>geometric objects (similar to hyperbolic surfaces in the case of<br/>classical Teichmueller space) which are parametrized by higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces. These objects will then be used to define<br/>algebraic, geometric and dynamical structures on higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces, and we expect that they will help to<br/>construct a natural map from higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>classical Teichmueller space.<br/><br/>Teichmueller space is the space of all geometric surfaces with a<br/>fixed combinatorial type. Because it parametrizes all surfaces,<br/>Teichmueller space is a fundamental mathematical object which<br/>also plays an important role in theoretical physics. Every point<br/>in Teichmueller space corresponds to a tiling of the Euclidean<br/>plane, the two-dimensional sphere or in most cases the hyperbolic<br/>plane by one polygon and its images under subsequent reflections<br/>in the sides. (Nice pictures inspired by such tilings appear in<br/>M.C. Escher's work.) The combinatorial type of the surface is<br/>determined by the number of vertices of the polygon and the<br/>gluing data, but the geometry of the surface depends on the<br/>length of the sides and the angles at the vertices of the<br/>polygon. Teichmueller space is the example of a moduli space of a<br/>pattern (the tiling) with rich symmetries (the reflections in the<br/>side of the polygon). Such moduli spaces can be efficiently<br/>studied via the group generated by the symmetries of the<br/>pattern. Higher Teichmueller spaces are moduli spaces of more<br/>complicated patterns in higher dimensional spaces. However, the<br/>symmetry group of these patterns is the same as the symmetry<br/>group of the tilings associated to classical Teichmueller<br/>space. Therefore one expects higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>parametrize geometric objects which are not surfaces themselves,<br/>but closely related to surfaces. The proposed research focusses<br/>on identifying these geometric objects and studying their finer<br/>structure.<br/><br/>The project proposes various activities to involve graduate<br/>students in research and teaching, as for instance a yearly<br/>mathematical retreat for graduate students to study, explore and<br/>present a mathematical topic in a group, and small workshops with<br/>mini-courses which allow graduate students to get insight into<br/>the working of modern research collaborations.<br/>"

These again appear both in science (e.g. phases of matter) and mathematics (e.g. knot theory). One of the earliest appearances of groups was in the study of Galois theory, where one looks at symmetries of a number system that do not move a subsystem, and in parallel one of the earliest appearances of quantum groups was in a similar Galois theory for von Neumann factors. The research portion of this project focuses on the study of quantum groups and subfactors. One important technique used to study such quantum groups is called ""higher dimensional algebra.""

The goal of this proposal is to initiate a systematic study of how conditioning on observed data affects the properties of large-scale stochastic models such as interacting particle systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and Markov random fields.  Research will focus on developing the foundations of a conditional ergodic theory for infinite-dimensional Markov processes and of conditional infinite Gibbs measures; on the investigation of probabilistic phenomena such as conditional phase transitions; on developing connections with problems in measure theory, statistical mechanics, and high-dimensional probability; and on potential applications to the design and analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for filtering and prediction in high-dimensional systems, where classical methods are known to fail.<br/><br/>Large-scale forecasting problems arise in a myriad of important applications such as weather forecasting, geophysical and oceanographic data assimilation, image analysis, traffic forecasting, and prediction in networks.

The broad goal of this project is to develop a systematic understanding of the interplay between complex models, randomness, and observed data that lies at the heart of any forecasting problem.  By focusing on the fundamental structures that are common to a diverse range of applications, mathematicians can provide unique insights and new directions to complex problems and provide an impetus for developing interdisciplinary connections.  At the same time, a strong workforce in the mathematical sciences is of crucial importance to the future of technological innovation and education. An integral part of this project is formed by a range of educational, mentoring and outreach activities aimed at increasing student interest and diversity in the mathematical sciences across pre-college, undergraduate and graduate student levels, and at training the next generation of researchers and educators."

One program  investigates the magnification cross sections of caustic-curve  networks due to generic multiplane weak-field gravitational lens  systems.  The other program studies the links between the global  geometry of the optical caustic surfaces in a spacetime (e.g., along  our past light cone or about rotating black holes) and the  singularities of the associated spacetime metric.  These issues point  to a new and promising direction in the mathematical theory of optical  caustics.  Furthermore, their rigorous treatment may also lead to a  deeper understanding of the flux enhancement of gravitationally lensed  quasars and their overdensity around foreground galaxies, and rapid  X-ray variability in active galactic nuclei.  Equally important, such  investigations may reveal new and powerful ways of understanding and  organizing fundamental physical concepts in gravitational lensing, and  can provide a theoretical check on results from numerical simulations.      Gravitational lensing is the deflection of light from a distant source  (e.g., quasar, extended galaxy) by an intervening matter distribution  (e.g., galaxy, cluster of galaxies).  When foreground galaxies magnify  background quasars, it causes an ``amplification bias'' in certain  quasar samples.  This has led to a mathematically difficult and  physically important problem in gravitational lensing: Determine the  probability that a light source is magnified greater than some  specified amount.  A rigorous study of this problem directly bears on  the the issue of ``magnification bias.''  Another important problem is  to investigate gravitational lensing by dynamical lenses (e.g.,  rotating black holes).  This is physically relevant since most  galaxies seem to have black holes at their centers.  Moreover,  gravitational lensing by a rotatin g black hole may account for rapid  X-ray variability in active galactic nuclei.  The aforementioned  problems will lead me to interact with astrophysicists and astronomers  for physics discussions and latest observations, computer scientists  for sophisticated numerical codes running on high-performance  computers, and mathematicians for issues in singularity theory and  differential geometry.  Also, implicit with this general aim is  isolating and studying the underlying mathematical structures invoked  by gravitational lensing.  Once determined, these structures can then  be made available as potential mathematical tools for other physical  systems (possibly shock formation in fluids) that may call upon them."

Transport phenomena are ubiquitous in nature, whether at the large scale of our macroscopic world or at the very small scale of microscopic particles. They describe interactions and exchanges between systems, and how quantities of interest are transported from one location to another. This project focuses on two important instances of these phenomena: the transport of light or sound waves in complex environments, and the transport of particles in devices at the nanometer scale. These two topics have many applications in various fundamental domains such as telecommunications, non-destructive testing, medical imaging, and nanoelectronics. Very often, transport phenomena are multiscale, in the sense that the underlying physics involves various spatial or temporal scales of very different orders of magnitude. As a consequence, the description and the computer simulation of transport processes are extremely difficult, and this is where mathematical analysis plays a central role. By identifying a set of important parameters, the original models can be simplified into reduced models, more amenable to analysis and computations. This notion of asymptotic analysis is the common thread of the two topics of the project. The project will advance new mathematical models and techniques, as well as new computational methods for transport phenomena in complex media and in quantum systems. The research will impact, in particular, the field of target or defect localization in disordered media, as well as the modeling of semiconductors. The project integrates research with an educational plan that is designed to reach various generations, from high school to doctoral students.<br/><br/>This project addresses two topics related to transport phenomena. The first one concerns quantum hydrodynamical transport models for nanodevices, which offer a reduced yet accurate macroscopic description of the dynamics at the quantum scale.  The main objectives are to build a complete mathematical theory for recent formal models, to develop numerical methods for their simulations, and to validate the models for future applications. A key ingredient in the theory is the ""quantum moment problem,"" which is a generalization to density operators of the classical moment problem for measures. The second topic concerns inverse problems in random media. The main goal is to develop transformative transport-based methods for imaging in strongly diffusive environments for which no efficient techniques are available as of today. Such methods are based upon understanding the transfer of information from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic scale. The stress will be put on random media with long-range correlations, such as the turbulent atmosphere, which offer an ultimate benchmark for the methods proposed in the project. The problem of fast intensity imaging algorithms using optimization techniques will also be addressed."

A direct numerical simulation that aims at capturing relevant phenomena at all scales requires an often prohibitively large amount of computation time. To simulate such systems, multiscale methods include the local behavior of a numerical solution in the approximation process, thus taking into account the various scales. For example, in modeling a wind turbine made from composites, deformations during operation can be simulated for portions of the wind turbine blade. The multiscale approximation for the deformation of the whole wind turbine is then built from these local solutions. Multiscale methods that can guarantee that the error between the multiscale approximation and the global solution is below a given tolerance are of particular interest. The goal of this project is to design and analyze such multiscale methods for the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations that are used in simulating deformations in (realistic) wind turbines. It is anticipated that the new methods will be crucial in building digital twins, that is, mathematical models of physical objects that can be employed in real time to assess, for example, the structural health of a system. Application of the results in digital twins for wind turbines will support the generation of renewable energy for society. The project includes a closely integrated educational plan to increase participation and retention of students from groups underrepresented in STEM by (i) designing and leading courses for high school students, helping them discover via creative and project-based learning techniques how the concepts of mathematics they are learning have important applications; and (ii) establishing a mentoring program for undergraduate mathematics students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To develop the desired multiscale methods, in this project, the local ansatz functions will be constructed to (quasi-)optimally approximate the nonlinear set of local solutions of the partial differential equation (PDE). To approximate the latter, randomized versions of model order reduction methods will be developed. While deterministic model reduction algorithms construct provably the optimal space to approximate a set of solutions of a PDE dependent on a parameter (here arbitrary Dirichlet boundary data), they suffer from the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional parameter sets. Randomizing these methods is expected to break the curse of dimensionality and allow analysis of the error in novel ways suitable for nonlinear systems. The three research objectives of the project are: development and analysis of randomized multiscale methods for (i) elliptic and (ii) parabolic nonlinear PDEs, where the local ansatz functions can be constructed parallel in time, and (iii) application to the simulation of the deformation of wind turbines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model reduction (complexity reduction) has become a ubiquitous tool that makes these repeated numerical simulations computationally tractable by exploiting intrinsic low-rank structures in the system dynamics. However, most of today's model reduction methods exploit linear structures that are present only in a limited class of problems, which excludes, for example, important problems with transport phenomena that describe waves and other moving coherent structures. This severely limits the use of today's model reduction methods in a wide range of applications from multi-phase problems in materials science to combustion in engineering to pattern formation in biology. The goal of this project is to develop new types of model reduction methods at the intersection of machine learning, numerical analysis, and scientific computing that exploit nonlinear structures to make tractable repeated simulations of transport phenomena to support scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The nonlinear model reduction techniques proposed in this project will derive reduced solutions on manifolds as compositions of low-rank approximations. This means that the traditional linear vector-space structure of today's model reduction methods is given up in favor of increased expressiveness (""breaking the Kolmogorov barrier""). The work packages are as follows: (i) New approximation theory concepts will be developed to show for prototypical transport-dominated partial differential equations that the proposed reduced models break the Kolmogorov barrier of today's linear model reduction methods, meaning the best-approximation error of the proposed nonlinear models decays exponentially faster than the best-approximation error of linear models. (ii) Numerical methods will be proposed that exploit the nonlinear low rankness of the composed approximations of the proposed nonlinear reduced models to achieve speedups compared to traditional models. The nonlinear solutions will be numerically computed by integrating in time the governing equations to ensure that the nonlinear reduced models generalize well to new inputs/parameters, in contrast to purely relying on data-fitted maps without going back to the governing equations. (iii) Two real-world applications in collaborations with domain scientists in storm-surge forecasting and additive manufacturing will demonstrate that the proposed techniques have the potential to impact a wide range of applications that currently are limited by prohibitively expensive simulations of transport phenomena. (iv) Integrated education components such as interactive online courses via flipped classrooms, tutorials for engineers, and outreach activities building on the two real-world applications in storm-surge forecasting and additive manufacturing will educate a broad audience and ensure relevance in practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project aims to further develop systematic rules for understanding and counting such pseudoholomorphic curves in a large class of physical systems, by establishing formulae reducing the study of area-minimizing surfaces of different shapes (spheres, surfaces with many holes, etc.) to the study of a simpler type of area-minimizing surfaces (disks), and subsequently by understanding the degree to which such latter counts (of disks) can be assembled from a decomposition of the physical system into elementary pieces. Applications will be studied to mirror symmetry, a far-reaching geometric duality first discovered in string theory involving (on one side) counts of such curves. The educational component of the project aims to create a series of online virtual research activities in symplectic geometry and related areas, including organization of a virtual seminar (ongoing), workshops, and mini-courses. The PI will also train and encourage mathematics students through traditional workshops, new course and seminar content, undergraduate and graduate advising, and outreach to K-12 students through science fairs.<br/> <br/>The long term research project funded by this award is to establish and further develop systematic frameworks for computing invariants in symplectic geometry and mirror symmetry coming from pseudoholomorphic curve theory.

In another, the project aims to further elucidate the relationship between Gromov-Witten invariants and the Fukaya category, with applications to enumerative mirror symmetry.

Stem cells differentiate into mature cells through the process of stem cell fate decision-making: in most cases, we cannot yet explain or predict this process. This project will develop mathematical models to understand how stem cells make fate decisions. The models will describe the dynamics of stem cells as well as the gene dynamics occurring inside cells and the higher-level coordination that occurs between the many cells of a tissue. The PI will take the novel approach of using publicly available genomics data to inform models of two organs: the blood (hematopoietic) and kidney epithelial systems. The research outcome will be an ability to predict and explain stem cell fate decisions: knowledge that will bring us one step closer to being able to build new organs. The educational objective of this project is to train a new generation of scientists to be equally skilled in biological and quantitative thinking. This will be achieved by developing new curricula for undergraduate, middle/high, and elementary level students, closely coupled to the research goals of the project.<br/><br/>This project will develop models to explain how stem cell differentiation is coordinated and maintained in complex signaling environments. Stem cell differentiation is controlled by cell-internal gene regulatory networks as well as signals from the microenvironment and cell- and tissue-scale effects. Predictive models of stem cell differentiation must take into account the dynamics occurring on all of these biological scales. Stem cell states (both homeostatic and perturbed) in two systems will be studied: hematopoiesis and kidney epithelia. For each system, publicly available single-cell genomics data will be leveraged to infer regulatory networks across transcriptional-to-cellular scales. This will be achieved via three scientific objectives: 1) Develop Bayesian inference methods to learn single-cell regulatory networks; 2) Investigate stem cell lineage dynamics via dynamical systems modeling and parameter inference; 3) Predict tissue-scale responses to stimuli through multiscale modeling. The resulting models will give fundamental new insight into how stem cells function, and may reveal shared regulatory logic of signaling pathway motifs across different organs. The educational goal of this project is to train a new generation of scientists to be simultaneously literate in mathematical and life sciences. This will be achieved in collaboration with the USC Joint Educational Project via two educational objectives: 1) Develop a curriculum for local elementary schools to diversify participation in and spark enthusiasm for mathematics and biology; 2) Develop a quantitative biology undergraduate course with a service-learning component in middle/high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models can inform scientific understanding of these complex and ever-changing systems, as well as public health policy. In particular, mechanistic models, mathematical models that describe the key processes that drive dynamic, real-world systems, along with empirical data, can be useful for assessing the efficacy of different control strategies, or testing different hypotheses about the underlying biology. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the importance of mechanistic models and the challenges of implementing these models to inform policy. One of these challenges, which spans disciplines, arises when there is a mismatch between the data available and the data required to inform these models and  reduce uncertainty in model outputs and predictions. A model-data mismatch could lead to erroneous conclusions about which control policies will be most effective at achieving a particular goal. This project aims to create a methodology that finds the most cost-effective approach to data collection for a given mathematical model, such that the model produces reliable outputs and measures of uncertainty. Applying these methods to recent case studies like COVID-19, Zika, and Ebola can inform appropriate responses to, and improve preparedness for, future pandemics. These methods will also be applicable to areas of ecology and physiology, where the overarching goal of integrating modeling and empirical studies is critical to progress. Integral to the research objectives is a new education program targeting undergraduate students, with unrecognized potential in STEM. A series of educational <br/>modules will engage students in the fundamentals of mathematical modeling, coding, and visualization, using a collaborative and inquiry-based approach. Participants will hone these skills by working with epidemiological models related to the proposed project, and will use their creativity and unique perspectives as novice modelers with diverse backgrounds to promote model literacy in the general public.<br/><br/>One way to address the problem of a model-data mismatch is first to evaluate the practical identifiability of a model, that is, the ability to estimate model parameters unambiguously from data, given a particular data set.  Conclusions derived from a practically unidentifiable model may not be robust.  Furthermore, commonly used methods to determine practical identifiability of epidemiological models rely on simple likelihood models (functions proportional to the probability of observed data given the model parameters) that make unrealistic assumptions about epidemiological data, which in reality are highly correlated and complex.  A poor approximation to the true likelihood model can lead to inaccurate estimates of uncertainty in model outputs.  Using appropriate identifiability metrics and improved (yet tractable) likelihood models, control theory can be leveraged to derive data sampling strategies, constrained by finite public health resources, that render a model practically identifiable.  The approach is to find sampling protocols that jointly minimize the identifiability metric and the cost of the sampling strategy.  These new methods will be tested using synthetic data, and applied to recent outbreaks to determine what data sampling strategies would have been sufficient to reduce the uncertainty in model parameter estimates, and therefore, reduce uncertainty in model outputs.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and the BIO Division of Environmental Biology through the Population and Community Ecology (PCE) Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to analyze how some fundamental physical objects interact with fractal structures.  For instance, suppose we know that a field associated to a body in space (for instance its gravitational field) is well-behaved (say, has bounded magnitude), then what can we infer about the geometry of the body?  Does the condition upon the field preclude the surface of the body from having a fractal type structure?  A second topic considered concerns understanding signals whose frequencies have a self-similar or fractal behavior.  More precisely, one is interested in the extent to which the signal can be reconstructed uniquely from a ""small"" set of values.  The principal investigator (PI) will incorporate both graduate and undergraduate students into the research program, training them for future careers in STEM fields.  The PI will organize annual undergraduate research symposia that will bring together undergraduate students interested in mathematical research across southeastern states to present their undergraduate research, build a network with others interested in pursuing research in the mathematical sciences, and provide information about research opportunities at the graduate level.<br/><br/>This project concerns the analysis of operators when the geometry underlying the problem is rough or fractal in nature.  The first question considered is: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that a Calderon-Zygmund operator associated to it is bounded?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz submanifolds of appropriate dimension? This basic question in analysis has found applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundaries, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  Despite intense study over the last thirty years, the tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the field to the geometric structure of the measure are currently underdeveloped, something that this proposal aims to rectify.  The second question is: How sparse must the support of the Fourier transform of a function be to ensure that the function can be uniquely reconstructed by its values on a ""thick"" subset?  Although this question is a classical form of the uncertainty principle, it is not yet well understood, especially in several dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The incoming graduate students interested in PDE are encouraged to participate in the principal investigator's PDE reading seminar, and to interact more with their peers and postdocs in the area. In term of undergraduate training, the principal investigator plans to increase the interest of University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of Analysis and PDE through some individual mentoring plans, and two undergraduate summer schools. Besides, the principal investigator plans to organize two conferences in nonlinear PDE and related topics for early career researchers.<br/><br/>The proposed research involves two themes. The first is about a level-set mean curvature equation with driving and source terms, and applications to a crystal growth model, in which each level set of the unknown evolves in time by its mean curvature with unit constant force. The second involves Eikonal equations, and homogenization, where the zero-level set of the unknown moves in a periodic environment with highly oscillatory normal velocity.

Increasingly, they impact every aspect of life, from medical image analysis to fraud detection. Machine learning has also risen to paramount importance in the sciences, as researchers use the same algorithms to analyze datasets, test hypotheses, and make predictions, accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. However, despite its success, many foundational questions of machine learning remain poorly understood: What is behind the surprising success of neural networks and when might they fail?

A link is a mathematical object that formalizes the notion of one or more knotted pieces of string. The mathematical theory of links (knot theory) is the study of such objects up to continuous deformations, that is we imagine that our link is made from a flexible material, and we consider two links to be the same if we can deform one into the other. Despite the seemingly specialized nature of knot theory, it has been shown to have applications to the theory of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, to theoretical physics, and it has been applied to the study of DNA recombination and protein folding. The problem of distinguishing two links is challenging for two reasons: first, it can be difficult to exhibit the deformations that identify two links that look different but are indeed the same; second, given two links that we suspect to be distinct, it is difficult to directly and rigorously show that in fact one cannot be deformed to the other. One technique for solving the latter problem is via a link invariant: an assignment of a simpler mathematical object to a link that is unchanged under deformation. If two links have different invariants, we know that they are indeed distinct. The main research goal of this project is to further our understanding of powerful modern link invariants called link homology theories. The accompanying educational activities share a common theme of increasing participation in the mathematical sciences at a variety of levels, including course-development, student research, and outreach activities at the K-12 level. The broader impacts of this project aim to support the persistence of groups typically underrepresented in mathematics via research mentoring efforts, and to foster connections with the public through the UNC Science Expo.<br/><br/>Link homologies are modern invariants of links that generalize (and moreover, categorify) quantum invariants such as the Jones polynomial. In addition to providing deep topological information in dimensions three and four, they enjoy a rich algebraic structure arising from connections to modern representation theory. Consequently, they are an important nexus for research in representation theory, topology, and related considerations in theoretical physics. Thus far, algebraic developments in link homology have focused on the Khovanov-Rozansky theory, which is associated with the Lie algebra sl(n). The PI will develop link homology beyond this (non-super) type A case. These developments are crucial for providing long sought-after bridges between quantum and classical topological structures and for studying link homology associated to simple complex Lie algebras distinct from sl(n) about which essentially nothing is known. In one line of work, the PI will construct the gl(m|n) link homologies (super type A) that have been predicted to exist by considerations in theoretical physics, and which conjecturally provide a connection between the Khovanov-Rozansky theory and knot Floer homology. In a second line of work, the PI will construct explicit and computable link homologies associated to simple complex Lie algebras outside type A. Along the way, he will also resolve the long-standing problem of finding  generators-and-relations descriptions of categories of quantum group representations for non-type A simple complex Lie algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the investigator and collaborator study the rigorous passage to both limits mathematically in various physical situations. The first part of the project concerns the hydrodynamic limits when free interfaces occur naturally: (i) vortex patch solutions of the incompressible Euler equation, (ii) two-species Vlasov-Boltzmann systems modeling binary fluid mixtures with sharp interface and surface tension, and (iii) shock formation in the compressible Euler equations and its kinetic approximation. The second part of the project concerns the Grad-Boltzmann limit in the presence of a thermal stochastic boundary. The investigators study the passage from the N-body Newtonian system interacting with stochastic boundary toward the Boltzmann equation with diffuse reflection boundary.

Harmonic analysis studies how general functions can be represented by sums of simpler functions, for instance, trigonometric functions. Analytic number theory is a branch of number theory that uses tools from mathematical analysis to answer questions concerning the integers. Recently, tools in harmonic analysis have proven to be very efficient in answering questions originating from analytic number theory. This project continues the investigation in the intersection of these two fields, in the hope of creating a dictionary between them that would allow researchers in one field to translate their tools to the other. The project also provides undergraduate students access to the forefront of current research. The PI plans to organize summer schools to attract more undergraduate and early graduate students to carry out interdisciplinary research in harmonic analysis and analytic number theory.<br/><br/>The project involves work in decoupling theory, oscillatory integral theory, and their applications in analytic number theory and combinatorics. One goal in the development of decoupling theory is to obtain sharp decoupling inequalities for all polynomial surfaces that are translation-dilation invariant (TDI in short). This would imply sharp bounds on the number of integral solutions to all TDI systems of Diophantine equations. As a first step towards this goal, the PI will study two particularly important systems: TDI systems of monomials and TDI systems generated by one polynomial. In oscillatory integral theory, the PI also will study two problems. The first problem asks for the optimal Sobolev regularity estimates for an averaging operator along moment curves. The second problem asks for sharp Lebesgue estimates for maximal averaging operators along moment curves. It is expected that local smoothing estimates for linear wave equations and related decoupling inequalities will play key roles in the study of these two problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, the classical assumption of independence is routinely violated in combinatorial datasets arising from social networks, making it increasingly important to develop realistic and mathematically tractable methods for modeling structure and dependence in high-dimensional distributions. This project leverages ideas from recent developments in optimal transport theory, random geometric graphs, and statistical physics to gain a deeper understanding of (1) multivariate distribution-free inference and (2) dependent network data.

The second component of this project will focus on modeling dependence in complex relational data, using the Ising model and, more generally, higher-order (tensor) Markov random fields.

One project will focus on the role that movement has in ecological systems or that redistribution has in economic systems.

The goal of this research is to inform optimal strategies for early detection of colorectal cancer using analysis of cell-free DNA from patient blood samples. This will be achieved through developing novel mathematical and computational models of cell-free DNA shedding during colorectal tumor evolution, and using them for evaluating diverse strategies for early detection. A common mathematical theme underlying this work will be the study of stochastic evolution on graphs.

An early instance of this is Euler who noted that for a polygonal surface the number of vertices minus edges plus faces is always two, which allowed him to prove that there are only five platonic solids. In the 1920s, Emmy Noether shifted the focus from numerical invariants to the algebraic structures underlying them, such as sets with algebraic operations. In Homotopy Theory, the focus is extended further to more advanced mathematical notions of infinite-dimensional spaces whose number of connected components recover the underlying numerical invariant. The projects funded by this CAREER award aim to lift classical algebraic invariants of geometric objects to the higher homotopical world and study them from this richer perspective. The educational part of the project consists in expanding access to mathematics not only within the academic world via conferences, but also beyond the usual academic settings to incarcerated individuals: the PI will introduce and teach an inquiry-based learning college level mathematics elective in the B.A. program offered at South Woods Prison. <br/><br/>The primary research goal of the project is to use new results in equivariant stable homotopy theory to study manifolds with group actions and their equivariant diffeomorphisms. Stable homotopy theory, the study of spectra, has played a crucial role in the longstanding program to classify manifolds; however, the classification of G-manifolds for a group G is far less understood than the classical nonequivariant story. Building in part on prior work of the PI on equivariant algebraic K-theory and her collaborative foundational work on equivariant infinite loop space theory, the machinery that turns suitable G-categories into G-spectra, the PI and Malkiewich were have built an equivariant generalization of Waldhausen's algebraic K-theory of spaces. Inspired by Goodwillie?s vision, they conjecture that, for a compact smooth G-manifold M, equivariant A-theory splits off a stable space of equivariant h-cobordisms. This project involves a significant extension of these efforts focused on proving this conjecture and exploiting it to further our understanding of equivariant h-cobordisms and diffeomorphisms of G-manifolds. The second research goal is to apply stable homotopy techniques to study classical invariants by deriving these, i.e., lifting them to spectra. The PI will pursue two projects of this flavor. First, together with Malkiewich and Moi, the PI will study a derived version of the classical character map from representation theory that they have defined. The second, which is a project that the PI is co-leading with Rovi for the Women in Topology Workshop, is to apply and extend recent work of Zakharevich and Campbell on scissors congruence K-theory spectra to manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Langlands program is a web of far-reaching and influential conjectures that predicts surprising connections between arithmetic (e.g., properties of integer solutions to polynomial equations) and analysis (e.g., automorphic forms, which are highly symmetric solutions to certain differential equations on symmetric manifolds). The celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by A. Wiles, for instance, uses early results in the Langlands program proved by Langlands and Tunnell. In another direction, automorphic forms have deep connections with the string theory and the study of black holes in physics. In this project the PI will investigate analytic properties of automorphic forms and their number-theoretic consequences in the Langlands program. The project also integrates educational opportunities, including public outreach lectures, undergraduate and graduate research activities, cross-disciplinary training and research, and graduate curriculum development. <br/><br/>A main theme in the theory of automorphic forms is to study the discrete spectrum of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a number field. By the pioneering work of Arthur, followed by many others, the discrete spectrum of a classical group has been classified into so-called Arthur packets, which are parametrized by Arthur parameters. The first part of this project is to analyze the finer structure of Arthur packets, including: concrete constructions of modules in each Arthur packet; Fourier coefficients of automorphic representations in each Arthur packet, including Jiang's conjecture; cuspidality of each Arthur packet; and relations among Arthur packets of different but closely related groups (via automorphic descent). The PI will also work on establishing Langlands functorial descent for exceptional groups, towards studying the Langlands functoriality and the discrete spectra of exceptional groups. The second part of the project is about converse problems. Converse problems aim to recover modular/automorphic forms from their Fourier coefficients. For example, the famous converse theorems of Hecke and Weil give sufficient conditions for a Dirichlet series to be the Mellin transform of a modular form. It is known that converse theorems play an important role in the establishment of Langlands functoriality. In this part of the project the PI will develop approaches to several conjectures, including Jacquet's conjecture and Cogdell-Piatetski-Shapiro conjecture, in order to prove optimal local and global converse theorems, as well as converse problems for exceptional groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its abstractions find numerous applications throughout mathematics. For example, objects can be understood or classified by their groups of symmetries and their actions (such as crystals or systems of differential equations), or they can be enclosed into a space and studied via its motions in it (such as flow of water on Earth and in its atmosphere). This project is in the realm of abstract topological dynamics, which extends the notion of time to any topological group and restricts spaces to compact Hausdorff. Its applications lie mostly in combinatorics, number theory, and measure theory. A priori, there is no bound on the size of the groups or spaces, however the majority of results have countability restrictions on both. The purpose of this project is to relax the countability conditions and to lay the foundations of uncountable topological dynamics. There are two major motives to do so: first, generalizations often bring clarification and simplification of a theory by revealing its true core and requires novel ideas that lead to new discoveries. Second, the uncountable is unavoidable as soon as we accept existence of countable infinity and even very natural dynamical systems of the discrete group of integers have complexity beyond any notion of countability. <br/><br/>The core objects of abstract topological dynamics are minimal dynamical systems that can be thought of as building blocks of dynamical systems. In particular, the universal minimal flow captures the complexity of minimal dynamics of a given group since it quotients onto every minimal dynamical system. It is known that for infinite locally compact, non-compact groups, the universal minimal flow is non-metrizable. Yet, even the universal minimal flow of the discrete group of integers is poorly understood, in contrast to an extensively developed theory of its metrizable minimal flows. The aim of this project is to fill this gap and to provide explicit descriptions of universal minimal flows of foundational groups such as the integers, the integer lattice, or the general linear group. More generally, the PI will continue recently initiated investigation of interactions between universal minimal flows and operations on groups (such as products, short exact sequences, or inverse limits). On the other side of the spectrum, remarkable discoveries from the verge of the century of connections between finite combinatorics (Ramsey theory) and topological dynamics showed that universal minimal flows of non-locally compact (called infinite dimensional) groups that are essentially countable can be metrizable or even trivial. The PI proved analogous results for infinite dimensional groups with the countability assumption removed and will build further upon these results. The ultimate goal is to find a unifying theory for these two seemingly orthogonal dynamical behaviors of locally compact and infinite dimensional groups in the joint framework of ultrafilter dynamics established in discrete dynamics and extended to topological dynamics by the PI. The project lies on the boundary of set theory, topology, model theory, combinatorics, and algebra and offers ample training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and even talented high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will shed further light on these questions, focusing particularly on which hypersurfaces satisfy various types of hyperbolicity properties. Furthermore, this project will help train the next generation of scientists and mathematicians through a strong educational plan aimed to K-12 students, that sees the involvement of undergraduate students and faculty.

Obtaining accurate predictions of turbulent flows is a central challenge in global change estimation, weather forecasting, freshwater supply, improving the energy efficiency of engines, controlling dispersal of contaminants, and designing biomedical devices. A turbulent flow is a highly irregular system, characterized by chaotic property changes involving a wide range of scales in nonlinear interaction with each other. These features yield a high computational complexity, which makes direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows that aim at resolving all features down to the smallest scales infeasible even with modern supercomputers. Instead, turbulence models are used for practical turbulence simulations to bypass the chaotic details and reduce the computational complexity. This project aims to develop a new family of ensemble averaged turbulence models and novel numerical methods for their solution, extending current applicability and computational limitations of effective turbulence simulations, which may have a great impact on numerous applications in aeronautics, hydraulics, chemical engineering, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and geophysics, considering turbulence?s prominent influence in almost all geophysical and industrial flows. A comprehensive educational program will be developed to provide students with systematic training in computational fluid dynamics and bring them up to date on current research topics in this field. <br/><br/>Turbulence modeling remains one of the most important scientific challenges. The fundamental approach for turbulence modeling is to seek to approximate suitable (ensemble, time, or spatial) averages of fluid velocity instead of pointwise velocity itself. Ensemble averaging is the most intuitive approach from the statistical theory for turbulence, but it is currently not in use for practical turbulence simulations of industrial flows due to the extremely high computational cost associated with ensemble simulations. This deadlock is recently broken with newly developed ensemble algorithms that give access to the full ensemble at every time step and thus open new and direct possibilities for developing turbulence models for the ensemble averaged Navier-Stokes equations. In this project the investigator will develop a new family of ensemble-based variational multiscale method (VMS) turbulence models and novel numerical methods under the new framework of ensemble averaging for practical turbulent flow simulations.

Examples include fault detection in manufacturing, disease outbreak detection in public health, spectrum sensing in signal processing, item change detection in educational testing, and fraud detection in e-commerce. While traditional methods mainly focus on identifying data points deviating from their normal states independently, new challenges arise in the big-data era as the anomalies often involve massive data with complex structures. This project will develop novel statistical methods and theoretical results along with computational tools to systematically deal with the detection of structured anomalies in large-scale data. In addition to the technical contribution, the methods developed in this project will positively impact research in other disciplines. For instance, the change detection method developed in this project will aid the monitoring of item pool quality in educational testing to improve the validity and reliability of the tests. This project will also implement an educational plan which includes engaging graduate and undergraduate students in research activities, creating a new curriculum, and outreach to educational institutes. The outcome of the project will be broadly disseminated through journal publications and conferences, and publicly available statistical software will be developed. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project will focus on two classes of problems in large-scale sequential decision-making and latent variable models. The first class of problems involves large-scale streaming data, which have become common in recent years, owing to the rapid development in data acquisition technologies. The project will establish a general compound sequential decision theory framework to quantify the performance of procedures for large-scale online change detection problems and develop efficient sequential decisions under this framework. The second class of problems is on high-dimensional generalized latent factor models with structured outliers. The project will develop efficient model estimation and statistical inference methods and provide theoretical guarantees on their accuracy and reliability. Fundamental issues such as identifiability and estimability of the model will be addressed. Moreover, novel technical tools will be developed to address theoretical and methodological challenges in the above problems. For example, a monotone coupling technique for stochastic processes living on a non-Euclidean space will be developed to enhance the understanding of sequential decisions for multi-stream problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the dynamics of disease is essential to earlier and more effective interventions to mitigate disease spread. To fully understand these dynamics, information across systems that operate on multiple spatial and time scales, as well as evolving via feedback, must be combined. This research project aims to develop a mathematical framework to combine and analyze such information to further the understanding of infectious disease spread, providing insight for ongoing and future disease outbreaks. The results are also intended to be applicable to multi-scale questions in ecology and immunology more generally. The educational component will serve to train a diverse generation of interdisciplinary scientists, building the capacity of the STEM workforce. Through focused short courses aimed at providing specific, relevant skills in quantitative techniques and cross-disciplinary communication, graduate students in the mathematical and life sciences will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively. Training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students will take place through focused research projects and opportunities to garner translational skills, for example developing and implementing project-based work and participating in outreach activities. Additionally, interactive presentations will engage middle school students through exposure to cutting-edge mathematical biology research.<br/> <br/>The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of interpretable, quantitative models that link mechanisms with data while accounting for variability. However, infectious disease dynamics remain incompletely understood, in part due to the lack of heterogeneity considered in models of immunological, ecological, and epidemiological aspects. Complex, non-linear feedbacks arise from heterogeneities; thus, novel quantitative frameworks are needed to better understand and control infectious disease. This project builds on work in ecology involving integral projection models to develop a framework incorporating trait-based variation. This framework aims to describe development of immunity in a population and, thus, determine disease risk over time. Results will be useful for monitoring infectious disease, selecting interventions, and informing public policy. The educational component aims to strengthen quantitative literacy to help produce a more interdisciplinary workforce. A group of graduate students, across applied, mathematical, and computational disciplines, will be introduced to fundamental quantitative skills such as statistical analyses, model building, parameter estimation, data visualization, and coding.

It quantifies the state of randomness or uncertainty of a physical system and has numerous applications in machine learning, data compression, and quantum mechanics. In this project entropy is studied in two settings. In the first the entropy of a dynamical system is considered. Dynamical systems describe the state of a certain physical system (e.g., amount of a certain gas inside a room, spread of viruses) as it changes in time. It is useful and natural to make ?time? abstract and replace it with a discrete system of symmetries called ?groups.? Dynamical entropy was originally defined through an information theory viewpoint, and recent developments show that this perspective allows one to expand entropy theory to evolution under a certain class of groups called ?sofic groups.? In this new framework, entropy describes how many finitary approximations an infinitary system has; a fundamental question of scientific inquiry. The second setting for entropy is in the context of von Neumann algebras (specifically in free probability), which arise naturally as the setting for quantum mechanics and provide a precise framework for quantum computing. Potential applications in cryptography are vast. Investigating entropy in this setting amounts to understanding the disorder of a quantum mechanical system. These problems have links to functional analysis, ergodic theory, operator algebras, random matrices, and geometry, some of which will be explicitly addressed. The educational component is directly aimed at broadening participation in mathematics and the sciences. This includes starting a teaching and diversity seminar at the University of Virginia to create a more diverse inclusive environment in the department and running a summer school to bring researchers in different fields together. An expansion is planned for the role of the bridge program at the University of Virginia, as well as the department's involvement with the math alliance. These two endeavors are explicitly aimed at increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/> <br/> <br/>This proposal revolves around two main projects. The first is the study of entropy in algebraic actions, which are actions of a discrete group on a compact group by automorphisms. One goal is to completely settle the connections between f-invariant entropy for algebraic actions of free groups and a generalized torsion theory (in the sense of topology) for noncompact Riemannian manifolds defined via Hilbert spaces. Planned is an extension of our current understanding of which algebraic actions are isomorphic to Bernoulli shifts. In von Neumann algebras, the principal investigator will expand on his recent joint work showing that Property (T) von Neumann algebras have few finite-dimensional approximations. These concepts will be generalized to groups with vanishing first cohomology with values in the left regular representation, as well as to inner amenable groups. Expansion of these results is planned to twisted group von Neumann algebras, and compact quantum groups, provided such objects have vanishing first cohomology in natural analogues of the left regular representation. Lastly, the term mean dimension will be adapted from the ergodic theory setting to the von Neumann algebraic setting with the ultimate goal of settling the famous generator problem for von Neumann algebras in the negative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important questions are: As time evolves, will electrons escape, showing metal-like behavior of the material, or will electrons stay confined near their original positions, showing insulator-like behavior? Furthermore, are there mathematical ways to quantify these behaviors? Understanding these features in different materials, including multi-layer graphene, has important applications, including electricity transmission, design of room-temperature superconductor, and quantum computing. The educational part of this project includes leading undergraduate research groups, mentoring graduate students, developing graduate courses on material sciences and spectral theory, organizing conferences and workshops for junior researchers to present and exchange ideas, and developing an online lecture series on modern research topics for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>Of specific interest in this project is the analysis of the magnetic Laplacian, which characterizes the motion of electrons under external magnetic fields and is a central topic in quantum mechanics. For magnetic fluxes with irrational magnitude, the spectra of the discrete magnetic Laplacians on the square lattice form a beautiful self-similar fractal structure called Hofstadter?s butterfly. This fractal structure, in particular the existence of spectral gaps, was a cornerstone of the first derivation of the quantum Hall effect and the theory of topological insulators. The planned focus lies on developing techniques to study magnetic Laplacians on various discrete lattices, including the bilayer graphene lattice. The topics of investigation include the magic-angle bilayer graphene, metal-insulator transitions, spectral gaps and quantum Hall effect, Anderson localization and eigenfunction asymptotics, and quantum dynamics.

The anticipated findings of this agenda should be applicable to mathematical models used to predict the stability and optimal shape of a wide range of small and large parts of our physical world: from cell membranes, fluid droplets, and airplane wings, to the interface between different layers of the Earth's atmosphere, the event horizon of a black hole, and even the entire universe.  Pedagogical efforts will engage graduate and undergraduate students in the discovery process. The latter will be supported by the creation of a 3D printing and visualization lab at CUNY Lehman College, which will be the first of its kind in any public institution of higher education in the Bronx borough of New York City, enabling new forms of inquiry-based instruction grounded on experiential learning. This facility will also be used to host events in partnership with CUNY Bronx Community College, to attract more students to Mathematics and help address the current lack of diversity and overall shortage of workers with STEM qualifications.<br/><br/>The lines of investigation in this project can be separated in two main categories, involving novel applications of either convex algebraic geometry or bifurcation theory to geometric analysis. In the first category, new topological obstructions to curvature conditions on closed manifolds will be sought through strategies that combine recently developed convex optimization tools, such as semidefinite programming, and classical local-to-global methods, including Chern-Weil theory, Index theory for twisted Dirac operators, and the Bochner technique. In particular, extremal values of polynomials on spectrahedral shadows of curvature operators will be used to bound characteristic numbers of certain manifolds with nonnegative or nonpositive sectional curvature, or special holonomy. These bounds are expected to shed new light on the Hopf Questions about existence of positively curved metrics in products of spheres, and the sign of the Euler characteristic in nonnegative or nonpositive curvature, as well as on the Stolz conjecture on the Witten genus of string manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. In the second category, global results from bifurcation theory will be used to analyze issues regarding symmetry, stability, rigidity, and multiplicity of minimal and constant mean curvature hypersurfaces, Einstein metrics, and solutions to other partial differential equations that arise in conformal or complex geometry, such as the Yamabe problem and its many variants.

To classify manifolds, one studies relationships between them; one such relationship is that of a branched cover. The PI will develop combinatorial and computational tools to study branched covers of three- and four-dimensional manifolds.

While the Big Data revolution brings a great opportunity to obtain valuable and profound insights from the richness of data and to enhance data-driven decision making, it also brings challenging demands for innovation and knowledge discovery in three crucial aspects from statisticians and data scientists: (i) development of flexible models that can appropriately describe the complexities of the data (ii) efficient and valid statistical estimation and inferential procedures, and (iii) development of computational algorithms that scale-up to large datasets. The purpose of this project is to make advances in all the three aspects by fully exploring the Bayesian framework, which treats the parameters of a model to be random and provides an efficient mechanism to quantify the uncertainty of the model parameters. In particular, the techniques developed will be useful for analyzing datasets containing a large number of covariates, for learning the dependence structures between a large number of outcome variables, and for obtaining a comprehensive description of the impact of covariates on outcome variables by modeling their relationships at different quantile levels. The research developed will have impact on statistical practice in various disciplines including biology, economics, environmental sciences, marketing, and medical sciences.

In contrast to most of the existing Bayesian approaches that focus on high dimensional estimation, a novel Bayesian framework for performing high dimensional Bayesian inference having valid frequentist properties will be developed. Scalable computational techniques that do not involve large matrix operations for obtaining point estimators from the posteriors as well as for sampling the full posterior distributions will be devised and their statistical properties will be studied. An attractive feature of the computational developments will be that they will be applicable to a diverse range of statistical models commonly used in practice.

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via (i) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and (ii) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. A primary focus of the principal investigator will be the analysis of the two-dimensional water wave equations, which govern the evolution of a free fluid surface, or of the interface between two fluids. The goal is to provide a better description of both the local dynamics (e.g. low regularity solutions and formation of singularities) and of global dynamics in fluid flows. Here, by singularities in free boundary problems, the principal investigator means evolutions where the interface loses smoothness, possibly forming a corner-like singularity followed by ""wave breaking''.  Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves, tsunami formation, just to mention a few. While this wave breaking is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor, and the mathematical justification of the phenomena based on the constitutive equations is rather difficult and is fully open at this time. This project aims to tackle a selection of key open problems related to singularity formation and to long-time properties of solutions to several classes of dispersive and hyperbolic equations that arise from a physical or geometric context, largely motivated by fluid dynamics. The project includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of the project is to understand the long-time behavior of solutions of the water waves. This includes lifespan estimates as well as global in time dynamics and scattering properties, where possible.  From this perspective there are two key properties that play a role: one is the ""dispersive decay'', and the other is the ``resonance analysis''.  Some of the key tools developed by the PI and collaborators (the ""quasilinear modified energy method'', and the ""testing with wave packets method'') will contribute to a better understanding of the proposed problems, but nevertheless, improvements of the existing methods and the need to develop new and robust techniques remain essential in order to describe, for instance, the singularity formation mechanism.

Such a development will increase our ability to control practical systems. Due to physical and technological limitations, available ways of perturbing a mechanical system are often constrained. For example, it is difficult to individually force single atoms in order to control a molecular system. On the other hand, partial intervention is often easier; for instance, an oscillatory electromagnetic field can interact with charged atoms and induce perturbations to the system, which are however in restricted forms. When the available perturbations are restricted, they may be inadequate to induce immediate favorable changes to the system. However, the key idea is that, if introduced at a smaller scale, perturbations can accumulate and contribute in less restrictive ways to the original scale. Based on this idea, the project develops a framework for designing the perturbation so that its accumulated effect can alter the system's macroscopic behavior in a desired fashion. Numerical computations and the development of computational tools will also be seamlessly integrated with the theoretical analysis. To illustrate the innovation of the proposed research, note that traditional control theory is still important, albeit insufficient, because the control is introduced at a microscopic level, yet one needs and only needs to control the system's macroscopic behavior. Brute-force computational search for the optimal control will also be practically infeasible due to the wide breadth of scales presented in the system. The research is to use theoretical analysis (based on tools from fields such as dynamical systems and multiscale methods) to either directly design or accelerate the computational search of control strategies. The study will also be complemented by investigations in multiple interdisciplinary applications, such as DNA deactivation, remote control of locomotion, temporal metamaterials, and recovery of material defects. Research will be integrated with education across multiple institutions and over the spectrum of academic levels. Specifics are planned for broadening women and underrepresented groups' participation and disseminating knowledge beyond PI's immediate institute or discipline.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project identifies (mostly-)oscillatory perturbations for accomplishing various control tasks, such as to steer a system from a macroscopic state to another, or to track a desired dynamic behavior at the macroscopic level for all time. The main methodology is to design microscopic perturbations that resonantly interact with the system, so that nontrivial effects cascade to the macroscopic scale. The PI has already obtained several preliminary results on this idea, and the proposed theory will be a generalization. The strategy of investigation is to first quantify how small-scale perturbations effectively accumulate at large-scale using dynamical systems tools, asymptotic/multiscale methods, and numerical computations, followed by the patching together of the local understandings for the global objective of control design. An example of core tasks is to identify and then track slowly-varying resonant frequencies in nonlinear systems. Integrable, nearly-integrable, and stochastic systems will be considered, so that an ambitious goal of controlling complicated dynamics can be gradually approached.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the existing statistical theory remains highly inadequate in explaining many new phenomena that emerge, and become pervasive in modern machine learning applications. For instance, the prevalence of over-parameterized models (i.e., the ones that have more model parameters than samples) challenges our classical statistical insights about the bias-variance tradeoff; the fact that many learning algorithms exhibit favorable algorithmic regularization to alleviate overfitting is largely beyond the reach of previous statistical literature, and the unconventional shapes of the risk curves in modern applications puzzle many statisticians. Compared to the rich theory developed for classical settings, however, the statistical underpinnings for these curious yet mysterious phenomena remain far from sufficient. Motivated by this, the overarching goal of the project is to enrich the statistical foundation of machine learning by adapting it to contemporary settings, thereby bridging classical statistics and cutting-edge machine learning. In addition, the project will provide valuable opportunities for training students (particularly underrepresented groups) at all levels across multiple disciplines in the STEM field, and will exert scientific and societal impacts on several domains beyond the tasks described herein, including but not limited to neuroscience, online education, and equitable machine learning.<br/><br/>Striving for interpretability and actionable insights, this project plans to revisit multiple classical statistical problems---ranging from minimum-norm interpolation, risk estimation, cross validation, kernel boosting, data-imbalanced classification, to transfer learning---with an emphasis on unveiling new insights for modern yet under-explored regimes. Several recurring themes include: (i) characterizing precise risk behavior in the face of large model complexity; (ii) reconciling the seemingly conflicting goals of over-parameterization and regularization; (iii) developing algorithm-specific statistical reasoning tools; and (iv) exploring the interplay between regularization and generalization. The project comprises three distinct yet related thrusts: (1) statistical insights for over-parameterization: which explores the prolific interplay between model complexity and out-of-sample performance; (2) algorithmic regularization via early stopping: which aims to develop statistical principles that underlie early stopping; (3) risk (non)-monotonicity with imbalanced data: which is motivated by the non-monotonicity of generalization errors in the sample size and pursues principled debiasing methods to rectify it. The project will develop a suite of statistical insights that can inform cutting-edge machine learning practice, as well as an array of statistical methodologies that will be practically appealing for modern data-driven applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to understand the deep connections between the field of Fourier analysis and questions in geometric measure theory concerning fractals. Fractals refer to a type of sets originating from natural shapes such as coastlines, snowflakes, crystals, and DNA, which display a self-similar structure across different scales. The study of fractals has numerous applications in natural sciences and engineering. This project aims to advance our understanding of fractals by exploring modern ideas in Fourier analysis, a field in mathematics that studies properties of a function by decomposing it into small pieces. One of the most famous open questions at the interface of these two subjects is the Kakeya conjecture, asserting that a fractal set that contains a unit line segment in every direction must not be too small (in terms of dimension). This conjecture is known to be closely related to central questions in analysis, partial differential equations, and number theory. In recent years, tools and ideas from combinatorics also came into the picture, which led to many breakthroughs in the field. The investigator plans to advance the study of this type of problems by using and inventing an array of interdisciplinary tools. This research will deepen the understanding of fractals and Fourier analysis, shed light on important questions in other fields, and potentially lead to discoveries in physics, biology, engineering, and computer sciences. Moreover, the research is expected to be integrated into the investigator's educational plan to nurture a new generation of researchers and educators, and to bring the research to a broader audience. Specifically, the investigator plans to run multiple study guide writing workshops, to organize an online research platform dedicated to small working groups, and to create a YouTube channel for the field of harmonic analysis. These activities are designed to not only advance the research projects, but also provide one-of-a-kind opportunities for students and early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>The broad aim of the project is to make progress towards open questions such as the Kakeya conjecture and the Falconer distance conjecture (on the dimensional threshold ensuring a fractal set to generate many distinct distances), to develop novel tools unifying ideas from different fields, and to explore their further applications in other related fields such as for the study of regularity of solutions to Schrdinger and wave equations in partial differential equations and number of solutions to Diophantine equations in number theory. There are three interconnected long-term goals: (A) understand the existence, amount, and distribution of geometric configurations (generalizing distances) contained in fractal sets; (B) investigate sparse domination for operators arising in geometric measure theory and their applications in finite point configuration problems; (C) study key operators in Fourier analysis related to the Kakeya conjecture such as (weighted) Fourier restriction/extension operators, Bochner-Riesz multipliers, and the Kakeya maximal function. The project is expected to advance the understanding of these central problems, to open the door to the systematic study of refined geometric structures of fractals, to develop novel interdisciplinary techniques, to reveal deeper connections between continuous and discrete questions, and to discover new connections among these fields and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This illustrates the unifying power of mathematical dynamics, which is the primary focus of this project. The PI's research program will connect the geometry of low-dimensional phase spaces with the dynamics of the systems that they support, with an eye towards applications in both geometry and dynamics.

Riemannian manifolds appear everywhere in physics, modeling the membrane of a cell as well as spacetime in general relativity, and Riemannian geometry offers fundamental tools to study their properties.  One concept of paramount importance, when studying physical objects as well as Riemannian manifolds in general, is that of symmetry, that is, the degree of ""self similarity"" of a geometric object, which make it invariant under certain length-preserving transformations (called isometries). Symmetry can be further generalized with the idea of partitioning a geometric object into ""sheets"", which stay parallel to one another. This idea, formalized by the mathematical concept of singular Riemannian foliation, is at the center of the mathematical investigation of this project.  Here, we use ideas introduced by the PI and collaborators to study the local behavior of these structures, as well as use them globally to produce new  manifolds with desirable curvature.  In this project, geometry is also used as a broad concept to encompass a number of activities for the mathematical community and society in general, such as:  1) Organizing a four-weeks-long thematic program in Metric Geometry, with schools for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a week-long conference.  2) Organizing a weekly math camp for girls in 3rd grade and up which is aimed at addressing the gender imbalance in the mathematical disciplines.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to study singular Riemannian foliations, both to further understand their structure and to apply them to Invariant Theory and Riemannian Geometry.  The local study of singular Riemannian foliations, namely foliations on a Euclidean space with the origin as one leaf, generalizes orthogonal representations of Lie groups. The PI proved in a recent joint work that infinitesimal submetries have an algebraic counterpart, given by certain polynomial algebras called Laplacian algebras. This opens the door to a novel approach called ""Invariant theory without groups"", consisting in understanding how to read geometric properties of manifold submetries off of their Laplacian algebra, and apply these techniques to the special case in which the submetry comes from an orthogonal representation.  Globally, singular Riemannian foliations can conjecturally arise from collapsing sequences of manifolds with a uniform lower sectional curvature bound: One project will try to prove this locally. Furthermore, singular Riemannian foliations will be used to produce new examples of manifolds with non-negative and positive curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some invariants are stable in the sense that they are independent of certain spatial dimension shifts. They are easier to compute because they are in some sense more algebraic. This project has two main themes. The first line of investigation is in chromatic homotopy theory, a field of mathematics that studies structural properties of stable invariants. This part of the project seeks to answer questions such as: Are there families of stable invariants that share common properties? What kind of symmetries exist for these families? How can these symmetries be used to do explicit computations and learn new things about fundamental geometric objects such as higher dimensional spheres? The second line of investigation is part of a multi-disciplinary collaboration with mathematicians and physicists, which uses stable invariants to study the phase of matter. A quantum system is a collection of interacting particles and, roughly, a phase is a family of quantum systems that may be different microscopically, but share certain macroscopic properties. For certain types of quantum systems, the phase type can be detected by stable invariants. This project aims to construct new stable invariants of phases and to study stable invariants of quantum systems equipped with certain symmetries. The broader goal is to make progress on the classification of phases of matter to better understand the fundamental properties of materials. The project has an integrated educational component, one goal of which is to make the two areas of research accessible to graduate students and advanced undergraduates through a series of graduate workshops. The educational plan also includes undergraduate and graduate research. In particular, the project will conduct research in collaboration with existing initiatives at the University of Colorado, Boulder that work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM. An important goal is to increase the accessibility of research for underrepresented minorities in mathematics.<br/><br/>Stable invariants are studied using generalized cohomology theories or, more specifically, mathematical objects called spectra.  Chromatic homotopy theory aims to classify families of spectra according to different periodic behaviors exhibited by the stable invariants they compute. There is a close relationship between periodic behaviors and the symmetries of the spectrum. This project uses equivariant techniques to better understand this relationship. It has applications to the study of stable homotopy groups of spheres. Specifically, the project explores theoretical and computational properties of equivariant generalizations of Lubin-Tate theories that are built from the Real bordism spectrum, an equivariant generalization of complex bordism. The project develops techniques to compute the equivariant stable invariants arising from these theories. In a different direction, the project examines a conjecture that parametrized gapped invertible phases of matter form a generalized cohomology theory. The project proposes the construction of a ground-state bundle for parametrized quantum systems and explores how equivariant homotopy theory can inform the study of systems with symmetries. The project aims to increase accessibility of these topics to students in two ways. First, the project includes two five days mathematical events that combine a graduate workshop with research talks with a focus on the main areas of research of the project. These are to be part of an ongoing series that will continue beyond the five year duration of the  project. These events will create an interactive and collaborative environment between participants and experts by incorporating active-learning in the program structure. Secondly, the project will engage in academic term and summer undergraduate research opportunities in topology and phases of matter with a goal to increase access to undergraduate research for students from historically excluded groups in mathematics.

It was Charles Ehresmann in 1935 who started the study of deformation spaces of geometric structures, asking which ""shapes"" can be ""locally modeled"" on a certain geometry. In 1982 William Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, now a theorem, thanks to Grigori Perelman, renewed the interest in locally homogeneous spaces, that is spaces that look the same at each point. The PI proposes to study families of structures on manifolds and how they change when one perturbs them, focusing in particular on geometric and dynamical aspects. As a broader impact, the PI wants to develop a more inclusive environment for undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs and early career mathematicians. She proposes to organize: a Directed Reading Program which pairs undergraduate students with graduate mentors for independent projects; a Women in Geometry and Topology network with a website, annual dinners at conferences and summer retreats where participants will start mutual collaborations; a Mid-Atlantic Math Alliance Program to build a regional community of mentors who will work with underrepresented minority students to help them succeed in their careers; Log Cabin Conferences gathering a small group of researchers (many early career) in a remote location to learn a new topic in a collaborative atmosphere. In addition, she plans to continue organize the Diversity Lecture Series, an annual Sonia Day for middle school girls, the Math Club for undergraduate students at UVa, to be faculty advisor for the AWM Student Chapter, mentor for the AWM program and for the Math Alliance program, to organize the Geometry Seminar, the Virginia Topology Conference and annual graduate reading courses.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic structures are the prototypical example of geometric structures with interesting deformation spaces. The PI wants to use results and techniques developed in the context of hyperbolic structures for studying other geometric structures.

A lot of deformation spaces arise from spaces of representations of the fundamental group of a manifold into a Lie group, so the PI is also planning to continue the study of the dynamical decomposition of character varieties of free groups, and of fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds with compressible boundary. Finally, the PI wants to study ""higher Teichmueller theory,"" that is ""nice'"" representations of a surface group into Lie groups of higher real rank, and Anosov representations, which are a dynamical analogue of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Since Anosov representations turn out to be generalizations of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one Lie groups to the context of discrete subgroups of Lie groups of higher rank, the PI plans to use techniques developed for Kleinian groups in order to study limits of Anosov representations. Differently from classical Teichmuller theory, it is not known, in general, if these representations are holonomies of geometric structures. The PI wants to study this question, together with the description of limits of these representations and a different topology on these spaces, the geometric topology. The PI thinks that results and techniques coming from differential geometry and low-dimensional topology will inspire new research directions with deep connections with dynamical systems, Lie theory, complex analysis, and even algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this research program is to understand how properties of these functions depend upon the underlying geometry of the space being studied. The project includes two main educational efforts. The first is the creation of working groups for incoming graduate students; its goal is to prepare the students to develop a strong set of skills to apply for grants and to prepare them for teaching. The second is the development of online materials for a course on semiclassical analysis that will be available for students to use whenever the in-person version of the course is not offered.  <br/><br/>Understanding the behavior of Laplace eigenfunctions is of fundamental importance in mathematical physics and has been studied since the 1700s. In particular, the challenging study of concentration properties of high energy eigenfunctions has been the subject of extensive work, and the tools developed for studying Laplace eigenfunctions have had a profound impact on nearly every area of spectral theory and geometric analysis. This project concerns a framework developed by the investigator to extract information on the structure of eigenfunctions from their concentration and propagation behavior in phase space via the use of semiclassical analysis. The current research aims to adapt and develop these methods to reach a deeper understanding of eigenfunction behavior by studying their pointwise growth, L^p-norms, associated two-point Weyl Laws, and applications to random waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Far from being esoteric, this world describes the procession of the days of the week (p = 7), the fundamentals of computer architecture (p = 2), and is also the setting for important cryptosystems.  Characteristic p algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects (""varieties"") given by solutions to polynomial equations in this world (e.g., the elliptic curves fundamental to the aforementioned cryptosystems), whereas mixed characteristic algebraic geometry is the study of varieties in a ""hybrid"" world serving as a bridge from the characteristic p world to our more familiar world where all directions go on forever. A singularity is a place where a variety has crossings, corners, or otherwise fails to be smooth. This project brings new algebraic techniques to bear on the topic of singularities in mixed characteristic algebraic geometry, with one main goal to explicitly analyze what processes are necessary to ""resolve"" them, i.e, smooth them out. The educational plan for the project provides opportunities at levels from high school to graduate school. Specifically, the PI's graduate students will work directly with the PI on the main research project, the PI will advise undergraduate research in related areas of number theory, the PI will help plan events for Baruch College's chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics, and the PI will continue his commitment to mathematics education in Liberia by running a mathematics competition for Liberian high school students, as well as a series of remote workshops for their teachers.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is dedicated to applications and generalizations of Mac Lane valuations, which give explicit, computationally useful descriptions of normal models of the projective line over a valued field. Mac Lane valuations date back over 80 years, but it is only this past decade that they have been successfully used to attack problems involving models of curves, such as computing resolutions of certain arithmetic surface singularities and verifying conductor-discriminant inequalities. The PI will apply Mac Lane valuations to (1) refine his previous results on conductor-discriminant inequalities for hyperelliptic curves and extend them to superelliptic curves and (2) shed light on the relationship between regular models, semistable models, and the ramification theory of ``purely arithmetic'' covers of Berkovich spaces. Furthermore, he will work to build a theory of Mac Lane valuations for higher genus curves. The second part of the project is devoted to understanding when branched Galois covers of curves lift from characteristic p to characteristic zero and to obtaining information about the geometry of the space of lifts. The PI will use moduli-theoretic techniques to attack the lifting problem in towers for cyclic covers, and he will continue his long-term work toward a classification of the so-called local Oort groups and the weak local Oort groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LQG originated from the study of 2D quantum gravity and string theory in theoretical physics. Subsequently, LQG has become an active and deep mathematical subject in probability. The research part of the project funded by this award aims to address outstanding challenges in the mathematical theory of LQG, thereby providing a firm foundation for several assumptions in theoretical physics. The educational part of the project aims to make high quality mathematical education and research more accessible, in particular, to students from underrepresented groups, researchers from geographically disadvantaged areas, and high school mathematics teachers.<br/><br/>Quantum gravity is the physics counterpart of random geometry. It is believed in physics that 2D quantum gravity coupled with conformal matter is described by LQG, governed by a conformal field theory (CFT) called Liouville CFT. The most intuitive formulation of 2D quantum gravity is through its microscopic description, namely random planar maps. The primary research goal of the project is to show that certain classical random planar map models converge to LQG in the scaling limit, laying a mathematical foundation for this physical picture. The two most challenging cases are when the random geometry is non-uniform or when the underlying surface is non-simply-connected. The project aims to address open questions in both cases. Besides the geometric aspect, the correlation functions of Liouville CFT possess deep algebraic structures, which are expected to be computed by a schematic program called the conformal bootstrap. Another major goal of the research is to rigorously establish the conformal bootstrap program for Liouville CFT. To achieve these goals, the PI will rely on the rich interplay between LQG and a family of random planar curves called the Schramm-Loewner evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coherent structures, such as vortices (eddies) and shear flows, are prominent features in fluid dynamics. The formation, stability, and evolution of coherent structures are critical fluid phenomena to understand in order to reduce drag, oscillation, and instability in scientific and engineering applications.

On the one hand, the approximation should be tractable to gain computational benefits. On the other hand, the approximation needs to be tight, so as to not compromise much in terms of the statistical optimality of the original problem. This project aims to bridge the computational and theoretical gaps in various statistical problems under complex and nonstandard settings.

However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation of variational inference from both the computational and statistical perspective.

In some situations, minimizers to these natural energies exhibit singularities ? places where the solution is not smooth. This project investigates the formation and structure of such singularities.

In medicine, for instance, machine learning is routinely deployed  for image segmentation, registration, computer aided detection and diagnosis, brain function or activity analysis from fMR images, and text analysis of radiology reports using natural language processing. In spite of this nascent ML trend, there has been significant reluctance to delegate decision making entirely to machine intelligence. This has been largely due to  the absence of a formal statistical framework for  uncertainty quantification  and  interpretability. This yawning gap between theory and practice presents new exciting research opportunities for theoretical developments that will justify and unleash the potential machine-assisted decision making in real life. This project has two broad objectives. The first one is motivated by the currently unmet demand for theoretical justification of widely used Bayesian machine learning tools. The second objective is developing practicable methodology for interpretable machine learning, which is essential for gleaning insights into the behavior of real-world processes.  The research outlined in this project will bridge current conceptual divides between statistics and machine learning by solidifying Bayesian machine-assisted inference as statistically valid so that it can be safely used to tackle complex scientific problems arising in data-rich environments including imaging, personalized medicine, business analytics, marketing and economics. <br/><br/><br/>There has been a growing realization of the potential of Bayesian machine learning as a platform that can provide both flexible modeling, accurate predictions as well as coherent uncertainty statements. In particular, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) has emerged as one of today's most effective machine learning methods under minimal assumptions. BART has already proved itself to be broadly effective at unveiling structure hidden in high dimensional data across a wide variety of contemporary applications. Its theoretical properties for statistical inference, however, have remained unknown. The detailed research agenda of the first three goals aims at obtaining an in-depth theoretical understanding of BART (as well as some aspects of Bayesian deep learning) through the investigation of (1) uncertainty quantification and confidence set constructions, (2) adaptability to spatially inhomogeneous objects, (3) asymptotic normality for causal inference. The completion of these objectives will significantly advance the current frontier of semi-parametric and non-parametric Bayesian theory. The principal investigator will develop new scalable tools for interpretable machine learning which will extend the reach of ML to many new application areas and problem types involving big data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent years have seen tremendous advances in the ability of machine learning algorithms to replicate and even exceed human performance on many of these tasks. However, we still lack a theoretical understanding of when large scale machine learning will work well to discover interesting patterns and structure in data, and when it will fail to do so and overfit. These problems have recently manifested in adversarial hacking of deep neural networks, which poses risks in sensitive applications where data privacy and security are paramount. The objective of this project is to use the theory of partial differential equations and the calculus of variations to study foundational problems in machine learning and data science, and develop new, more efficient, algorithms founded on strong theoretical principles. The project will advance data science education by developing an annual summer school for high school students on graph-based learning, mentoring high-school students from the University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program, developing graduate courses on current research in graph-based learning, and supporting the participation of women and underrepresented groups in all aspects of the project.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to use partial differential equation (PDE) continuum limits for discrete machine learning problems to analyze existing algorithms, develop new algorithms with better performance guarantees, and make new connections between machine learning and PDEs. A major focus of the project is graph-based learning, where discrete learning algorithms on graphs can be interpreted as discretizations of continuum PDEs, and properties of those PDEs (e.g., regularity and well-posedness) convey information about the learning problem and can lead to new algorithms founded on strong theoretical principles. In particular, the project will (1) develop and study a new algorithm, called Poisson learning, for graph-based semi-supervised learning at very low labeling rates, (2) draw new connections between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and viscosity solutions of nonlinear PDEs, showing that SGD has the ability to select good minimizers in ill-posed problems, (3) use ideas from classical elliptic regularity theory to prove interior Lipschitz regularity for solutions of graph-based learning problems on random geometric graphs, (4) prove generalization bounds for graph-based learning in low label-rate regimes, including the active learning setting, and (5) develop a consistency theory for learning problems on directed graphs, such as ranking algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely established that, in the future, quantum computing can revolutionize the way one performs and thinks about computation and serve as the backbone of groundbreaking new technologies for scientific discovery, engineering design, national security, and business development, to name a few. Currently, the key barrier in the development of quantum computing is the error induced by the noise in the hardware. The research goal of this project is to develop methods to model the error propagation in quantum computing algorithms and filter the resulting noise in the outcomes.

The educational goals of this effort are to prepare students for interdisciplinary research and promote STEM participation and equity among underrepresented groups. Outreach activities also involve K-12 students. <br/><br/>The investigator will develop new uncertainty quantification methods in the following four directions to understand and alleviate the effect of noise on quantum computing algorithms: (1) describing propagation of gate error and readout error using epistemic uncertainty models; (2) mitigating errors using constrained optimization methods and Bayesian approaches; (3) analyzing asymptotic behavior of the propagation of the error; (4) developing an open-source software package to implement the uncertainty quantification algorithms. These new methods will leverage Bayesian inference approaches, tensor decomposition techniques, asymptotic analysis tools for stochastic differential equations, and high-performance computing packages to build the foundation of a ""quantum numerical analysis"" framework from a probabilistic perspective. This framework is general, and it can be used to assess the performance of real-world quantum processors and evaluate the suitability of specific quantum computing hardware architectures for a wide range of applications.

The work is interdisciplinary, and success will come from blending techniques from engineering and physics with pure mathematical analysis. Rigorous optimization questions are considered to identify the most extreme examples, with the aim of deriving a general theory for predicting the motifs of wrinkles and folds in packed elastic sheets, as well as general techniques for the design of load-bearing morphable materials. Outreach activities to high school students are planned, involving university students and researchers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. With the goal of training the next generation of effective mathematical researchers working at the intersection of variational analysis and the mechanics of materials, this project supports undergraduate research infrastructure, and provide support and mentoring opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The research concentrates on two sets of questions from mechanics: on stress focusing in confined elastic shells and related one-dimensional systems, and on the aggregate properties of many body interacting elastic systems known as mechanical metamaterials. On stress focusing: the aim is to develop a variational model of the wrinkle-fold state, which has recently been observed in confined shells but has yet to receive a systematic mathematical treatment. Based on prior successes with predicting the wrinkling patterns of shallow shells, the investigator seeks an asymptotic characterization of the more general wrinkle-fold state starting from fully nonlinear elasticity. On mechanical metamaterials: motivated by the question of predicting the overall behaviors of kirigami elastic systems in response to applied loads, the investigator aims to characterize the effective deformations and emergent stress-strain laws of these and other related many body elastic systems.

Tail dependent time series, as an emerging data type, has been observed and recognized in various fields including actuarial science, climate science, economics, finance, hydrology, and internet traffic engineering, among others. The task of understanding and appropriately accommodating the phenomenon of tail dependence can be of significant importance to the modeling of extreme events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and financial crises. The results from the project will make significant impacts in scientific areas such as climate science, economics, actuarial science, finance, hydrology and internet traffic engineering. The proposal also involves an integrated education plan to expose undergraduate and high school students to the topic, to equip graduate and advanced undergraduate students with a desirable level of statistical reasoning and analytical skills for analyzing tail dependent time series, and to mentor doctoral students to become future leaders in the education and research of the area. <br/><br/>Existing methods for studying tail dependent time series often rely on certain parametric models for describing the underlying tail dependence structure. This is particularly due to the lack of a convenient and rigorous framework that one can use to obtain desired limit theorems for a general class of tail dependent time series. The project aims to address this fundamental problem by proposing a new framework based on the causal representation and the technique of adversarial tail coupling. Using the newly proposed framework, the project will develop meaningful results toward a tail m-dependent approximation scheme, which can then be used as a powerful tool to obtain limit theorems for statistics of tail dependent data. Compared with the conventional m-dependent approximation, the current setting can be more challenging due to the double asymptotics where the quantile index is allowed to approach either zero or one as the sample size increases to reflect extreme risks. The project will study several statistical inference problems for tail dependent time series, including high quantile estimation and its associated confidence interval construction, tail dependence visualization and testing, inference of extremely high quantiles using the extreme value theory, extensions to high and extremely high quantile regression models, and high-dimensional nonstationary settings. The results to be developed are expected to be useful in identifying undiscovered features in certain climate science and economic data, and applicable to other scientific problems that involve the analysis of tail dependent time series.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include recommender systems, neural recordings, and influenza prediction, where decision-making is constantly updated as more data arrives and thus the problems are best represented with models capturing the online nature of data. With collective efforts from statistics, computer science, and optimization, a large toolbox has been developed to efficiently make an update to the model based on one data point at a time, whereas much less is explored about how to quantify uncertainty of the predictions in these online learning problems. For example, to what extent can we trust the predictions of an online learning algorithm, and how different would the predictions be by updating the model with more data? The investigator will develop a new framework involving theory, algorithms, and software to quantify uncertainty for a large class of online learning algorithms. The methods developed through this research project will be applied to large-scale classification problems in online learning, with the goal of enhancing interpretability of the predictions.  All methods will be implemented in software that will be broadly disseminated to practitioners who work on online learning tasks.

The algorithmic randomness of stochastic gradient descent is potentially non-negligible and could even jeopardize the interpretation of predictions at worst. Taking a fully inferential viewpoint, the proposed research has a detailed research agenda that aims to obtain an in-depth understanding of uncertainty quantification for stochastic gradient descent through three fundamental topics: (1) constructing confidence intervals for online learning with convex objectives, (2) quantifying uncertainty for deep neural networks, and (3) accelerating stochastic optimization in the online setting. Taken together, the proposed research projects will build a firm foundation for integrating statistical inferential ideas into stochastic optimization using streaming data, with research output feeding back into the development of practical methodology for analyzing online datasets.

Extensive research effort has been devoted to these topics, and novel numerical methods have been developed to efficiently deal with large-scale data sets and complex problems with uncertainty. Both UQ and big data analysis enable us to better understand the impacts of various uncertain inputs (boundary and initial data, parameter values, geometry, network etc.) to numerical predictions. UQ and big data analysis are thus critical to many important practical problems such as climate modeling, weather prediction, ocean dynamics, and smart grids. As the data size and dimensions of parameter space increase, one of the biggest challenges in UQ computations and big data analysis is the computational cost for analyzing the data and running the simulations. For large-scale complex interconnected systems, deterministic simulations can be very time-consuming, and conducting UQ simulations further increases the simulation cost and can be prohibitively expensive. This project aims to address these critical challenges. A novel set of highly efficient UQ and big data analysis algorithms will be developed to make big data analysis and UQ simulations amenable for large-scale complex interconnected systems. The new algorithms will significantly advance the current state of the art of UQ and big data analysis methods. The project also integrates educational opportunities, including exposing a range of undergraduate students to UQ and big data, giving graduate students the advanced skills needed to apply them, and mentoring Ph.D. students to be leaders in UQ and big data education and research. <br/><br/>The approach under development in this research project is based on scalable algorithms for multivariate Bayesian-treed Gaussian process and power network reduction; high-dimensional UQ algorithms; dynamic state estimation and model calibration for non-Gaussian noisy data; and advanced stochastic contingency analysis. The new algorithms will be based on building multi-fidelity models in both network models and probability space. Such algorithms can accommodate big data in linear time. In addition, while current contingency analysis allows only assessment of a static power grid status without considering uncertainty, the new approaches will allow analysis of contingency dynamically and probabilistically for cascade failures. The new algorithms will allow investigators to establish an efficient framework to rigorously quantify the uncertainty, analyze big data, and endow smart grid simulations with a composite error bar."

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects. The corresponding equations contain integro-differential operators that are highly nonlinear, singular and with degenerating coefficients. Integro-differential equations of this type have received increased attention recently: well-posedness and regularity theory are being developed since many new applications have emerged, among which conformal geometry, stochastic control and image processing. The project aims at advancing knowledge in the theories of kinetic equations, nonlocal integro-differential operators and degenerate differential operators."

Geometric group theory is most often focused on quasi-isometry invariants: measurements that are insensitive to bounded (additive and multiplicative) distortion of distances. This allows us to pass between the study of groups and the spaces they act on geometrically, and between different Cayley graphs for finitely generated groups. A unifying theme for the research projects described here is the pursuit of ""finer"" approaches to asymptotic geometry through the use of more sensitive measurements.  In particular, the PI proposes to study large-scale geometric statistics that are not invariant under quasi-isometry.  This point of view facilitates the study of randomness and asymptotic density in groups, and of properties of ""typical"" geodesics in spaces.<br/><br/>The ideas in play here have already led the PI and her collaborators to new density results in free abelian groups and the Heisenberg group; new invariants used to further the classification program for right-angled Artin groups; and progress in the study of Teichmueller geometry.   Statistical geometry is broadly applicable in a range of settings outside pure mathematics, from computer science to medicine---wherever geometric models are made and long-term probabilistic prediction is required.  In addition to the research program, this proposal describes a collection of educational projects:  principally, the development of an organizational infrastructure for Research Labs engaging faculty and students from a wide variety of institutions.  Each lab will work on a cluster of problems around a coherent mathematical nucleus, with opportunities for mutli-level teaching, learning, exploration, and collaboration.  There will be conferences and journal issues coordinated with these Labs, guided by the principles of combining expository soundness with research value and emphasizing collaboration."

Development of efficient and accurate numerical algorithms for simulation of solutions to conservation laws continues to be a challenging task. Structure-preserving methods, which provide numerical solutions that preserve a certain continuum property of the underlying models exactly, are recently demonstrated to be more efficient with limited computational resources. This project aims to develop a comprehensive framework to understand structure-preserving methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The work will have a direct impact in many multi-disciplinary application areas, including fluid and gas dynamics, astrophysics, and atmospheric modeling. This project also has significant broader impact through various educational and outreach activities aimed at students at all levels. These activities include a summer camp program that will expose students including underrepresented minorities to the areas of mathematical modeling, computational science, and computational mathematics. Graduate students will also be mentored and trained through planned working group activities. <br/><br/>The notion of conservation (of number, mass, energy, momentum) is a fundamental principle that is used to derive hyperbolic conservation laws. Recent study reveals that structure-preserving numerical methods, which either conserve important physical quantities in addition to mass or preserve other properties of the underlying physical problems, are demonstrated to be more accurate and often have a much improved long time behavior. The objective of this project is to establish a detailed study of novel high-order structure-preserving methods for the linear and nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws arising in various applications, and to educate students at various levels about the potential and challenges of utilizing numerical simulation to solve important practical problems. The PI aims to study structure-preserving numerical methods in the following directions: (i) Energy conserving methods for wave equations; (ii) Asymptotic preserving methods for kinetic equations; (iii) Well-balanced methods for hyperbolic problems with source terms. The activity is planned to include new algorithm development, theoretical numerical analysis, numerical implementation, and practical applications. This project will also provide excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students interested in computational sciences, and includes an outreach program for high school students."

Classically, the symmetries of a mathematical object form a ""group"", which is a set with a binary operation such as the integers with addition. In recent decades, we have seen the emergence of quantum mathematical objects whose symmetries form a group-like structure called a ""tensor category"", which has a collection of objects with a binary fusion operation. Tensor categories are said to encode quantum symmetry: they describe topological phases of matter in physics, and they give us quantum invariants of knots and 3-dimensional surfaces.  We are currently seeing the emergence of new mathematical objects which encode ""enriched"" quantum symmetry, which describe interfaces between 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional quantum systems. At this time, we have several competing formalisms. This project aims to unify these notions and produce exotic examples through classification. The educational component of this project includes undergraduate research and Summer schools on subfactors and quantum symmetry at the Ohio State University.  The project will incorporate the principal investigators current learning materials and those developed for these programs into a book on subfactor theory.  He will also collaborate with the STEAM Factory at Ohio State University to enhance general scientific and mathematical literacy in the community.<br/><br/>This project has two main focuses: the representation and the classification of these new enriched quantum symmetries. Unitary fusion categories have objects whose dimensions are not necessarily integers, so representing unitary fusion categories requires von Neumann factors, whose modules have a notion of continuous dimension.  In this project the principal investigator will use his previous experience in the classification of small index subfactors to classify quantum symmetries enriched in small unitary ribbon categories. This will study an enriched operator algebra theory to develop an enriched subfactor theory. The principal investigator will also develop the theory of bicommutant categories, which are a higher categorical analog of von Neumann algebras originally due to Henriques. These bicommutant categories have important connections to conformal field theory, and they are expected to be an important tool in the classification of enriched quantum symmetries."

At the transition point, the properties of the system such as the volume or heat capacity may change discontinuously. The aim of our research is to study phase transitions in mathematical models using probabilistic tools in the following three directions. (1) The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a permutation is the length of a maximal subsequence of the permutation in which the elements increase. How long is the LIS for a uniformly random permutation? This question has been studied in connection with practical applications such as sorting sequences, disk drive scheduling and airplane boarding times. The mathematical study of the LIS has revealed deep and unexpected connections of the problem with areas such as the theory of random matrices, analytic combinatorics and random polymer models.  The proposed research aims to study the LIS when the permutation is drawn from certain non-uniform distributions and associated phase transitions. (2) Many computational problems can be phrased as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) where one wants to find a solution to a number of variables with a set of constraints imposed on them. CSPs were first studied in computer science motivated by applications to artificial intelligence. To study the difficulty of finding solutions in typical rather than worst case scenarios, researchers study random CSPs. Using sophisticated heuristics, physicists have made detailed predictions about the location and nature of phase transitions in random CSPs. The accuracy of these heuristic predictions motivates the importance of discovering the rigorous mathematical foundations of these techniques. (3) Interacting particle processes are used to model large, randomly evolving interacting systems of agents that arise in the natural sciences including in physics and in biology. The exclusion and interchange random walks are examples of such interacting particle processes. In the symmetric case the long term mixing behavior of the random walk and the nature of phase transitions is well studied. The goal of this research is to understand the mixing properties of natural asymmetric and weighted versions of these processes. While achieving these three goals, the principal investigator will create exciting research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in probability, mentoring programs with the goal of retention of women in mathematics, and the development of online curricular material.<br/><br/>The main aim of this project is to develop new theory and analysis for phase transitions in certain discrete probabilistic models. The first problem is to study the limiting distribution of the LIS in non-uniformly random permutations by way of analyzing the fluctuations of the LIS as the parameter of the distribution is varied. The distribution is known to be Gaussian in one regime of the parameter and Tracy-Widom in another and we aim to study this transition. The second problem is to study the condensation and clustering transitions in random CSPs such as the hardcore model on random graphs. The research aims to identify the location of the reconstruction threshold more precisely in these models and to explore the connection to the clustering transition. Finally, the proposal will consider Markov processes such as asymmetric exclusion and interchange and attempt to relate the mixing times and spectral gaps of these processes to the corresponding quantities for a single particle and to understand the cutoff phenomenon for these processes."

Probabilistic models are commonly used to represent physical, biological and financial phenomena that are often however too complex to solve, approximate or even simulate. The primary purpose of this research is to rigorously investigate problems related to multiscale systems, rare events and related Monte Carlo simulation methods. We are interested in studying stochastic dynamical systems that may have different time scales and understudying and quantifying related events that may be rare in a given time scale, but can have important consequences for the system itself. Exact solutions are typically impossible, so one has to rely on simulation and for this reason rigorous development of provably-efficient approximation methods and simulation Monte Carlo methods is in the core of our analysis. The problems of interest in this project are motivated both by fundamental mathematical questions and by a broad array of questions in other branches of science. Examples range from estimation of rare event probabilities in chemical physics, genetic switch models in biology, tracking loop problems in engineering to network failure and large portfolio losses in complex financial systems, where multiscale features and rare events are core issues. In addition, the research project is integrated with an educational program that is designed to help in the training of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, engineering and chemistry in the exploration of rare events, multiscale processes and their analysis, calibration and simulation.<br/><br/>This research project leads to the development of a rigorous mathematical framework that allows to design provably efficient algorithms associated to modeling and estimation of rare events as well as statistical calibration methods. We are interested in both the large deviations regime (tail or rare events) as well as in the moderate deviations regime (the gap between the typical center and the tail of the distribution). We develop provably-efficient Monte Carlo methods such as importance sampling and statistical calibration methods. In a closely related direction we rigorously investigate the consequences of violation of time-reversibility in the design of Monte Carlo methods such as steady state simulation and algorithms for acceleration of convergence to equilibrium. The research project attempts to crystallize concepts and methods that are not well understood such as the effect of metastability on Monte Carlo methods and of multiple scales on large and moderate deviations, on Monte Carlo methods and on statistical estimation methods. The goal is to provide a useful and reliable methodology for simulation and statistical procedures for complex stochastic multiscale dynamical systems that can be used by a wide collection of disciplines and also open frontiers for research.

The research goal is to develop a systematic deep learning analysis serving as the theoretical foundation of numerous scientific problems based on deep learning; cutting-edge algorithms for the efficient solutions of high-dimensional and highly nonlinear partial differential equations arising in various application domains will also be proposed with a theoretical guarantee. The proposed deep learning-based algorithms for high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems will be expected to greatly advance the state-of-the-art simulations of complex physical systems arising in many fields in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The theoretical challenges of deep learning are largely due to the highly non-linear nature of deep neural networks (DNNs). As a function parametrization tool formulated as compositions of non-linear functions, DNNs are highly non-linear and require advanced mathematics to fully understand. Therefore, there is a critical need for new advances in mathematics for a better understanding of DNNs. The theoretical part of this project mainly focuses on the approximation and generalization capacity of DNNs. The central questions to be answered are whether DNN approximation conquers or lessens the curse of dimensionality, what is the optimal approximation rate of various function classes, and how to characterize the Rademacher complexity of various DNNs trained with state-of-the-art empirical regularization methods aiming at optimal generalization error bound. The computational part of this project concentrates on solving high dimensional and highly oscillatory partial differential equations. The specific approach of this project is to propose hybrid algorithms that combine the advantage of deep learning algorithms and traditional numerical techniques for more efficient computation and higher accuracy. The key idea is to treat deep learning solvers as a preconditioner of traditional numerical algorithms. The algorithms designed in the project will also be implemented in deep learning packages for numerical PDEs and made publicly available. Research outcomes of this project will be disseminated through conferences, publications (journal papers and textbooks), and new mathematical deep learning courses to a broad audience, especially for the next generation of computational scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Principal Investigator (PI) will study basic mathematical objects by studying their symmetries, and by studying how the objects change under transformations: this is the study of group actions.  The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.  When the objects of interest are highly complex or not easily parametrized, these problems are difficult to approach, and the PI's program centers on several new techniques to render rigidity problems tractable.  The project also involves the introduction of active-learning courses for undergraduate mathematics students, including a program to train graduate students in teaching methods, and a major workshop on effectively communicating mathematics across research areas with the aim of increasing communication between mathematicians in disparate fields.  <br/><br/><br/>A major guiding principle in the PI's work is that rigidity of group actions, in the sense of topological dynamics, is often the result of an underlying geometric structure. One example of this phenomenon is the PI's recent results on foliated circle bundles over surfaces, where it is shown that every rigid such bundle is geometric. This project builds on this success of this program, extending this theme to new contexts and applications. The PI will continue work on flat bundles and rigid monodromy group actions, using techniques from foliation theory and coarse geometry in negative curvature to study boundary actions.  Another strand of this project involves an investigation of rigidity of infinite discrete groups acting on the circle through the topology of spaces of circular orders, following work of A. Navas.

The focal points of this proposal - smoothness, quasi-invariance, and Taylor isomorphisms - are fundamental principles in the study of measures in infinite dimensions. Although these concepts have their own intrinsic interest, one may motivate their study by physical applications. For example, in quantized classical mechanics, it is standard practice to perform integration over certain infinite-dimensional spaces with respect to ""infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure."" Of course, this measure does not exist, and the appropriate replacement is Wiener measure or, for an infinite-dimensional curved space, heat kernel measure. As the integral computations physicists perform routinely involve changes of variable and differentiation, quasi-invariance and more general smoothness results for heat kernel measures are critical in giving a mathematical foundation to these formal computations. Taylor isomorphism theorems are also significant to physical applications as they are related to the important problem of quantizing Yang-Mills fields which form a key part of the ""standard model"" of particle physics. The study of hypoelliptic heat kernel measures are important in the study of sub-Riemannian geometries that appear in physical models.<br/><br/>This is an integrated project of research and training in probability. The research program focuses on the study of so-called ?heat kernel measures? in infinite dimensions. Consider a curved surface (like the Earth) to which one applies a unit of heat at a fixed point and then steps away and allows the heat to propagate. The heat kernel measure describes the evolution of the proportion of heat in subsets of the surface at some later time. As the manner in which heat diffuses relies heavily on the geometric and topological properties of the relevant space, the heat kernel measure reflects these properties and analysis of this measure reveals much about the space on which it lives. Heat kernel measures are the natural generalization to curved spaces of Gaussian measures (higher dimensional analogues of the normal distribution) which have for many decades been recognized as the appropriate measures to conduct infinite-dimensional analysis. Infinite-dimensional spaces often show up in physical models; in particular, infinite-dimensional groups appear in quantum field theory and quantum mechanics. Thus, this research program contributes to solidifying a rigorous mathematical framework for the study of quantum physics. Many of the applications have finite-dimensional models which are accessible to undergraduates or beginning graduate students.  Thus, this project has a significant training component, including involving undergraduates in research on related problems in finite dimensions.  The training program also includes mentoring of graduate students in an introduction to math outreach and promoting the retention and visibility of women researchers in probability."

This project seeks to develop new theory for such random graph processes, in order to better understand their properties, improve existing methods of analysis, and rigorously justify their applications. In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering. The educational component includes annual K-12 math teacher workshops, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,and a multidisciplinary workshop/summer school for junior researchers and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the development of new theory and applications for time-evolving random graph processes with dependencies (that grow step-by-step according to specific rules or structural constraints). One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project focuses on studying the geometric properties of the SLE curves of various kinds. To do this project, the PI will use the stochastic coupling technique he developed earlier. This technique is used to construct more than one SLE curve in single domain in such a way that the curves commute with each other. It was applied to prove the Duplantier's duality conjecture, the reversibility of chordal SLE and whole-plane SLE (for some parameters), and that it is possible to erase loops on a planar Brownian motion to get an SLE curve.

Yet, the efficient solution of large-scale, globally coupled (so-called elliptic) computational problems arising in these application areas remains a major challenge. Although integral equation (IE) methods for numerical simulation typically have optimally low cost when applied to common problems in science and engineering, their impact has been limited to a small handful of applications by technical obstacles. The purpose of this project is to take important steps to remove these obstacles. First, the project will develop novel numerical and symbolic algorithms to reduce the amount of method design and implementation work required when adapting IE methods to new classes of applications. This will make the associated cost savings of these methods more broadly accessible. Second, the project will design, implement, and analyze parallel algorithms to enable the nation's large-scale computing resources to be used in conjunction with IE methods. Their increased computational efficiency will facilitate the study of models with increased fidelity and higher accuracy. Third, the project will extend the set of problems that can be attacked with IE methods to those including volume (and not just surface) data while using highly accurate geometric representations. Fourth, it will provide a theoretical understanding and practical methods for automatic control of numerical error in these methods. Lastly, the project will demonstrate the new methods and their use in the mathematically and numerically challenging context of fluid dynamics. To foster an understanding of the power of these kinds of computational tools in the next generation of the nation's workforce, this project will employ a day-long experience for students in their formative middle-school years. This experience will convey that computer modeling and simulation can help understand the world by testing the predictive power of simple, mechanistic models. Through its reliance on self-contained, hands-on computer experiments, the experience will be interactive and visually engaging, require little mathematics preparation, and easily establish connections with real-world applications of computing.

Initially, the tools in the field were optimized for the case when the fundamental components of these objects are linear:  The Fourier Transform decomposes a signal (such as a sound) as a superposition of constant-frequency waves (notes); the X-ray transform is a way of understanding the density of a body by passing (straight line) beams of radiation through the body and measuring the strength of the beam emitted on the other side.  In recent years, however, it has become increasingly apparent that harmonic analysis tools are also useful and important in situations where curvature plays a role.  As an example, the Schrdinger equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system, and recent advances toward understanding solutions to this equation were facilitated by the fifty-year-old realization that all of the Fourier data of a solution to the Schrdinger equation lies on a parabolic object.  Curvature has a localizing effect:  since the waves all propagate in different directions, their superposition can only be large in a small region of spacetime; by contrast, if the Fourier data were to lie on a flat plane, the superposition would be constant in directions perpendicular to that plane.  Other physical signals may have Fourier data constrained to different surfaces, and one aspect of the project is to precisely quantify the localization of these signals, in a way that depends only on the curvature of the underlying object.  As another example, operators that average signals over curved surfaces arise in a variety of contexts, including three-dimensional geometric optics.  Whereas averages over translates of a fixed plane are inherently unstable in directions perpendicular to the plane, averages over curved surfaces smooth out the original signal in all directions.  The project will precisely quantify the degree of smoothing for surfaces that may have some curved parts and some flat parts.  Finally, in recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in inverse problems wherein an attempt is made to characterize extreme cases consisting of mathematical signals for which the decay and smoothing effects described above are very weak; part of the project is to study some basic questions in this direction.  These inverse problems are connected with potential applications in engineering, physics, and medical imaging.  These scientific endeavors are inextricably linked with the investigator's efforts to help train the next generation of mathematicians.  This workforce development encompasses three main directions:  advising Ph.D. students in mathematics, creating summer research opportunities for undergraduate students, and organizing a series of symposia that foster interactions among mathematicians at all levels. <br/> <br/>During the past five decades, an important theme in harmonic analysis has been problems wherein the curvature of some underlying manifold causes operators to behave better than expected.  The main part of this project considers Fourier restriction and averaging operators associated to manifolds with varying curvature.  Curvature causes these operators to behave better than would be predicted by simply counting the dimension of the manifold, and the chief goal of the activity is to prove uniform bounds for these operators by equipping the manifold with a measure that gives small weight to regions where the curvature is small.   These curvature-independent bounds are essentially the strongest possible for the operators considered.  Moreover, these results would precisely quantify the role of curvature in the associated operators.  The investigator will also work toward a characterization of functions that saturate the Lebesgue space inequalities for certain operators of this type.  As an integral part of this project, the investigator will work to train junior mathematicians by serving as a dissertation advisor, by mentoring undergraduate researchers, and by organizing symposia that will include mathematicians at all levels."

As a general-purpose approach to statistical inferences, the bootstrap has found wide applications in semi-nonparametric models. Unfortunately, systematic theoretical studies on the bootstrap inferences are extremely limited, especially when the nonparametric component is not root-n estimable. Two classes of bootstrap methods are considered: the exchangeably weighted bootstrap (EWB) and the model-based bootstrap (also known as the parametric bootstrap). The PI proves that the EWB consistently estimates the asymptotic variance of the Euclidean estimate and is theoretically valid in drawing semiparametric inferences in the framework of penalized M-estimation. However, the EWB may become invalid in drawing inferences for nonparametric components. Hence, the PI considers the model-based bootstrap, and theoretically justifies it as an universally valid inference procedure for all the parameters in semi-nonparametric models. The proposed research also involves the development of advanced empirical processes tools. The above research lays the theoretical foundation for the general semi-nonparametric inferences via various bootstrap sampling schemes, and establishes a general framework for non-standard asymptotic theory concerning the nonparametric components.<br/><br/>The immediate need for fast and efficiently extracting information from all the dimensions of modern massive data sets gives rise to the increasing popularity of the semi-nonparametric models. For example, to understand the recent financial crisis, the semi-nonparametric copula models are applied to address tail dependence among shocks to different financial series and also to recover the shapes of the impact curve for individual financial series. The proposed research promotes the use of semi-nonparametric models in analyzing modern complex data by developing a series of innovative and valid bootstrap inferential tools, and eventually gain substantial scientific productivity across various disciplines. Statistical science benefits from the increasing number of researchers trained in semi-nonparametric modelling both from the statistical and scientific viewpoints. This would include the students funded by this work, broader collaborating research and educational activities. The above research also produces easy-to-implement software for the public."

This is a challenging problem involving advances in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and database management.  The investigator addresses this problem from a statistical analysis viewpoint.

Although coupled problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, their adaptive treatment is in its infancy. In fact, ad hoc adaptivity without rigorous justification is very popular but its efficiency suffers from solid mathematical grounding. Yet, the increasingly amount of resources involved in coupled systems makes adaptive algorithms even more essential. The aim of the proposed research is to design, analyze and implement adaptive algorithms tailored to coupled problems. The following objectives are put forward: (i) develop a systematic framework for the design of explicit adaptive algorithms iterating between the resolution of each quantity of interest; (ii) study a new concept of approximation able to describe the nonlinear interactions between each component of the coupled systems; (iii) derive optimal convergence decay rates in the context of elliptic problems, saddle point systems, and time dependent problems; (iv) challenge the new algorithms in the context of living cell motility where numerical methods must confront the complexity of the numerous phenomena involved and their interactions with the cell geometry.  <br/> <br/>Modern algorithms are able to optimize and balance the computational effort to capture small details without over-resolving the quantity of interest. However, when several processes interacting with each other need to be approximated, the established theory fails to apply due to two major obstructions: (i) the algorithm is required to make decisions without complete knowledge of all interacting quantities; (ii) the abilities to approximate each component of the system are tangled together in a highly nonlinear fashion. We propose to initiate a systematic study of couple problems with special emphasis to physical models related to living cell motility.  The difficulty of modeling cell locomotion is to overcome the inherent great computational expense when considering multi-scale, multi-dimensional and multi-component phenomena. Efficient and flexible algorithms are thus critical in this context. The understanding of cell locomotion has impact on several areas of bio-physics such as in embryonic development,  tissue regeneration, immune response and wound healing in multi-cellular organisms. In addition, the proposed study will actually benefit strategic departments such as energy (oil recovery and carbon dioxide sequestration), environment (groundwater contamination) and  material science (cloaking and filter design)."

To this end, the investigator has formulated two separate but highly interdependent sets of research goals.  The first set of research goals is the integration of statistical theory with methods of topological data analysis. Recent breakthroughs in computational topology have made it possible to compute topological invariants of sets from a collection of points in Euclidean spaces. Though the potential for high-dimensional statistical inference  of these new types of data summaries is significant, their statistical properties are still largely unexplored.  The investigator proposes to 1) to develop a comprehensive theory of minimax (and adaptive) estimation of topological properties of sets and 2) to create statistical procedures for non-parametric testing and de-noising based on topological invariants. The second set of research goals pertains to the traditional geometric data-analytic task of clustering in high-dimensions, and it is aimed at advancing the theory and practice of high-density clustering. Recent progress in the theory of clustering has demonstrated  that clustering using density estimation can perform well in high-dimensional settings, and that the notion of high-density clustering provides a natural probabilistic framework for describing and analyzing clustering problems in great generality. Thus, the investigator intends 1) to generalize and refine the high-density clustering problem under weak conditions on the data-generating mechanism and 2) to investigate the theory and use of data resampling techniques for parameter tuning in high-density clustering and density estimation. A common thread in the proposed research is the reliance on density estimation, as a tool for both accurate high-dimensional clustering and smoothing/de-noising of topological features. <br/><br/><br/>In the last few decades, advances in data acquisition technologies have led to an explosion in the collection and diffusion of large-scale datasets, across a variety of scientific fields. The unprecedented magnitude and complexity of modern databases pose formidable challenges to statisticians, both of theoretical and methodological nature, and has required the development of new statistical tools for data analysis. Modern high-dimensional statistics is predicated on the key assumption that, while the data are observed in a high-dimensional space, the intrinsic complexity of the data-generating mechanism is in fact significantly smaller and, therefore, learnable in computationally efficient ways. This research proposal capitalizes on this premise, and describes an array of methods for summarizing, discriminating, visualizing and clustering high-dimensional noisy data and for extracting salient low-dimensional features. The proposed research encompasses several novel and open research problems at the interface of mathematics, computer science, statistics and machine learning. The procedures studied in the proposal are of broad applicability and promise to be used in a multitude of scientific areas, such as medical imaging, neuroscience, astrophysics, biology, genetics, geophysics and sensor networks, just to name a few. The broader impact of this project also includes interdisciplinary training of students in statistics, mathematics and computer science."

It is also a field ripe for modern statistical development, since nonparametric models are in a sense even more appealing in the ""big data"" era, as it is precisely in data-rich settings that the increased flexibility of these models will begin to show real rewards in terms of statistical accuracy. The proposed work will develop nonparametric methods (and affiliated software) that will be useful to data scientists who model smooth, nonlinear trends in areas like those mentioned above, as well as many others. A specific scientific emphasis will be the forecasting of influenza and dengue fever. Such forecasts will help policy makers design and implement more effective countermeasures towards these diseases. The proposal puts forward two main ideas for educational training, closely related to the research aims to be pursued. The first is a set of short videos on nonparametric smoothing, intended as supplements to an undergraduate level course called Advanced Methods for Data Analysis. They will be integrated with an interactive quiz system, and will be made freely available (on YouTube) so that others outside the class may watch too. The second idea is a statistical computation training group, for PhD students from Statistics and Computer Science.<br/><br/>""Locally adaptive"" nonparametric methods offer more fine-grained flexibility than traditional nonparametric methods, in that they can simultaneously represent different amounts of smoothness at different parts of the function domain. Currently, locally adaptive nonparametric methods are not often used in big, modern data sets, likely because of their computational inefficiency, and the general inavailability of locally adaptive methods in many modern problem settings. The proposed work seeks to change this, and to push the state of the art in modern locally adaptive nonparametric estimation. The research aims are to: deepen the theoretical understanding of existing locally adaptive methods for univariate problems; efficiently scale these methods and extend these theories to problems where data are collected in high dimensions and over graphs; and develop inferential tools for all of these locally adaptive procedures. The specific contributions will be balanced between the theoretical (statistical theories that describe the underpinnings of the methods in question) and computational (practical algorithms that describe implementation of these methods at scale) perspectives. A final more applied research aim is to use the proposed methods to improve and extend a forecasting system for major epidemics such as influenza and dengue fever."

The common theme is computing and extracting desired information embedded or hidden in the problems and use it in the applications. In image processing, the investigator and his colleagues develop a novel multi-channel image denoising strategy based on cross channel information. Several high level mathematical tools including geometrical partial differential equations (PDE's), multiresolution harmonic analysis and calculus of variation are integrated together with some statistical methods and computer vision theory such as color spaces to remove noise from images while retaining salient geometrical features such as edges and corners. The investigator and collaborators also study a rigorous error analysis theory for wavelet based PDE techniques in image processing. In stochastic differential equations, the investigator and colleagues analyze the phase noise and time jitter for electric oscillators including an Analog Digital Conversion (ADC) model. The key is to use a moving coordinate system based on a vector bundle theory to completely decompose the phase noise and amplitude noise, and then study the associated Fokker-Planck equations which separate the deterministic statistical properties such as mean and variance from the randomness. A novel numerical method based on the Fokker-Planck equations is designed to compute Shannon's entropy which can be used to evaluate the performance of the oscillators.<br/><br/>Computing information has become one of the fastest growing aspects in many areas of science and technology. For instance, digital image processing analyzes and extracts useful information from digital images. Many images, including satellite, radar or sonar images and medical images, are polluted by noise from the environments like air, water, lighting conditions and dust on lens when they are acquired, or damaged during transmission processes such as wireless communications. Image denoising, which removes the noise, becomes one of the most important tasks in applications. A key objective in this research is to design new strategies removing noise in images while restoring important and useful information such as edges and shapes, which are often hard to be separated from the noise. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe complicated physical or engineering systems with uncertainties. Examples include composite materials, turbulence, circuit design and optics. For instance, electric oscillators are the key circuits used in many electric devices such as antennas, and are often modeled by systems of stochastic differential equations. Phase noise, which causes channel interference in wireless communications, is one of the most important factors for designing oscillators. One objective of this study is to develop mathematical theory and methods to analyze and compute useful statistical information from random processes in oscillators so that they can be used in designing or evaluating the performance of oscillators. In addition, another major objective is to integrate the research activities with education and training of undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs through seminars and courses.<br/>"

However, models are typically subject to considerable uncertainties stemming from uncertain inputs to the model (e.g., coefficient fields, constitutive laws, source terms, geometries, and initial and/or boundary conditions) as well as from noisy and limited observations. While many of these input quantities cannot be directly observed or measured, they can be inferred from observations, such as those of ice surface velocities in ice sheets. This typically leads to an extremely challenging mathematical problem. This project aims to enable the propagation of uncertainties from data/observations through inference to prediction and increase predictability of complex physical systems.  The selected driving application (i.e., the ice sheet model) for research and education activities, capture important general and complex algorithmic challenges such as large-scale, nonlinearity, time-dependence, and ill-posedness. The research will be, therefore, applicable to a broader spectrum of problems. The algorithms, mathematical findings and open source codes will be shared through peer reviewed journal papers, and presentations at conferences and workshops.<br/> <br/>Technical description of the project: Bayesian inversion facilitates the integration of data with complex physics-based models to quantify and reduce uncertainties in model predictions. This opens the door to more advanced capabilities for prediction and decision-making under uncertainty.  However, the algorithmic developments for Bayesian inversion are subject to several challenges. For instance, characterizing the posterior distributions of parameters or predictions inevitably requires repeated evaluations of (possibly) large-scale and complex forward models governed by differential equations.  In addition, the posterior distribution has a complex structure stemming from the presence of possibly nonlinear forward models and heterogeneous sources of data. To overcome these computational challenges, it is essential to exploit problem structure (e.g., derivatives and local sensitivity of the data with respect to parameters). The objectives of this proposal is to conduct exploratory work in addressing the mathematical and computational barriers in solving large-scale Bayesian inverse problems governed by differential equations. Developing mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient and robust methods in the context of statistical inference has the potential of transformative research in the field of modern computational inverse problems. In particular, the PI and her student will work on the following vertically-integrated research areas: (i) scalable algorithms for large-scale inverse problems (here the focus will be on second derivative (i.e., Hessian) approximations for inverse problems and on developing efficient preconditioners for inexact Newton-Krylov systems to increase the computational efficiency of inverse solvers), and (ii) uncertainty quantification in high dimensions (here the focus will be on building Hessian- and reduced order model-based methods for efficient posterior exploration in high dimensions).

If one so samples the graph enough times, useful information can be deduced about it without ever dealing with the whole graph in its entirety.

This project is a rigorous study of the fundamental patterns that arise in a wide range of complex systems exhibiting many different extrema. The aim is to develop general quantitative methods to understand the statistics of extrema of these systems and to draw new connections with related problems in mathematics and physics.

The focus of the project is on developing new probability methods in two instances: realistic spin glasses in statistical mechanics and the Riemann zeta function in number theory. In particular, it builds on recent progress in the description of infinite-dimensional models of spin glasses to propose a new rigorous method to investigate the behavior of realistic (finite-dimensional) spin glasses, which exhibit unusual magnetic behavior due to the presence of many extremal energies. The program also outlines new directions of research in pure mathematics by studying the Riemann zeta function as a disordered system.

It has a distinctive and rich structure that is already apparent in two-dimensional Teichmuller space. In this case, the PI and her collaborators have developed a clear picture of the infinitesimal and coarse geometry of this metric. The PI plans to extend these results to higher dimensional Teichmuller spaces as well as explore dynamics of the Thurston metric. The PI will also study stable commutator lengths via quasimorphisms on right-angled Artin groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, and more generally, virtually special groups. Plans to organize graduate student workshops dedicated to these topics and related topics are also included."

Understanding these spaces and structures is central to understanding the shape and properties of our universe.  For example, Einstein's description of gravity via general relativity relies on mathematical tools for understanding manifolds that are not too different from those under development in this project.  Indeed, many of the theories under study have applications and origins in physics.  A major goal of the project is to develop methods that might be used to unify several existing and important tools for studying 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.  Such unification would likely reveal interesting connections between disparate fields of mathematics.  An important method for understanding higher dimensional spaces is to study lower dimensional spaces that embed into them; much of this research project will be focused on understanding 1-dimensional spaces called knots embedded in 3-dimensional manifolds.  Knot theory was initiated as a subfield of topology in the 1880's by the chemist Lord Kelvin, and it has many other interesting applications outside of mathematics -- to the study of how certain enzymes alter the knotting of DNA, for example.  One of the project goals is to unify two very important, but prima facie different, tools for studying knots; there is tantalizing conjectural evidence of a concrete relationship between these two theories.  Another means of studying 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds is by understanding the sorts of geometric structures they support.  Considerable effort in this project will go into understanding contact structures on 3-dimensional manifolds.  In addition to their applications in mathematics, contact structures are important in classical mechanics, thermodynamics, dynamical systems, and in the study of liquid crystals.  This project also contains several explicit directions for student research, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and will support the PI's teaching and mentoring activities.  In addition, the project will serve the broader community by creating a Wiki repository of open problems, with background and context.  The PI will also use the funds from this award to start a Boston-area graduate seminar, and to participate in math outreach for the general public at the Cambridge Science Festival.<br/><br/>Floer theory has revolutionized the study of the topology and geometry in low dimensions.  Many of these Floer theories appear to encode the same information, indicating deep connections between fields like symplectic geometry and gauge theory.  These and connections between Floer theory and link invariants from representation theory have led to spectacular results in low-dimensional topology, such as proof of the Weinstein conjecture.  Despite some progress in understanding these connections, there is not yet a simple, unifying explanation for them.  Indeed, a fundamental open problem, and a distant lodestar for part of the research project, is to axiomatize Floer theory.  One approach involves developing invariants of bordered 3-manifolds.  The bordered monopole Floer theory under development in this project is novel in that it may provide methods for computing invariants of 4-manifolds as well.  A complementary goal of this project is to elucidate links between Floer theory and Khovanov homology, an invariant of links motivated by representation theory.  Such connections were instrumental, for example, in establishing that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.  This project investigates a new approach to proving a long-standing conjecture relating Khovanov homology with knot Floer homology, which would imply, among other things, that Khovanov homology detects the figure eight, trefoil, and Hopf link as well.  The project also investigates a novel approach for using actions of quantum cohomology on Floer theory to study the rich theory of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds.  This has not been done before, despite the role Heegaard splittings play in the constructions of some Floer theories.  Finally, the research project will employ newly-developed gauge-theoretic contact invariants to provide fresh insights into Legendrian knots and Lagrangian concordance, and to establish hitherto unexplored connections between contact geometry and the fundamental group."

Ubiquitous in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory, and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to encourage the participation of students and young researchers.   <br/><br/>The project will address two main types of research problems. Hodge theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry but it is fundamentally transcendental in nature.  Recent work of the PI and coauthors has demonstrated that techniques from model theory and complex geometry can be used to bridge this divide systematically, and the first goal of the project is to develop the application of these techniques more deeply. Secondly, the project will develop a more detailed understanding of the moduli of certain varieties which are particularly closely related to Hodge theory, including abelian varieties and hyperkahler varieties. Building on previous work using techniques from differential and complex geometry, the PI will further investigate the geometry and arithmetic of the moduli spaces of these varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Higher Teichmueller<br/>spaces are connected components of the variety of representations<br/>of the fundamental group of a surface into semisimple Lie groups,<br/>which share essential properties with Teichmueller<br/>space. Classical Teichmueller space plays an important role in<br/>various fields of mathematics due to its rich structure and the<br/>fact that it is a smooth cover of the moduli space of Riemann<br/>surfaces.  For higher Teichmueller spaces many potentially<br/>interesting structures are yet to be discovered and the relation<br/>to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces still needs to be<br/>clarified. The proposed research focusses on identifying the<br/>geometric objects (similar to hyperbolic surfaces in the case of<br/>classical Teichmueller space) which are parametrized by higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces. These objects will then be used to define<br/>algebraic, geometric and dynamical structures on higher<br/>Teichmueller spaces, and we expect that they will help to<br/>construct a natural map from higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>classical Teichmueller space.<br/><br/>Teichmueller space is the space of all geometric surfaces with a<br/>fixed combinatorial type. Because it parametrizes all surfaces,<br/>Teichmueller space is a fundamental mathematical object which<br/>also plays an important role in theoretical physics. Every point<br/>in Teichmueller space corresponds to a tiling of the Euclidean<br/>plane, the two-dimensional sphere or in most cases the hyperbolic<br/>plane by one polygon and its images under subsequent reflections<br/>in the sides. (Nice pictures inspired by such tilings appear in<br/>M.C. Escher's work.) The combinatorial type of the surface is<br/>determined by the number of vertices of the polygon and the<br/>gluing data, but the geometry of the surface depends on the<br/>length of the sides and the angles at the vertices of the<br/>polygon. Teichmueller space is the example of a moduli space of a<br/>pattern (the tiling) with rich symmetries (the reflections in the<br/>side of the polygon). Such moduli spaces can be efficiently<br/>studied via the group generated by the symmetries of the<br/>pattern. Higher Teichmueller spaces are moduli spaces of more<br/>complicated patterns in higher dimensional spaces. However, the<br/>symmetry group of these patterns is the same as the symmetry<br/>group of the tilings associated to classical Teichmueller<br/>space. Therefore one expects higher Teichmueller spaces to<br/>parametrize geometric objects which are not surfaces themselves,<br/>but closely related to surfaces. The proposed research focusses<br/>on identifying these geometric objects and studying their finer<br/>structure.<br/><br/>The project proposes various activities to involve graduate<br/>students in research and teaching, as for instance a yearly<br/>mathematical retreat for graduate students to study, explore and<br/>present a mathematical topic in a group, and small workshops with<br/>mini-courses which allow graduate students to get insight into<br/>the working of modern research collaborations.<br/>"

A fundamental example of this micro-to-macro phenomenon is seen in the ubiquity of the bell curve, which describes many distributions seen in nature, even when they come from different sources. The project will help uncover the analog of the bell curve for fundamental behaviors of numbers.<br/><br/>Specifically, the distribution of class groups of number fields and function fields will be studied using tools from probability, random groups, arithmetic geometry, algebraic geometry, topology, and number theory.

For many problems in practice, data is commonly associated with certain coherent and nonlinear structure. Mathematically, this allows us to model data sets as points sampled on manifolds usually of low dimensions embedded in a high dimensional ambient space. Different from image and signal processing which handle functions on flat domains with well-developed tools for processing and learning, manifold-structured data is far more challenging due to their complicated geometry. For example, the same geometric object can take very different coordinate representations due to the variety of embeddings, transformations or representations (imagine the same human body shape can have different poses as its nearly isometric embedding ambiguities). These ambiguities form an infinite dimensional isometric group and make higher-level tasks in manifold-structured data analysis and learning even more challenging. To overcome these challenges, it becomes increasingly important to develop new tools in both theoretical and computational point of views for processing manifold structured data. <br/><br/>This project proposes to investigate analyzing and learning of manifold-structured data by bridging connection from geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) and learning theory to intrinsic data analysis. The major objectives of this project contain three components. The first part is to investigate a framework of geometric-PDEs-based methods to a data structure for manifolds represented as incomplete inter-point distance. The second part is to overcome the challenge of poor performance using intrinsic descriptors to handling not nearly isometric manifolds. In the third part, a new method of defining geometric convolution on manifolds is considered. This provides a building block of constructing the proposed geometric convolutional neural network for conducting deep learning on manifold-structured data. By collaborating with biomedical engineers, applications such as human brain mappings will also be explored. The new methodologies and research findings resulting from the proposed work will lead to new ways of tackling problems in manifold-structured data analysis and will be integrated into my future teaching and course projects in appropriate ways. The education plan is to provide unique opportunities to train undergraduate and graduate students interested in exploring geometry and learning on manifold-structured data, and to reach out the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some regions, VBDs, such as malaria and dengue, have resurged where previous elimination campaigns have waned. In other places, the novel introduction and spread of vectors and pathogens, for example the Asian citrus psyllid and with it huanglongbing (citrus greening), is occurring due to human facilitated introductions (long distance travel events, shipping containers, etc.). Transmission of VBDs is complex. The patterns of transmission that we observe are determined by interactions between vectors, pathogens, hosts, and their environment. Most disease vectors are small arthropods; they are sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall. It is vitally important to understand how these factors and conditions affect the dynamics of the vectors in order to better inform strategies for monitoring and mitigation of VBDs. This CAREER project will further a general understanding of how environmentally-mediated traits of vectors (e.g. longevity and fecundity) interact with environmental factors to impact the transmission of VBDs. Improved quantitative methods will be developed for predicting when and where transmission will occur and for estimation of the uncertainty in these predictions.  <br/><br/>This CAREER project addresses three main questions: (1) How do we quantify and model the impacts of environmental drivers on multiple correlated traits of vectors and thus on VBD transmission dynamics? (2) How can we link mechanistic or model-based measures of transmission with statistical models of incidence/transmission to improve predictions of when and where VBD transmission or emergence may occur? (3) How can we integrate multiple sources of uncertainty into our models/predictions and how can we communicate this uncertainty in a way that is useful for decision making? The PI will tackle these questions with a trait-based framework, initially focusing on two very different but data rich study systems, dengue and huanglongbing. More specifically, mechanistic mathematical models that include details on environmentally mediated vector traits, including trait correlation and heterogeneity, will first be developed.  These models will be parameterized and validated with data from open data repositories using a Bayesian approach. Methods and tools will be developed for validating these models, for properly quantifying sources and types of uncertainty, and for testing interventions and making policy decisions under uncertainty. Through an integrated approach to statistical training and collaboration with current researchers in the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), the project will improve the quantitative and statistical capabilities of future researchers and public health officials and policy makers. In particular, the work will include: a) Development of tools and training materials for VDH employees to use cutting edge modeling techniques; b) Training and experience for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in public health collaboration through interactions with the VDH; c) Training of undergraduate biologists in statistics through a revitalized Biological Statistics course at Virginia Tech; d) Undergraduate research experience in quantitative biology with a focus on VBDs; e) Training of graduate students in teaching and mentoring through a seminar course on statistics pedagogy and through opportunities to co-mentor undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The realization that drag forces exerted on a body moving through air (or water) take place on a thin layer around the body lead to the development of boundary layer theory. The practical importance of boundary layer theory in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics is immense: computing the drag on an object and the energy dissipation rate nearby, with implications for fuel efficiency; understanding the problem of wing stall, the dependence of the lift on the angle of attack; and even the enhancement of heat transfer near solid walls. Mathematically, these questions concern the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the vanishing viscosity limit, and the stability of the ensuing boundary layers.  This project will develop new analytical tools to study the validity of the vanishing viscosity limit, the formation of singularities in boundary layers, and to explore the nonlinear stability mechanisms by which these lead to dynamic boundary layer separation. This theoretical information will lead to more accurate reduced models and finer predictions about real fluid flows. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers, in modern research problems in applied mathematics and the tools to study them.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical tools that will further our understanding of the vanishing viscosity limit: the question whether solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the incompressible Euler equations as the viscosity approaches zero, in the presence of a characteristic physical boundary.

The PI and collaborators will address the emergence of singularities in the Prandtl boundary layer equations by establishing more robust finite time blow-up scenarios. The stability of nearly laminar boundary layers will be studied via a hypocoercive analysis of the Prandtl system and of higher order models. Finally, the PI will develop new energy methods that intertwine Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to prove the vanishing viscosity limit in high regularity regimes. The goal is to develop nonlinear, solution-adapted methods. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will be mentored and included in the research activities."

Key components, which are interconnected so that progress on one advances the others, include investigating the interplay between p-adic and archimedean properties of L-functions and automorphic forms, studying p-adic aspects of unitary Shimura varieties, and bridging different approaches to p-adic automorphic forms to gain insight into the behavior of associated data whose significance extends into number theory, homotopy theory, and arithmetic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, the investigator proposes to (1) study the role of geometry in statistical inference of complex data,  in particular manifold-valued data that are now routinely collected in many fields of science and engineering; and (2) investigate the role of geometry in high-dimensional data analysis where the data generating process  often centers around some lower-dimensional geometric space.  The central theme of this program is that  geometry is inherently present in the data  with the geometry either known or to be learned,  which should be utilized for efficient and reliable statistical learning and inference. The investigator aims to make fundamentally mathematical, statistical and algorithmic advances in complex data analysis and high-dimensional data analysis. In addition, the investigator proposes a comprehensive and detailed educational and training program for graduates students, undergraduate students as well as high school students that is integrated into the research program.<br/><br/>Modern data of complex nature are routinely being collected in many scientific fields. One example is from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of neuroimaging, which obtains local information of neural activity through  3 by 3  positive definite matrices. DTI has clinical applications in the study and treatment of neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, as well as in detecting subtle abnormalities related to a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia). Other examples of complex data include digital images in machine vision, where a digital image can be represented by a set of landmarks, forming certain shapes.  One may also encounter data that are stored in complex forms such as subspaces, surfaces, curves, and networks. The investigator will characterize the structure or geometry of complex data, and incorporate the geometry in developing valid statistical models for inference. In addition to complex data, it is also a common practice  to collect high-dimensional data across many disciplines such as biology, public health and neuroscience. Being able to learn the often lower-dimensional geometry of the  high-dimensional data is essential for accurate statistical inference and decision making in society. The investigator will utilize the geometry in developing valid statistical methods, which will be applied to medical data and neuroscience data, which has potential far-reaching impact in applied fields. In particular, the practical impact of the statistical methodologies from the project will be evaluated in the context of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) data set. By completing the proposed program, the investigator expects to better serve society and advance science by applying the developed models and methods in important fields such as  medical diagnostics by enabling accurate prediction, classification or detection of diseases or brain disorders."

Many of the fluids encountered in everyday life, such as water, gasoline, and honey, are well-understood (Newtonian) fluids, but many of the fluids related to industrial and biological applications are not. Common examples of non-Newtonian fluids include paint, multi-grade engine oils, laundry detergent, pediatric liquid medicines, pulmonary mucus, and cell membranes. A distinguishing feature of non-Newtonian fluids is microscopic structures that can be rearranged significantly during flow and consequently alter behavior over time and between circumstances. The goal of this research is to establish mathematical relationships between microstructural processes and flow properties in soft biological matter. Current advances in microscopy, flow measurement, theory and computation will lead to new models, allowing scientists to design and test next-generation biomaterials and investigate biological flows. Undergraduate and graduate students will not only be able to learn how to design and perform wet-lab experiments, formulate mathematical models and perform high-performance computational simulations, but also have opportunities to closely interact with researchers from mathematics, biology, physics and biomedical sciences. STEM students from the South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation program will be recruited as incoming freshmen to participate in a variety of research and educational activities supported by this project.  A second program, the SC Women in Science Luncheon, will bring together female undergraduate and graduate students for vertically-integrated research presentation, discussion and mentoring.

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via A) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and B) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. The main focus is on the study of the so-called ""non-equilibrium behavior"" of nonlinear dispersive equations. Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves or in the transmission of optical signals, to mention only a couple. While this turbulence is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor and the mathematical justification of the involved phenomena based on the model equations is rather difficult and is mostly still open. This project is aimed at rigorously proving turbulence phenomenon for certain nonlinear dispersive models.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the long-time behavior of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDE) on compact domains is out-of-equilibrium behavior or long-time instability. This means that solutions do not exhibit long-time stability near equilibriums solutions or configurations. Such questions can be addressed from a dynamical systems perspective and from a statistical physics perspective, in what is often called in the physics literature as ""wave turbulence theory"". The proposed projects address this broad problematic from both perspectives. In terms of dynamics, the aim is to construct solutions exhibiting the so-called ""energy cascade"" phenomenon, in which the energy of a dispersive system moves its concentration zone between characteristically different length scales. On the statistical physics perspective, projects aimed at justifying the fundamental equations of wave turbulence are proposed. These are effective equations for the dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations, and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive PDE, provided they are rigorously justified. The project also includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc."

Because of automated data collection methods, there is now<br/>a surfeit of severely multi-dimensional records.  Grouping them into homogeneous clusters to better understand them is a desirable goal in a variety of applications, yet classical statistical methods are computationally infeasible in many cases.  I propose to develop parallel methodology for this context.

The first pertains to the<br/>US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) self-reported Toxic Releases Inventory (TRI) databases, where profiling the different facilities in terms of their product, demographic and business information can improve the accuracy of records, as well as better characterize them vis-a-vis their emissions mix.  The second project is to assess the reliability of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans, with a view to understanding the cognitive processes of the brain, as a first step to patient care and therapy.  The third application is in bioinformatics where the goal is to cluster microarray data and also to analyze two-dimensional proteomic gel images.  This will help in isolating genes and understanding their relationship with different disorders.  <br/><br/>Clustering is in general a very difficult problem, with empirical solutions even for very moderately sized datasets.  I propose to develop multi-pass methodologies in several different scenarios.  I also propose multi-scale simulation approaches to estimation in a high-dimensional context.  One of the biggest challenges faced by simulation methods due to high dimensionality is the low mobility around the space to be traversed because of its vastness.  I propose to address this issue by connecting these high-dimensional spaces to lower-dimensional ones  (which are significantly smaller) and by using these lower scales to traverse from one corner of the higher-dimensional space to another.  A final goal of this five-year plan is to investigate the development and estimation in more complex models for proteomic gel data.  Most of the plans proposed will be possible only with a parallel computing interface.  This is increasingly critical in a large number of scientific applications, and I propose to simultaneously provide statistics students with the necessary expertise by designing suitably tailored graduate and undergraduate classes.<br/>"

The cortex, which lies just below the outer membrane of the cell, consists primarily of polymerized filaments of the protein actin. These actin filaments are cross-linked by a variety of proteins that can reorient and even move the filaments, making the cortex a highly dynamic structure. Despite the importance of the actin cortex for critical cell functions, it is not clear how small scale interactions give rise to large scale patterns and functions associated with the cortex. This project will use mathematical modeling to bridge disparate time and space scales associated with cortical actin dynamics, directly linking molecular level interactions to the emergence of cell level functional structures. For this project, novel models will be constructed that draw on a variety of mathematical approaches, including stochastic models which take into account infrequent interactions, and continuum models which can track the moving boundary of the cortex as well movement of proteins in time and space. The development and analysis of these biologically based models will result in an improved understanding of actin and its regulation in a cellular context. This research will also be leveraged to recruit and retain women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields through the development of an integrated undergraduate course in mathematical modeling, with recruitment of students through a number of existing programs at Ohio State University, including Women in Mathematics and Science and Women in Engineering. Students involved in this project, and in the undergraduate course, will be exposed to real world mathematics applications and will interact with peers from other disciplines in a supportive interdisciplinary environment.<br/><br/>Mathematical modeling is an ideal tool for the investigation of complex biological systems, where experimental techniques are not available or are not feasible. At the macro-scale level, systems of partial differential equations  will be used to investigate the interplay between biochemical and mechanical actin dynamics, and the consequence of these dynamics on cell shape. Asymptotic analysis will be used to explicitly study the role of curvature in actin dynamics, and moving boundary simulations will be used to study changes in cell shape. At the mesoscale level, integro-differential equations, which use integral kernels to describe actin filament dynamics, will be used to study the formation of large scale actin filament patterns such as asters, vortices and aggregates. At the micro-scale level, stochastic individual-based models will be used to determine physical properties of the local actin meshwork and to determine under what conditions the actin meshwork behaves as a viscoelastic material. By enforcing consistency across multiple time and space scales in the proposed models, mechanisms that give rise to cellular structures will be revealed. Analysis and simulations of these models will present unique challenges leading to improvement of techniques in several areas of applied mathematics, including asymptotic analysis, moving boundary simulations, nonlocal model analysis, and stochastic simulations. The proposed models will be motivated and validated in a single experimental organism, avoiding complications from combining in vitro data with in vivo data from multiple organisms and cell types. The integrated computational and analytical models resulting from this research will increase our understanding of a fundamental protein that is critical for proper cell function."

For finite random samples, methods such as maximum likelihood estimation and cumulative sum (CUSUM) sequential rules are known to be optimal for dealing with the two previously mentioned problems. Although one expects that optimality would be preserved when the time span between consecutive observations of a Levy process shrinks to zero, there exist important examples showing this not always to be the case. The mystery behind these counterintuitive results is closely connected to the ""fine"" distributional properties of Levy processes in short time. Rather than directly attacking the two proposed problems in continuous time, the investigator builds on the well-studied analogous problems in discrete time and fill in the infinite time continuum by analyzing their evolution when the time span between consecutive observations is made increasingly small. This bottom-up approach is not only appealing but also useful since in practice one would like to determine the performance of statistical methods for high-frequency observations rather than for continuous-time observations, which are arguably never available. The focus on Levy processes is motivated by the fact that the latter are the simplest stochastic models displaying abrupt changes while still preserving the parsimonious statistical properties of their increments. Extensions to other multi-factor stochastic models driven by Levy processes are also contemplated. <br/><br/>Automatic high-frequency monitoring systems of natural and social phenomena are increasingly used in engineering applications, financial markets, and environmental studies. Therefore, there is an increasing need for efficient and accurate statistical and computational methods for the high-frequency data generated by these systems. Two important issues arise with this need: understanding the meaning of statistical efficiency in a high-frequency sampling setting and analyzing the optimality of some of the commonly used statistical methods when applied to high-frequency data. The undertaken research responds to these two pressing problems. The project's outcomes have important applications in pricing of financial derivatives, calibration of financial models, monitoring of navigation system, intrusion detection in computer networks, and more. Educational impacts include providing summer research experiences for undergraduates and developing teaching/computational resources for interdisciplinary topics in statistics, probability, and mathematical finance.

This project takes the next step -- developing the requisite algorithms for problems that sit within these boundaries. While almost all 'algorithms' currently in use for tensor problems lack correctness and convergence guarantees, the ones developed for this project strive to be algorithms in the true sense of the word, i.e. meeting the basic requirement of convergence to a true solution and not just a stationary or fixed point. This is in general not possible but the PI will (i) identify large classes of interesting cases for which efficient, provably convergent algorithms exist; and (ii) exploit multilinearity and tap the existing rich collection of linear techniques. These design principles and goals will be applied to algorithmic development of all following problems: (a) Low rank tensor approximations; (b) eigenvalues and singular values for tensors; (c) systems of multilinear equations in the exact and least-squares sense.

To achieve this, one must first realize that while there are natural extensions of the aforementioned handful of linear problems, there are also subtle difficulties and even impossibilities associated with these multilinear analogues. The crux of the project is to carve out a substantial tractable subclass of problems that are nevertheless still useful in applications. The project would also examine three concrete applications to brain imaging, cellular phone communication, and analytical chemistry."

In many cases, the symmetries of the algebraic equations in question have a rich geometric and analytic structure. Using this structure it is possible to translate the arithmetic problems into geometric and dynamic problems on spaces of symmetries. Understanding how the arithmetic features of a problem manifest in the geometry of the corresponding space creates a link between arithmetic and geometric phenomena, and advances knowledge in both fields. The research in this proposal is complemented by educational and outreach activities, including the creation of a summer research workshop and a graduate seminar on analytic number theory.<br/><br/>The PI will study two types of problems in homogenous dynamics, both originating  from arithmetic. The first type of problems are shrinking target problems for unipotent flows on homogenous spaces. Shrinking target problems for diagonalizable group actions on homogenous spaces are very well understood. The corresponding problems for unipotent flows (as well as other slow mixing actions) are not yet understood, except for some special arithmetic cases. The PI will use methods from spectral theory and analytic number theory, in combination with methods of homogenous dynamics and ergodic theory, in order to analyze shrinking target problems for unipotent flows and their applications to the classical field of metric Diophantine approximations.  The second type of problems regards the distribution of translates of closed orbits on homogenous spaces. The study of the distribution of translates of closed subgroup-orbits is an interesting problem with many applications. When the orbits are compact, or of finite measure, there are a number of techniques to study the limiting distribution of their translates, and these can be applied to study the classical problem of distribution of integer points in algebraic varieties; they are also amenable to more analytic applications in the study of L-functions of automorphic forms. The PI will extend such results to orbits of infinite measure, with an emphasis on cases having interesting arithmetic applications."

Certain diseases or drugs may cause clots to form improperly, resulting in life-threatening bleeding or pathological clot growth with vessel occlusion.

The results will lead to a better understanding of how the cortex functions and how it dysfunctions in disease states.  The results will also inform the development of biologically-inspired machine learning algorithms.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research and benefit from coursework inspired by the research projects.  Students at a public high school will be guided in a project to incorporate learning algorithms from the research into a robot, providing hands on experience with applied mathematics, computer programming, and robotics.<br/><br/>The project comprises three sub-projects that build on each other.  The first sub-project utilizes the notion of excitatory-inhibitory balance in cortical networks to derive scaling laws for connection strengths at large network size.  Previous theoretical work elucidates the computational utility of an inverse square root scaling law and recent experimental work provides biological evidence for it, but the mechanisms through which the law could emerge are unknown.  Candidate biological mechanisms will be analyzed mathematically and evaluated in collaboration with an experimental neuroscientist.  For the second project, the theory of neuronal networks with excitatory and inhibitory balance will be refined and extended to account for the imprecision of balance observed in experiments.  Preliminary calculations suggest that this imprecision is mathematically necessary, produces biologically realistic activity, and invokes intricate response properties that have implications for artificial neural networks used for image analysis.  The third project will develop and analyze a mathematical model of motor learning that combines Hebbian plasticity in a cortical pathway with reward modulated plasticity in a sub-cortical pathway, inspired by experimental observations.  This two-pathway motor learning algorithm has implications for biological motor learning, motor disease, and robotics."

This project is concerned with determining when such a system has a solution where all coordinates are rational numbers. For an arbitrary system of equations, it can be quite difficult to determine whether there exist any such rational solutions. This research project develops a new perspective on this problem using geometry and asymptotic behavior. The research in this proposal is complemented by educational and outreach activities, including workshops for mid-to-late career graduate students focusing on presentation skills and how these skills can be leveraged to develop and broaden one's research program. <br/><br/>The research projects fall in two main directions. The first focuses on the change in behavior of rational points and obstructions as the base field varies. In this direction, the project pursues a direct connection between the existence of 0-cycles and rational points on geometrically rational surfaces and explores new asymptotic questions that will shed light on Colliot-Thlne's conjecture on 0-cycles. The second focuses on leveraging dominant rational maps emanating from a variety X to obtain information about the Brauer group, rational points, and 0-cycles of X."

These problems are known as fluid-structure interactions and fluid-solid mixture problems, respectively.  In most of these applications, the ultimate goal is the optimization or optimal control of the considered process, as well as related sensitivity analysis (with respect to relevant physical/biological parameters) investigations. Examples include the design of small-scale unmanned aircrafts and morphing aircraft wings, like robo-bees, minimizing turbulence in blood flow within a stenosed or stented artery, or optimizing the pressure of the blood flow and investigating the influence of pertinent biological parameters in the case of the lamina cribrosa in the eye, where these factors are believed to be related to the development of glaucoma.  This research program addresses sensitivity analysis, control, and optimization-related problems for moving boundary fluid-elasticity interactions and fluid flows through biological tissues.  The project will focus on the particular example of the coupling between biomechanics and hemodynamics in the lamina cribrosa in the eye, where performing sensitivity analysis with respect to important parameters (like blood flow and intraocular and retrolaminar pressures) will further the understanding of the cause and progression of glaucoma, and enable novel means for preventing or treating glaucoma. This research will also be applicable to other biological fluid-solid mixtures such as cartilages, bones, and engineered tissues. <br/><br/>Moving boundary fluid-elasticity interactions and  porous media flows are nonlinear dynamical systems with Banach space parameters, and most questions related to their sensitivity analysis and control are open in the field. This project will (i) advance the theory of optimal control problems subject to these nonlinear systems by developing the theoretical framework for sensitivity analysis and optimality conditions;  (ii) perform sensitivity analysis on the lamina cribrosa model to identify the important biological parameters, and use the obtained results to develop and address possible control strategies in the development of glaucoma. Well-posedness of optimal solutions, Frechet differentiability of cost functionals and state  with respect to both distributed and boundary controls, and derivation and well-posedness analysis of adjoint systems will be addressed.  These results will provide the starting point for all sensitivity calculations, parameter estimation, and derivative-based optimization algorithms."

In these situations, the target parameter is often high-dimensional/high-order, but the important information may lie in dimension-reduced subspaces induced by various structural conditions. How to efficiently exploit these subspaces poses significant statistical and computational challenges. This project aims to address these challenges from a perspective of subspace learning.

The first strand centers on the ``Symplectic Poincare Conjecture,?? a question about whether or not the topological space of the complex projective plane has a unique smooth structure that supports a symplectic form. The second strand centers on a question first posed by C. Taubes: if the product space of a 3-manifold and a circle admits a symplectic form, does the 3-manifold fiber over a circle? Baldridge?s previous work in each strand has formed and influenced his work in the other--the two strands are deeply connected. <br/>The research in this proposal would investigate the following questions related to the conjectures above: (1) Which manifolds with small Euler characteristic admit smooth exotic structures? Which of those exotic structures admit a symplectic form? (2) Are there criteria under which a symplectic 4-manifold is (up to diffeomorphism) uniquely defined by its topological data? (3) What interesting phenomena occur in the geography problem as one gets close to the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau line? (4) Which circle bundles over a fibered 3-manifold admit a symplectic form?<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a space that locally looks like the familiar space in which we live. If one imagines replacing every point in the 3-manifold with a circle of points in a nice way, one gets an example of a 4-manifold with a circle action. Here `action' means a rotation of the space along each circle. Four manifolds with circle actions have many nice periodic and symmetry properties, which makes them particularly suitable for modeling and testing physical theories. (For example, the space-time universe we live in is an example of a 4-manifold which may have a circle action.) These manifolds are especially useful for modeling if they also have a symplectic structure--a key ingredient in almost all the equations of classical and quantum physics. Baldridge will investigate the shapes of symplectic 4-manifolds with circle actions and of 4-manifolds in general. This investigation is done by constructing new examples of smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds and by distinguishing 4-manifolds from each other by relating invariant features of a 4-manifold to the number of solutions of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential equations on that manifold. In addition to his research work in mathematics, Baldridge will strive to help the next generation of U.S. citizens learn mathematics through his work on three projects. The first project is to complete a comprehensive college curriculum for prospective elementary and middle school teachers. The second is to bring outstanding mathematicians to Louisiana State University to be ``Scholars in Residence?? to interact with participants in a new professional Master?s degree program for teachers. The final project is professional development for teachers in a high-need school district that has the potential to create a replicable model for building high-performing mathematics programs in high-need schools.<br/>"

Such solutions and their stability can be studied on long time scales in relation to small scale models for light in optical media in nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac models, surface waves on a surface tension scale in the gravity-capillary equations, or molecular dynamics in terms of both large scale nonlinear diffusions of crystals through thermodynamic fluctuations as well as Lagrangian mechanics for smaller systems of electrons trapped in various nuclear potentials.  They can also be studied in macroscopic systems such as interaction of surface waves and internal waves in coupled fluids models, vortex formation in fluid flow around biological objects in the Navier-Stokes equations with boundary, and dark matter formation in models from general relativity using Einstein-Scalar Field equations and their reductions as Schrdinger-Poisson models.  In applications that include large systems, complicated nonlinearities, and/or interesting geometric settings, the analysis and numerics can become increasingly difficult.  The quest to understand complexity in partial differential equation models has led to the development of dramatically new analytic and computational techniques to explore questions of symmetry, phase transitions, uniqueness for the attractive states, as well as generalizations of Fourier transform methods using scattering theory, spectral theory and microlocal analysis to understand their stability.  These techniques can be applied for instance on spaces with curvature, boundary, metric singularities or other difficult features such as noise in a sample or trapping due to external potential wells.  <br/><br/><br/>This proposal will involve research in partial differential equations directly related to optics and electronic structure with relevant boundary conditions and potentials, as well as other equations from fluid dynamics, general relativity and thermodynamic fluctuations on crystal surfaces.

From a human resources standpoint, models like those in this proposal provide a large pool of problems that give a strong background in computation and geometry, as well as some applied statistics, which can be used for training purposes in work with researchers of all levels, from undergraduate to postdoctoral, then applied in many scientific fields.

Recent advancements in computational fluid dynamics have enabled researchers to efficiently explore problems that involve moving elastic boundaries immersed in fluids for problems such as cardiac fluid dynamics, fish swimming, and the movement of bacteria. These advances have also made modeling the interaction between a fluid and a neuromechanical model of an elastic organ or organism feasible. This project will focus on the development and implementation of such models for two problems: 1) fluid transport through the pumping of tubular hearts, and 2) feeding currents generated by the pulsation of jellyfish bells. This proposal leverages existing computational algorithms for fluid-structure interactions, whereas the mathematical novelty lies in coupling this technology to living boundaries. The models will integrate feedback between the conduction of action potentials, the contraction of muscles, the movement of tissues, and fluid motion. For example, mathematical models will be developed that couple action potentials triggered by noisy pacemaker cells to the generation of tension through appropriate muscle and Ca2+ models. The non-Hookean material properties and geometry of highly deformable heart tubes and jellyfish bells will also be quantified and accurately modeled using discrete differential geometry. <br/><br/>This work will combine computational, mathematical, and experimental tools to ultimately answer some of questions posed in one of the five grand challenges in organismal biology: Integrating living and physical systems. Integrative mathematical models of the neurobiology, muscular mechanics, elasticity, and fluid dynamics of pumping tubular hearts and jellyfish bells will be developed. While great strides have been made in the modeling and simulation of each of these components separately, coupling these fields remains elusive. The working proposition that motivates this research is that modeling the complete neuromechanical system is more tractable for the two selected problems than almost any other given their relative simplicity. The results of this research may also provide a framework for the development of integrative models of other fundamental biological problems such as the movement and regulation of waste through the intestines, air through the lungs, and lymph through the lymphatic system. The educational focus of this proposal is to implement a unified training program for mathematicians and biologists centered on mathematical modeling in biology. The proposed educational activities will include a first year seminar in epidemiology, a course and associated text on mathematical modeling in comparative biomechanics for biologists and mathematicians, and a summer program for mathematical biologists at the UNC Galapagos Center. This educational program is motivated by the fact that it will be critical to train mathematics and biology students at this interface in order to rise to the scientific challenges that will be posed during the 21st century."

Hyperkhler manifolds are remarkable for their ubiquity in high energy physics, quantum field theory, and string theory. They arise naturally as parameter spaces for Yang-Mills instantons, magnetic monopoles, Higgs bundles, and solutions of many other physical equations. The P.I. will study the geometry and topology of hyperkhler manifolds. He will construct new examples of hyperkhler manifolds, and/or their singular counterparts, hyperkhler orbifolds. He will also establish new restrictions on the possible topological types of hyperkhler manifolds.

The P.I. will mentor PhD, masters, and undergraduate honors students, who will assist with the research project. He will enhance the training opportunities available to graduate students at the University of North Carolina by organizing mini-schools on advanced topics, by promoting student-led seminars, and by modernizing the geometry and topology courses. At the undergraduate level he will lead a problem solving seminar to coach students for mathematics competitions, facilitate research through honors projects, and initiate a new study abroad summer program for math majors and potential math majors.

He aims to show that every hyperkhler manifold can be deformed to a Lagrangian fibration, a hyperkhler manifold admitting a holomorphic fibre space structure. He then plans to establish general finiteness results by refining his earlier results for Lagrangian fibrations. He will exploit the analogies between compact and non-compact Lagrangian fibrations, such as Hitchin systems, to find new examples.

Complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. In this project, the PI will further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. This project also has a substantial educational component: The PI will develop a research experience in data science for first year undergraduate students at Louisiana State University (LSU).

Many classical results in the subject consider bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth, and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of conditions on the boundary.  Using this approach, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems, but also many new and interesting examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classification trees have been applied to variety of statistical problems, ranging from mortality studies to the recognition of functional groups in gene sequences.  Quantization trees have been applied to the compression of medical images and sampled speech.  The problem of designing good classification and quantization trees from finite data sets is usually addressed through the use of greedy growing algorithms.  While the empirical behavior of these algorithms is well understood, there has been little theory to support their use, or to examine their behavior on large data sets.  The proposed research will undertake a systematic study of greedy growing algorithms.

The term ""measure"" refers to an abstract generalization of length, area, or volume, which assigns a size value to every mathematical set. Traditional outlets for geometric measure theory have expanded in recent decades. The widespread utility and current use of geometric measure theory in different areas of analysis justifies its continued development. The research component of this project seeks to advance our understanding about underlying structures of general measures and to develop new techniques that will expand the toolbox that geometric measure theory provides for researchers in adjacent areas of analysis and geometry. On the educational front, this project will support a network of early career researchers whose research involves nonsmooth analysis, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who work in a number areas.  Principal activities by the PI include organizing a Workshop for Postdocs in Fall 2017 and a Conference for Graduate Students with Mini-Courses in Spring 2019. The two conferences will be linked: postdoctoral participants from the workshop will be invited to give mini-courses for graduate students in the follow-up conference. The PI will further integrate research and education by organizing an analysis learning seminar and mentoring two postdoctoral researchers at the PI's home institution.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a constellation of questions about the structure of Radon measures in Euclidean space. The underlying theme is that general measures may be understood in terms of their behavior with respect to lower dimensional sets such as finite length curves in the plane and finite area surfaces in space. This point-of-view originated in the 1920s and 1930s through investigations by A.S. Besicovitch, which compared and contrasted properties of finite length sets with properties of rectifiable curves.  Later contributions by A.P. Morse and J.F. Randolph, H. Federer, P. Mattila, and D. Preiss from the 1940s through the 1980s produced a rich theory of qualitative rectifiability of measures in Euclidean space that are absolutely continuous with respect to Hausdorff measures; a quantitative theory of rectifiability for Ahlfors regular measures emerged in the 1990s through the work of G. David and S. Semmes. The proposed research seeks to broaden our understanding of different notions of rectifiability of measures in the absence of background regularity hypotheses from past investigations. Specifically, the PI will look for characterizations of Radon measures which are carried by countable families of Hlder continuous curves, Lipschitz graphs, or Lipschitz continuous images of linear subspaces. This goal requires integration of techniques from modern harmonic analysis and quantitative geometric measure theory. The PI will explore approaches based on the PI's work with R. Schul, which characterized Radon measures that are carried by countable families of rectifiable curves, as well as approaches based on G. David and T. Toro's extension of the Reifenberg algorithm and approaches based on K. Rajala's quasiconformal uniformization theorem."

The current proposal focuses on those processes that arise naturally in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization. The common features of the proposed problems are simple formulation, fundamental mathematical structure, interesting underlying phenomena and non-trivial impacts on physical disciplines. One main aspect of the proposal is on extreme values for Gaussian processes. An example question is on the geometry of level sets for some spatial processes, and in particular whether one could walk on a random surface while staying on high mountains most of the time.  Another main aspect is on  phase transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems, and an example question is to decide whether there exists an assignment simultaneously satisfying a collection of random boolean formulae.  In addition, the PI intends to apply probability in related areas such as statistical learning and biological evolution. For example, the PI wishes to understand how features of individuals influence the structure of social network and what could be learned about individuals from the network structure.   Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for both graduate students in probability theory, and to develop topic courses that bring probability techniques to students in related areas.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications on a number of stochastic processes in statistical physics and optimization. In the direction of Gaussian processes, the proposal focuses on a number of aspects including the geometry of level sets for two-dimensional Gaussian free fields, an improvement on majorizing measure theory, as well as the connection between Gaussian free fields and random walks.  For instance, we intend to study the random geometry and random motion on the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, which is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity.  In the direction of random CSPs and optimization problems, the proposal features the intriguing phase transitions of the solution spaces predicted by statistical physicists. Since most classical NP-complete problems are expressed as CSPs and random CSPs are a rich source of computationally hard CSPs, the proposed study of random CSPs are expected to shed light on underlying barriers to algorithmic performance. Some of the study of random combinatorial optimization problems is related to understanding the average complexity of certain widely-used algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI proposes to study certain probabilistic models for social network such as random geometric graphs,  as well as the NK-fitness model in biological evolution with the aim of providing mathematical explanation to some experimental findings."

How might we compare their complexity in a productive way? The foundations of the present approach to this question were built in the 1960s with the development of the ultrapower construction. Roughly speaking, ultrapowers give a way of amplifying the original object in accordance with a coherent set of conditions, called an ultrafilter. Different ultrafilters produce different amplifications, but nonetheless by observing the range and characteristics of such amplifications  it is in a few fundamental cases possible, and in more complex cases conjecturally possible, to detect and classify the basic drivers of structure. One can make this description precise via a pre-order known as ""Keisler's order. Some important and striking special cases of the structure of Keisler's order were worked out in the seventies within the mathematical field of model theory and were very productive for its development. The difficulty in going further had long been double: a mathematical theory sufficient to detect and explain the details of the amplification by ultrafilters had not been developed, and little was known about the construction of ultrafilters - perhaps they may vary much more than the known examples suggest.  The PI's 2009 PhD thesis and early papers re-opened this area, developing our understanding of the interaction of ultrafilters and theories. Among these developments were connections to some phenomena in extremal combinatorics, such as Szemeredi's celebrated regularity lemma. Recently, joint work of the PI and Shelah has leveraged this developing approach to the comparison of complexity to solve problems in diverse areas of mathematics, such as a sixty-year-old question about cardinal invariants of the continuum and a characterization of the existence of irregular pairs in the regularity lemma.  A broad aim of the present project is therefore to develop our understanding of the nature of the complexity which ultrafilters detect and classify, in light of its possible applications, while addressing related problems from model theoretic classification theory and working to settle certain basic questions about the structure of Keisler's order. By means of assistantships, courses, summer programs, and visits, the project aims to include both undergraduates and graduate students from within the PI's institution and to support visitors with a range of relevant expertise. A component of the associated education project will involve training mathematically talented high school students.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, the proposed research concerns a large-scale classification program in model theory, which builds a framework for comparing the complexity of theories, and its emerging connections to the study of complexity in finite combinatorics, set theory, and general topology.  A longstanding open problem in this context is the problem of determining the structure of Keisler's 1967 order on theories. Recall that if D is a regular ultrafilter on I, and M, N are elementarily equivalent models in a countable language, we have that the D-ultrapower of M realizes all types over sets of size no more than |I| iff the D-ultrapower of N does. If so, let T be the associated theory, and let us say that D saturates T. Keisler's (pre-)order on countable theories, often considered as a partial order on the equivalence classes, sets T less than or equal to T' if every regular ultrafilter which saturates T' also saturates T. Three main research aims of the present project are the following.  The first is to investigate the model theory of simple unstable theories via the framework of Keisler's order. The second is to build the beginnings of a structure theory for the class of theories which are not simple but do not have the strong tree property SOP2, those conjecturally not maximal in Keisler's order, and to address related questions of ultrafilter construction. The third is to develop further the interactions with Szemeredi regularity and Ramsey theory and to investigate the effectiveness of earlier results with a view towards applications."

The investigator studies how singularities impact the behavior of existing statistical methods and develops new techniques for adequate assessment of statistical significance.  The focus is on algebraic statistical models, that is, models that have (semi-)algebraic sets as parameter spaces.  The class of algebraic models comprises many of the singular models employed in practice and can be studied using tools from computational algebraic geometry.  Importantly, the well-behaved local geometry of semi-algebraic sets makes it possible to obtain general results without having to assume difficult to verify regularity conditions.  The statistical techniques under study include classical procedures from likelihood inference such as likelihood ratio and Wald tests as well as information criteria.<br/><br/>Modern scientific studies often require analysis of data on several jointly observed variables.  Statistical models of dependence relationships among the different variables are often formulated using additional variables that are not observable (or hidden).  A common feature of hidden variable models is that their statistical properties are not entirely understood because of a lack of smoothness properties that makes them irregular.  This is the primary motivation for this project that develops theory and methods that have a bearing on problems such as determining the number and type of unobserved variables to be included in a statistical model.  Such problems arise in particular in applications in the social sciences where key concepts such as intelligence are not directly observable, and in computational biology where hidden variables are employed, for example, when DNA of present-day species is used to validate evolutionary theories that involve extinct species.  More broadly, the work is relevant for any study, medical or otherwise, in which the existence of influential unobserved variables cannot be excluded.<br/>"

Kerr spacetimes and perturbations of such are of particular interest, due to aspirations to contribute to a proof of the stability of this family of solutions to Einstein's equations.  Recent work has focused on proving localized energy estimates and Strichartz estimates, which are both measures of the dispersive nature of the wave equation which are known to be fairly robust.  The former have played a key role in Tataru's recent proof of the long conjectured Price's law, which asserts a certain decay rate for solutions to the wave equation on the Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds.  A key feature of these blackhole spacetimes which demands extra attention is the existence of trapped rays.  In flat space, light travels on lines which escape to infinity.  Thus packets of a solution which are initially overlapping but traveling in even slightly different directions quickly spread out, and this spreading promotes decay.  On Schwarzschild, the paths on which light travels are dictated by the geometry, and in particular, there is a region, called the photon sphere, where photons can orbit the blackhole.  Such trapping, where the rays remain in a compact set, is a known obstacle to certain dispersive estimates, such as localized energy estimates.  Trapping also occurs on the Kerr family of spacetimes, though its geometry is more complicated.  <br/><br/>General relativity asserts that the universe is a (1+3) dimensional curved space and that gravity corresponds to the curvature of this space.  A common description is to think of the universe as a trampoline.  A mass, such as a bowling ball, which is placed on the trampoline causes it to curve in such a way as to attract other objects on the surface.  Einstein's equations model the curvature and evolution of such curvature of universes.  Though Einstein's equations are quite nonlinear, a few special solutions are known.  These are typically found by imposing many symmetries to simplify the equations.  Of particular relevance to this proposal are the Minkowski space time, the family of Schwarzschild space times, and the Kerr family of space times.  These correspond to the flat solution, to spherically symmetric black holes, and to rotating black holes respectively.  A natural question to ask is whether these solutions are stable.  That is, if one starts close to, say, a member of the Kerr family of space times, will it necessarily remain close to a member of the Kerr family.  The only rigorous proofs of (nonlinear) stability are for the Minkowski space time, which began with the seminal work of Christodoulou and Klainerman.  The stability of the Kerr family of space times is a major open problem in mathematical relativity which has been garnering much interest recently.  A thorough understanding of the decay properties of the wave equation on such backgrounds is considered to be prerequisite knowledge to any proof of such stability.  The studies in this proposal are expected to directly contribute to this.  The teaching components of this proposal consist primarily of the development of a course on general relativity as well as a first year seminar course.  The research and teaching components are integrated through reading seminars and directed research projects."

The proposed methods are expected to bring a great impact to accelerate the discovery of new personalized treatment strategies. Therefore the proposed work is directly related with the White House Precision Medicine Initiative(https://www.whitehouse.gov/precision-medicine) as a research effort to revolutionize how to improve health and treat disease. The proposed methods are also general enough to be applied to a variety of data sources including clinical, biomarker, economic and financial data. If successful, the projects will greatly enhance the acquisition and analysis of large-scale data for the scientific and engineering communities.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposal is to develop cutting-edge semiparametric methods and machine learning tools to realize the promise of precision medicine. Specifically, the PI aims to: develop flexible and efficient methods for discovering optimal ITRs (Aim 1); develop a general class of optimal ITRs (Aim 2); develop optimal ITRs with high-dimensional data (Aim 3); and develop optimal ITRs under population heterogeneity (Aim 4). The proposed work contributes to both semiparametric inference and machine learning fields. Machine learning methods have rarely been studied for doubly robust estimation and optimal ITRs with high-dimensional data. The theoretical developments including driving nonasymptotic distribution, risk bounds, new empirical process technical tools are challenging. The methodologies to be developed in this project will be fundamentally important and generally applicable for studying semiparametric models in high-dimensional setting. Using semiparametric and machine learning methods for precision medicine is an emerging novel area. The integration of research and education is a key aspect of this project. New courses on statistical learning and semiparametric inference will be developed. These courses will broaden the areas of specialized training in a department that has a strong history of attracting under represented groups.

It combines in a single program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participating of those traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic careers that include both research and education.  The research will focus on the development of computational techniques for dendritic solidification in three dimensions using two methods.  The first method is implementation of adaptive mesh refinement to simulate the phase field model of dendritic growth, which models the solid/liquid interface by a  thinviscous layer.  In addition to the coding complexity, the central issues are construction of stable and accurate time discretization formulas, specification of accurate criteria to guide the automatic refinement strategy, and possible permiting the interface thickness to depend on local velocity.  The second, more speculative, method is a lattice-based variational method, using an Ising-type model and simulated annealing to minimize a combination of bulk and surface energy at each time step.  The first approach is expected to be effective at large undercoolings or supersaturations, where kinetic effects are important; the second approach will be more efficient at small undercoolings, near local equilibrium.    The overall purpose of this project is to develop effective computational tools for predicting and controlling the microstructure  which develops almost every time a metal or other substance solidifies  from its melt, that is, in almost every casting process from horseshoes to jet turbine blades.  The details of this microstructure have a tremendous influence on the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the resulting material piece; if the processes which produce them could be understood and controlled, then dramatic improvements might be possible.  The teaching side of this project is construction of an applied mathematics component for the University of Chicago's SESAME program, which teaches mathematics to elementary teachers from the Chicago Public Schools.  The investigator will develop classroom and computer material focusing on the questions of how and why objects in Nature assume the shapes they do in response to their physical environment; he will consider trees and tree leaves, soap films, crystals, seashells, and square-cube scaling laws."

The ever-increasing need for improved accuracy leads to very large-scale and complex dynamical systems. Simulations in such large-scale settings can overwhelm computational resources; this is the main motivation for model reduction. The goal is to produce a simpler reduced-order model approximating the original one as accurately as possible. The resulting reduced model can then be used as an efficient surrogate to the original, to replace it in a larger simulation or to develop a simpler and faster controller suitable for real time applications. Krylov-based methods have emerged as promising candidates for model reduction in realistic large-scale settings. This project seeks to develop optimal, robust, and systematic Krylov-based projection methods for efficient construction of high fidelity and optimal reduced-order models. By carefully employing inexact solves in a Krylov-based model reduction setting, the proposed research will extend these optimal reduction techniques to realistic settings with millions of degrees of freedom while maintaining the same quality of the error measures with respect to the exact rational Krylov subspaces. In addition, systematic approaches will be developed for the design of fast and effective, low-order optimal controllers, and more generally, for reduction of interconnected (coupled) systems. The project will apply the newly developed methods to several test problems drawn from different application areas.<br/><br/>Large-scale simulations and computations play a crucial role in studying a great variety of complex physical phenomena in many areas of computational science and engineering. Examples include signal propagation and interference in electric circuits, molecular dynamics, weather forecasting, wave propagation and vibration suppression in large structures, temperature control in various media, and behavior of micro-electro-mechanical systems. Computing in large-scale settings leads to unmanageably large demands on the nation's computational resources; hence there is a growing need to approximate the complex dynamical systems with simpler, high fidelity models that will make these simulations much easier and faster to compute. This project seeks to develop techniques that will yield optimal, high fidelity approximations of complex systems; leading at once to simulations that are more rapid yet still reliable. The mathematical tools and high-quality software that will be developed through the course of this project will contribute to research efforts of scientist and engineers working with large-scale, complex multi-physics problems. In addition to the research component, this project offers a comprehensive education plan that consists of the supervision of undergraduate and graduate students; development of a graduate course; and several interdisciplinary research projects available for introducing students in a variety of areas of high-performance scientific computing.<br/><br/>"

Both initiatives are investing heavily in generating high-resolution data, which once analyzed properly, can yield insights that will pave the foundations of advanced treatments for genetic and nervous system disorders. To fully maximize the potential impact of collecting such data, this proposal develops a new framework for identifying complicated underlying patterns in multiway arrays. Specifically, the project fills a gap in nonparametric estimation of low-dimensional structure and geometry in big and noisy data arrays. The PI plans to develop a training program based on applications of the proposed research to recruit and retain talented high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups for potential careers as innovative data scientists. <br/><br/>Modern data matrices present two challenges to their analyses: (1) they are transposable in the sense that both their rows and columns are often of interest and may contain non-trivial dependencies among them, and (2) they may be very large. The first challenge has only partially been addressed by existing biclustering or co-clustering methods. These methods can identify only very simple coupled structures that organize the rows and columns. In order to flexibly model and extract more complicated patterns in large data matrices, in which both rows and columns are high-dimensional, one requires a new co-manifold learning framework that can discover a wider range of intrinsic geometries of the rows and columns. To meet the first challenge, this project develops a framework for performing joint nonlinear dimension reduction on the rows and columns.  The proposed methods construct multiscale distances that are invariant to row and column permutations, equipping practitioners with a means to estimate the intrinsic organization of the rows and columns of a data matrix without prior information on any row or column orderings. To meet the second challenge, this project formulates the key computations as optimization problems that admit distributed parallel algorithms with nearly linear speed-up. The framework also generalizes naturally to the higher-order generalization of matrices, multiway arrays or tensors. Finally, the estimated intrinsic geometries possess stability guarantees, namely small perturbations in the data due to noise or adjustments to input parameters cannot lead to disproportionately large variations in the estimated intrinsic geometry. The proposed procedures have the potential to enable practitioners to extract complicated patterns stably from massive data tensors with non-trivial dependencies along their modes or axes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High-dimensional and massive data are now emerging in scientific areas including biomedical engineering, environmental science, financial econometrics, array signal processing, and social networks, among many others. An important associated research challenge is to develop efficient methods to extract information and quantify its uncertainty for a large number of variables and measurements. Data-driven statistical inferential procedures for uncertainty quantification via the bootstrap methods are often computationally intensive for high-dimensional large-scale datasets. On the computational side, this research project will make use of distributed inference via the parallel high-performance computing technique, which is an essential ingredient to speed up bootstrap calculations. On the statistical side, this research will introduce a general framework for studying the performance of various bootstrap methods. This research project aims to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental tradeoff between statistical and computational concerns in quantifying uncertainty for a broad class of inferential procedures, thus providing guidance to practically optimize statistical accuracy and computational cost in potential real applications. Both undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the project.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research project is to provide new insights and deepen the theoretical understanding of strengths and fundamental limitations of fully data-dependent inferential procedures (such as bootstraps) in the high-dimensional and massive data framework on two classical problems: i) change point detection and identification; ii) computationally-aware statistical inference for U-statistics. The research aims to develop statistically correct and computationally scalable inferential procedures when the dimension can be larger (or even much larger) than the sample size. In contrast to existing work, the methods under development have strong theoretical guarantees, are robust under mild assumptions, require no tuning, and are easy to parallelize. Of practical interest, the research will develop needed software tools for researchers from disciplines with applications of high-dimensional and nonparametric statistics. Theoretical contributions of the proposed research include establishing new approximation and coupling theorems (under weaker regularity conditions than existing literature) in high-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces of increasing dimension and complexity, where classical probability tools such as the central limit theorem and extreme value theory are no longer applicable. The mathematical theory is of independent interest and will provide powerful new tools to analyze other statistical procedures on high-dimensional and nonparametric models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus is on the study of the regularity properties of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, and their connections with the well posedness of such problems; parts of the project concern non local diffusions. The partial differential equations investigated in this project arise from stochastic models dealing with discontinuous processes. A  number of models from finance, physics, population dynamics, chemistry and biology  involve non local diffusions. Another related direction of research concerns the interaction between local or non local diffusion with advection. There are a number of advection-diffusion models from physics that are not currently well understood mathematically. Typical examples of such phenomena arise in the study of equations that model fluids dynamics. The principal investigator Luis Silvestre will study estimates for advection-diffusion equations geared towards an improved understanding of the active scalar equations arising from models in fluid dynamics. Silvestre will also investigate a number of questions related to fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations that occur in the study of zero-sum stochastic games.<br/><br/>This mathematics research projects studies the behavior of so-called non-local equations. Such equations arise in any physical model with long range interactions. They also arise naturally as the equations governing any probabilistic model whose values may take long jumps. A common example is the modeling of stock prices in financial mathematics, which could sporadically take sudden changes. Non local equations appear in myriad of models from physics, finance, social sciences and biology. Their applications may range from the valuation of financial options, to the effective computation of protein docking, which is useful in the design of medicinal drugs, and even in the modeling of the flight of birds. The development of a general theory of non local partial differential equations has seen great progress in recent years, which goes side to side with an increasing number of applications. The equations describing the dynamics of fluids present very difficult mathematical questions. Luis Silvestre (the principal investigator in this project) will also study certain diffusion equations, local and non local, in moving fluids. For the educational part of this proposal, Silvestre will organize summer schools, design an improved partial differential equations class for undergraduates, as well as teaching a graduate class; Silvestre will also organize conferences, and will mentor graduate students and postdoctoral fellows."

Examples for such invariants are rank, cost, Betti numbers, Heegaard genus, amenability, spectral gap, bounded generation and girth. The historical background of the project is subgroup growth and profinite groups (Lubotzky, Segal, Shalev and Wilson), finitely presented groups and topology (Luck and Lackenby), orbit equivalence (Weiss, Popa and Furman) and self-similar groups (Grigorchuk and Nekrasevich).<br/>A group is called residually finite, if the intersection of its subgroups of finite index is trivial. This means that finite images approximate the group structure. Important examples are finitely generated linear groups, and specifically, arithmetic groups. The core object of interest is a descending chain of finite index subgroups. There is an interesting interplay between the combinatorics of the finite coset actions in the chain, the dynamics of the measure preserving action on the boundary of the corresponding coset tree and the structure of the discrete group. This interplay allows one e.g. to apply rigidity theorems in measurable group theory and get new graph theoretical results.

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

Schubert varieties are fascinating geometrical objects which lie at the intersection of several fields of mathematics; their study began with the classical works in projective geometry of the nineteen century.  Better understanding of these structures would have impact in algebraic geometry, combinatorics and representation theory. Outside of mathematics, these results may have applications in theoretical physics, computer graphics, and the study of Bucky balls (Carbon-60 molecules).  A further goal of this proposal is to explore the changing roll of computers in mathematics.  Computer verification and computer proofs play a central role in characterizing properties of Schubert varieties by pattern avoidance.<br/><br/>An important aspect of this proposal is its educational component. Mathematics education and research are intrinsically linked - research brings out the creativity and drive needed to learn new mathematical concepts.  In particular, undergraduate students enjoy the challenge of facing unsolved problems.  However, due to the nature of mathematics research, finding ""good"" undergraduate research problems is difficult.  Computer verified proofs and computer experimentation are particularly well suited to the skills and knowledge of undergraduates while also of interest to graduate students and more senior researchers.  Therefore, this line of research has been incorporated into the education portion of the proposal through a new course and undergraduate research projects. <br/>"

The main objective is to reveal new and further explore previously known links between the moduli spaces and objects in other fields of mathematics, in particular Representation Theory and Lower Dimensional Topology. The PI will work toward a proof of the mathematical conjecture relating the topological invariants of the Hilbert scheme of points on plane singular curves and the HOMFLY knot homology of the links of the singularities of the curve (Hilb/HOMFLY formula). The conjecture also reveals unexpected symmetries of the homology of torus knots: conjecturally, they form an irreducible representation of the rational Cherednik algebra of type A. The PI will explore the generalized Hilb/HOMFLY conjecture that relates the representation theory of the symplectic reflection algebras and the rational Cherednik algebras of types other than A. Finally, the PI describes the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobians of quasi-homogeneous singularities. The PI (jointly with Zhiwei Yum) conjectures a relation between the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobian of the curve and the structure ring of the moduli space of the rational maps to the curve: a local variation of the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas relation. The educational component of the project offers a new model for the UMass REU program.  <br/><br/>Knot invariants and topological invariants allow us to analyze the global structure of complicated shapes by collecting local information about the shape. Complicated shapes occur naturally in biology (e.g. proteins, DNA), theoretical physics (strings), and other areas of natural science. Thus developing new invariants and computational methods for understanding of the global structure of complex shapes is an important mathematical problem with many potential applications. The PI strives to understand the hidden symmetries of already discovered invariants, develop new invariants, and find unexpected applications of these invariants to other areas of mathematics. The PI will also involve undergraduate students in cutting edge research through a summer research program integrating mentorship by faculty and graduate students. The PI aims to attract more students from underrepresented groups to mathematical research by reserving specific spaces in the summer research program for students from two local women's colleges. The PI will prepare graduate student mentors during the year by teaching related graduate classes and a reading seminar. This new summer research program structure will increase diversity and strengthen vertical integration in academia and improve the communication and flow of ideas between different generations of present and future researchers."

Further, extending <br/>beyond intrinsic network dynamics, he will ask how these basic network properties <br/>determine the ways in which patterns of synchrony can be controlled by external stimulation.   <br/>Answering these complementary questions requires synergies between methods of <br/>stochastic processes, dynamical systems, and statistical inference.<br/><br/>How do how networked neurons work together to produce the brain's astonishing <br/>computational ability?   Such coordinated neural dynamics are characterized by <br/>synchrony among different neurons.  One prospect is that this coordinated <br/>activity opens new channels for signal processing:  there is a combinatorial <br/>explosion in the number of possible multi-neuron patterns that can occur in <br/>increasingly large networks.  However, we only have the first hints at whether <br/>and when these patterns systematically occur in the brain's networks, and what <br/>information they might (or might not) carry.  Shea-Brown will study the <br/>fundamental properties of neural dynamics, connectivity, and noise that <br/>determine the level and impact of multi-neuron synchrony in a series of <br/>networks of gradually increasing complexity.

These findings will <br/>contribute to experimental and clinical neuroscience:  working in <br/>collaboration with experimentalists, the investigator will make predictions for light stimuli <br/>that evoke higher-order correlations in the retina, and for electrical stimuli <br/>that suppress pathological synchrony in neurodegenerative disease.

Upon completion, it will lead to a comprehensive general understanding of high dimensional eigenanalysis that will significantly enhance the ability to employ it in a wide range of scientific settings. The methodological development will be disseminated to the broader scientific community through user-friendly software packages that will serve as the basis for potential applications. The research output will also be effectively integrated with educational activities such as course development and mentoring at both undergraduate and graduate levels."

We can gain information about an abstract group (and the properties of its multiplication) by analyzing the geometry of the object it is acting upon. This is the genesis of geometric group theory.

Direct sampling of the Earth's deep interior is impossible due to the extreme pressures and temperatures. Our knowledge of the Earth?s deep interior is thus pieced together from a range of surface observations. Among surface observations, seismic waves emitted by earthquakes are effective probes of the Earth?s deep interior and are relatively inexpensively recorded by networks of seismographs at the Earth's surface. Unprecedented volumes of seismic data brought by dense global seismograph networks offer researchers both opportunities and challenges to explore the Earth?s deep interior. The key challenge is that directly applying statistical methods to this ultra-large sample seismic data using current computing resources is prohibitive. To facilitate geophysical discoveries that can enhance our understanding of the Earth?s deep interior using current computing resources, the investigator proposes a family of novel statistical methods under a subsampling framework. The proposed methods provide an opportunity to study various distinct statistical problems, such as function estimation and variable selection, in a unified framework. The investigator will establish asymptotic and finite sample theory to investigate the approximation accuracy and consistency of the proposed methods.<br/><br/>How to analyze ultra-large sample data creates a significant challenge in almost all fields of science and engineering.  Scientists and engineers develop various solutions to tackle the problem, such as developing cloud computing for aggregating a wide range of computing resources and building powerful supercomputers.  However, the high cost of these solutions creates an extraordinary budget barrier for researchers. The proposed subsampling methods provide alternative methods to surmount this challenge. The theory to be established will benefit a wide spectrum of research in science and engineering. They will offer a unique educational experience for both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in cutting-edge statistical and interdisciplinary research and inspire new lines of researches in three distinct fields: statistics, geophysics, and computational biology."

Solitons as per their structural robustness and quasi-elastic interactions are natural building blocks that have been used for information transmission in optical settings in the past and could naturally be extended as information carriers in this new matter wave setup. Furthermore, these structures can be appropriately manipulated, waveguided or used to construct various patterns at this microscopic (atomic) level. The study will be undertaken at three different levels: (1) The level of creating these solitary waves by taking advantage of instabilities and/or experimentally available mechanisms (such as the Feshbach resonance); (2) The one of manipulating the waves (either dragging them by means of an optical tweezers or waveguiding them through  junctions); (3) And, finally, at the level of combining them to create patterns and to identify their steady states and structural transitions. These steps will be carried through for the two principal types of interactions: a) For attractive interactions between the atoms (e.g., for focusing nonlinearities and negative scattering lengths as in the case of lithium); b) For repulsive interactions  (e.g., for defocusing nonlinearities and positive scattering lengths as in the case of rubidium and sodium). The models that will be examined will be both continuum models of partial differential equations with external potentials (linear or quadratic, or combination thereof), as well as quasi-discrete ones (relevant for periodic external potentials<br/>as in the case of the so-called optical lattice). The techniques that will be used will involve regular and singular perturbation<br/>methods, linear and modulational stability analysis, regular and possibly exponential asymptotics, numerical bifurcation theory as well as direct numerical simulations and also molecular dynamics techniques (to study patterns and their structural transitions). <br/><br/>The main focus of this research project is a detailed study of solitary waves generated in the very controllable, ultra-low temperature, atomic physics context of Bose-Einstein  condensates (BECs). Since their recent experimental realization (for which the 2001 Physics Nobel prize was awarded), BECs have been the center of an intensive and ever growing experimental and theoretical effort in the Mathematics and Physics communities. The examination of BECs has also strong ties with a deeper understanding of the exciting and important fields of superconductivity and superfluidity (which were the theme of the Physics Nobel prize in 2003). From a Mathematical Physics perspective, one of the most interesting and appealing aspects of studying BECs is their rich nonlinear wave phenomenology, the wide variety of possible settings (one to three dimensions) and the detailed experimental control that permits a precise engineering/manipulation of the external conditions under which these waves dynamically evolve.<br/>The main purpose of this research effort is to extend and deepen our <br/>understanding of the fundamental structures and waves and their role<br/>and importance in BECs, but also more generally (due to the similar<br/>mathematical description) in nonlinear optics (optical fibers and<br/>waveguides) as well as wave physics. As an aside, it should be noted that this effort will heavily rely on computational resources and the concomitant use of numerical codes that model these phenomena; it should also be remarked that one of the longer term perspectives of this activity on matter waves is to conceive and construct novel devices that would guide and more generally control the motion of the matter waves and could potentially be used for quantum information processing at the nanoscale. These aspects lead us to expect that significant benefits may result from the implementation of this project in areas of strategic federal interest such as high performance computing and materials and manufacturing.<br/><br/>"

The project  roughly breaks up into two parts.  The first part concerns the study of moduli spaces and log geometry.  Since log geometry and logarithmic structures are closely related to degenerations,  log geometry plays a natural role in the study of compactifications of moduli spaces.  The PI studies several problems related to log geometry and moduli spaces, and also studies a logarithmic Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, generalizing the classical theorem for schemes. The second part of the project concerns sheaves on algebraic stacks. A central theme in this part of the project is trace formulas and their generalizations to stacks. Central to all parts of the project is the close relationship between algebraic stacks and log geometry discovered in earlier work of the PI.<br/><br/><br/>Given a system of polynomial equations defining an algebraic variety, there are two natural ways to study the system.  One approach is to study the symmetries of the equations, and a second approach is to vary the coefficients of the equations (""moduli"") and ""degenerate"" them to a simpler (though possibly singular) system.  Stacks, introduced by Artin, Deligne, Grothendieck, and Mumford in the late 1960's, are the main tool used in algebraic geometry to study spaces with additional symmetries. In recent years, the theory of stacks has come to play an important role in almost every part of algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and mathematical physics and a great number of exciting new  <br/>applications of stacks have been found.   For example, stacks play a  <br/>central role in the study of Brauer groups and in the rich interaction between string theory and algebraic geometry. For the study of degenerations, a key tool is the theory of logarithmic geometry developed by Kato, Fontaine, and Illusie in the late 1980's.

We have been and will continue to be particularly interested in two specific models: the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity, and micromagnetics. In the area of micromagnetics, we studied previously some simplified two-dimensional model in the asymptotic regime corresponding to sharp ""domain-wall"" transitions. We established some optimal energy estimates, and exhibited optimal patterns for the transition profile, which fit very well with the ""cross-tie wall"" observations, and gave a first example of a non one-dimensional optimal profile in a vector-valued phase-transition problem. We intend to pursue this analysis towards more physically relevant models. In the area of the Ginzburg-Landau model, we previously focused on understanding the apparition, structure, and location, of vortices. We established a Gamma-convergence result deriving a limiting free-boundary problem, and proved convergence to some limiting vortex-densities, which we characterized, for minimizers as well as critical points. The project is to pursue further the analysis in the regime of high-applied fields, and turn towards the study of the associated dynamical models. We hope to establish the limiting dynamical laws obeyed by the vortices, first for a finite number of them, then for an infinite number of them, via some new estimates and an energetic approach to gradient-flow. Beyond that, we will be interested in understanding better the convergence of gradient flows for general Gamma-converging energies.<br/><br/>This project, in the field of analysis and PDEs, is concerned with the analysis of statics and dynamics in some models from physics, in particular the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity and microagnetics. In both cases the focus is on understanding, via rigorous mathematical proofs, the qualitative behavior of solutions to such models, and in particular explain the structure and the dynamics of singularities arising in some asymptotic regimes.<br/><br/>The purpose of such research is thus two-fold. First to shed light on the understanding of the specific physical problems themselves: by obtaining asymptotic expansions and explicit formulas, one can explain physical experiments, confirm or disprove the validity of models, and by rigorous<br/>analysis one can one also derive reduced simplified models (for example reducing the dimension) that are easier to work and compute/simulate with. The second purpose is more mathematical. As mentioned, the underlying philosophy is to manage to reduce the original asymptotic problems to simpler limiting problems (of lower dimension) on which the core phenomena (here singularities) can be tracked down. This is the main philosophy of ``Gamma-convergence''. In order to perform such analysis, one needs to develop appropriate mathematical tools and provide the right settings to understand the phenomena. One also wishes to understand how much of the behavior is particular, and how much can be extended and understood as a more general mathematical phenomenon, with the hope that what is understood for one specific model may in turn help to understand others. <br/>"

Complex data demand statistical models that are sufficiently flexible to adapt to meaningful, underlying signals, allowing scientists to discover unexpected patterns.  Yet as society relies more heavily on statistical algorithms to make decisions impacting everyday life, it becomes increasingly important for a method's output to be interpretable by non-experts.  This demands parsimony: that simpler explanations be favored over more complicated ones.  For example, the Internet has led to unprecedented quantities of data in the form of text (such as articles, blogs, webpages, consumer reviews, and many other social media products).  Such text data represent a potential treasure trove of insights into the world -- what people are thinking, how this is changing over time, how this varies by location, etc. The investigator develops new statistical methods for overcoming major technical challenges to gleaning useful information from this data.  This same methodology can be applied to the study of the microbiome, the vast community of microbes living in an environment such as the human gut.  Better statistical methods are needed to identify types of microbes in the gut that play a crucial role in human health and disease.  Another problem that is tackled in this project involves modeling data collected over time (such as wind-speed data and wildlife monitoring).  The methods that are developed allow for more accurate forecasting, which is crucial in many areas including health and medicine and the development of lower cost energy systems.  The last major area in this project is devoted to making the process of statistical research more efficient and its software of higher quality and easier to share across the community of statistical researchers.  Finally, all three research objectives are closely integrated with educational outcomes, including the supervision and teaching of graduate students, outreach to non-statisticians and non-scientists, and the release of undergraduate-accessible mini-papers describing the investigator's new research findings.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the design of new statistical methods that balance two important and often opposing needs: flexibility and parsimony.  (1) Building predictive regression and classification models is difficult when the features are highly sparse.  While many methods focus on the challenge of high dimensionality, relatively few have considered the obstacle posed by features that are rarely nonzero. The investigator develops a new framework for feature selection when the features are highly sparse that succeeds where preexisting methods fail.  This is studied both from theoretical and computational standpoints.  (2) High-dimensional covariance estimation and time series modeling are two rich, but largely distinct, areas in statistics, which the investigator combines to develop new methods for modeling locally stationary time series.  The added flexibility in going from stationarity to local stationarity must be carefully balanced with parsimony.  (3) A series of area-specific software modules will be distributed freely online building on the investigator's new platform for streamlining the process of performing simulation studies.  Each module will implement some of the most common models, methods, and metrics used in a given area of statistics research.  The goal is to facilitate the sharing of high-quality, reproducible simulation code in the statistics research community by creating an easily-adaptable standardized format."

A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.  Since the path-breaking work of Belavin, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov in the 1970's and 1980's, it has been understood---at least heuristically---that the laws of certain macroscopic observables of these systems should be invariant under conformal maps from one planar domain to another.  Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.  Many of the these problems have natural higher dimensional analogs that we are only beginning to understand.

Both  projects study resonance among geophysical waves, in very  different scales: the former considers energy transfer through  the self-similar inertial range, from the long waves beyond which  the system is forced, to the short waves below which dissipative  mechanisms take over, and the latter concentrates on the very  long waves, comparable to the radius of the Earth, where forcing  plays an important role.  In fact, the resonance between long  equatorial waves could be considered as a starting point for the  resonant energy transfer toward shorter waves.  Once the scales  become relatively small, detailed information on the nature of  the forces is lost, and a statistically self-similar regime  arises, further carrying the energy through a wide range of  scales toward the very short waves.  The educational component of  this proposal involves developing a curriculum which blends  applied mathematics and geophysical fluid dynamics.  Particular  efforts are devoted to integrate experimental and numerical work  into both graduate and undergraduate education.  This is  facilitated by the building of a Laboratory for Fluid Dynamics at  the Courant Institute, scheduled to open in the Spring of 1997.  Two new graduate courses in the mathematical modeling of  geophysical waves are developed, one introductory and the other  more advanced, the latter focused on nonlinear mechanisms of  energy transfer among geophysical waves.  Numerical modeling and  desk-top experimentation are integrated into advanced  undergraduate mathematical courses, with the goal of introducing  undergraduate students to the lure and potential of  interdisciplinary work.       The Ocean and Atmospheric  Sciences have reached a degree of  maturity such that the accurate prediction of the weather and  even of longer term climatological changes appears to be within  reach.  A basic understanding of many of the fundamental processes  underlying the prevailing winds and currents has been developed  over the last few decades; and the computational power brought  about by the computer revolution makes it possible to run global  models with relatively fine grids.  However, the dynamics of the  weather and climate has a tremendous complexity, with phenomena  taking place in a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  This  complexity makes it hopeless to resolve all the relevant  phenomena without appealing to strong simplifying assumptions.  Applied Mathematics provides powerful tools that may help clarify  the validity of the various assumptions and shed light on many  phenomena not yet fully understood.  The two proposed subjects of  this research are examples of fields where this contribution  should be particularly fruitful.  The dynamics of equatorial waves  is known to strongly affect the global weather and climate;  phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and its global  effects exemplify this.  In order to study phenomena of this kind,  one needs to go beyond the time scale of the order of days of the  waves, to the months or years where small effects accumulate to  yield substantial changes in the amplitude and behavior of the  waves.  Asymptotic multiple-scale analysis is an ideal applied  mathematical tool to achieve this.  As for the other line of  research, understanding the transfer of energy among scales in  the Ocean and Atmosphere is fundamental to predict the long-time  effects that a change in forcing, such as the one brought about  by the release of chemicals in the Atmosphere and the Ocean, may  produce on our weather.  Involving students in these lines of  research, and bringing research-related results and methods into  their classroom education, also helps develop a  generation of  scientists better equipped to understand the difficult and  important problems of atmosphere and ocean interactions."

They relate to a transport of some substance, for example a pollutant or particulate material, by a flow, be it a fluid or gas flow or an intra-cellular flow.  Mathematically, a certain scalar or vector field (e.g. density, vorticity, temperature) is carried by some velocity field.  These phenomena can be described by partial differential equations (PDE), which often involve both nonlocal (dependence on the history of the flow or on the not necessarily close-by events) and nonlinear terms. Examples include the 2D Boussinesq equation that models large scale atmospheric and oceanic flows, and the diffusion-aggregation equation that models collective animal behavior. Due to the nonlocal and nonlinear nature of these equations, it is often unknown whether solutions exist globally in time or develop a finite-time singularity. Even in the cases where solutions are known to be global, their long-time behavior remains unclear for many equations. This project aims to develop novel analytical tools for a range of transport equations arising in fluid dynamics and biology, focusing on singularity, asymptotic, and mixing properties of the solutions. An integral part of the project is the educational component including developing advanced courses, supervising undergraduate research, and conducting a young researchers' workshop on nonlinear PDE. The workshop features mini-courses by established researchers and short talks by junior participants, aiming to introduce young researchers to the forefront of PDE research and facilitate collaborations. This project will advance the mathematical understanding of nonlocal PDE and their applications in fluids and biology.  The project will also provide opportunities for education and training of junior researchers in this vibrant field.<br/><br/>This project contains three different but related directions. The first direction is to obtain finite-time singularity formation for some fluid equations. The plan is to start with some one-dimensional model equations and prove finite-time singularity by establishing some kind of global control up to the blow-up time. The study of these model equations may shed new light on the full dynamics of fluid equations in higher dimensions. A second direction is the development of new tools for understanding the long-time dynamics of aggregation-diffusion equations, where the gradient flow structure plays an important role. A third direction is mixing by incompressible flows, and the goal is to study how fast the density can get mixed given some quantitative constraint of the velocity field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F.

The application focus of the proposal is motivated by two core problems: neutrophil chemotaxis in the blood stream and cellular mechanics in microcirculation.  Principally, these models are governed by coupled anisotropic diffusion-convection-reaction equations and coupled Stokes equations.  The efficient and effective numerical solutions of these complex equations is central to the proposed work.  This includes the development of an effective discontinuous least-squares spectral element method, a comparison with popular strategies such as discontinuous Galerkin, and the development of an integrated algebraic multigrid preconditioner for use with high-order spectral elements in this situation.  Ultimately, this work establishes a theoretical and computation base for further research in discontinuous least-squares methods and high-order preconditioning.  Moreover, an intrinsic element of this project is  the integration of new methods in numerical PDEs and iterative methods into the existing scientific computing curriculum to help train future computational scientists.<br/><br/>As physical models grow in complexity and high-performance computing environments grow in speed, so do the demands on the underlying mathematical algorithms.  The goal of this project is to make progress toward a more generalized mathematical framework that encompasses more layers of the entire simulation tool chain.  Large-scale computational analysis is a critical experimental component in many areas of the physical sciences and yet, computational scientists are limited in their tool set.  Olson proposes to develop a multilevel approximation method for core applications, such as cellular behavior in the blood stream, and to expand wider adaptation of new methods in the field through outreach and education. The proposed research methodology promotes conformity with the physics of the problem, allows for a natural and extensible computational implementation, and yields an accurate and efficient solution.  This project will develop new steps for the multilevel methodology, disseminate the computational tools to the broader scientific and computing community, and train students and scientists on using these emerging computational technologies.<br/>"

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are the dimensions that are substantially least understood. One-and two-dimensional spaces are ""small"" enough that nothing interesting can happen; five-dimensional spaces are ""large"" enough that interesting things have room to become uninteresting. A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere. This group has deep connections to the substantial difference between the topological and smooth categories in four-dimensions, and to structural issues in higher dimensional topology. In the past thirty years, substantial progress on this and other central topological questions has been made using invariants from gauge theory (which deals with solutions of partial differential equations from physics) and Floer theory (which deals with rigid curves in spaces with a notion of area). This project will use tools from Floer theory to study the homology cobordism groups and other topological questions, and to undertake new theoretical work in Floer theory that will produce useful tools for low-dimensional topology. In parallel to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring and outreach efforts, with a focus on increasing the accessibility of mathematics at early stages and on building pedagogical and mentorship skills in young researchers.  These plans include an extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for workshops for building academic communication skills. <br/><br/><br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism. The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S. Sarkar, the Principal Investigator plans to construct one, and to use it to study many situations in low-dimensional topology that possess natural symmetries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the central questions are the nature of sparsity in different contexts, and how it determines our ability or inability to deal with high dimensional data. The investigator studies a reproducing kernel Hilbert space based framework to exploit sparsity for general predictive problems. The framework underpins the connections among various popular methods that encourage sparsity, and provides an opportunity to study them in a unified fashion, which in turn will foster the development of improved methods and algorithms. The investigator will also consider the problem of covariance matrix estimation and selection. The research concentrates on understanding the nature of and connection among various notions of sparsity for large covariance matrix, and their relationship with Gaussian graphical models.<br/><br/>From the world's most powerful telescopes to the finest atomic force microscopes, from the flourishing financial market to the fast-growing World-Wide Web, high dimensional and massive data are being produced at an astonishing rate.

Development of statistical theory to understand the nature of their fundamental characteristics, and methodology to address the associated issues, including those discussed in this proposal, will advance our intellectual exploration and knowledge, and undoubtedly benefit a multitude of scientific and technological fields -- genomics, medical imaging, communication networks, and finance are just a few well known examples.<br/>"

Direct sampling of the Earth's deep interior is impossible due to the extreme pressures and temperatures. Our knowledge of the Earth?s deep interior is thus pieced together from a range of surface observations. Among surface observations, seismic waves emitted by earthquakes are effective probes of the Earth?s deep interior and are relatively inexpensively recorded by networks of seismographs at the Earth's surface. Unprecedented volumes of seismic data brought by dense global seismograph networks offer researchers both opportunities and challenges to explore the Earth?s deep interior. The key challenge is that directly applying statistical methods to this ultra-large sample seismic data using current computing resources is prohibitive. To facilitate geophysical discoveries that can enhance our understanding of the Earth?s deep interior using current computing resources, the investigator proposes a family of novel statistical methods under a subsampling framework. The proposed methods provide an opportunity to study various distinct statistical problems, such as function estimation and variable selection, in a unified framework. The investigator will establish asymptotic and finite sample theory to investigate the approximation accuracy and consistency of the proposed methods.<br/><br/>How to analyze ultra-large sample data creates a significant challenge in almost all fields of science and engineering.  Scientists and engineers develop various solutions to tackle the problem, such as developing cloud computing for aggregating a wide range of computing resources and building powerful supercomputers.  However, the high cost of these solutions creates an extraordinary budget barrier for researchers. The proposed subsampling methods provide alternative methods to surmount this challenge. The theory to be established will benefit a wide spectrum of research in science and engineering. They will offer a unique educational experience for both undergraduate and graduate students to participate in cutting-edge statistical and interdisciplinary research and inspire new lines of researches in three distinct fields: statistics, geophysics, and computational biology."

A surface is a two-dimensional space, in other words, a two-dimensional version of the world we live in.  Surfaces come in many shapes (for instance the surface of a ball is different from the surface of a doughnut) and they arise in many varied contexts, from physics to robotics to data analysis to quantum field theory.  The symmetries of a surface form a beautiful and rich theory that has been the focus of intense study over the past century.  One surprising phenomenon is that there are combinatorial objects called curve complexes - looking nothing themselves like a surface - that have the same symmetries as a surface.  Many such objects have been discovered in the past twenty years.  The first goal of this project is to give (essentially) a complete list of such curve complexes.  This will be a capstone in the well-studied theory of symmetries of curve complexes.  The second project is to study a certain centrally important subset of the set of symmetries of a surface - the so-called Torelli group.  These symmetries are significant because of their strong connections to algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Basic properties of the Torelli group are unknown, despite the fact that this group has been studied heavily for fifty years.  This project aims to understand the basic finiteness properties of the Torelli group - for instance finite presentability.  This is one of the main open problems in the theory of surfaces.  Using a computer-aided search,  new footholds have been found into this problem.  The third project is a proposed algorithm for quickly computing the basic properties of a single symmetry  of a surface. For instance, this algorithm computes the entropy, which is the amount of mixing being achieved on the surface.  Other such algorithms exist, but ours is much faster.  For instance, using an appropriate notion of size (called word length), the existing algorithms can handle symmetries of size 30 (or so) and our algorithm can very easily handle symmetries of size upwards of 30,000.  In conjunction with these projects, the principal investigator will also be completing a textbook for undergraduates on a related subject, called Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist, and also will continue to run a professional development workshop for graduate students, the Topology Students Workshop.<br/><br/>The mapping class group of a surface is the group of homotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the surface.  Among other things, the mapping class group encodes the outer automorphism group of the surface fundamental group, the (orbifold) fundamental group of the moduli space of the surface, and the isomorphism types of surface bundles over arbitrary spaces.  The mapping class group also has connections to many, many areas of mathematics, including dynamics, group theory, number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, just to name a few. The goals laid out in this project are threefold: (1) find a general theory for when a combinatorial, algebraic, or geometric object associated to a surface has the extended mapping class group as its group of automorphisms; (2) determine the finiteness properties of the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group, specifically whether or not the Torelli group is finitely presented; and (3) establish a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the conjugacy invariants for a pseudo-Anosov mapping class.  Problem (1) was conceived by Ivanov; with Brendle, the PI has made substantial progress on this question.  Problem (2) is one of the most important open problems in the theory of mapping class groups.  It is a very hard question going back to the work of Dehn and Nielsen in the 1920s.  Bestvina, Lucarelli, Vogtmann, and the PI are making significant progress by performing a computer-aided search.  Various algorithms for Problem (3) are known, most notably the Bestvina-Handel algorithm.  With Yurttas the PI has a new algorithm for computing train tracks that works in quadratic time; in practice it is much quicker than the Bestvina-Handel algorithm (which we conjecture to be doubly exponential).  All three projects address fundamental questions in the theory of mapping class groups and in all three cases the PI and his collaborators have already made significant headway. In addition to these research goals, the PI also proposes to continue work on two major projects that have direct impact on graduate and undergraduate students.  The first is the Topology Students Workshop, a conference that serves both as a research conference in topology for graduate students as well as a professional development workshop.  The second is Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist, an introductory text on Geometric Group Theory for undergraduates."

First, as the PI has shown in his earlier research, viewing elements of the Brauer group as isomorphism classes of algebraic stacks gives rise to topological and geometric rigidifications of questions in classical algebra.  Using these structures, one can relate these classical questions to modern questions about local-to-global principles and to the geometry of certain moduli spaces closely related to moduli spaces of vector bundles.  The PI and his graduate students will continue to investigate these connections and push into new territory.  Second, the PI has a list of proposed targets for testing the difference between the cohomological and Azumaya Brauer groups of algebraic spaces.  A good understanding of these targets will involve computing their algebraic K-theory and relating it to the K-theory of resolutions of singularities, and the PI expects to work on these examples jointly with his graduate students.  Finally, the PI will study Fourier-Mukai equivalences in positive characteristic, with an initial focus on K3 surfaces.  One important tool will be crystalline and p-adic forms of the Mukai Hodge structure, and he conjectures that the formal Brauer group will play a role in positive characteristic analogous to that played by the transcendental lattice in Mukai's classical theory.  As a special case, the PI and his graduate students will investigate the HKR isomorphism in positive characteristic and its connection with novel characteristic p deformations of moduli spaces of vector bundles of rank p on K3 surfaces coming from the tangent space to the formal Brauer group.<br/><br/>Originally devoted to the study of solutions of polynomial equations, algebraic geometry has vastly expanded its mandate in the last century to encompass a large range of interactions between algebra and geometry and a raft of applications in government and industry.

Many of the<br/>connections between topology and contact geometry are mediated by<br/>Legendrian knots (these are knots that are tangent to a contact<br/>structure), thus the first main theme of the proposed research is<br/>Legendrian knots. As part of this proposal the general structure<br/>of Legendrian knots will be studied. The expected outcome will be<br/>various classification results for certainLegendrian knots and contact<br/>structures; and, moreover, a betterunderstanding of Legendrian surgery<br/>(an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian <br/>knots in higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology.<br/>There is very little known about contactstructures, or Legendrian knots,<br/>in dimensions above three. By investigating  Legendrian knots in these <br/>dimensions the nature of contactstructures should be illuminated, just<br/>as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact<br/>structures. The final part of the proposed research centers on the <br/>connection between contact structures and hydrodynamics discovered a few<br/>years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. Here work with<br/>Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, <br/>closed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic<br/>instability from the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads<br/>into the study of energy minimization for fluid flows and relations between<br/>contact and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/>Contact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries <br/>ago,in the study of geometric optics and partial differential equations.<br/>Through the centuries contactstructures have touched on many diverse areas<br/>of mathematics and physics,including classical mechanics and thermodynamics.<br/>In everyday life oneencounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel <br/>parking a car,using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play <br/>of light ina glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of <br/>their work to this subject  but only in the last decade or two has it moved<br/>into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance is due to the recent<br/>remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and<br/>beautiful theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of<br/>all this recent work is the intimate connections between contact<br/>structures and topology in dimension three. Thus by studying this abstract<br/>notion of a contact structure one can learn many subtle things about the<br/>universe in which we live. For example, the study of contact geometry<br/>has recently lead to some unexpected advances in our understanding of<br/>the flow of idealized fluids. The Principal Investigator will explore<br/>connections between contact structures and topology in all (odd)<br/>dimensions, continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics)<br/>via contact geometry and analyze intriguing new conjectures concerning<br/>string theory and contact geometry. The Principal Investigator will<br/>also engage in several educational endeavors, including the support and<br/>encouragement of graduates students and the creation of introductory<br/>and survey materials to bring the rapidly developing field of contact<br/>geometry to a wider audience.<br/><br/><br/>"

The principal questions in ergodic theory are  existence, uniqueness and attraction properties of invariant measures for stochastic or deterministic dynamical systems. In the quenched random media setting, invariance is naturally replaced by skew-invariance and attraction has two natural counterparts, forward and pullback attraction. The main question is that of the existence of a global attracting skew-invariant positive solution for a cocycle generated by products of random linear cone-preserving operators. Therefore, one of the key points of the project is to develop a general analogue of the Perron--Frobenius theory for positive linear cocycles in noncompact settings. This approach will allow the asymptotic analysis for a wide class of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems and include the classical ergodic theory of Markov processes as a specific case. It is most promising in the situations where the random environment possesses certain localization properties. <br/>It is also aimed at the infinite-dimensional situations where the classical minorization conditions fail. Naturally, under this project several problems tightly related to the main topic will be studied: the problems of invariant measures for PDEs with random forcing and boundary conditions; localization issues for random directed polymers and associated parabolic models; universality classes for action-minimizing paths in random potential; the questions of regularity of transfer operators for  infinite-dimensional systems and related techniques of infinite-dimensional Malliavin calculus and non-adapted stochastic analysis.<br/><br/>Random media problems and ergodic theory have been intensively explored by mathematicians and physicists for many years.  In this project, these two fields are brought together. Ergodic theory studies statistical patterns arising in complex systems where it is hard or impossible to make exact predictions, and only probabilistic predictions make sense in the long run. There are many interesting and important practical situations including those from physics, biology and economy where the dynamics is determined by the randomness present in the environment which adds another layer of complication to the analysis. In particular, the statistical patterns themselves become random. The main and unifying goal of this project is to describe the random statistical patterns in the long-term behavior of these stochastic systems and understand qualitatively and quantitatively the mechanisms of their formation. The proposed activities include attracting students to this area of research beginning at the undergraduate level.<br/>"

In the mid-eighties Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak used deep results from the theory of automorphic forms (Selberg's 3/16 theorem, proved Ramanujan<br/>conjectures) to give explicit constructions of expanders as Cayley graphs of finite groups with respect to very special choices of generators.  A basic problem, formulated by Lubotzky and Weiss, is to what extent being an expander family is a property of the groups alone, independent of the choice of generators. The first project of the principal investigator will be devoted to addressing this problem and  constructing new robust families of expanders using recently developed tools from additive combinatorics. The second project of the principal investigator builds on the recent joint work with Bourgain and Sarnak, in which expanders were used to obtain novel sieving results towards non-abelian generalizations of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. The general problem addressed in the second project involves sieving for primes (or almost-primes) on an orbit of a group generated by finitely many polynomial maps; application of combinatorial Brun sieve depends crucially on the expansion property of the ""congruence graphs"" associated with the orbit. The third project of the principal investigator is devoted to studying from a unified point of view one of the basic conjectures pertaining to expander graphs and one of the basic conjectures in the theory of Quantum Chaos. A basic conjecture in the theory of expander graphs asserts that many families of groups are expanding with respect to random choices of generators (Independence Conjecture for random generators). A basic conjecture in Quantum Chaos, formulated by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Shmit, asserts that the eigenvalues of a quantized chaotic Hamiltonian behave like the spectrum of a typical member of the appropriate ensemble of random matrices. Both conjectures can be viewed as asserting that a deterministically constructed spectrum ""generically""  behaves like the spectrum of a large random matrix: ""in the bulk"" (Quantum Chaos<br/>Conjecture) and at the  ""edge of the spectrum"" <br/>(Independence Conjecture).  The principal investigator will work on proving these conjectures in the context of the spectra of elements in  group rings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanders are highly-connected sparse graphs widely used in Computer Science, in areas ranging from parallel computation to complexity theory and cryptography.  In the early seventies, following Pinsker's observation that <br/>random sparse   graphs are expanders, Margulis gave  the <br/>first explicit group-theoretic construction of expanders;  in the late eighties  Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak constructed celebrated Ramanujan graphs (optimal expanders from spectral point of view)  using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has dramatically increased; over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of  development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth.  The principal investigator plans to pursue three projects centered on expanders and involving mutually beneficial interactions between arithmetic, group theory and combinatorics. The first project is devoted to constructing new robust families of expanders using recently developed tools from additive combinatorics.  In the second project expanders will be used to obtain novel sieving results, thus partially repaying the debt of computer science to number theory. <br/>The third  project is devoted to studying connections between expander graphs and random matrices. The  principal investigator will  direct research by graduate students on the problems related to the three projects described above and will design and teach graduate courses in additive combinatorics and random matrix theory, as well as an undergraduate course devoted to applications and constructions of expander graphs. He will also direct undergraduate research projects, involving a mix of numerical experimentation, analyzing data, background reading, and theoretical work. In addition, the principal investigator will organize meetings bringing together Bay Area researchers and graduate students for a day of talks and informal discussions, leading to long-term collaborations in research and education.<br/><br/>"

Describing in an idealized fashion what may be observed in an ocean or a lake, water waves are a perfect specimen of applied mathematics. They host a wealth of wave phenomena, ranging in length scale from ripples driven by surface tension to tsunamis and to rogue waves. They provide source and inspiration to several branches of mathematics. Furthermore they impact outside of mathematics, from hydraulics to weather prediction. The water wave problem, notwithstanding, presents profound and subtle difficulties for rigorous analysis, modeling and numerical simulations. For one thing, the interface between the water and the air is a priori unknown and to be determined as part of the solution, namely a free boundary. Incidentally, free boundaries are mathematically challenging in their own right and they occur in numerous situations such as the melting of ice and the stretching of a flexible membrane over an obstacle. To make things worse, boundary conditions at the free surface are severely nonlinear.  This project will develop new tools to advance understanding of these challenging problems."

The long term goal of the project is to prove the Mouse Set Conjecture, which is a central conjecture in descriptive inner model theory. Immediate goals include advancing the core model induction technique beyond its current levels, and computing better consistency lower bounds for the failure of  square at a measurable cardinal. <br/><br/>Mathematics is the language of science; it is what is used to express scientific predictions and theories. Mathematics is simply the most fundamental and indispensable part of science. However, just as scientific achievements must be tested for their validity, mathematical discoveries too must be tested for their consistency. Mathematical theories are based on axioms known as the axioms of Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Provided that the proofs from ZFC and its various extensions are correct, it is believed that the resulting theories are correct. Set theory is the part of mathematics that deals with the consistency of ZFC and its extensions via Large Cardinal Axioms (LCA). Because of the celebrated Godel's incompleteness theorem one cannot hope to prove that ZFC or any of its extensions are consistent. Nevertheless, one can hope to provide naturally occurring models for ZFC + LCA in the same spirit that the set of natural numbers is the natural model of the axioms of Peano Arithmetic (PA). PA is the axiomatic system that guides and controls the usage of arithmetic in everyday life. The inner model program is a set theoretic program whose primary goal is to construct such canonical models for ZFC + LCA. The proposed project is a contribution to the inner model program. One specific objective of the proposed project is to advance the most successful recent method for constructing natural models for various extensions of ZFC, the core model induction, to new levels, and thus to construct natural models for extensions of ZFC that were unreachable before."

Moreover, recent computational results and convex approximations have greatly simplified the implementation of NPML-based methods.  Leveraging these computational breakthroughs, the investigator is developing novel and scalable NPML-based methods for high-dimensional classification, high-dimensional regression, and other statistical problems.

As part of this proposal, the PI plans to continue expository writing aimed at communicating high level mathematics to a student audience. Kronecker's ""dream of youth"" was to explicitly construct all the abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields. Hilbert presented the problem for general number fields as the 12th problem in his famous list. The search for an explicit class field theory has motivated many great advances in number theory. Its prime successes include the Kronecker-Weber theorem and the theory of complex multiplication. This project hopes to extend the understanding of explicit class field theory beyond the setting of complex multiplication. The main technique is to study the connection between units in number fields and special values of zeta-functions. This connection is a central motivating theme in number theory.<br/>"

More precisely, the PI focuses on singularity analysis of possible finite time singularities occurring in those evolution equations. Such equations appear in quantum field theory, plasma physics,  thin liquid film dynamics. More precisely, one of the things the PI wants to study is the regularity of nonlinear geometric flows, such as finding the minimal geometric conditions that will guarantee the smooth existence of a solution to the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The other thing the PI would like to understand are the ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows and their classification. It is well known that ancient solutions arise as singularity models (blown up limits) at finite time singularities. Their classification is crucial for better understanding the singularities that may occur in finite time. Ancient solutions to the two dimensional Ricci flow  describe trajectories of the renormalization group equations of certain asymptotically free local quantum field theories in the ultra-violet regime. One special class of ancient solutions are Ricci solitons. The PI would like to study those, having an ultimate goal of classifying generic singularities of a generic Ricci flow.  <br/><br/>The project the PI proposes  links many different active fields of mathematics, such as nonlinear analysis, differential geometry and topology. The proposed research activity on singularity analysis and regularity of nonlinear parabolic geometric evolution equations may result in interesting applications in geometry and topology. There may be potential application in physics as well. It is well known that the Ricci flow theory has lead to a solution of the Poincare conjecture in topology. The hope is that geometric flows may help solving other important topological question such as the classification of manifolds in higher dimensions.  One of the main obstacles in order to even approach such a difficult question like that by using the flow theory is understanding the singularity formation and the classification of singularities, since one can not hope the flow will exist forever. Most likely it will develop singularities in finite time. The PI proposes to understand the formation of singularities in the flows such as the Ricci flow, mean curvature flow, the Yamabe flow  and therefore contribute to finding a way to approach the big mentioned problem above."

Additionally, it has formulations in the areas of operator theory, complex differential geometry, functional analysis, and commutative algebra.  The Corona Problem has served as an impetus for research in four main areas of analysis: complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory. Additionally, it arises in real-world applications through the use of control theory to engineering questions.

The proposed research is based on recent, significant contributions made by the principal investigatorr and focuses on key questions connected to the Corona Problem.  In particular, the principal investigator will address questions that relate the Corona Problem to complex differential geometry via the curvature of canonical vector bundles associated with the problem.  The Corona Problem will additionally be studied for more general multiplier algebras of analytic functions.  Finally, the connection with the Corona Problem and control theory will be explored via the computation of the stable rank of rings of analytic functions.  <br/><br/>The project's educational component creates a novel ""Internet Analysis Seminar"" that provides a forum for researchers in these areas to interact and learn from one another, both academically and professionally.

The seminar takes the standard dissemination of research results further, providing an open, inclusive setting for junior mathematicians to learn new research concepts and apply them through group projects with more senior researchers. Moreover, the project integrates the principal investigator's current and future research with an ambitious educational component: the cutting-edge research will provide many of the topics selected for the Internet seminar, and seminar participants will likely collaborate on future research projects. Solutions to the research questions investigated in this project will have countless applications in complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.  Not only will they open the way to additional mathematical inquiry, but they will also have significant application to real-world ideas, in particular in the area of control theory.

This method will be applied in the contexts of so called ""K-QC mappings"" (mappings sending an infinitesimal circle/ball to an infinitesimal ellipse/ellipsoid), geometric measure theory (GMT, which analyzes sets and measures on them -these are generalizations of length, area and volume-), harmonic analysis (decomposing a signal into elementary pieces of wavelike character), and potential theory (study of Coulombic potential and related topics.)  <br/><br/>The mathematical objects involved have found abundant applications in other disciplines, so the problems proposed will advance knowledge in those areas. Fractals (GMT) appear naturally in electrodeposition and Diffusion Limited Aggregation. The internal structure of lungs has a high fractal dimension (to capture more oxygen.) Fourier analysis is often applied in signal and image processing. QC maps are solutions to problems in non-linear elasticity, and have found applications in string theory. Uniform rectifiability appears in minimizers of the Mumford-Shah functional (originally used for image segmentation.) Geometric combinatorics is used for fair division and voting problems in the social sciences, and for phylogenetic trees models in biology. Distance sets are used in industry to study the dimensionality of data sets. The PI will continue preparing students for the Putnam Competition, participating in the Math Club, and mentoring graduate students informally in the context of graduate courses. Fractals and geometric combinatorics are excellent areas for promoting teaching and training of undergraduates and postdocs.

Three types of interrelated problems involving perturbations will be investigated: 1) Regular Hamiltonian perturbations of systems with homoclinic orbits to saddle-centers, e.g. perturbations of sine-Gordon breathers. 2) Perturbations containing highest order derivatives. With this type of perturbations to PDEs, the nature of the systems can be changed dramatically, e.g. loss of finite speed propagation and/or disappearance of solutions backward in time. Impact of both dissipative and conservative perturbations on the dynamics will be studied. 3) Hamiltonian motions with fast oscillations. Averaging method and formal multi-scale analysis are applied in deriving the limiting wave or Schroedinger maps. In addition to justifying the convergence on various time scales, the structural stability will be studied, which are in the form of normally elliptic type geometric singular perturbation problems.<br/><br/>Many well-known evolutionary PDEs, as mathematical models, are approximations of real world dynamical systems. In order to have better understanding of the original problems, we need to study not only these PDEs, but their perturbations as well, which may include factors like small viscosity or weak elasticity, etc. On the other hand, while there are some special well-understood ones, it is usually rather difficult to study the qualitative properties and temporal asymptotic behavior of many evolutionary PDEs. Rigorous and formal asymptotic analyses provide effective ways to study the dynamics of systems close to those special ones. This proposal focuses on certain regular and singular perturbation problems related to waves, ferromagnetism, etc., involving rapid oscillations, strong dissipation, strong dispersion etc. In conjunction with this, it is also proposed to incorporate several aspects of this research into curriculum development.

The goal is to establish diffusive propagation of waves in a weakly disordered medium over arbitrarily long times.  There is a rich non-rigorous theory of wave diffusion in the physics literature, based on heuristic analyses and uncontrolled perturbation theory, which suggests that diffusion occurs and predicts the leading order asymptotic behavior of the diffusion constant.  In spite of the obvious importance of this problem, we are far from having a rigorous analysis of the mathematics involved.  The PI will consider the problem from a number of view points, in particular using an ``augmented space"" representation such as has proved useful in the analysis of random walks in random media and homogenization.  Additionally the PI will consider related problems in the theory of random matrices, specifically random band matrices, with entries that vanish outside a band around the diagonal, which have been suggested as a model of a so-called metal-insulator transition as the bandwidth is moved from the matrix size down to one.<br/><br/>What are the effects of disorder?  This is a fundamental question in regards to any model of physics, even one in which disorder is not explicitly included.  After all, any real world system is subject to a small amount of noise, and experience shows that even weak disorder may have a profound effect on the behavior of the system.  Despite the fundamental nature of this subject, aspects of it remain poorly understood and it is not at present incorporated in the curriculum in an accessible way. This program seeks to bridge this gap as follows: 1) through the development of courses for undergraduates on the basic models of statistical mechanics and random matrix theory; and 2) by focused research on aspects of the question relevant to wave motion and semi-conductor physics.  The goal of such work is to use analytical tools to further basic understanding of models of theoretical physics and applied mathematics.  Such advances impact areas outside of mathematics and theoretical physics in the short run by yielding ideas for constructing new and better models useful in applications. In the long run, however, the impact will be even greater, as mathematical work illuminates those parts of physical theory that are truly fundamental."

Specific goals include a classification of knots in the 3-dimensional sphere which produce  simple manifolds under surgery, topological characterization of knots which bound complex curves inside  complex   surfaces, and a deeper understanding of the structure of cobordism groups of knots and 3-manifolds.  Primary tools for this study arise in symplectic geometry, gauge theory, and quantum algebra. Many of these tools come in the form of  algebraic invariants e.g. Floer homology theories or combinatorial knot invariants such as Khovanov homology. The project also seeks to further our understanding of the invariants themselves,  and a central theme is to determine the extent  to which they faithfully represent the topological objects which they shadow.   The specific mathematical goals of the project are complemented by concrete initiatives targeted at graduate and undergraduate education, together with  activities aimed at an international community of topologists and geometers.  For instance, a new graduate course will be designed and implemented whose dual focus is on the development of topological breadth and communication skills in a variety of scenarios.  A summer school  for undergraduates and a broad-interest conference on topology will be organized.  <br/><br/><br/>Topology and geometry are mathematical fields which study  shapes and spaces, and low-dimensional topology focuses on those shapes which are within or just out of reach of our vision.   This project makes fundamental contributions to low-dimensional topology.   One of the key problems that the project attacks is the mathematical theory of ""knotting"", an area which attempts to understand and quantify the method by which ideal strings become tangled and knotted in space.  In addition to a fundamental role which knotting plays in low-dimensional topology, its theory has deep interactions with many seemingly unconnected areas of mathematics and physics, and even to areas such as polymer science.    One of the central aims of the project is to understand how knots evolve over time.  Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time.  Further imagine that  at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together.  Such a movie is called a ""concordance"", and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way.    Understanding the arithmetic of knots turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of modern mathematics.    In addition to its specific mathematical aims, the project will also contribute in a significant way to graduate and undergraduate education and to a global  research community through design and organization of innovative courses, workshops, and conferences."

Although the definition of algebraic K-theory is not inherently equivariant, the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory have proven useful for K-theory computations. In particular, one fruitful approach exploits the equivariant structure of topological Hochschild homology (THH) to compute algebraic K-theory. In some cases K-theory computations can be reduced to the computation of equivariant stable homotopy groups of THH, graded by the real representation ring of the circle. Determining which groups need to be computed, computing them, and assembling the groups to recover algebraic K-theory are all important components of this approach. Goals of this project include completing these steps for various specific K-theory computations, as well as defining abstract algebraic objects embodying equivariant structures arising in such computations.  Other goals of this research program include describing the structure of higher topological Hochschild homology, and developing and exploring applications of a new equivariant model for THH.<br/><br/>Algebraic K-theory is an invariant which can be applied to study basic objects from several fields of mathematics. In particular, algebraic K-theory can be used to study properties of fundamental objects in algebra, called rings. Although higher algebraic K-theory was defined more than 30 years ago, computational progress has been slow. Indeed, even for some very basic rings, the algebraic K-theory is still not known. K-theory computations, however, have important applications to many areas of mathematics. Algebraic K-theory lies in the intersection of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory, with applications to motivic homotopy theory, classification of manifolds, special values of L-functions, etc. A goal of this project is to use tools from algebraic topology to not only produce new algebraic K-theory computations, but also to develop the framework and theory to facilitate future computations. This project also includes several educational and mentoring programs centered around the recruitment and retention of women and other underrepresented groups in mathematics. Programs aimed at undergraduate students include the development of a Women in Mathematics course, the creation of a Careers in Science lecture series, and undergraduate research opportunities aimed at early-career undergraduates. For graduate students, career mentoring seminars will be developed both for students at Michigan State University, and more broadly for students and post-docs in the international Algebraic Topology community through a retreat at an upcoming semester-long program. Also included are opportunities for K-12 students from underrepresented groups, as well as a program for female faculty members in science, mathematics, and engineering.

Such singularities manifest themselves in mathematical equations when the underlying physical models lose validity on a given scale.  To study such systems, one must connect often quite disparate physical models arising at different length and time scales.  The investigator employs a combination of modern analytical and numerical methods introduced by him for the Onsager model of nematic liquid crystals and Keller-Segel model of bacterial chemotaxis.  In particular, he investigates liquid-crystalline systems such as polydisperse and biaxial nematics, smectics, and elastomers; phenomenon of formation and interaction of particle aggregates in bacterial chemotaxis.  He creates the Multiphysics Modeling Lab: a center for research and education in methods of mathematical modeling and computer simulations.  This establishes a collaborative environment involving students at the University of Arizona as well as (utilizing the close connection of the investigator with the Tucson Math Circle) the local K-12 students in projects on modeling and simulation of complex systems. <br/><br/>     The fundamental significance of the areas of this project has been widely recognized, e.g., by a Nobel Prize awarded in 1991 to P.-G. de Gennes for fundamental contributions to our understanding of order phenomena in complex systems, and by a Microsoft Award in 2006 to D. Bray for his work on chemotaxis on E. coli.  The practical applications of the project range from liquid-crystalline display (LCD) technology to understanding the functioning of our immune system.  Recently, the analytical and numerical methods employed in the investigations of such systems have matured enough to allow for new significant advances in these fields.  Achieving this is the primary scientific goal of this project.  Beyond that, the interdisciplinary nature of this program is perfect for illustrating the power of mathematics in describing diverse natural phenomena and is suitable for involving students of all levels.  The Multiphysics Modeling Lab involves graduate and undergraduate students in active applied mathematics research and promotes mathematics and science among the K-12 students and educators via close integration with the system of math circles.

The estimation of a signal from the knowledge of its Fourier transform in a band qualifies as super-resolved when the fine structure of the signal is recovered on a length scale smaller than the inverse of the band's width --- the so-called Shannon-Nyquist scaling.  It is a poorly understood, yet real and decidedly nonlinear numerical phenomenon.  Sparsity has been suggested as a principle according to which super-resolution reliably occurs.  However, recent insights from analysis of convex programs indicate that a second principle, sign compatibility, is needed in tandem with sparsity to unlock positive results.  Building on this, the investigator seeks quantitative guarantees of a new kind for successful signal recovery up to the ideal resolution level that no method can beat.  Such results would generalize the theory of compressed sensing in the regime of very coherent dictionaries, where no restricted isometry-type property can be expected to hold.  The investigator also studies algorithms based on translation-invariance such as the matrix pencil method, modified matching pursuits, precorrective filtering, and generalizations to higher dimensions.  He explores implications, both positive and negative, for tomographic imaging modalities such as seismic and synthetic aperture radar in the subwavelength regime. <br/><br/>     The project aims to design advanced, nonlinear processing methods to deliver higher image resolution and interpretation levels in situations where the data come with poor frequency content, such as in the case of a blurring.  A methodical understanding of the possibilities offered by super-resolution could eventually transform the methods by which information is extracted from data in a host of inverse problems, ranging from medical imaging (MRI, fluorescence microscopy) to geophysical imaging (exploration seismology) and defense applications.  The project also offers an opportunity for students to acquire strong interdisciplinary training at the intersection of computational mathematics, modern data processing, and tomographic imaging.  Graduate curricula typically fall short of covering this evolving material in a satisfactory way, even though there is a great demand in industry for quantitative-minded specialists who can operate as experts on all these fronts.

For example, a mirror on a wall can help to visualize a reflection of 3-dimensional space, a symmetry which sends each point in our world to the corresponding point on the other side of the mirror. Coxeter groups are special kinds of groups of symmetries that consist of sequences of reflections through mirrors placed at precise angles to one another. The so-called ""crystallographic"" Coxeter groups occur frequently in physics and mathematics because they preserve lattice points, for example the locations of atoms in a crystal. Crystallographic Coxeter groups also arise when analyzing important geometric spaces; this imbues them with a great deal of interesting structure. Mysteriously, Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic still possess this beautiful structure, despite having no geometric explanation. For example, each Coxeter group has an associated Hecke algebra, and by multiplying elements in this algebra one can produce numbers called structure coefficients. For crystallographic Coxeter groups, these coefficients are always non-negative because they are counting something. However, the non-negativity result holds in general. An underlying goal of this project is to find combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of the structures apparent in Coxeter groups, to help explain these mysterious phenomena. The main objects of study are categorical representations of Hecke algebras, where usual reflections are replaced by ""reflection functors"" that act as symmetries not on some n-dimensional space, but on spaces attached to representations of other important algebras in mathematics.<br/><br/>In this research project the categorical representation theory of Hecke algebras will be investigated along three lines of attack. The first approach is to lift the notion of diagonalization from linear algebra to categorical representation theory. For example, the full twist in the braid group, and its image in the Hecke algebra, is diagonalizable in any finite dimensional representation. In joint work with Hogancamp, I aim to prove that the categorified full twist is ""categorically  diagonalizable."" This allows one to lift much of the structure  theory of Hecke algebra representations to the categorical level.  In the second approach, together with Williamson and Juteau, I will study certain categorical representations of affine Weyl groups which are significant for modular representation theory, and their quantum deformations. The goal is to compute local intersection forms, which will explain how the category degenerates in finite characteristic. This computation will give character formulas for modular representations of algebraic groups which were previously unknown. In the third approach, together with Young, I will find an algebraic description of the quantum deformation mentioned above, when the quantum parameter is a root of unity. This is related to the categorification of complex reflection groups, which is an open problem."

Tail dependent time series, as an emerging data type, has been observed and recognized in various fields including actuarial science, climate science, economics, finance, hydrology, and internet traffic engineering, among others. The task of understanding and appropriately accommodating the phenomenon of tail dependence can be of significant importance to the modeling of extreme events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and financial crises. The results from the project will make significant impacts in scientific areas such as climate science, economics, actuarial science, finance, hydrology and internet traffic engineering. The proposal also involves an integrated education plan to expose undergraduate and high school students to the topic, to equip graduate and advanced undergraduate students with a desirable level of statistical reasoning and analytical skills for analyzing tail dependent time series, and to mentor doctoral students to become future leaders in the education and research of the area. <br/><br/>Existing methods for studying tail dependent time series often rely on certain parametric models for describing the underlying tail dependence structure. This is particularly due to the lack of a convenient and rigorous framework that one can use to obtain desired limit theorems for a general class of tail dependent time series. The project aims to address this fundamental problem by proposing a new framework based on the causal representation and the technique of adversarial tail coupling. Using the newly proposed framework, the project will develop meaningful results toward a tail m-dependent approximation scheme, which can then be used as a powerful tool to obtain limit theorems for statistics of tail dependent data. Compared with the conventional m-dependent approximation, the current setting can be more challenging due to the double asymptotics where the quantile index is allowed to approach either zero or one as the sample size increases to reflect extreme risks. The project will study several statistical inference problems for tail dependent time series, including high quantile estimation and its associated confidence interval construction, tail dependence visualization and testing, inference of extremely high quantiles using the extreme value theory, extensions to high and extremely high quantile regression models, and high-dimensional nonstationary settings. The results to be developed are expected to be useful in identifying undiscovered features in certain climate science and economic data, and applicable to other scientific problems that involve the analysis of tail dependent time series.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim is to provide an accurate, practical, detailed description of these coherent wave structures that is useful for applications in nanomagnetism and the fluid dynamics of dissipationless, dispersive media.  Motivated by recent experiments, time-periodic, localized solutions of a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates a spin transfer torque forcing term to compensate damping will be computed and studied analytically using asymptotic methods.  These magnetic droplet solitons and their generalizations have potential for technological applications. Another research front will be developed involving modulated nonlinear wavetrains or dispersive shock waves (DSWs).  The generation of DSWs represents a universal mechanism to resolve hydrodynamic singularities in dispersive media such as water waves, plasma, optics, interfacial fluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and two-phase, viscously deformable fluids.  Theoretical studies will focus upon central questions of modern DSW theory including loss of genuine nonlinearity/strict hyperbolicity in the modulation equations, multi-dimensional DSWs, and stability.  In collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, the principal investigator will undertake experiments involving a viscous fluid conduit system in order to make quantitative measurements of DSW properties for comparison with theory.<br/><br/>When wave properties intrinsically depend upon the wave amplitude, novel physical behavior can arise.  With a view toward applications, this project encompasses two classes of these nonlinear waves: solitary waves in nanomagnetism and shock waves in dispersive media.  Spintronics encompasses the effort to develop information transport, processing, and storage using the electron's spin in addition to its charge, for example, to continue Moore's Law (the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every eighteen months) beyond present technological limitations.  The spatially localized spin excitations in a nanomagnet to be studied in this project possess features that hold great promise for future spintronic applications.  Viscous shock waves that form when a projectile exceeds the speed of sound in air are commonly understood. The dispersive shock waves studied in this project are of a very different type, lacking dissipation and realized as expanding, oscillatory wavetrains.  A fluid experiment will be developed to carefully measure these shock properties while also being used as an educational, outreach, and demonstration tool, providing young mathematicians direct experience with nonlinear waves.  Presentations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will provide the general public with exposure to this fascinating field."

The PI will continue his close involvement with graduate education and mentor graduate students and postdocs, suggesting problems related to the proposed research strands.<br/><br/>The PI will study several interrelated problems revolving around the study of integral points on varieties.  First, the PI will examine the problem of generalizing Siegel's theorem for integral points on curves to higher-dimensional varieties, along the lines of the PI's conjectures.  In a second project, the PI will study integral points of bounded degree on curves.  Then, in a different direction, aspects of the problem of effectively computing integral points on varieties will be studied, both for curves and higher-dimensional varieties.  Fundamental tools for studying integral (or rational) points on varieties come from the subject of Diophantine approximation.  One such key tool is Schmidt's Subspace Theorem.  The PI will continue his recent work on proving generalizations of Schmidt's theorem, with a Schmidt-Wirsing type conjecture for algebraic points as an ultimate goal.  The PI will study several ""uniform boundedness"" conjectures in arithmetic dynamics, a subject well-suited for applications of the above techniques and results.  Lastly, by work of Vojta and others, there exists a surprising correspondence between statements and theorems in Diophantine approximation and statements and theorems in Nevanlinna theory.  The PI plans to study the analogues of the above problems in Nevanlinna theory, with the hope of enriching both subjects."

The study of hyperbolic polynomials originated in the context of partial differential equations in the 1950's and has been used to understand problems in convex optimization, operator theory, and combinatorics. There are still many important open questions about such polynomials, and because of their prevalence and concrete nature, structural results often have far-ranging applications.

Coefficients of these polynomials give discrete probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled. This research aims to use real algebraic and discrete geometry to further develop our understanding of these classes of polynomials, with a view towards applications in approximation algorithms, combinatorics, convex optimization, and operator theory.

Motivated by scientific problems in colon carcinogenesis experiments and hypertension studies, the investigator proposes new dimension reduction methods, which are widely applicable to semiparametric regression problems with functional predictors.

To analyze such complex data, the principal investigator (PI) aims to develop new statistical methodologies. The PI proposes to study four interrelated research topics. First, the PI focuses on large-margin classification and proposes new large-margin classifiers to deliver competitive classification and conditional class probability estimation. He also proposes to address the question of whether a soft or hard classifier is preferred for a particular classification task and how to incorporate estimated conditional class probability to improve dimension reduction for data with a categorical response. Second, the PI proposes an extension of the least angle regression to deal with generalized linear models and, more generally, a strictly convex optimization problem. The new solution path is piecewise given by systems of ordinary differential equations and can be slightly modified to get the corresponding LASSO regularized solution path. Third, data with a sparse and irregular functional predictor are considered. New response-based dimensional reduction methods are proposed for such data using cumulative slicing and a viable scheme is also proposed to extend large-margin classifiers to analyze such data. Fourth, the PI focuses on the semi-parametric multi-index regression. By noticing that the Hessian operator filters out the effect of the linear component automatically, the PI provides a direct estimation scheme to estimate the space spanned by the multiple indices. The new scheme differs from existing methods in that it does not require estimating the nonparametric link while estimating the space spanned by the multiple indices as in other existing approaches.<br/><br/>The proposed statistical methodology innovations are widely applicable in various fields. For example, the proposed new large-margin classifiers can be applied to analyze genomic data with a categorical response such as cancer type; new ordinary differential equation based solution path algorithms can used to analyze survival or binary genomic data to identify important predictors; while analyzing longitudinal data of aging, the new proposed statistical methods for sparse and irregular functional data will be useful. In order to facilitate the use of the proposed new methods, the PI will implement them in R or Matlab and make new software available to the public along with the corresponding research reports. The success of the proposed research will help to improve public health."

A further objective is to promote connections to statistical physics and computer science, where random csps are fundamental models. Indeed, recent progress on random csps has crucially relied on the exchange of ideas among several disciplines: probability, statistical physics, combinatorics, and computer science. The proposed research will endeavor to advance this dialogue, which has potential to open new research avenues in those disciplines. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature: its primary focus is in the development of probability theory, but it is expected that the research approach will be much influenced by developments in statistical physics and computer science. The educational component of the proposal seeks to further promote this interdisciplinary aspect, in classroom education as well as in mentorship of graduate students. With the proliferation of statistical inference problems on large datasets, the development of fast algorithms for combinatorial problems becomes an increasingly urgent problem. At the same time it becomes more important to quantify fundamental barriers in these problems, in terms of information-theoretic and algorithmic limits. This study is complemented by proposing to develop more robust techniques to handle a wider range of problems, including some concrete problems of interest for network theory and machine learning. The educational component involves curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate special topic course development, and mentoring graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorial search/optimization problems are prominent in a wide range of scientific contexts. Broadly, the defining feature of these problems is that the a priori solution requires exhaustive search over a combinatorial state space such as {0,1}^n. A major challenge is that many such problems are expected to be computationally intractable in worst-case instances (np-hard). In response to this, significant attention has been directed towards random problem instances - they represent natural average-case scenarios, and serve as a useful practical benchmark. A deeper understanding of obstacles in the random setting has potential to inspire algorithmic advances. Practical considerations aside, random problem instances are of deep theoretical interest, and full of rich connections among diverse fields of research. In probability theory, random csps have contributed numerous long-standing open problems - especially ones concerning various phase transitions, conjectured either from numerical simulations or from physical heuristics. A notable problem of this type is the location of sharp satisfiability thresholds. It is a widely held belief that for many random csps, the solution space has a complicated geometric structure; and that this is precisely what obstructs standard probabilistic approaches for analyzing phase transitions. Moreover, it is conjectured that essential features of the solution space geometry are universal to a large class of random csps. Some components of this conjectural picture have been validated by recent progress in the theory of random csps, including results on satisfiability thresholds and partition function asymptotics. However, many key aspects of this picture - particularly ones relevant to algorithmic challenges - remain at the level of conjecture. One of the main goals of the current project is to shed light on these questions: to this end, specific research problems are posed regarding asymptotic properties of the solution space (in the search context) and energy landscape (in the optimization context).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Regularization and sparsity are critical components for modeling such data and extracting information. Broad success of sparse modeling methods, such as the Lasso, has encouraged fast development in this area. However, most existing methods were developed under the frameworks of linear models and generalized linear models. The complex structures in genomic data require further development beyond existing methods. To this end, proposed are three novel sparse modeling methods with sophisticated model structures driven by large-scale gene expression data, protein binding data and DNA sequence data. The first method, motivated by modeling the relationship between protein binding and gene expression, constructs linear regression models on the terminal nodes of a decision tree. The decision tree partitions the population into subgroups according to the predictors. Each subgroup has its own sparse linear regression model between the response and the predictors. Two types of regularization, one on the regression coefficients and the other on the size of the tree, are used to encourage sparsity. The second method concerns the construction of tight clusters for gene expression data by penalizing the difference in grouped parameters between two tight clusters and between a tight cluster and the null cluster. Block-wise coordinate descent in conjunction with majorization is developed to maximize the regularized likelihood function. The third method, motivated by the motif finding problem, aims at sequence pattern discovery. A dictionary model is used to partition a sentence into words, which represent sequence patterns, and single letters. A novel regularization through the Kullback-Leibler divergence is developed for the product-multinomial model for words, which can achieve sparsity in estimating the cell probabilities. This regularization is used to construct a sparse dictionary that contains only a small number of words. A generalized EM algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation and solution path construction.<br/><br/>As efficient analysis of large-scale high-dimensional data is critical in many fields of science and engineering, the proposed research is of great current interest. Particularly, the proposed methods are ready for applications to front-edge research areas in genomics and molecular biology, where massive data sets have been continuously generated. To accelerate such applications, free computer packages and self-contained software are being developed for users to analyze their own data. On the other hand, this proposal contains many innovative statistical methodologies that may contribute significantly to statistics and computational sciences. Finally, the proposed research is integrated with educational activities by developing new and improving existing courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels."

One of the basic problems of random matrix theory is to analyze the eigenvalues of large random matrices. The PI will focus on problems related to the asymptotic spectral properties of the beta ensembles, a family of models generalizing some of the most studied classical random matrix models (e.g. GOE, GUE, GSE, Wishart). The project builds on the recent results of the PI and collaborators in which the point process scaling limits of general beta ensembles are derived in the bulk of the spectrum. The proposed problems include the extension of methods to other random matrix ensembles, analyzing the limiting point processes and finding connections to the existing descriptions of classical cases. The approach relies on the study of random tridiagonal matrices which also provides a natural framework to investigate the asymptotic spectral properties of certain random Schrodinger operators. Non-rigorous physical scaling arguments suggest that a large class of one-dimensional random systems have unusual superdiffusive fluctuations with a scaling exponent of 2/3. Examples include interacting particle systems, growth models and directed polymers. These systems arise as models for various phenomena in the natural and social sciences. The recent decade brought a breakthrough from the mathematical side: for certain models the fluctuation exponent has been determined rigorously and in some cases even scaling limits have been proved. The PI will work towards extending the rigorous results to a wider family of models. In particular the fluctuation theory of certain lattice gases, directed polymer models and self avoiding processes will be studied.<br/><br/>The problems considered in the proposal deal with the analysis of systems with a large number of random components with complex interactions. We might understand the joint distribution of the entries of a large random matrix, but the distribution of the eigenvalues is usually a lot more complicated. The evolution of an interacting particle system might be simple on a local level, and we might understand the behavior of the fluctuations for a fixed time, but the scaling limit of the fluctuation field may be a highly non-trivial object. The goal of the proposal is to develop new tools and to provide a better understanding for such problems. The educational part of the proposal focuses on enhancing undergraduate and graduate probability education at the PI's host institution and actively involving graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the PI's area of research."

Does the condition upon the field preclude the surface of the body from having a fractal type structure?  A second topic considered concerns understanding signals whose frequencies have a self-similar or fractal behavior.  More precisely, one is interested in the extent to which the signal can be reconstructed uniquely from a ""small"" set of values.

The first question considered is: What can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that a Calderon-Zygmund operator associated to it is bounded?  Under these circumstances, can the measure have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable number of) Lipschitz submanifolds of appropriate dimension? This basic question in analysis has found applications in the calculus of variations, the study of free boundaries, and the geometry of harmonic measure.  Despite intense study over the last thirty years, the tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic condition on the field to the geometric structure of the measure are currently underdeveloped, something that this proposal aims to rectify.  The second question is: How sparse must the support of the Fourier transform of a function be to ensure that the function can be uniquely reconstructed by its values on a ""thick"" subset?  Although this question is a classical form of the uncertainty principle, it is not yet well understood, especially in several dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bacterial chromosome is circular and replication invariably results in the formation of interlinked daughter chromosomes. Error-free unlinking is required to ensure proper segregation at cell division and stable plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases unlink replication links. In Escherichia coli, in the absence of topo IV (a type II topoisomerase credited with chromosome unlinking), the site-specific recombination system XerCD mediates sister chromosome unlinking. This reaction is activated at the division septum by a powerful translocase FtsK, which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation. The mechanism by which the XerCD-FtsK complex simplifies the topology of DNA remains unclear. The main objective of the proposed studies is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by the XerCD-FtsK system using knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and computer simulations.  There is evidence that after being activated by FtsK, the enzymes XerCD unlink DNA in a stepwise manner. The tangle method will be used to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by site-specific recombination on small substrates. A computer model of DNA recombination will be developed, adapted to the Xer-FtsK system, and combined with the analytical results to analyze experimental data obtained from the Sherratt lab. The research is highly interdisciplinary and involves close collaboration with groups in Japan, Canada and the UK. Such collaborations will facilitate state-of-the-art student cross-training. Basic information about DNA topology will be disseminated to the general public, including elementary school children and visitors to the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>DNA replication is the basis for biological inheritance. In bacteria, reproduction starts with replication of the chromosome into two identical daughter molecules, followed by segregation of the newly replicated chromosomes and division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. In circular chromosomes, problems of entanglement during DNA linking complicate the process of chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli, DNA unlinking is typically mediated by the enzyme topoIV, which is an important drug target for quinolone antimicrobial agents. Understanding DNA unlinking by Xer recombination, in addition to providing a more complete picture of the chromosome segregation process, is highly relevant for drug design. Mathematical and computational tools are very useful for studying the action of enzymes that change the topology of DNA. In this project such tools will be used to characterize all unlinking pathways and to reveal the mechanism of unlinking by Xer. The educational goal is to develop new and effective ways to disseminate knowledge related to DNA topology and its biological significance, as well as to increase public awareness of the critical role of mathematics in understanding biological processes. The proposed plans include the creation of Math Circles for elementary school children in San Francisco and the development of a series of educational materials for public consumption in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences. This will culminate in the production of an exhibit on DNA topology for the general public in the California Academy of Sciences Museum."

Mathematical models, validated and informed by experimental data, have made important contributions to the understanding of interactions between virus, cells, and immune responses. However, new data emerge and update our understanding of the biology underlying these processes. Sometimes the analysis of new data generates conflicting results. This project will develop and analyze new models, compare them with experimental data, explain potential discrepancies generated by new data, and address the implications to therapy and vaccine development. The first part of this project develops multi-scale models to study hepatitis C virus (HCV) dynamics in patients treated with new antiviral drugs. These models include both intracellular viral replication and extracellular cell infection. The second part of the project develops comprehensive immune models to elucidate the mechanisms in controlling HIV, a virus that causes AIDS in humans. The modeling predictions will be compared with experimental data to determine the relative roles of target cell availability and specific immune mechanisms in viral control.<br/> <br/>This project will generate modeling, computational, and data analysis methods in quantitative studies of virus infection and immune responses. The multi-scale virus models will establish a theoretical framework for studying viral dynamics in patients treated with new drugs and will investigate the emergence of drug resistance. This can help to develop more effective combination therapy and improve cure rates. Such combination strategies have achieved a great success in the management of HIV infection. The comprehensive immune models developed in this project will address fundamental questions in immunology, e.g.,  how the immune system controls viral load and why some monkeys can live with an HIV-like virus without progressing to AIDS. The results may suggest effective strategies for the development of future virus vaccines and immune-based therapies. This interdisciplinary research will provide extensive training opportunities to students from diverse backgrounds at levels from high school to graduate school.

The current proposal focuses on those processes that arise naturally in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization. The common features of the proposed problems are simple formulation, fundamental mathematical structure, interesting underlying phenomena and non-trivial impacts on physical disciplines. One main aspect of the proposal is on extreme values for Gaussian processes. An example question is on the geometry of level sets for some spatial processes, and in particular whether one could walk on a random surface while staying on high mountains most of the time.  Another main aspect is on  phase transitions of random constraint satisfaction problems, and an example question is to decide whether there exists an assignment simultaneously satisfying a collection of random boolean formulae.  In addition, the PI intends to apply probability in related areas such as statistical learning and biological evolution. For example, the PI wishes to understand how features of individuals influence the structure of social network and what could be learned about individuals from the network structure.   Finally, the PI intends to provide research opportunities for both graduate students in probability theory, and to develop topic courses that bring probability techniques to students in related areas.<br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is the development of new theory and applications on a number of stochastic processes in statistical physics and optimization. In the direction of Gaussian processes, the proposal focuses on a number of aspects including the geometry of level sets for two-dimensional Gaussian free fields, an improvement on majorizing measure theory, as well as the connection between Gaussian free fields and random walks.  For instance, we intend to study the random geometry and random motion on the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, which is connected to the Liouville quantum gravity.  In the direction of random CSPs and optimization problems, the proposal features the intriguing phase transitions of the solution spaces predicted by statistical physicists. Since most classical NP-complete problems are expressed as CSPs and random CSPs are a rich source of computationally hard CSPs, the proposed study of random CSPs are expected to shed light on underlying barriers to algorithmic performance. Some of the study of random combinatorial optimization problems is related to understanding the average complexity of certain widely-used algorithms.  Furthermore, the PI proposes to study certain probabilistic models for social network such as random geometric graphs,  as well as the NK-fitness model in biological evolution with the aim of providing mathematical explanation to some experimental findings."

Dynamical systems are mathematical objects which evolve in time, and they are ubiquitous in the applications of mathematics.  Whenever math is used to predict the future, e.g. to predict the weather, the stock market, or the behavior of particles in a solution, a dynamical system is involved.  The dynamical systems in the real world, like those just mentioned, are often extraordinarily complex.  The PI will study a simple class of dynamical systems modeled on ideal billiards in polygons with a view towards understanding the complicated dynamical systems that occur in applications.  The PI will work to uncover and categorize the range of dynamical behaviors possible in billiard systems, and will continue his research exploring connections between billiards and the theory of numbers.  Using the resources allotted by this grant, the PI will also create a graduate course on topics relevant to his research.  The course will culminate in a workshop hosted at Rice University during which leaders in the field have a chance to interact with students in the class.  Finally, the PI will use funding from this grant to create a curriculum in mathematical biology for the Say STEM Camp, a camp aimed at engaging high school students in groups typically underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address fundamental challenges in the study of dynamics on Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. These subjects have connections with many areas of mathematics and important applications to the classification of mapping classes, the dynamics of rational maps and billiards in polygons. Of particular importance are the special subvarieties of moduli space which are invariant under the geodesic flow.  Such subvarieties are rare and their origins are mysterious.  The PI will pursue two lines of research in this proposal. First, the PI will investigate connections between special subvarieties and number theory, with the particular goal of understanding the arithmetic geometry of these spaces.

Ideas from statistical physics give predictions for these thresholds which we will mathematically prove.  It also studies questions of how long it takes random processes on networks, such as the Glauber dynamics Markov chain, to reach their equilibrium distribution and how this depends on their initial starting position.  Such processes are used as algorithms for sampling high dimensional distributions.  The proposal focuses on development of mathematical theory with a view to better understanding these problems.

A second theme is the development of new tools for establishing rough isometries and other geometric notions of closeness between random metric spaces.  In particular we will consider whether independent copies of Poisson processes, percolation clusters and SLE curves are rough isometries or quasi-symmetries.  Finally the proposal will consider Markov random fields such as the Ising model on lattices.  At high temperatures it will consider the question of universality of the cutoff phenomena as well as the effect of different initial conditions on the mixing time.

One can imagine asking how quickly one would need to sample an audio clip so that from those samples alone, the audio clip could be accurately recovered. Would you need to sample every nanosecond, every millisecond, or every second? Compressive Signal Processing (CSP) shows that the important information in many signals can be obtained and recovered from far fewer samples than traditionally thought. The applications of CSP are widespread and include imaging (medical, hyperspectral, microscopy, biological), analog-to-information conversion, radar, large scale information synthesis, geophysical data analysis, computational biology, and many more. Although these applications are astounding, there has been a disconnect between the theoretical work in CSP and the use of CSP in practical settings. The goals of this project will bridge this gap by providing methods and analysis for CSP that apply to real-world signals and settings. Such work will lead to decreased scan time in MRI, reduced cost and energy consumption in computing infrastructures, improved detection of diseased crops from hyperspectral images, increased accuracy in radar, and improved compression and analysis in many other large-data applications. In addition, this project will involve students at all levels and introduce them to rigorous scientific research. The PI actively recruits members from under-represented populations, and will continue to promote diversity through her own research and outreach programs.<br/><br/>Early CSP models restrict the class of signals to those compressible in a very specific sense (sparse with respect to an orthonormal or incoherent basis). One goal of this project is to relax this restriction to allow for signals actually encountered in practice, such as those sparse in redundant, coherent, and highly overcomplete dictionaries. We will utilize both greedy approaches and optimization-based methods, tailored to specific dictionaries of interest, as well as more general methods for arbitrary bases. In addition, this project will develop adaptive CSP sampling schemes, where measurements of the signal are designed ""on the fly,"" as they are being taken. Traditional measurement schemes ignore this information, while adaptive schemes have the potential to significantly reduce reconstruction error, number of measurements, and computation time. We will identify optimal measurement strategies for constrained and unconstrained settings, and analyze how much one can actually gain from adaptivity from an information theoretic point of view. The project will also involve work in ""one-bit CSP"", a new and exciting branch of CSP which handles extreme (and often more realistic) quantization. We will draw on sub-linear methods, where large errors appear naturally, and also use optimization based techniques along with adaptive quantization thresholds to reduce the recovery error below the best possible for non-adaptive quantization. In studying these topics, the research will bridge a large gap in the theory of CSP and provide a unified framework for both practitioners and researchers."

The proposed project aims to explore Teichmueller dynamics using tools in algebraic geometry and to develop applications to the geometry of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. The ultimate goal is to establish a correspondence between dynamical properties of these orbits and the intersection theory of their closures in the moduli space. Moreover, the intersection calculation can determine the cycle class of an orbit closure in the moduli space, which in turn provides crucial information towards understanding the cone of effective divisors, cone of curves, Chow ring structure, and birational models for the moduli space. <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry and dynamical systems are two important branches of modern mathematics. The former uses algebraic (polynomial) equations to study geometrical structures, while the latter applies analytical tools to describe the time dependence of a moving point. Despite the fact they initially seem unrelated, the principal investigator plans to explore their inner connections by constructing algebraic equations to measure the behavior of Teichmueller dynamics. In a sense this is analogous to introducing coordinates in Descartes geometry. The proposed project also opens many avenues for student and postdoctoral research. The principal investigator will continue to integrate his research with undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate training as well as workshop organization.

Despite over two centuries of intensive research and a massive body of results, today partial differential equations on domains are thoroughly understood only when both the coefficients and the domain exhibit smoothness.  However, the dominance of irregularities in real life and numerous problems in modern mathematics demand for an extension of the classical  ""smooth"" theory. Three major directions for this extension pursued by the PI are: (a) the study of boundary problems with rough data on non-smooth domains; (b) the second-order elliptic operators with non-smooth coefficients; (c) elliptic PDEs of higher order. The scope of the proposed work incorporates a full range of sharp well-posedness and regularity results, asymptotic formulas, introduction and analysis of new measures, capacities and new function spaces, numerical experiment, localization phenomena.<br/><br/>Given the ubiquitousness of irregularities in nature and in man-made mechanisms, their understanding is essential to science, engineering, industry, and to society in general. Indeed, most classical models only provide a nice, smooth approximation of the objects and processes. However, perfectly uniform smooth systems do not exist in nature, and every real object inadvertently possesses singularities (a sharp edge of the boundary, an abrupt change of the medium, a defect of the construction). They often have a decisive effect on the occurring phenomena, but cannot be captured in a smooth set-up (e.g., the fractal structure of lungs). The present project combines the mathematical pursuit and a rigorous educational program towards the general goal of advancing analysis of partial differential equation in non-smooth media and preparing a diverse array of mathematicians working in related areas. The latter objective will, in particular, be achieved through a novel Workshop for Women in Analysis and PDE."

Specifically, this project intends to achieve the following three objectives: (i) Identify optimal designs for GLMs under non-homogeneous subjects. In this study, optimal designs are derived for models in which the subjects are divided into two or more groups using one or more factors, allowing the intercept or slope to vary from one group to another. Random subject effects can also be allowed for differences among subjects within groups. (ii) Identify optimal designs for GLMs with multiple covariates. There are very few optimality results for GLMs with more than one covariate. The PI will study optimal designs for GLMs when multiple covariates exist. These models can also account for subject heterogeneity. (iii) Identify optimal designs for some other nonlinear models. In nonlinear models, most optimal results were derived under D-optimality for all parameters. The PI will investigate a general approach to identify optimal designs for nonlinear models with three or more parameters under commonly used optimality criteria when all or some of the parameters are of interest. The proposed research will have a tremendous impact because it will fill several gaps in the literature: the models in the proposed research accommodate heterogeneity among subjects and multiple covariates; general solutions for optimal designs of nonlinear models with three parameters will be provided. The technique in the proposed research is innovative in that it yields very general results that go beyond solving problems on a case-by-case basis. It helps to identify the support of locally optimal designs for many of the commonly studied models and can be applied for all the common optimality criteria based on information matrices. It works both with a constrained and unconstrained design region. Furthermore, it can be applied to multistage experiments, where an initial experiment may be used to provide a better idea of the unknown parameters.<br/> <br/>GLMs and other nonlinear models have been used in a wide range of social and natural science fields, such as biological sciences, pharmaceutical research, agricultural science, economics, marketing, etc. The results of this study will have a deep impact on the application of GLMs in these fields. For example, when the findings are applied to the design of clinical trials during new drug discovery and development, they will significantly reduce the time, money, and number of patients needed in these trials. In fact, this research can help the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to improve its guidelines for clinical trials. To effectively disseminate the results of this research, the PI will develop a user-friendly software package targeting non-expert users. To successfully integrate research and education, the PI will develop advanced experimental design courses at the University of Missouri-Columbia incorporating findings of this project.

For the design of experiments, control-theoretic methods are suggested for experimental dynamical systems. Specifically, methods to choose system inputs so as to maximize the Fisher Information concerning the parameters of interest for the observed system are described. While models for rapid evolution in experimental ecologies provide real-world a real-world application, the proposed methods have much wider applicability, for example in chemical engineering, pharmacokinetics and neurodynamics.<br/><br/>The research in this grant will provide new, improved methods for making statistical inferences about real-world systems that change over time.

However, this research has broader applications in areas as diverse as human immune systems, models for drug absorbtion by the body and chemical engineering. (I) A first task is to answer the question ""Is the proposed model adequate to describe the data observed from this system and, if not, how should it be improved?"" A particular question in experimental ecology is whether the models are missingspecies that are present in the system and which must therefore have evolved during the experiment. This research will provide the first statistical test of recently-advanced theories that evolution can occur at the same time-scales as ecological processes; theories that have profound implications for environmental protection, the management of algal ponds producing biofuels and many other domains. (II) A second focus of this work is to develop tools to improve the design of these experiments so as to obtain maximal information about the system from the data they generate. In ecological experiments, system inputs such as nutrients can be manipulated over time so as to produce the behavior that is most informative about the system's dynamics. Similar experimental design problems exist in neural dynamics, chemical engineering and pharmacokinetics. This grant will support the development of novel mathematical, statistical, and computational methods for addressing these issues."

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the mathematical understanding of the effects of flow on combustion.  Nevertheless, the inherent complexity and richness of the phenomena continues to present a challenge to our study of this problem.  These models are given by nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular, by reaction-diffusion equations which may also be coupled to equations of fluid dynamics.  One of the goals of the proposed research  is a continuation of previous work on passive combustion in periodic, random, as well as general inhomogeneous media.  The main questions of interest include the effects of flows on mixing and on speed-up of propagation of reaction.  In addition, simplified models will be considered and experience gained from their study will be applied to the original problems.  Another goal of the project is the study of propagation of reaction in a model of active combustion, with direct feedback of reaction on the fluid motion via the buoyancy force and gravity-induced mixing.  In many situations this effect cannot be ignored, particularly in highly turbulent combustion regimes.  Although this is a very difficult problem, limited progress has been achieved recently and it is proposed here to build upon these results.  The developed techniques will also be applied to the study of other related models, including systems of reaction-diffusion equations and a model of liquid suspensions.<br/><br/>Reactive processes, such as burning in internal combustion engines, nuclear reactions in stars, and forest fires, are ubiquitous in nature.  Their study is relevant to several branches of science and engineering such as astrophysics, biology, environmental science, and chemical engineering.  The research proposed here focuses on the influence of the motion of the underlying medium, such as fluid flow, on the speed of spreading of reactive processes.  It aims at improving our understanding of fundamental mathematical models describing such processes, which may provide useful qualitative insights into real life phenomena.  An important part of this proposal is its educational component.  The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop an undergraduate partial differential equations (PDE) course at the University of Wisconsin, mentor undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of advanced topics, and organize a Research Experience for Undergraduates program in analysis and PDEs.  The PI will also teach specialized graduate courses and involve graduate students in working under his supervision."

These equations describe the variations of certain physical observables, such as energy, momentum, etc. with respect to more basic variables like space and time. A particularly important feature of PDE-based descriptions is that problems with rather diverse scientific backgrounds can often be described by mathematically similar equations. Many insights about the underlying scientific problem can thus be gained by studying the PDEs themselves using analytical and/or numerical techniques. The current project studies a certain class of nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in the description of collective phenomena in quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is one of the two fundamental building blocks in modern physics (the other one being Einstein's theory of general relativity) and it concerns the study of mechanical systems whose dimensions are close to, or even smaller than, the atomic scale. The mathematical formulation pioneered by Erwin Schrdinger, Paul Dirac, and especially John von Neumann is to a large extent based on PDEs for so-called wave functions, which describe the state of the quantum particles in a probabilistic interpretation. It is not surprising that more than 100 years after its discovery, quantum theory has reached a stage of enormous complexity. Modern experimental techniques have made it possible to design, manipulate, and closely monitor quantum mechanical systems involving thousands of particles interacting with each other. In order to obtain a better understanding of these highly complicated systems, it is necessary to clearly separate the slow and fast degrees of freedom intrinsically present within such systems. The main objective of the current project is to develop a mathematical theory which allows to do so by means of several different analytical techniques. Its outcome will be a much simpler mathematical description in which the fast degrees of freedom have been taken into account through their total cummulative effects only. The effective model equation thereby obtained becomes accessible for a more detailed mathematical study and for accurate numerical simulations using the current state of computing power. All of the equations studied arise as important physical models in the description of various quantum mechanical phenomena. Answers to the questions raised will therefore have a strong impact as proven statements in a wide range of theoretical physics, as well as in the analysis of PDEs. In addition, the PI proposes an integrated plan of educational activities related to the proposed research: A series of mini-courses and workshops for advanced graduate students and recent PhDs will be held. They will bring together students with renowned specialists from different fields of mathematics. Furthermore, the PI will organize and support a weekly student seminar for graduate and strong undergraduate students interested in applied analysis and related fields. Finally, the PI has proposed new graduate courses on topics at the juncture of nonlinear dispersive equations, mathematical physics and asymptotic analysis.<br/><br/>Separation of scales plays a fundamental role in the understanding of the dynamical behavior of complex systems in physics and other natural sciences. By identifying the slow and fast degrees of freedom, it is often possible to derive simple laws for certain slow variables, which in turn serve as an approximate description of the full multi-scale dynamics of the problem. A particular example is the classical adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, going back to M. Born and V. Fock in 1928, which can be loosely stated as follows: A quantum mechanical system subjected to slowly changing external conditions retains its basic form (at least approximately). For quantum systems described by linear Schrdinger equations there is a wealth of mathematical results which give a rigorous meaning to this basic idea. The current project is devoted to the development of a rigorous adiabatic theory for partial differential equations of nonlinear Schrdinger type (and related models). The intellectual relevance of the proposed research stems from the importance of nonlinear Schrdinger equations as mean-field models of complex many-body quantum systems. Applications can be found in the mathematical description of Bose-Einstein condensates, quantum wave guides, and semiconductor graphene layers. All of these applications are at the forefront of modern experimental and theoretical physics. The mathematical theory to be developed will provide a qualitative description of the solutions to the respective model equation in physically relevant multi-scale regimes, and in addition establish deep connections to other areas, such as semiclassical analysis, homogenization theory, and to the study of dispersive equations on manifolds."

To analyze such complex data, the principal investigator (PI) aims to develop new statistical methodologies. The PI proposes to study four interrelated research topics. First, the PI focuses on large-margin classification and proposes new large-margin classifiers to deliver competitive classification and conditional class probability estimation. He also proposes to address the question of whether a soft or hard classifier is preferred for a particular classification task and how to incorporate estimated conditional class probability to improve dimension reduction for data with a categorical response. Second, the PI proposes an extension of the least angle regression to deal with generalized linear models and, more generally, a strictly convex optimization problem. The new solution path is piecewise given by systems of ordinary differential equations and can be slightly modified to get the corresponding LASSO regularized solution path. Third, data with a sparse and irregular functional predictor are considered. New response-based dimensional reduction methods are proposed for such data using cumulative slicing and a viable scheme is also proposed to extend large-margin classifiers to analyze such data. Fourth, the PI focuses on the semi-parametric multi-index regression. By noticing that the Hessian operator filters out the effect of the linear component automatically, the PI provides a direct estimation scheme to estimate the space spanned by the multiple indices. The new scheme differs from existing methods in that it does not require estimating the nonparametric link while estimating the space spanned by the multiple indices as in other existing approaches.<br/><br/>The proposed statistical methodology innovations are widely applicable in various fields. For example, the proposed new large-margin classifiers can be applied to analyze genomic data with a categorical response such as cancer type; new ordinary differential equation based solution path algorithms can used to analyze survival or binary genomic data to identify important predictors; while analyzing longitudinal data of aging, the new proposed statistical methods for sparse and irregular functional data will be useful. In order to facilitate the use of the proposed new methods, the PI will implement them in R or Matlab and make new software available to the public along with the corresponding research reports. The success of the proposed research will help to improve public health."

The PI has already made contributions in this direction in the recent past. The project includes a significant educational component; its principal aim is to bring together groups of young researchers from different fields of expertise in geometry and analysis and to foster interaction between these groups through targeted activities.

In its simplest form, the isoperimetric problem asks which shape of a closed curve with a given length can cover the largest area on a plane. In modern mathematics, isoperimetric problems play an important role in many fields, notably in geometry, analysis, probability theory, and group theory. The present project aims at gaining a deeper understanding of the connections between isoperimetric problems and problems from other fields, such as for example large scale geometry, a field which has been influential in many branches of mathematics in recent years. Roughly speaking, large scale (or asymptotic) geometry is the study of geometric properties of objects ""seen from far away"". From this perspective, a dotted line for example is indistinguishable from a solid one."

The arithmetic properties of such families of automorphic forms arising from periodic families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres will also be investigated. Similar analysis for unstable homotopy groups of spheres will be considered using Goodwillie calculus.  The PI also proposes an educational program to identify and develop diverse undergraduate talent at MIT through ROUTE partnerships (Reading Outreach for Undergraduate Talent Exploration).

The first stems from the recent discovery by the investigator and collaborators of a connection between the Tracy-Widom laws of RMT, their generalization to the so called ""beta-ensembles"", and a family of random Schroedinger operators.  This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random matrices and random Schroedinger.<br/>The second set of problems concerns bulk fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry.  Such questions are of growing interest in theoretical physics on account of the ties between these fluctuations and the Gaussian Free Field.  Finally, the investigator looks at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.<br/><br/>Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout mathematics and its applications.  The study of random matrices (again, RMT) addresses the natural question: ""What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix look like?""  Or, said another way: ""What properties of the spectra are universal in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the matrix ensemble?"" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering.  On the theoretical front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic) eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry.  On the more directly applied side, this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where, interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of RMT.  The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a limited resource.  Presenting a natural setting for collaborations between mathematicians and electrical engineers, this project will sponsor joint meetings along with jointly mentored graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/>"

Motivated by scientific problems in colon carcinogenesis experiments and hypertension studies, the investigator proposes new dimension reduction methods, which are widely applicable to semiparametric regression problems with functional predictors. The investigator proposes new estimation procedures based on spline approximation and roughness penalties, and will also investigate the model selection and inference problems related to these methods.

For example, wave- or dispersive-type equations display this kind of behavior. These evolution equations provide the possibility of constructing solutions from prescribed initial conditions. In some evolution processes, a prescribed restriction (or boundedness) over time is given and the question is then whether the boundedness property persists forever or whether some sort of ""unboundedness"" can arise (e.g., a freak wave suddenly appearing in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics). These evolution processes are fundamental in nature, yet we are still in the infancy of their full analytical description. This project seeks to shed new light on the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE), in particular, of dispersive PDE for which the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with linear evolution. A special emphasis will be placed on the study of singularity formation, such as collapse and blow-up. The principal investigator's research program starts from advancing the theory of collapse for the simplest models in nonlinear wave equations, proceeds by expanding this theory to more generalized models and equations, and then goes on to explore the dynamics of solutions for simple dispersive systems, which have hitherto been studied little but which describe important models in the physical world. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop singularity theory for dispersive systems like the Davey-Stewartson system. These equations arise in physical contexts such as the description of water waves or acoustic waves, and in various fields such as laser optics and fluid and air dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the frontiers in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations, in particular, improving our understanding of collapse phenomena. It will produce a rigorous analytical description of concentration and aggregation for physical applications in real life. This work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen interinstitutional ties, for example, between the George Washington University (GWU) and Howard University. In addition, the project will provide mathematical training and educational experiences at all mentoring levels, reinforcing future US competitiveness. It will focus on attracting, training, and retaining in mathematics and science outstanding female students and students from underrepresented groups. Vertical integration of educational activities, from middle school to the graduate level and beyond, will help to reinforce the project's agenda and contribute to the recruitment and retention of skillful workforce in the STEM fields. These activities will occur at the middle school level through the DC Math Circle program; at the high school level through the GWU summer precollege program (which annually recruits over two hundred students nationally); at the undergraduate level by engaging the principal investigator in the supervision of senior research theses and her serving as a mentor and  guest lecturer at the GWU ""Summer Program for Women in Math"" ; and, finally, at the graduate level by organizing the DC Grad Camp, with the emphasis on attracting female and underrepresented minority students."

Important examples include the Einstein equations of general relativity (which form the basis of modern cosmology), the Euler equations of fluid mechanics, the equations of elasticity, and the equations of crystal optics. Despite hundreds of years of mathematical progress, major gaps remain in our understanding of solutions. For example, although it is expected that solutions often ""become infinite"" there are few cases in which mathematicians have found a proof. Moreover, in other contexts, it is not even known if the equations have solutions. Thus, we still do not have a definitive understanding of the physical predictions of many equations of classical physics. The main obstacle is that the aforementioned equations are extremely difficult to study except under unrealistic simplifying assumptions. However, there have been some recent advancements in resolving some of these difficulties. For example, recent results provide a detailed description of Big Bang formation in solutions to the Einstein equations and shocks in solutions to the Euler and related equations. A major goal of this project is to extend these results to apply to other physically relevant equations and regimes. This work will provide new insight on the long-time behavior of waves and on the ways in which various physical theories can break down. <br/><br/>This research project involves the rigorous study of quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs and has three main research goals. The first is to provide a detailed description of singularity formation in various quasilinear wave-like equations of physical significance, with an emphasis on avoiding symmetry assumptions whenever possible. Examples include various Einstein-matter equations, the Euler equations, and the equations of elasticity. This research will expand our understanding of singularity formation by enlarging the class of equations and the class of initial conditions that are known to lead to blow-up. The second research goal is to prove local well-posedness for a class of physically relevant quasilinear hyperbolic problems with a free boundary along which the hyperbolicity of the equations degenerates. The third is to develop new tools for understanding the behavior of solutions to quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs with multiple characteristics in contexts where knowledge of the precise characteristics is essential. An ultimate goal is to use these tools to prove that for such equations, under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearities and data, shock formation occurs and is stable.  This proposal has several educational components that are intimately connected to the research problems. Many of the problems have components that can be investigated by advanced undergraduates, and the PI plans to supervise undergraduate research projects. There are also components suitable for PhD students. Moreover, the PI is organizing, with three co-organizers, a pair of summer schools targeted at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students from across the US and beyond. The PI will also develop curriculum materials that will be made freely available to the public online."

This project will develop and analyze new models, compare them with experimental data, explain potential discrepancies generated by new data, and address the implications to therapy and vaccine development.

The comprehensive immune models developed in this project will address fundamental questions in immunology, e.g.,  how the immune system controls viral load and why some monkeys can live with an HIV-like virus without progressing to AIDS. The results may suggest effective strategies for the development of future virus vaccines and immune-based therapies.

But in order to make sound decisions, understanding how large the most severe events are likely to be is imperative. The PI will focus on developing statistical tools for understanding the spatial structure of the most extreme events. These new tools will improve on existing models because they will be both more realistic and more computationally tractable.  The PI will also apply these tools to help scientists and policymakers study risks posed by severe environmental phenomena like inland floods, wildfires, and coastal storm surges. Furthermore, the PI will organize workshops to foster closer integration of statistical and Earth science research, as well as develop graduate courses and a textbook focused on modern statistical methods for Earth science.<br/><br/>The PI will develop stochastic models for extreme events in space that are 1) flexible enough to transition across different classes of extremal dependence, and 2) permit inference through likelihood functions that can be computed for large datasets.  It will accomplish these modeling goals by representing stochastic dependence relationships conditionally, which will induce desirable tail dependence properties and allow efficient inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The first research component will develop sub-asymptotic models for spatial extremes using max-infinitely divisible (max-id) processes, a generalization of the limiting max-stable class of processes, based on a conditional representation.  The second research component will develop sub-asymptotic spatial models for extremes based on scale mixtures of spatial Gaussian processes.  The PI will conduct closely interwoven computational development and theoretical explication of the joint tail dependence that the proposed hierarchically specified max-id and scale mixture processes induce.  Finally, the PI will apply these models to problems of high societal impact, such as extreme precipitation risk, wildfire susceptibility, and coastal storm surge exposure.  The PI will enhance connections between extreme value statisticians and communities of climate and atmospheric scientists, mitigation researchers, and stakeholders, through 1) biannual international workshops on weather and climate extremes, 2)  a Ph.D. level course in spatial statistics which will include new advances and applications of spatial extremes, and 3) writing the textbook Modern Statistics for Earth Scientists.  The PI also will add modules on extremes to Penn State's Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) summer school, and contribute to SCRiM's electronic resources and interactive teaching materials for educators, decision makers, underrepresented groups, and the general public.

This insight led to major breakthroughs and to several categories of motives. Noncommutative algebraic geometry, a recent branch of mathematics, is concerned with the study of noncommutative algebraic varieties, i.e., differential graded (=dg) categories. Recently, Kontsevich had also the motivic idea of replacing the different homology theories of noncommutative algebraic varieties (K-theory, cyclic homology, topological Hochschild homology, etc) by the ""universal"" one. Similarly, this led to several categories of noncommutative motives. The main objective of this project is to bridge the gap between the above two motivic ideas. Concretely, the Principal Investigator (PI) will construct appropriate symmetric monoidal functors relating the categories of motives and noncommutative motives. Among the manifold uses of such functors, the PI will exploit them to address the Schur/Kimura finiteness of motives as well as the rationality of motivic zeta functions.<br/><br/>The theory of motives was envisioned by Grothendieck in the sixties and greatly developed since then by Beilinson, Deligne, Voevodsky, and others. In contrast, the theory of noncommutative motives was only recently introduced by Kontsevich. The PI proposes to construct precise bridges between motives and noncommutative motives. These will enable the interchange of results, techniques, ideas, and insights between the commutative and the noncommutative world. In order to make these results accessible to the mathematical community, the PI will lecture graduate courses, disseminate them online, organize working seminars, and write the first book on the subject. Complementing these educational activities, the PI will also mentor undergraduate students through research projects on applications of motives to several areas of mathematics."

(Roughly, Heegaard Floer homology forms a (3+1)-dimensional topological field theory, and bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a (2+1+1)-dimensional extension of this field theory.)  This project seeks to further develop bordered Heegaard Floer homology. The ultimate goals are to find practical ways of computing Heegaard Floer homology (and the Seiberg-Witten invariant); an axiomatic characterization of Heegaard Floer theory; and variants on Heegaard Floer theory capable of answering other topological questions.<br/><br/>As is taught in high-school geometry (and was known to the ancient Greeks), three-dimensional space -- the space we live in -- can be sliced into a family of non-intersecting (parallel) planes. It can also be sliced into a family of disks with boundary on the standard, unkotted circle (except that one disk will have a point missing): think of the disks as soap bubbles on a bubble-wand, and the family as coming from blowing on the soap harder or less hard.  If you start with a knotted circle K, it may or may not be possible to slice space into a family of surfaces with boundary on K.  So, it is natural to ask:  for which knots K is there such a family of surfaces?  Knots for which there is such a family are called ""fibered knots"", and finding ways to tell if a knot is fibered turns out to be both interesting and hard.  Surprisingly, some of the most effective tools for answering this kind of question are closely related to ideas from modern mathematical physics, quantum field theory, and string theory, and have applications not just to 3-dimensional questions but also to 4-dimensional ones.  A family of invariants called Heegaard Floer homology is one such tool.  This project seeks to further understand the structure of Heegaard Floer homology, with the goals of developing ways to compute it more efficiently and finding other related tools adapted to different problems."

The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.

Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.

Many special cases of this duality are well-understood, but what links them remains to be investigated. This research is also tied up in the exploration of individual examples of these singularities; in these our proposal would be a ""geometrification"" and ""categorification"" of well-known dualities in mathematics, such as Schur-Weyl duality, rank-level duality and Gale duality.

The principal investigator will focus on understanding the nature of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures and the statistics of relevant observations for nonequilibrium phenomena, using innovative approaches related to the study of chaotic systems. While sophisticated techniques have been developed and beautiful results obtained for equilibrium systems, the research topics of random and chaotic behavior in nonequilibrium systems have remained wide open. The reason for this is that chaotic phenomena in these settings have quite a different flavor from those in the equilibrium context. Recently developed mathematical tools in hyperbolic systems offer hope for significant progress. This project seeks to obtain both a theoretical understanding of and new ways to connect mathematical ideas to a variety of complex phenomena by addressing two challenging issues through the use of spectral analysis, the coupling method, and other innovative approaches. The first concerns statistical properties of nonequilibrium hyperbolic systems (e.g.,to prove the existence of SRB measures that characterize the steady states; to study the time correlation functions that relate to the diffusion matrix in the transport processes; to verify other limiting theorems for perturbed hyperbolic systems).  Specific models include Lorentz gases under general forces, an ideal gas with slow-moving scatterers, and random systems with microstructure. The second issue has to do with properties of SRB measures and related physical laws (e.g., to understand the nature of SRB measures, including their entropy and Hausdorff dimensions; to obtain Ohm's law, the Einstein relation, and other physical laws for certain nonequilibrium hyperbolic systems that arise in physics).<br/><br/>This project will use mathematical tools to address applied problems in physics, chemical engineering, and other sciences. The theory of hyperbolic systems has provided excellent models or paradigms for understanding chaos and diffusion processes in systems that are random or changing over time. The goal is to capture the major complexity of these systems, from integrability to chaotic behavior, without the difficulty of integrating the equations of motion. As the study of physical invariant measures and their asymptotic statistical properties provides new insight into the nature of steady states and transport phenomena, the project will contribute to modern statistical physics and chemical engineering. Thus, it will have a broad impact outside of mathematics in the physical sciences and within the broader scientific community. The principal investigator plans to motivate and excite students about research on chaotic systems by directing graduate student research, by incorporating research-related concepts and simulations of nonequilibrium systems into new undergraduate courses, thereby enhancing research experiences for undergraduates (REUs), and by carrying out K-12 outreach activities. The research will be integrated into both graduate and undergraduate research projects, as well as into curriculum development. The principal investigator will seek institutional approval for a new topics course for graduate students on stochastic differential equations and a new undergraduate course that will focus on topics related to chaos and fractals. She will initiate a Guest Lecture Series at the Amherst Regional High School on topics related to chaos and fractal geometry, in order to engage local high school students in this interdisciplinary, cutting-edge research. She will also organize annual workshops for high school girls that will include hands-on scientific activities and career discussions with individual pursuing careers in the mathematical sciences, academic or otherwise.

To address these challenges, four interrelated research topics are proposed for investigation. First, the investigator proposes robust variable selection methods for heavy-tailed data in the ultra-high dimensional setting of dimensionality increasing exponentially with the sample size. To address the heavy-tailedness, regularization methods with robust losses and general penalty functions in various model settings are investigated. The risk properties of these methods are studied and the optimality of penalty function and loss function is characterized. Robust independence screening methods are also proposed and studied. Second, variable selection in high-dimensional functional regression models with functional predictors and/or functional response is investigated. Model fitting procedures are proposed and sampling properties of the proposed methods are thoroughly investigated. Third, the investigator studies the regularization parameter selection in penalized empirical risk minimization in both settings of correctly specified and misspecified models in ultra-high dimensions. The appropriate tradeoff between the model fitting and model complexity is characterized. This study also answers the question on whether conventional model selection criteria such as AIC and BIC continue to work in ultra-high dimensions.  Fourth, high-dimensional classification with correlated features is extensively studied under the unified framework of thresholding classification rules, and the optimal choice of threshold that minimizes the classification error is identified. The investigator studies Gaussian classification and generalizes the methods and results to the case of correlated discrete features.<br/><br/>Thanks to the advent of modern technologies such as the handwritten digital recognition and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping experiments, massive data sets with a large number of variables are becoming more and more common in various scientific fields such as computational biology, economics, finance, machine learning, and climatology. How to effectively analyze these data sets poses great challenges in both methodology and computation that are not present in smaller scale studies. A major goal of this proposal is to propose new or extended methodologies and investigate their sampling properties in depth and width for high-dimensional model building and model evaluation in various settings of regression and classification problems. The PI has broad research interests in many fields outside statistics such as computational biology, finance, econometrics, and machine learning. The proposed methods will be tested on real data sets and extended to these different areas. In addition, the PI plans to develop software packages to implement the proposed methods, and make them publicly available. The proposed work will benefit a broad range of scientists and researchers in various fields. The PI also plans to integrate education activities with the proposed research, such as involving minority students, undergraduate students, and graduate students in the proposed projects and incorporating cutting-edge high-dimensional statistical methods into new courses."

Number theory is among the oldest branches of mathematics; its applications to technology are prevalent and vital for communication systems, data processing, and computational algorithms. The goals of this project are driven by landmark problems on arithmetic families. Families arise when assembling and studying together objects that share common features. Families are often crucial even if one is a priori interested in a single object and thereby are central to the recent resolution of certain difficult algebraic and asymptotic questions. These goals of the project are complemented by concrete initiatives targeted at undergraduate and graduate education that are centered on developing effective writing and communication skills. In collaboration with the Institute for Writing at Cornell University, the PI will organize a monthly seminar on writing, regular writing groups, and an online wiki that will serve as a communication platform and access to resources for the general public. The PI will continue to mentor undergraduate research projects, disseminating knowledge and discoveries while promoting learning through the investigation of open problems.<br/><br/>This research project aims to develop a quantitative theory of the asymptotics of special functions, such as characters of representations. The long-term goal is to solve problems on automorphic periods, subconvexity and non-vanishing of L-functions, and arithmetic statistics of families.  The trace formula is a fundamental tool in number theory and the development of the Langlands program in particular. Even though there has been enormous progress, important questions remain open, notably analytic aspects that are critical for many applications. These questions are now ripe for investigation following the works of Arthur and others. An immediate outcome of this research is a Sato-Tate equi-distribution theorem for families of Maass forms on GL(n), resolving a long-standing problem.  The understanding of the absolute convergence of the geometric side of the trace formula is currently one of the most urgent problems in the subject. A second focus is on trace characters, which are a central concern in representation theory, such as the local Langlands correspondence and functorial transfers. The PI will work on quantitative aspects that have seen little progress since the seminal work of Harish-Chandra. Related to this, the PI will continue work on Whittaker periods, notably towards a conjecture of Zuckerman on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. The proposed activity is to bring methods from analysis, geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics in their full strength, notably symplectic geometry and integrable systems; an immediate goal is the systematic study of the quantitative aspects of coadjoint orbits."

Software that implements these algorithms will be made available to the public.  These new products will help practitioners in industry create better predictive models and will also help advance research in many other fields.

These penalties are useful because they lead to interpretable parameter estimates, but assuming that these zeros exist may be inappropriate in some applications.  The investigator develops and analyzes new methods to fit models in high dimensions that do not require that zeros are present in the parameters of interest, but still allow the practitioner to make simple interpretations of the fit in terms of the measured variables.  This includes the development of new methods to fit multiple response regression models and multinomial logistic regression models, as well as the development of new methods to shrink characteristics of inverse covariance estimates that are needed to fit predictive models.

Nonparametric procedures have become increasingly popular in the theory and practice of statistics in recent times primarily because of their fundamental advantages over parametric methods: greater flexibility and more 'data-driven' features. In this proposal, the investigator studies three core directions of statistical research in this area: (A) Nonparametric function estimation under shape restrictions, (B) Dimension reduction using semi/non-parametric techniques, and (C) Bootstrap based inference in non-standard problems. The main motivation for this research is in developing nonparametric procedures that are completely automated (free from tuning parameters, e.g., smoothing bandwidths) but still flexible enough to incorporate data-driven features. A major part of this proposal deals with nonparametric methods applicable to multivariate data, an area that has received relatively less attention, though often felt to be necessary in performing real data analysis.<br/><br/>With the advancement in modern computing facilities and the explosion in collection of large scale data sets, the use of more complicated/intricate statistical procedures involving numerical optimization techniques are becoming increasingly popular. However, a complete theoretical analysis of most of these procedures is still largely unavailable. This research aims at understanding the theoretical and computational aspects of some of these statistical procedures, and quantifying the uncertainties involved in such stochastic optimization problems. The intended applications of the proposed research are diverse, ranging from detecting the advent of global warming, to estimating the radial velocity distribution of stars in a galaxy, to developing inferential techniques for binary choice models (of special interest to econometricians), and would involve collaborations at different levels with statisticians, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, econometricians and astronomers."

However, making inference for quantile regression is challenging in data-sparse regions such as at low or high quantiles with quantile levels close to 0 or 1. In the proposed research, the Principal Investigator (PI) aims to develop theory and methodology for quantile regression in data-sparse regions, which opens up a significant new direction in quantile regression. For estimating extreme conditional quantiles of the response distribution, the PI plans to develop extrapolation methods based on a novel application of the extreme value theory. In data sparse areas, the formulation of models plays a critical role. The PI will study models with different levels of complexity, which calls for different techniques for quantifying the tail quantiles. New theory and methods for joint quantile estimation and inter-quantile shrinkage will be developed to improve statistical efficiency by sharing information across multiple quantile functions. The PI will also study tail quantile regression for dependent data, where the common understanding about the impact of dependence on statistical inference needs to be re-examined. As a result, new and efficient methods to incorporate tail dependence will be proposed.<br/><br/><br/>An important problem in many fields is the modeling and prediction of events that are rare but have significant consequences.

The proposed methodologies will have broad and valuable applications in studies of rare events in climate sciences, risk management in finance, studies of infant birth weights, and prediction of insurance claims. The PI will integrate research and education by developing advanced topics courses, engaging graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, in the project, and reaching out to the K-12 education levels by training high school teachers."

More specifically, the CAREER Award will fund Pelayo's investigations on classical and quantum semitoric systems. A classical semitoric system is an integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom for which one component generates a periodic flow. For mathematicians, semitoric systems form the next natural class of systems after toric systems. Semitoric systems retain some properties of toric systems, while at the same time they exhibit a much greater flexibility. This flexibility is reflected in the existence of singularities which are dynamically and symplectically rich.Semitoric systems are commonly found in simple physical models and arise naturally as examples in analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry. As a matter of fact, a semitoric system defines a singular toric fibration whose base comes endowed with a singular integral affine structure. These singular affine structures are a central concept in symplectic topology and mirror symmetry. A semitoric quantum system is given by two commuting self-adjoint semiclassical operators acting on a Hilbert space whose principal symbols form a classical semitoric system. One of Pelayo's main goals is  to study the spectral theory of semitoric quantum systems and how it relates to classical systems. Concretely, Pelayo's plan is to work towards verifying that the semiclassical joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system determines completely the system; this is the Spectral Conjecture, widely considered the most spectacular problem in the area.  Proving this conjecture requires establishing a number of results in semiclassical analysis, giving a tool for future research in the field, independent of the conjecture. Another component of Pelayo's research plans is to continue studying semitoric systems in a more general context, in particular as it regards to the study of the convexity and connectivity properties of the singular Lagrangian fibrations which semitoric systems induce, and which are of special interest in mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The research that the CAREER Award will support belongs to the context of  dynamics and geometry.  Dynamics  is the study of the motion of bodies. Geometry is the study of shape (broadly understood) of objects and spaces.More specifically, the CAREER Award will support Pelayo's research at the intersection of symplectic geometry, spectral theory  and dynamics. Symplectic geometry has its roots in physics, and provides an appropriate mathematical framework to study many problems of physics and chemistry and their quantum counterparts. Pelayo's research on this topic exhibits the interplay between mathematical and physical theories. Indeed, several groups of physicists and chemists working on modern quantum spectroscopy have been interested in seeing how mathematical methods can  contribute to advance their research, and predict new physical phenomena. They have been particularly interested in understanding the global structure of joint energy-momentum spectra of small molecules. Even more, they have recognized the pivotal role that mathematical invariants play in this problem. Their works have motivated a large number of mathematical questions. The physicists have asked whether one can single out an optimal set of mathematical invariants that would characterize a physical system and then detect these invariants in the spectrum of the system.  The detection of the invariants in the system spectrum will allow us to reconstruct the system and hence predict new phenomena. The CAREER Award will support Pelayo's investigations into this crucial question.  These applications to quantum molecular spectroscopy are integrated in Pelayo's approach of employing methods from pure mathematics (symplectic and spectral theory, microlocal analysis) to address problems from the applied sciences. More generally,  Pelayo's  research is focused on a fundamental type of physical system, the so called integrable systems. One can find direct applications of integrable systems in numerous contexts. Some such examples are nonlinear control,  locomotion generation in robotics, elasticity theory, plasma physics, field theory and planetary mission design. In order to communicate this relevance of mathematical research to the general public, Pelayo has been interviewed on several occasions by the press (radio and magazines with several hundred thousand audience members). He has commented and advocated for an understanding of the leading role that mathematicians play in the advance of applied science and technology in society. Pelayo will continue actively reaching out to the general public during the tenure of the award, and will continue to take a leading role at Washington University outreach programs. In this respect he will run a  Talent Identification Program at Washington University to encourage and nurture undergraduate research at an early stage."

Both  invariants associate chain complexes to knots whose chain homotopy types (and consequently, homology groups) are knot invariants. This project has two major research goals. The first goal is to extend various aspects of these homological invariants to stable homotopy types, i.e., construct new knot invariant topological spaces (well-defined up to stable homotopy equivalences) whose homology groups are the existing invariants. This will produce higher structures on the homological invariants which will be useful for studying certain geometric properties of knots, such as their four-ball genus. The second goal of this project is to study the relationship between the homological invariants. The project seeks to find new spectral sequences, and combinatorial reformulations of the existing spectral sequences, from the Khovanov homology invariants to the knot Floer homology invariants. This will lead to a better understanding of why these two invariants coming from very different origins share so many similarities.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes of spaces; and low dimensional topology concentrates on spaces up to dimension four. Knot theory is an important sub-field of low dimensional topology where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, for example, knotted pieces of strings inside the (three-dimensional Euclidean) space that we live in. In addition to being an extremely valuable tool in low dimensional topology, knot theory has also proven to be useful in real world applications: from analysing knotting in DNA to studying mixing in liquids, and from estimating energies of orbits inside a magnetic field to creating new data encryption schemes. A fundamental problem in knot theory is the knot isotopy problem: to determine if a given knot can transform into another one without tearing or crossing itself (such a transformation is called a knot isotopy). Knot invariants are mathematical objects, such as numbers or groups, that one associates to knots, and which remain unchanged during such a knot isotopy. Therefore, knot invariants are used extensively in the knot isotopy problem: if one finds some knot invariant that takes different values on the two given knots, then one concludes that the two knots are not isotopic. The current project is based on knot theory, and it seeks to study properties of certain previously known knot invariants, and to extend them to construct new knot invariants. The project will lead to dispersion of mathematical knowledge, particularly in the area of low-dimensional topology, via a variety of means. This project will fund undergraduate students for summer research, week-long workshops on low-dimensional topology, and a wiki-based website on knot theory."

One such occurrence relevant to this project is the set of dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The time is right for a deeper study of these structures. This project will develop such a study through targeted applications to new classes of examples which have been selected for novelty, either in settings or technical details.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue several projects that involve different kinds of categorical and classical symmetries in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The general theme of the research is to find and exploit hidden symmetries in a problem to gain new information about it. This information can take the form of a new structural property or a finiteness result about a family of invariants. This research will focus in particular on several classes of mathematical objects for which these properties or calculation of invariants have resisted more traditional means of attack. Among these are: the action of ordered injections on the homology of groups of upper-triangular matrices, the action of surjections on the cohomology of compactified moduli spaces, and Hopf ring actions on syzygies of secant varieties of varieties arising from multilinear algebra.

A particular feature of the proposal is a focus on situations when no extremal metric exists. On the algebro-geometric side the goal is to construct canonical degenerations of the variety and the PI's proposal is to use filtrations of the homogeneous coordinate ring, in analogy with Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of unstable vector bundles. On the differential geometric side one needs to understand the possible limiting behavior of families of extremal metrics. In general this is much more intricate than the much more thoroughly understood case of Kahler-Einstein metrics, and the PI proposes to first restrict attention to metrics with bounded curvature, and to relate the limiting behavior to filtrations. In the proposal a special emphasis is placed on the construction of new examples of extremal metrics, and the applications of these ideas to other problems in Kahler geometry."

However, a key difficulty with nonparametric models is model fitting for high dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality. Another difficulty is model inference and interpretation, i.e., how to evaluate or test individual variable effects on the complex surface fit. For heterogeneous data with complicated covariance structure, nonparametric model estimation is even more challenging. The objectives of this proposal are to develop novel and widely applicable procedures to simultaneous model selection and estimation for nonparametric models and their related paradigms in data mining. In the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the PI proposes a host of new regularization techniques for several families of models: smoothing spline ANOVA models for correlated data, semiparametric regression models, support vector machines for supervised and semi-supervised learning. The proposed methodologies constitute key advances over standard methods through their unified framework for achieving model sparsity and function smoothing altogether, their tractable theoretical properties, and their easy adaptation to high dimensional problems.

The second application is the development of topological cluster categories arising from surfaces; extending to higher dimensions should allow for the development of new invariants of higher-dimensional manifolds analogous to ones for surfaces.  This second application should also inform the first, with higher-dimensional cluster categories giving new information about topological field theories.  The third application is concerned with connections between Hall algebras and algebraic K-theory.  In one direction, constructions of homotopical Hall algebras are expected to give rise to K-theory spectra which should give new information about Hall algebras, especially those related to quantum groups.  In another, variations of Hall algebra constructions have corresponding variants of algebraic K-theory which are worthy of further investigation.  <br/><br/>Broadly speaking, this proposal is concerned with incorporating algebraic information into categorical and topological structures which are currently being used in a wide range of kinds of mathematics.  We then seek to apply these enhanced structures in mathematical physics, manifold theory, and representation theory.  The educational component of this proposal consists of a series of four summer workshops for mathematics majors who are in the process of transferring to UC Riverside.  The goal is to help twenty participants each year to make the transition to upper-level mathematics via introduction to proof techniques, more theoretical concepts, and a broad overview of the range of topics in higher-level mathematics courses.  Students will be provided with some follow-up mentoring activities, including opportunities for participating in undergraduate research."

Furthermore, it is a natural framework to import powerful algorithms from numerical optimization, especially for large scale problems. The broad goal of this project is to understand the fundamental interactions between statistics and stochastic optimization. To accomplish this task the investigator (a) identifies new problems from statistics, especially with complex structure, that can be recast as stochastic optimization problems; (b) develops new algorithms that optimally and efficiently solve large scale problems; (c) determines essential characteristics of the problems that govern the performance of algorithms and their fundamental limitations; and (d) explores peripheral problems of stochastic optimization including stochastic optimization with stochastic constraints and stochastic optimization with limited feedback. <br/><br/>The information era has witnessed an explosion in the collection of data and large scale data sets are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications including biology, networks, environmental science, sociology and marketing. This results in an acute need of new statistical methods to analyze these data sets of unprecedented size. While techniques from numerical optimization can be used in several scenarios, their analysis remains largely dissociated from that of the statistical task at hand. This research aims at providing a unified treatment of a number of large scale problems emerging from statistical learning and from optimization under uncertainty in general. Therefore, the project will not only result in new and effective algorithms, but also in a novel theoretical framework that supports the analysis of stochastic optimization problems and enables further improvements of said algorithms."

One can imagine asking how quickly one would need to sample an audio clip so that from those samples alone, the audio clip could be accurately recovered. Would you need to sample every nanosecond, every millisecond, or every second? Compressive Signal Processing (CSP) shows that the important information in many signals can be obtained and recovered from far fewer samples than traditionally thought. The applications of CSP are widespread and include imaging (medical, hyperspectral, microscopy, biological), analog-to-information conversion, radar, large scale information synthesis, geophysical data analysis, computational biology, and many more. Although these applications are astounding, there has been a disconnect between the theoretical work in CSP and the use of CSP in practical settings. The goals of this project will bridge this gap by providing methods and analysis for CSP that apply to real-world signals and settings. Such work will lead to decreased scan time in MRI, reduced cost and energy consumption in computing infrastructures, improved detection of diseased crops from hyperspectral images, increased accuracy in radar, and improved compression and analysis in many other large-data applications. In addition, this project will involve students at all levels and introduce them to rigorous scientific research. The PI actively recruits members from under-represented populations, and will continue to promote diversity through her own research and outreach programs.<br/><br/>Early CSP models restrict the class of signals to those compressible in a very specific sense (sparse with respect to an orthonormal or incoherent basis). One goal of this project is to relax this restriction to allow for signals actually encountered in practice, such as those sparse in redundant, coherent, and highly overcomplete dictionaries. We will utilize both greedy approaches and optimization-based methods, tailored to specific dictionaries of interest, as well as more general methods for arbitrary bases. In addition, this project will develop adaptive CSP sampling schemes, where measurements of the signal are designed ""on the fly,"" as they are being taken. Traditional measurement schemes ignore this information, while adaptive schemes have the potential to significantly reduce reconstruction error, number of measurements, and computation time. We will identify optimal measurement strategies for constrained and unconstrained settings, and analyze how much one can actually gain from adaptivity from an information theoretic point of view. The project will also involve work in ""one-bit CSP"", a new and exciting branch of CSP which handles extreme (and often more realistic) quantization. We will draw on sub-linear methods, where large errors appear naturally, and also use optimization based techniques along with adaptive quantization thresholds to reduce the recovery error below the best possible for non-adaptive quantization. In studying these topics, the research will bridge a large gap in the theory of CSP and provide a unified framework for both practitioners and researchers."

It is a very active field, since many questions in other fields can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example: the spectra of heavy atoms in physics, statistical estimation of covariance matrices in statistics, capacity of quantum channels in quantum communication, conducting properties of semiconductors (Anderson models). This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory. The investigator will also run workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to random matrix theory as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>The investigator will focus on the identification of the eigenvalue densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the  eigenvector distributions of  many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this project include anisotropic  matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied. The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for more general random matrix ensembles."

The investigator studies how singularities impact the behavior of existing statistical methods and develops new techniques for adequate assessment of statistical significance.  The focus is on algebraic statistical models, that is, models that have (semi-)algebraic sets as parameter spaces.  The class of algebraic models comprises many of the singular models employed in practice and can be studied using tools from computational algebraic geometry.  Importantly, the well-behaved local geometry of semi-algebraic sets makes it possible to obtain general results without having to assume difficult to verify regularity conditions.  The statistical techniques under study include classical procedures from likelihood inference such as likelihood ratio and Wald tests as well as information criteria.<br/><br/>Modern scientific studies often require analysis of data on several jointly observed variables.  Statistical models of dependence relationships among the different variables are often formulated using additional variables that are not observable (or hidden).  A common feature of hidden variable models is that their statistical properties are not entirely understood because of a lack of smoothness properties that makes them irregular.  This is the primary motivation for this project that develops theory and methods that have a bearing on problems such as determining the number and type of unobserved variables to be included in a statistical model.  Such problems arise in particular in applications in the social sciences where key concepts such as intelligence are not directly observable, and in computational biology where hidden variables are employed, for example, when DNA of present-day species is used to validate evolutionary theories that involve extinct species.  More broadly, the work is relevant for any study, medical or otherwise, in which the existence of influential unobserved variables cannot be excluded.<br/>"

Partial differential equations emerge in a variety of physical contexts as mathematical models for the time-evolution of certain physical quantities. A particular class of such equations are the so-called completely integrable systems, which are characterized by the fact they satisfy a sufficiently large (in a sense which can be made precise) number of conservation laws. The theory of completely integrable systems has a long and distinguished history. Over the past thirty years, in particular, interest in the field has been fueled on the one hand by the fact that many of the equations known to be completely integrable are obtained as models of fluid dynamics, and on the other hand by the close connections that have been discovered with many fields of pure mathematics, such as Lie algebras or symplectic and Poisson geometry. One of the fundamental goals of the current project is to expand and deepen the understanding of these connections and to widen the class of models to which the techniques of completely integrable theory apply. Hence one aims to describe as fully as possible the solutions to these models and hopefully to gain thereby insights into real-life phenomena. An essential part of the proposal is its educational component, which is centered around the organization of an annual summer school for advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s on various topics of current research interest at the juncture of analysis, partial differential equations, and numerical analysis. All talks in the summer school will be delivered on preassigned articles by the participants. Beyond its broad mathematical impact, the project will allow the principal investigator to expand  other educational activities as well. She will support the work of graduate students through advanced courses, seminars, and student research workshops, and she will work with local chapters of the Association for Women In Mathematics (AWM) in the Chicago area to promote the advancement of women in mathematical careers."

This is the emerging technology of compressed sensing (CS). In this research, the PI proposes to study a broad range of issues and techniques to advance CS. His proposed reseach includes the introduction of new methodolgies for exploiting solution sparsity to accelerate CS computation, the development of algorithms that utilize operations requiring low storage and maintain robustness to noise and errors in data, and the discovery of efficient methods for minimizing the l1-norms of wide classes of functions such as first and higher-order differences. This project will include an integrated educational program involving a new course, one Ph.D. student, and the participation in the Rice-Houston AGEP program in producing competitive women and minority graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The new emerging technology of ""compressed sensing"" is a complement to traditional data compression. While the traditional technology encodes digital data using fewer bits in order to save storage and transmission time, the new technology can significantly reduce the time, energy, and cost associated with the acquisition of digital data. This is achieved by acquiring digit information of an object of interest from a reduced number of obervations than what is usually necessary. For example, the life of an aeriel such as a space telescope can be greatly extended due to a lower sampling rate (and thus a lower power demand). Hyperspectral and infrared imaging devices can produce the same images with smaller sensors, or if with the same sensors, images at higher resolution. As such, the new technology can lead to breakthroughs for applications where the bottleneck lies in the high cost of data acquisition.<br/>"

Additionally, it has formulations in the areas of operator theory, complex differential geometry, functional analysis, and commutative algebra.  The Corona Problem has served as an impetus for research in four main areas of analysis: complex analysis, function theory, harmonic analysis, and operator theory.

To address these two problems, the investigator proposes to study (a) a set of techniques for more effectively learning one or more Gaussian graphical models by making more effective and structured assumptions about the topology of the true conditional dependence networks, via convex penalties and other techniques; and (b) more flexible frameworks for estimating conditional dependence relationships without the usual Gaussianity assumptions.<br/><br/>In recent years, new technologies and fast computers have resulted in the generation and availability of vast amounts of data in fields as diverse as molecular biology, marketing, finance, sociology, linguistics, and computer vision.

Two situations are studied: a) the functional variables are the response of interest and b) the functional variables are predictors and another scalar variable is the response. In both cases, accounting for the dependence within the subject as well as for the longitudinal design is crucial for modeling and inference. However, current methods either ignore the dependence or are too complicated and computationally intensive. The specific research goals of this project are: 1) to introduce novel parsimonious modeling framework for the repeatedly observed functional variables, which allows to extract low dimensional features and use them to study the process dynamics; 2) to develop significance tests to formally assess the effect of covariates; and 3) to develop association models and inferential procedures when the functional variables are predictors and another scalar variable is the response observed in a longitudinal design."

For example, wave- or dispersive-type equations display this kind of behavior. These evolution equations provide the possibility of constructing solutions from prescribed initial conditions. In some evolution processes, a prescribed restriction (or boundedness) over time is given and the question is then whether the boundedness property persists forever or whether some sort of ""unboundedness"" can arise (e.g., a freak wave suddenly appearing in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics). These evolution processes are fundamental in nature, yet we are still in the infancy of their full analytical description. This project seeks to shed new light on the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE), in particular, of dispersive PDE for which the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with linear evolution. A special emphasis will be placed on the study of singularity formation, such as collapse and blow-up. The principal investigator's research program starts from advancing the theory of collapse for the simplest models in nonlinear wave equations, proceeds by expanding this theory to more generalized models and equations, and then goes on to explore the dynamics of solutions for simple dispersive systems, which have hitherto been studied little but which describe important models in the physical world. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop singularity theory for dispersive systems like the Davey-Stewartson system. These equations arise in physical contexts such as the description of water waves or acoustic waves, and in various fields such as laser optics and fluid and air dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the frontiers in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations, in particular, improving our understanding of collapse phenomena. It will produce a rigorous analytical description of concentration and aggregation for physical applications in real life.

In addition, the project will provide mathematical training and educational experiences at all mentoring levels, reinforcing future US competitiveness. It will focus on attracting, training, and retaining in mathematics and science outstanding female students and students from underrepresented groups. Vertical integration of educational activities, from middle school to the graduate level and beyond, will help to reinforce the project's agenda and contribute to the recruitment and retention of skillful workforce in the STEM fields. These activities will occur at the middle school level through the DC Math Circle program; at the high school level through the GWU summer precollege program (which annually recruits over two hundred students nationally); at the undergraduate level by engaging the principal investigator in the supervision of senior research theses and her serving as a mentor and  guest lecturer at the GWU ""Summer Program for Women in Math"" ; and, finally, at the graduate level by organizing the DC Grad Camp, with the emphasis on attracting female and underrepresented minority students."

The discovery process usually involves an extensive screening through a large number of hypotheses to separate signals of interest and also recognize their patterns. The situation can be described as finding needles of various shapes in a haystack. Despite the enormous progress on methodological work in data screening, pattern recognition and related fields, there have been little theoretical studies on the issues of optimality and error control in situations where a large number of decisions are made sequentially and simultaneously. These issues are among the central topics in modern Statistics; hence it is imperative to develop solid theory and powerful data-driven methods to help understand, regulate and optimize the dynamic decision process of sparse signal and pattern recovery. The specific research goals in this proposal are: to study the optimality theory and develop data-driven methods for a broad class of interrelated problems in signal detection, multiple testing and pattern classification; to develop a dynamic scheme for data acquisition, resource allocation and decision making for effective and accurate signal recovery; and to develop a compound decision theoretic framework for large-scale simultaneous and sequential inference. <br/> <br/>The data screening and pattern recognition problems may arise from a wide range of scientific applications such as bioinformatics, finance, signal and language processing, image analysis, and geographical and astronomical surveys. These problems have significantly contributed to the rapid growth of a new and active interdisciplinary research area in data mining that has attracted substantial interests from applied mathematicians, statisticians and computer scientists. The proposed research provides important insights on some fundamental issues in these problems such as how the size of large data sets can be reduced significantly without losing many signals, how the signals can be separated from noise optimally, how the shapes and patterns of different objects can be recognized accurately, and how the inflation of errors in a large number of decisions can be controlled effectively. User-friendly software will be developed and made freely available for public use. The investigator will integrate the proposed research into educational activities through developing new courses for the young USC Statistics program, and through mentoring and training both undergraduate and graduate students to help them participate effectively in an information era overwhelmed by massive data."

From its origins in the late 19th century to today, the mathematical theory of dynamical systems has been inspired by problems in adjacent areas of mathematics (e.g. number theory, geometry, probability), and other natural sciences (e.g. celestial mechanics, statistical mechanics, population biology). This project belongs to that rich tradition, and focuses on deriving fundamental results for a variety of dynamical systems arising from geometry, number theory and applied settings. The common thread that unifies these topics is an 'entropic' approach to all the problems under consideration. The entropy of a dynamical system is a fundamental invariant which measures the complexity of its orbit structure. The three main research directions of the project are: (1) to establish uniqueness of measures of maximal entropy and equilibrium states in a variety of higher dimensional settings of interest to the dynamics and wider mathematical communities; (2) to give a number-theoretic description of all the possible entropies that can be achieved within certain natural classes of dynamical systems; (3) to use information-theoretic interpretations of entropy and related quantities to give insight to problems in mathematical bioscience. The project contains a substantial program of synergistic educational activities, including the development of an after-school math enrichment program for the Ohio State University Young Scholars Program. The program will develop fundamental mathematical skills for a talented population of students from under-represented groups taken from all the major urban areas of Ohio.<br/><br/>Part (1) of the project develops a novel approach to the theory of equilibrium states, focusing on implementation to non-uniformly and partially hyperbolic systems. The project develops novel techniques to overcome some of the traditional obstructions to developing an effective theory in these higher dimensional settings. The end goal is to use these results to derive numerous global statistical properties (central limit theorems, large deviations, etc.) for the systems within our framework. Motivating examples include geodesic flows in non-positive curvature, and the Teichmueller flow on the moduli space of quadratic differentials. Part (2) concerns the algebraic description of numbers arising as entropies of post-critically finite interval maps. A surprising relationship between the degree of the map and the algebraic properties of these numbers was identified experimentally in Thurston's final paper. A rigorous explanation of this phenomenon remains an open problem, which the PI has recast in terms of identifying zeros of certain complex functions. Part (3) investigates finitary versions of entropy, and related quantities, in the mathematical biosciences. The PI will use these quantities, interpreted as measures of complexity, as tools for detecting structure in large data sets, particularly those arising in genomic analysis and in the dynamics of biologically motivated networks."

In the first proposed activity, the PI will prove that there exists an algorithm to compute the cohomology of an arithmetic group as a Hecke module.  The PI will implement the proposed algorithm robustly in a computer algebra system, collect and analyze data, and conjecture and prove results based on the discovered phenomena.  In the second activity, the PI will study arithmetic applications of Galois Belyi covers that arise from a modular embedding of a triangle group into a quaternionic unit group.  The PI will investigate questions of modularity, parametrization of elliptic curves, and special points arising from this construction.

The theory, design, and implementation of algorithms in arithmetic geometry is a burgeoning area, and there are many exciting applications of these methods to diverse fields.  The PI further proposes many specific projects at the undergraduate and graduate level, and the proposed algorithmic tools will be integrated into teaching, training, and learning.  The PI will continue undergraduate outreach, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and expository writing and extensive lectures aimed at communicating high level mathematics to a student audience.

For general cluster algebras, he plans to prove the positivity conjecture, which is the oldest unsolved conjecture in the field. For cluster algebras of surface type, the PI will study the properties of canonical bases introduced by him and his collaborators. Moreover, he will use the bases to gain a better understanding of the cluster algebra itself as well as its relationship with representation theory and Teichmueller theory. The Pi will also study automorphisms of cluster algebras which will lead to a better comprehension of the intrinsic symmetries of cluster algebras. The PI will integrate education and research at several levels. He will organize a graduate summer school on cluster algebras at the University of Connecticut. The PI will continue to develop an international network at institutions in Argentina, Canada and the US, which will allow advanced graduate students and postdocs to go abroad for two-week long research visits in order to exchange ideas with local researchers. Moreover, the PI will continue to run the cluster algebra seminar in his department.<br/><br/>When cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002, their original motivation came from representation theory, which is a branch of modern algebra. Studying the symmetries of a model is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This motivates a further development of the theory of cluster algebras to which this project will contribute. <br/>"

Algebraic topology studies the problem of attaching invariants, e.g., numbers or, more generally, abstract algebraic structures, to spaces in a manner independent of the way they are pulled and twisted (without being torn).  Solutions to systems of polynomial equations are not obviously amenable to the tools of algebraic topology, especially when such systems arise from arithmetic.

This project aims to study two general classes of problems by transplanting a very successful method from algebraic topology (the theory of obstructions) to the setting of algebraic geometry by means of A^1-homotopy theory.

The PI proposes to develop mathematical models, examine mathematical issues, and design computational methods for new and important classes of direct and inverse problems that arise from the acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation in complex and random environments. The mathematical modeling techniques and computational methods developed in this project address several key scientific challenges in applied and computational mathematics, which include: (1) multi-scale modeling and computation of the wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium; (2) computational stochastic direct and inverse scattering problems; (3) numerical solution of Maxwell's equations and well-posedness of associated models; (4) global uniqueness, local stability, and numerical solution of the ill-posed inverse scattering problems.

The proposed education activities include: (1) undergraduate and graduate courses and curriculum development; (2) mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc research; (3) organizing summer schools, seminars, and workshops. <br/><br/>The dramatic growth of computational capability and the development of fast algorithms have transformed the methodology for scientific investigation and industrial applications in the field of scattering theory. Reciprocally, the practical applications and scientific developments have driven the need for more sophisticated mathematical models and numerical algorithms to describe the scattering of complicated structures, and to accurately compute acoustic and electromagnetic fields and thus to predict the performance of a given structure, as well as to carry out optimal design of new structures. The proposed computational models and tools are highly promising for qualitative and quantitative study of the complex physical and mathematical problems in optics and electromagnetics, and provide an inexpensive and easily controllable virtual prototype of the structures in the design and fabrication of optical and  electromagnetic devices.

Many special cases of this duality are well-understood, but what links them remains to be investigated.

The creation of a bridge between findings on algebraic higher-rank actions that rely on analytic tools and the more dynamical approach used for general smooth actions is crucial for an improved understanding of rigidity phenomena. For algebraic higher-rank actions, the project will study connections between cohomological obstructions obtained geometrically and those obtained analytically from the induced action on representations.  Part of the strategy is to work towards answering these questions by focusing on representative examples. The principal investigator's main interest is in actions by groups that have higher rank but that lack rich geometric or algebraic structure (e.g., abelian groups, nilpotent groups, solvable groups).<br/><br/>Persistence of dynamics under perturbations is an old question in science. We completely understand the future and the past only for sufficiently simple systems, which are merely approximations of observed phenomena. Chaotic behavior was initially considered to be a pathology. However, it turns out to be a source of stability. Studies showing that it is a healthy heartbeat that demonstrates the presence of chaos are not surprising, provided that one accepts the fact that nature prefers stability. For systems that fall under the heading ""group actions"" the relation between chaos and stability is  even more dramatic:  weaker chaotic behavior tends to imply stronger stability for the system. Group actions can be thought of as systems with multidimensional time. As such, they are useful models in biology (neural networks), chemistry (quasi-crystals), and computer science (multidimensional data storage). In particular models, chaos appears in different guises. It is a goal of this project to explore conditions under which systems with diverse chaotic behavior preserve their dynamical properties under perturbations. This topic is especially amenable to introducing students to research in the area of dynamical systems. Through the study of simple models, students can develop intuition, learn what the open problems are, and make their own contribution to the actual research by performing specific computations. This is the rationale for the project's outreach component, which is aimed at high-school girls and the goal of which is to introduce mathematical research and insights into academic careers to female students at an early stage in their intellectual development."

The aim is to provide an accurate, practical, detailed description of these coherent wave structures that is useful for applications in nanomagnetism and the fluid dynamics of dissipationless, dispersive media.  Motivated by recent experiments, time-periodic, localized solutions of a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation that incorporates a spin transfer torque forcing term to compensate damping will be computed and studied analytically using asymptotic methods.  These magnetic droplet solitons and their generalizations have potential for technological applications. Another research front will be developed involving modulated nonlinear wavetrains or dispersive shock waves (DSWs).  The generation of DSWs represents a universal mechanism to resolve hydrodynamic singularities in dispersive media such as water waves, plasma, optics, interfacial fluids, Bose-Einstein condensates, and two-phase, viscously deformable fluids.  Theoretical studies will focus upon central questions of modern DSW theory including loss of genuine nonlinearity/strict hyperbolicity in the modulation equations, multi-dimensional DSWs, and stability.  In collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, the principal investigator will undertake experiments involving a viscous fluid conduit system in order to make quantitative measurements of DSW properties for comparison with theory.<br/><br/>When wave properties intrinsically depend upon the wave amplitude, novel physical behavior can arise.  With a view toward applications, this project encompasses two classes of these nonlinear waves: solitary waves in nanomagnetism and shock waves in dispersive media.  Spintronics encompasses the effort to develop information transport, processing, and storage using the electron's spin in addition to its charge, for example, to continue Moore's Law (the doubling of the number of transistors per unit area every eighteen months) beyond present technological limitations.  The spatially localized spin excitations in a nanomagnet to be studied in this project possess features that hold great promise for future spintronic applications.  Viscous shock waves that form when a projectile exceeds the speed of sound in air are commonly understood. The dispersive shock waves studied in this project are of a very different type, lacking dissipation and realized as expanding, oscillatory wavetrains.  A fluid experiment will be developed to carefully measure these shock properties while also being used as an educational, outreach, and demonstration tool, providing young mathematicians direct experience with nonlinear waves.  Presentations at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will provide the general public with exposure to this fascinating field."

The nonlinear nature of deformations makes these objects extremely powerful while at the same time making them challenging to estimate and theoretically explore. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The theoretical properties of estimated deformations for generating nonparametric and semiparametric statistical estimates are analyzed through a surprising connection with Stein's method. In addition, the investigator focuses on recent results found in the theory of optimal transport, which has the potential to provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for deformable templates. The computational aspects of estimated deformations will utilize a new Euler-Lagrange characterization of a penalized maximum likelihood estimate, which can significantly relieve the typical computational burden associated with estimation. One consequence will be to make these methods available for widespread use by statistical practitioners in a broad range of problems: nonparametric and semiparametric density estimation, estimating gravitational lensing in cosmology and posterior sampling techniques, to name a few. Another intellectual merit of this proposal are the scientific ramifications of two new proposed deformation estimates of weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): a wavelet/Slepian quadratic estimator and a new Bayesian lensing estimator. Gravitational lensing studies have become one of the most successful tools for probing the nature of dark matter. The precise estimation of lensing is important for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, understanding cosmic structure, constraining cosmological parameters and detecting gravity waves. The investigator proposes to uses wavelets and Slepian multi-tapers to adapt the quadratic estimate to local foreground contaminants and sky cuts, which are ubiquitous features in most modern cosmological surveys. The investigator proposes a new Bayesian estimator which has the potential to dramatically change the way gravitational lensing studies are done and how they are integrated within other astronomical surveys.<br/><br/>Smooth invertible transformations, or deformations, are fast becoming important tools in modern data analysis.  They have been used with spectacular success in the field of computational anatomy where time varying vector field flows which generate deformations are used to statistically analyze medical fMRI images and quantify abnormal morphological structure. In cosmology, deformations are used to model gravitational distortions of the cosmic microwave background from dark matter density fluctuations, and have resulted in a deeper understanding of cosmic structure. Even though these important tools are becoming integrated in modern scientific methods, the statistical properties of estimated deformations have been largely unexplored. This proposal is dedicated to the development and theoretical understanding of deformations applied to three specific areas of research: statistics, cosmology and image analysis. The tools resulting from this project will be useful, not only in statistics, but also in other branches of science and technology ranging from genetics to machine learning. In the field of physics, for example, the potential scientific progress resulting from gravitational lensing estimation could a have broad impact on scientific understanding and the future of scientific research. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly important to train graduate and undergraduate students with the tools necessary to successfully navigate interdisciplinary work, and who are prepared for independent research. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal will foster a culture of collaboration that will reach the fundamentals of statistical education and will deepen ties with statistics and other physical sciences. In addition, through the integration of research and education, the proposal will teach both graduate and undergraduate students research skills. The result will be two fold. First, it will train graduate students to become creative independent researchers who can contribute within an academic environment. Second, it will educate undergraduates to navigate a work environment which values creative independent investigation."

The PI proposes to enhance both the flexibility and the applicability of structured methods. Systematic analysis for the structures and the methods will be included. The following aspects will be studied: (1) theoretical foundations of rank properties and new nested hierarchical structures; (2) new perspectives for exploring matrix structures, such as matrix-free structured sparse factorization, factorization update, and nested localization and sparsification; (3) efficient rank structured matrix algorithms, their analysis, and their use in fast solutions of large linear systems, least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, discretized PDEs, and numerous engineering applications.<br/><br/>Matrix computations lie at the heart of most scientific computation tasks.

Understanding the structures will also provide new perspectives to classical challenges in numerical solutions, such as large fill-in, ill conditioning, lack of explicit matrices, and repeated solutions with highly varying parameters.

The research component will focus on the   theoretical understanding of fluid phenomena. Specifically, these research   efforts outline the study of turbulent transport and scalar intermittency, the   numerical calculation of enhanced burning speeds in premixed combustion,   and theoretical and computational studies of weakly  compressible transport   phenomena. An underlying theme in this effort is the isolation of how fluid   flow properties affect transport phenomena, which may include enhanced   mixing rates, enhanced rare event probability, enhanced burning speeds, and   enhanced anelastic heat transport. These studies involve a sophisticated   integration of modern asymptotic, numerical, and probabilistic techniques.   Additionally, this award will support the continued curriculum development   of an advanced undergraduate/ graduate level Mathematical Fluid Dynamics   course.  Such a course is designed to present the student with the essential   mathematical tools necessary to understand fluid mechanics and to quickly   equip the student with essential techniques for attacking research problems   in Applied Mathematics.  Additionally, a small demonstration fluids   laboratory will be developed to offer visualization of many fluid   phenomena.    This Faculty Early Career Development Award will provide the principal   investigator the opportunity to pursue his research efforts in the   understanding of many fluid transport phenomena while additionally   developing new educational curricula. Developing sound theories for fluid   transport is fundamental in many ways.  The experimental understanding of   fluid turbulence typically involves the tracking of passive dye, and,   consequently, the quantification of how fluid flow properties affect the   mixing of such dye is critical.  Further, the development of sound transport   theories naturally will yield insight into a va riety of mixing applications   such as the tracking of atmospheric pollutants.  Perhaps most importantly is   the potential information such theories may offer to large-scale   computational fluids, combustion and climate models in which a common   difficulty regards how to treat unresolvable length and time scales.  It is an   accepted fact in computational fluid dynamics that important, non-  negligible, complex fluid phenomena exist which are simply not resolvable   on even the largest supercomputers.  These sub-grid effects play a dramatic   role in many fluids applications such as weather prediction. They cannot be   ignored, and a standard approach is to replace them by something simpler--   an effective mixing coefficient.  In many applications, the transport theories   developed here offer sound justification and quantification of these   coefficients, and potentially may offer improvements to existing   computational models.  Finally, the curriculum effort will involve the   development of a small fluids laboratory including a demonstration water   tunnel.  Through this lab, a student studying the theory of fluids will find   exciting visual contact with real fluids phenomena typically unavailable in   mathematics coursework, and this visualization will lead to greater   excitement and appreciation for the usefulness of mathematical theory in the   understanding of observable phenomena.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-  wide  program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the   context of their overall career development.  It combines in a single   program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense   and the full participation of those traditionally underrepresented in science   and engineering.

Despite over two centuries of intensive research and a massive body of results, today partial differential equations on domains are thoroughly understood only when both the coefficients and the domain exhibit smoothness.  However, the dominance of irregularities in real life and numerous problems in modern mathematics demand for an extension of the classical  ""smooth"" theory. Three major directions for this extension pursued by the PI are: (a) the study of boundary problems with rough data on non-smooth domains; (b) the second-order elliptic operators with non-smooth coefficients; (c) elliptic PDEs of higher order. The scope of the proposed work incorporates a full range of sharp well-posedness and regularity results, asymptotic formulas, introduction and analysis of new measures, capacities and new function spaces, numerical experiment, localization phenomena.<br/><br/>Given the ubiquitousness of irregularities in nature and in man-made mechanisms, their understanding is essential to science, engineering, industry, and to society in general. Indeed, most classical models only provide a nice, smooth approximation of the objects and processes. However, perfectly uniform smooth systems do not exist in nature, and every real object inadvertently possesses singularities (a sharp edge of the boundary, an abrupt change of the medium, a defect of the construction). They often have a decisive effect on the occurring phenomena, but cannot be captured in a smooth set-up (e.g., the fractal structure of lungs). The present project combines the mathematical pursuit and a rigorous educational program towards the general goal of advancing analysis of partial differential equation in non-smooth media and preparing a diverse array of mathematicians working in related areas. The latter objective will, in particular, be achieved through a novel Workshop for Women in Analysis and PDE."

This will be done by creating new convergent reaction-diffusion master equation approximations to high dimensional coupled systems of partial integro-differential equations.

Understanding how proteins move about and interact within cells is critical to being able to predict and control these dynamical processes. This project will develop new mathematical equations and computational methods that can be used to study how proteins move about and interact within cells. These methods are designed to facilitate the computer simulation of cellular processes within realistic models of the interior of cells derived from high resolution experimental imaging data.  This project integrates the theoretical work with an educational program designed to improve the training of computational mathematical biologists. This interdisciplinary field requires a synthesis of skills that the project will provide to students in an integrated manner. These skills include the ability to develop mathematical models of biological systems; the ability to understand, and choose, appropriate numerical methods with which to solve these models; and the ability to implement these methods in a manner that takes advantage of existing numerical libraries on large scale computing platforms.

Current EIDs like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) and antibiotic-resistant superbugs have the potential to make devastating impacts on public health. The methodologies under development in this project can be used to translate real-time data on EIDs into recommendations about where, when, and to whom to apply interventions so as to minimize negative impacts of the disease while reducing overall resource consumption. Furthermore, these recommendations are designed to be immediately interpretable in a subject matter context, thereby empowering decision makers to incorporate information from complex and heterogeneous data streams into disease management. Application of these methodologies has the potential to reduce mortality and morbidity at lower cost than existing management plans. Furthermore, models underpinning intervention recommendations will generate new knowledge about EID dynamics. <br/><br/>This research project aims to make fundamental contributions to online sequential decision making and to create a new statistical framework for data-driven management of EIDs. We conceptualize the EID as spreading across a finite set of locations, which might be physical locations in space or nodes in a network. An allocation strategy formalizes management of an EID and is represented by a sequence of functions, one per intervention decision, that map up-to-date information on an EID to a subset of locations recommended for treatment. An optimal allocation strategy maximizes some mean utility function over the duration of the EID. Construction of an optimal allocation strategy from data on an EID is challenging because: (i) the number of allocations is exponential in the number of locations; (ii) estimation and management must occur simultaneously; (iii) spatial proximity induces causal interference; and (iv) an allocation strategy must be interpretable to subject matter experts. We integrate ideas from statistics, computer science, optimization, and disease ecology to overcome these challenges. We combine simulation-optimization with policy-search algorithms to construct an online estimator of the optimal allocation strategy; this strategy trades off exploring allocation choices that improve estimates of disease dynamics with exploiting current estimated dynamics to immediately slow spread of the EID. We show that the treatment allocation problem can be recast as an infinite-dimensional bandit problem. We leverage this connection to derive estimation algorithms that scale to very large allocation problems and are amenable to theoretical study. We combine our policy-search and bandit-based estimators with a novel class of allocation strategies that can be expressed as a sequence of if-then statements that are immediately interpretable to subject-matter experts and can be readily adjusted based on expert judgment. We derive a non-parametric lower bound on the approximation error of an estimated allocation strategy within this class; this bound is used to perform goodness-of-fit tests for the estimated optimal allocation strategy."

The bacterial chromosome is circular and replication invariably results in the formation of interlinked daughter chromosomes. Error-free unlinking is required to ensure proper segregation at cell division and stable plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases unlink replication links. In Escherichia coli, in the absence of topo IV (a type II topoisomerase credited with chromosome unlinking), the site-specific recombination system XerCD mediates sister chromosome unlinking. This reaction is activated at the division septum by a powerful translocase FtsK, which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation. The mechanism by which the XerCD-FtsK complex simplifies the topology of DNA remains unclear. The main objective of the proposed studies is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by the XerCD-FtsK system using knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and computer simulations.  There is evidence that after being activated by FtsK, the enzymes XerCD unlink DNA in a stepwise manner. The tangle method will be used to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by site-specific recombination on small substrates. A computer model of DNA recombination will be developed, adapted to the Xer-FtsK system, and combined with the analytical results to analyze experimental data obtained from the Sherratt lab. The research is highly interdisciplinary and involves close collaboration with groups in Japan, Canada and the UK. Such collaborations will facilitate state-of-the-art student cross-training. Basic information about DNA topology will be disseminated to the general public, including elementary school children and visitors to the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>DNA replication is the basis for biological inheritance. In bacteria, reproduction starts with replication of the chromosome into two identical daughter molecules, followed by segregation of the newly replicated chromosomes and division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. In circular chromosomes, problems of entanglement during DNA linking complicate the process of chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli, DNA unlinking is typically mediated by the enzyme topoIV, which is an important drug target for quinolone antimicrobial agents. Understanding DNA unlinking by Xer recombination, in addition to providing a more complete picture of the chromosome segregation process, is highly relevant for drug design. Mathematical and computational tools are very useful for studying the action of enzymes that change the topology of DNA. In this project such tools will be used to characterize all unlinking pathways and to reveal the mechanism of unlinking by Xer. The educational goal is to develop new and effective ways to disseminate knowledge related to DNA topology and its biological significance, as well as to increase public awareness of the critical role of mathematics in understanding biological processes. The proposed plans include the creation of Math Circles for elementary school children in San Francisco and the development of a series of educational materials for public consumption in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences. This will culminate in the production of an exhibit on DNA topology for the general public in the California Academy of Sciences Museum."

Algebraic geometry has ancient origins with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and number theory. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to robotics and to the analysis of large data sets, and a recent revolution in the foundations of algebraic topology has broadened its applicability to other fields of pure mathematics. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several well-known questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry. Some of these questions will be investigated jointly with students as part of undergraduate research projects in the Mathematical Computing Laboratory at UIC, which the PI founded in 2015 with David Dumas and Jan Verschelde. This integration will provide valuable opportunities for students to engage in research and impact ongoing research.<br/><br/>The PI will work on several projects at the border of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Three projects aim to use various topological methods to understand the Brauer group and Azumaya algebras as well as the role of higher algebraic structures in algebraic geometry. (1) The PI will study (higher) algebraic representatives of tale cohomology classes, generalizing the connection between the Picard and Brauer groups and low-degree cohomology groups. (2) The PI will explore separate applications of motivic homotopy theory and persistent homology to the period-index conjecture with the aim of finding algebraic counterexamples to the conjecture. (3) The PI will explore the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem in characteristic p, specifically focusing on the question of whether or not the local-global spectral sequence for Hochschild homology degenerates at the E_2-page for smooth projective surfaces in characteristic 2."

This interdisciplinary   modeling project will focus on studying and constructing realistic model   mechanisms that capture key biological processes that may be involved in   spatial patterning and showing how they are orchestrated.  Model   applications will include mechanisms for the generation of embryonic   fingerprints.  Particular emphasis will be placed on (i)  development of   analytical and numerical techniques for the solution of model equations,   such as perturbation theory and the use of the level set approach for the   solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations coupled with parabolic   equations, (ii) biological interpretation of the results in terms of insights and   predictions, (iii) model comparisons based on currently known biology, and   (iv) model refinements as they apply to specific biological patterning   problems such as the development of fingerprints.  It is expected that this   work will result in a much better understanding, both mathematically and   biologically, of the mechanical effects of cell traction on cell motion and   cell aggregation within embryonic tissues, and should, therefore, provide   significant insight into how this relatively new mechanical approach to   modeling biological patterns could be used to address pattern formation   problems in developmental biology.  The education component will focus   on an interdisciplinary mathematical modeling curriculum for   undergraduate and beginning graduate students.

The curriculum will consist of two parts:  the first part will be a bridge   between calculus and its applications and it will involve technology in the   classroom.  It is expected that this course will provide the textual material   necessary to support a substantial modeling course.  The second part will be   a sequence that will introduce students to contemporary biomathematical   modeling.  It is expected that this course will cover quantitative topics that   will help life science students deal with the numerical and technical   information they will encounter.

The PI's research uncovers these hidden structures in an area of mathematics known as representation theory which is closely connected to some of the most sophisticated models in theoretical physics.  Following the philosophy that fundamental structures in mathematics should be simple and intuitive the PI utilizes a diagrammatic framework to encode a great deal of complexity into an intuitive diagrammatic language that greatly simplifies computations.  The PI will incorporate this diagrammatic philosophy into transformative educational programs aimed at high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students making the tools of modern research accessible to a new generation of researchers.

More precisely, he will investigate the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series induced from parabolic subgroups. When the degree of the cover is trivial, this reduces to the case of Eisenstein series on linear algebraic groups as studied by Langlands, Shahidi, and others, which have been instrumental in formulating and proving portions of the Langlands program. By studying metaplectic forms in families ranging over all finite covers (including the trivial one), surprising new structure emerges. Brubaker and his collaborators have demonstrated that the resulting Fourier-Whittaker coefficients contain Dirichlet series in several complex variables (so-called ``multiple Dirichlet series'') whose coefficients are described in terms of crystal graphs. These crystal graphs encode information about representations of quantum groups, which are deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. In this situation, the relevant Lie algebra is associated to the Langlands dual group of the group on which one builds the Eisenstein series. The proposal seeks to develop this theory more completely and explore the novel connections it suggests between number theory, quantum groups and combinatorial representation theory. <br/><br/>Langlands' program was initially conceived as a stunning collection of conjectures relating functions with interesting arithmetic properties (e.g., counting the number of integer solutions to an equation) to functions with good analytic properties (e.g., having symmetries and being the solution of a natural differential equation). But similar kinds of duality have been observed in geometry and mathematical physics, leading to geometric and quantum versions of the Langlands programs, respectively.  In short, these dualities have become a lens through which a large portion of modern mathematics and mathematical physics can be organized and understood. However, the explicit underlying mechanisms which relate, for example, arithmetic functions to analytic functions remain largely a mystery. In these projects, Principal Investigator Brubaker with his collaborators and students will use the data provided by the above special examples to attempt to find such a mechanism and attempt to better understand the relationships between various incarnations of the Langlands program in arithmetic, geometry, and physics. An equally important component of the projects is the training of students at all levels by creating a tiered system of mentoring. To bolster these efforts, a set of course materials will be developed to reflect the changing emphasis in modern number theory on analytic techniques, focusing on computational approaches and example-based learning to reinforce concepts"

The  Aalen model incorporates the possibility that both value and contribution  of  covariates may change over time.  Most important, no particular parametric  shape of this time-dependence is assumed.   In the current project, kernel smoothing will be used to estimate the  regression coefficient curves.  A major objective is to develop data-driven  bandwidth selectors, and to investigate their properties.  It is expected that  the resulting methods will improve upon currently used empirical estimates.   Moreover, kernel methods allow one to estimate the regression coefficient  curves themselves, as opposed to cumulative coefficients.  This is  particularly important for graphical data analysis. The new smoothing methods will be implemented in XLISP-STAT, an object- oriented programming language; a user-friendly interface will be provided.   Dynamic graphics will be used to support visual data exploration.  As part of  the project, the developed smoothing procedures will be used to analyze  epidemiological data. On the side of education, the development of a new lecture course on  ``Smoothing Methods in Curve Estimation'' for statistics majors at the M.S. or  Ph.D. level is proposed.  Research results of the current proposal will be  included.  Dynamic graphics software will be used to demonstrate smoothing  techniques in class, thus giving students access to cutting edge technology   An important problem in medicine is to predict the survival of patients,  given their current condition and treatment.  The condition of a patient is  described by ""covariate values"", such as blood cholesterol, blood pressure,  number of antibodies, etc.  A central problem in analyzing survival data is to  assess the influence of covariates;  for example, to quantify by how  much an  elevated level of blood cholesterol increases the risk of stroke. Often the  influence of covariates is known to change with time.  In this case standard  methods tend to fail. The proposed project develops risk estimates based on the Aalen model.  This  model is extremely flexible.  The influence of covariates is allowed to change  over time, without assuming any particular shape of this time-dependence  beforehand.   In this project,  modern smoothing techniques will be adapted to estimate the  influence of covariates.  Smoothing methods are extremely useful for  descriptive data analysis, and widely used in statistics.  In the context of  survival data, however,  the use of corresponding methods is a very recent  development, with many open problems. Part of the project is the user-friendly computational implementation of the  newly developed estimation procedures.  Interactive graphics will be used  extensively to support visual data exploration.  With the provided software,  smoothing methods in Aalen hazard regression will be available for  practitioners for the first time. The new smoothing procedures will be used to analyze epidemiological data. On the side of education, the development of a new lecture course on  ``Smoothing Methods in Curve Estimation'' for statistics majors at the M.S. or  Ph.D. level is proposed.

The research will focus on the theory of near-  integrable systems. These systems are small perturbations of completely   integrable ordinary and partial differential equations or integro-differential   equations. Two areas will be addressed: multi-pulse homoclinic orbits in   low-dimensional systems, and regular and irregular dynamics of the   Maxwell-Bloch integro-partial differential equations that describe ring-  cavity laser optics. The proposed research in the area of multi-pulse   homoclinic orbits is a  continuation of the author's previous work on   unstable resonant systems. It will exhibit several new classes of multi-pulse   orbits in a large family of near-integrable systems, and thus reveal the   intricate phase-space structure of the systems in this family.  This research   will also provide computable methods for verifying the presence of these   complicated homoclinic orbits, and therefore irregular dynamics, in specific   examples.  Applications of these methods in mechanics, fluid and solid   dynamics, and nonlinear optics are also proposed. In the area of the   Maxwell-Bloch equations, the proposed research contains a broad array of   theoretical, computational, and applied questions.  These questions include   finding new explicit solutions of the integrable Maxwell-Bloch equations,   homoclinic orbits and chaotic dynamics, finite-dimensional attractors,   stabilization of the excited states of lasers, numerical simulations of   solutions, and mathematical descriptions of fiber lasers and diode lasers.   Comparisons with realistic physical and engineering applications and   experiments are also proposed.  The education component involves   translating  the author's research experience into a geometric and   dynamical-systems oriented approach to teaching courses in differential   equations on the sophomore, junior-senior, and graduate levels, and   advising  students and involving them in research collaborations with Los   Alamos National Laboratory.    The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early   development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The   Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-  wide program that provides for the support of junior faculty within the   context of their overall career development.

This program enhances and emphasizes the importance   the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic   careers that include both research and education.  The research component   of this project involves intended research that addresses both regular,   mainly time-periodic, and irregular, or chaotic, behavior in two classes of   physical systems in mechanics and laser optics.  The work will focus on   mathematical models that are near-integrable, that is, models whose degree   of approximation is a small step away from making them explicitly   solvable.  By neglecting certain small quantities, these models do become   explicitly solvable, or integrable.  The explicit solutions obtained in this   way may be used to approximate the solutions of the more complicated   near-integrable systems.  The proposed work will thus develop a   mathematical description of the mechanisms behind certain types of   behavior of the physical systems under investigation, such as the irregular   beats in the amplitudes of coupled pendula, and some of the regular and   chaotic  operation regimes of lasers.  Numerical computations will be used   to motivate the  analytical investigations and confirm their findings, as well   as to extend their results to mathematical models that are less simplified and   thus not amenable to either explicit or approximate solution, but are more   phys ically accurate.

The first part of the project involves the development of combinatorial models for semisimple flows that generalize the symbolic description of the geodesic flow on the modular surface given by continued fractions. These models will provide important tools for addressing several open problems in Diophantine approximation, including the famous Littlewood Conjecture, Schmidt's Conjecture (on successive minima of a lattice), and determining the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singular vectors. This part of the project may also involve some numerical studies. The second part of the project focuses on problems related to the ergodic theory of rational billiards. One objective will be to test the validity of the conjectural picture that every nonergodic Teichmuller geodesic arises from a Masur-Smillie-type construction.  Another objective is to understand how the Hausdorff dimension of the set of nonergodic directions depends on the Diophantine properties of the underlying translation surface or rational billiard. The theme unifying the two components of the project is the technique of extracting useful information from the evolution of a discrete subset of Euclidean space under the action of a linear group.  <br/><br/>The approach followed by the principal investigator is inspired by a dynamical systems viewpoint and has already led to breakthroughs in number theory. Further open problems are expected to be solved via this approach. The improved understanding of so-called semisimple flows that will result from the first part of the project can likely be used to develop efficient algorithms for generating rational approximations to irrational vectors and finding short vectors in lattices. These problems are of immense interest to computer scientists for their numerous applications, especially to cryptography. The investigation of nonergodic directions in the second part of the project is motivated in part by the recent discovery (by the principle investigator and his collaborators) of a striking phenomenon known as the ""dichotomy of Hausdorff dimension"" that has never before been observed in the dynamics of billiards (the term ""billiards"" here refers to a mathematical model for a certain type of collision, not to the activity one observes in pool halls). A better understanding of the mechanism that produces this phenomenon may potentially provide the basis for a new model to explain critical phenomena and may be of interest to physicists. On the human resource development side, the project involves the training of graduate students to become research mathematicians."

Because these circuits are so complicated and the details of the circuitry vary from person to person, our understanding of the brain remains limited. In this project the Principal Investigator will study fundamental questions relating circuit structure and dynamics in the brain. One thing we do know about the brain is that neural circuits change, from infancy through young adulthood and into our later years. Some of these changes are part of healthy developmental transitions, such as an infant becoming able to sleep through the night or an adolescent entering puberty; other changes are pathological, such as the loss of a particular group of neurons in the sleep disorder narcolepsy. In close collaboration with laboratory scientists, the Principal Investigator seeks both to characterize these neural changes and to determine the underlying neural mechanisms. She will focus on three areas: (1) puberty, (2) sleep-wake regulation, and (3) systems of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. Changes in the cells of neural circuits can alter the activity of these neurotransmitters, with sometimes profound effects on important human behaviors such as feeding, mood, and social interactions. The Principal Investigator will carry out these investigations by studying mathematical models of different brain circuits, using mathematics that she is developing for this purpose.<br/>Mathematical investigations will include developing the theory of mixed mode oscillations, studying how stochastic dynamics on graphs change as the graph changes, using spectral analysis to understand how graph structure determines the general character of the distribution of absorption times of Markov processes, and developing the theory of doubly stochastic processes. These investigations will give understanding of the normal functioning of particular neural circuits and also help to explain what goes wrong in neuropsychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. The Investigator will use her extensive experience in teaching, recruiting, and mentoring students to design a new pipeline program in Ohio that will encourage students to choose careers in science."

This project concerns the development and implementation of new algorithms for shape optimization of Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids in nearly singular geometries, and for the computation of time-periodic solutions in fluid mechanics.  New adjoint-based optimal control methods will be developed to compute gradients of objective functions and constraints governed by partial differential equations featuring singular integrals, non-local operators, or hysteresis.  The solutions of these optimization and boundary value problems occur in multi-parameter families that will be studied using numerical continuation algorithms capable of identifying bifurcations and following folds in the manifold of solutions.<br/><br/>Shape optimization is fundamental in the design of a wide range of engineering systems such as fuel-efficient vehicles and aircraft or micro-fluidic ""lab on a chip"" devices used in chemistry and molecular biology.  One of the goals of this research is to develop shape optimization techniques for materials that behave partly as viscous fluids and partly as elastic solids.  Applications include designing inkjet printers, recycling and manufacturing plastics, and understanding bio-locomotion in invertebrates.  Another goal of this research is to develop numerical methods for computing solutions of the equations of fluid mechanics that evolve to an exact copy of their initial state at a later time and then repeat themselves forever. These solutions are helpful in understanding complex phenomena such as ocean waves or the onset of turbulence in a pipe.  They should also prove useful in dynamic shape optimization problems, where the goal might be to optimize the average speed over one cycle of a swimming stroke.

The major research goals of this project are to understand the relationship between the two coordinate systems for the moduli space of projective structures and to use this understanding to solve problems in related areas.

Second, the PI will create a new course at UIC for undergraduate mathematics and mathematical computer science majors on ""experimental mathematics"", discussing the way computer software (both custom and off-the-shelf) is used as an exploratory tool in mathematical research.

Statistics, finance, signal processing, physics, and genetics are but some of the areas that have benefited from the injection of randomness into the design of algorithms.  However, existing methods are not without difficulties.  A new class of algorithms called perfect sampling methods solves many of these problems in specific cases, but their applicability is limited.

Other specific areas of the proposed research include computations of important examples of support varieties, constructions of new invariants for small quantum groups, and advances to the theory of modules of constant Jordan type.

Pevtsova is particularly interested in connections with geometry. She has always been fascinated by the beautiful interplay between algebra and geometry that transcends many areas of mathematical research. In her CAREER project,  she seeks to develop a new algebra-geometric connection, building a bridge  between algebraic descriptions of representations which can be presented in terms of matrices and certain geometric invariants which can be thought of as spaces.

Long-standing theoretical questions in the literature include how high dimensionality regularization methods with general penalties can handle, what the role of penalty functions is, and how to characterize the optimality of variable selection procedures. The investigator proposes to study four interrelated research topics. First, the investigator studies penalized likelihood methods with general penalties, which are widely applied for simultaneously selecting important variables and estimating their effects in high dimensional statistical inference, where the dimensionality can be much larger than sample size. Second, various contexts of high dimensional variable selection beyond penalized likelihood methods including penalized empirical risk and hunting for interactions are investigated. Third, the investigator proposes new principles for model selection when models are possibly misspecified and studies the robustness of various regularization methods for high dimensional variable selection under model misspecification. Fourth, the risk properties and optimality of various high dimensional regularization methods in the contexts of penalized least squares and penalized likelihood are further investigated.<br/><br/>The analysis of vast data sets now commonly arises in diverse fields of sciences, engineering and humanities ranging from genomics and health sciences to economics, finance and machine learning. High dimensional data analysis poses numerous challenges to statistical theory, methods and implementations that are not present in smaller scale studies. A major goal of this proposal is to make theoretical and methodological contributions to the important and challenging topic of high dimensional variable selection and statistical inference. These new developments provide unified and systematic understandings of various regularization methods in high dimensions, and allow scientists to analyze high dimensional data with increased efficiency, expediency and interpretability. The proposed work is incorporated into new courses on the state-of-the-art high dimensional statistical learning, and will benefit the training and learning of undergraduates, graduate students, and underrepresented minorities. The proposed work on variable selection in high dimensions will not only help better identify factors that are important to, for example, public health and market risk, but also benefit a broad range of scientists and researchers in various fields.<br/>"

An important goal is to<br/>effectively merge the various approaches, and develop new ways of<br/>thinking about multi-scale problems. To this end, this project focuses<br/>on investigating five interdisciplinary problems, using ideas from<br/>functional analysis, geometry, topology, matched asymptotics and<br/>scaling arguments, in conjunction with numerical simulations. These<br/>problems are (1) Generalized crumpling: Combining functional analytic<br/>methods with geometric/topological ideas to study singularities and<br/>microstructure; (2) Blowup in Parabolic PDEs: Applying Morse theory to<br/>the dynamics of blowup solutions; (3) Dynamics of microstructure:<br/>Studying global bifurcations involving the change of microstructure in<br/>a model system; (4) Pattern formation and non-equilibrium phase<br/>transitions: Investigating multiple scale behaviors in nonlinear<br/>systems in the presence of noise; and (5) Topological transitions in<br/>fluid interfaces: Using tools from PDE to investigate topological<br/>transitions in 2 fluid systems.<br/><br/>Many real world systems are interesting precisely because they exhibit<br/>different behaviors on different scales. This is certainly true for<br/>living organisms, geological and geophysical systems, technologically<br/>important composite materials and even social structures and<br/>hierarchies. Thus researchers across many disciplines grapple with the<br/>following two questions, which are the essence of multiple scale<br/>analysis: (1) How does the large scale (macroscopic) behavior emerge<br/>out of the collective behavior of the small scale (microscopic)<br/>units?, and (2) What are the rules governing the large scale behavior,<br/>and how does this influence the behavior of the small scale units? The<br/>research component of this project studies these questions in a<br/>mathematical setting through problems that arise in material science<br/>and in physics. The overall goal is to meld together a variety of<br/>techniques to develop tools that can successfully handle complex<br/>real-world multiple scale problems. This is combined with an<br/>integrated approach to pedagogy, that features a strong involvement in<br/>undergraduate and graduate research, development of research<br/>opportunities for groups that are under-represented in mathematics and<br/>the physical sciences, curriculum development both at the graduate and<br/>the undergraduate level, and development of materials for scientific<br/>outreach to the general public.<br/><br/>Date: December 17, 2001<br/>"

When the variety in question is the cotangent bundle to a flag variety, then the category that one obtains is equivalent to a block of the ""Category O"" of representations of a Lie algebra, originally introduced by Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand.  For this reason, this category is referred to as ""Geometric Category O"".  This category is conjectured to have many beautiful properties, which have been verified in certain special cases that arise naturally from representation theory and polyhedral geometry.  Chief among these conjectures is that the categories are Koszul, and that each symplectic variety has a ""symplectic dual"" whose associated category is Koszul dual to that of the original variety.  This phenomenon is expected to form a bridge between various approaches to categorification of Lie algebra representations and link invariants that were previously thought to be unrelated.<br/><br/>Symplectic algebraic varieties arise naturally from many different areas of mathematics. Geometric and topological properties of hypertoric varieties have shed new light on the topology of hyperplane arrangements and the combinatorics of matroids. Quiver varieties provide geometric realizations of actions of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, leading to canonical bases and to actions on categories of sheaves. This grant plays a key role in this picture, providing new geometric insight to such phenomena as Gale duality in combinatorics and level-rank duality in representation theory. This project will contribute to each of these endeavors independently, and will also advance a common treatment that unifies our understanding of the various individual phenomena.  In addition to the research component, the grant includes an annual workshop for graduate students and postdocs that bridges these various fields."

In recent years, similar positive algorithms have led to the solutions of many important problems for Type A Grassmannians, including the saturation conjecture and the reality of Schubert calculus. The investigator will also study the effective cones of the moduli space of curves and stable maps. The moduli spaces of curves are among the most studied objects in mathematics. Their cones of effective divisors are important invariants, intimately tied to problems such as the Schottky problem, the Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves, and the existence of modular forms. Recently,  understanding the effective cone of moduli spaces has received new impetus following the seminal work of Hacon, McKernan, and their collaborators on the Minimal Model Program (MMP). The investigator proposes to run MMP on moduli spaces such as the Kontsevich moduli spaces of genus zero stable maps or Hilbert scheme of points on the projective plane. <br/><br/>Systems of polynomial equations occur in many facets of life ranging from evolutionary biology to physics and from cryptography to computer science. Algebraic geometry studies geometric properties of solutions of polynomial systems.  The solutions that have many symmetries are especially interesting and important. For example, a sphere is a perfectly symmetric space in the sense that any point can be rotated to any other point. The investigator studies the number of solutions to polynomial systems involving such perfectly symmetric spaces called homogeneous varieties. The investigator also calculates more subtle geometric invariants of systems of polynomial equations such as how the behavior of the space of solutions changes under perturbations of the system."

Applications of learning methods are ubiquitous: they include systems for face detection and face recognition, prediction of stock markets and weather patterns, learning medical treatment strategies, speech recognition, learning user's search preferences, placement of relevant ads, and much more. As statistical learning methods become an essential part of many computerized systems, new challenges appear. These challenges include large amounts of data, high dimensionality, limited feedback, and a possibility of malicious behavior. All these challenges have a profound impact on (a) the statistical performance and (b) the computation time required to perform the task at hand. Little work exists on studying these two aspects simultaneously, and the goal of this project is to fill this gap. Better understanding of the interaction between Statistics and Computation is likely to lead to faster and more precise methods, thus positively impacting technology and society.

Model selection for semiparametric regression<br/>models consists of two components: model selection (such as choice of<br/>smoothing parameters) for the nonparametric component, and variable selection<br/>for the parametric portion. Traditional variable selection<br/>schemes, such as the stepwise deletion and the best subset variable<br/>selection, could be extended to semiparametric modeling, but they are<br/>expensive in computation since they require the smoothing parameters to<br/>be selected for each submodel. The objectives of this proposal are to<br/>develop new widely applicable model selection procedures for three<br/>classes of semiparametric models which provide a unified framework for<br/>many existing semiparametric regression models in the literature. In this<br/>proposal, the PI (a) studies the asymptotic behaviors of the proposed<br/>estimators, (b) demonstrates how the rate of convergence of the resulting<br/>estimator depends on the regularization parameter, (c) shows that the proposed<br/>procedures perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection<br/>for semiparametric regression models, and (d) addresses issues related to<br/>implementation of the proposed procedures.

Sullivant proposes to exploit the algebra/statistics connection to address a number of problems in algebraic statistics and its applications to evolutionary biology.  In evolutionary biology, Sullivant and his students will study phylogenetic models, which are statistical models for determining the ancestral relationships between a collection of extant species.

On the experimental side, recent developments <br/>in nanotechnology have allowed scientists to follow biological processes on <br/>single-molecule basis, providing scientists with powerful means of studying many <br/>biophysical processes that were inaccessible just a decade ago. This new <br/>frontier also raises significant statistical challenges. It calls upon an <br/>urgent need for stochastic modeling, because many classical models derived <br/>from oversimplified assumption are no longer valid for single-molecule <br/>experiments. Parallel to the experimental progress, the rapid advance of <br/>computing resources and Monte Carlo methods also offers great potential <br/>for biophysical studies, because in most biophysical experiments inference<br/>on the underlying stochastic dynamics is complicated by latent processes, <br/>and many biophysical problems are computing intensive.

(B) Developing data augmentation tools to handle latent <br/>processes in biophysical experiments, where the goal is to use the data <br/>augmentation techniques to augment the hidden processes so as to <br/>efficiently infer from the experimental data the biophysical properties <br/>of interest.

The field of biophysics benefits from these <br/>advances in particular, as the technology advances have allowed scientists <br/>to study many biological processes that were inaccessible just a decade <br/>ago. These advances also raise significant challenges for statistics, <br/>because the unprecedented amount of data brought by the new technology <br/>requires critical statistical analysis.

There are three major issues based on this approach that will be investigated.  One concerns the exploration of the convexity properties of G-closures with the goal of developing new numerical approximations to the elusive set. This approach may lead to the new analytic results in several basic cases, where the G-closure is still not known.  The second issue is to make use of the new formula for effective tensors in terms of the W-transformation of Milton for studying effective behavior of the random media. That formula provides a new series expansion for the fields and effective tensors of the random composites. The new expansion is shown to converge rapidly even for a relatively high contrast media. Finally, we will develop a new and exciting idea of space-time composites proposed recently by Lurie.  The space time composites refer to composites whose electromagnetic properties change rapidly in time.  These temporal oscillations may be a result of high frequency vibrations of the composite specimen or of an active nature of the material itself. <br/><br/>This project's research is centered on the investigation of properties of complex and smart materials.  Examples of such materials include composites (used in spacecraft, airplanes, cars, skies, golf clubs, etc.), random media like rock, clay or bone, novel active materials that are used in sensors and actuators.  This grant provides funding for a variety of research and educational activities that includes a small elasticity demonstration lab. The main purpose of the lab will be to heighten students' interest in mathematics through the inclusion of experiments and demonstrations.  The lab will also facilitate involvement of undergraduates in mathematical research and interdisciplinary interaction throughout the College of Science and Technology at Temple University. The grant will also support a multi-prong applied research program unified by the common mathematical tools used in this research.  One of the goals of this project is the prediction of properties of composite materials. Success in this direction may make it possible to reduce or eliminate expensive and time-consuming measurements of elastic properties of composite materials by providing good theoretical predictions.  Another application is to the study of high-contrast disordered media, of interest in hydrology for prediction of the permeability of large volumes of sedimentary rock based on local measurements.  The permeability is a crucial property of soil that determines how ground water, oil or pollutants propagate underground.  Yet another application is to the novel field of space-time composites: composite materials whose components are in rapid relative motion or whose components have the ability to change their properties rapidly in time without mechanical motion.  The success of this part of the project will be essential for designing and understanding the new generation of smart materials that are able to respond quickly to a changing environment. <br/>"

Our newfound ability to design complex systems (cars, new materials, city infrastructures, etc.) via computer simulations rather than physical experiments has in many fields led to both cost savings and profound improvements in performance. Intense efforts are currently being made to extend these advances to biochemistry, physiology, and several other areas in the biological and medical sciences.<br/>     The goal of the proposed research is to develop faster and more accurate algorithms for computing approximate solutions to a class of mathematical equations called ""partial differential equations"" (PDEs) that lie at the core of models of physical phenomena such as heat transport, deformation of elastic bodies, scattering of electro-magnetic waves, and many others. The task of solving such equations is frequently the most time-consuming part of computational simulations, and is the part that determines which problems can be modeled computationally, and which cannot.<br/>     Technically speaking, most existing numerical algorithms for solving large PDE problems use ""iterative methods,"" which construct a sequence of approximate solutions that gradually approach the exact solution. The proposed research seeks to develop ""direct methods"" for solving many PDEs. Loosely speaking, a direct method computes the unknown data from the given data in one shot. Direct methods are generally preferred to iterative ones since they are more robust, are more suitable for incorporation in general-purpose software, and work for important problems that cannot be solved with known iterative methods. The reason that they are typically not used today is that they are often prohibitively expensive. However, recent results by the PI and other researchers indicate that it is possible to construct direct methods that are competitive in terms of speed with the very fastest known iterative solvers. In fact, in several important applications, the direct methods appear to be one or two orders of magnitude faster than existing iterative methods.<br/>     In addition to constructing faster algorithms, a core goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the capabilities of the new methods by applying them to a number of technologically important problems that are not amenable to existing techniques. These problems include scattering problems at frequencies close to a resonance frequency of the scatterer, modeling of crack propagation in composite materials, and the modeling of large bio-molecules in ionic solutions.<br/>     An integral part of the proposed work is the development of new educational material on computational techniques. Specific goals include: (1) The development of a textbook on so called ""Fast Multipole Methods."" (2) The development of a new graduate-level class on fast algorithms for solving PDEs. (3) The updating of the standard curriculum of undergraduate classes in numerical analysis to reflect new modes of thinking about numerical algorithms (specifically the development of methods that are not ""convergent"" in the classical sense, but that can solve specified tasks to any preset accuracy). This work is to be undertaken in close collaboration with Leslie Greengard at NYU and Vladimir Rokhlin at Yale University."

Population models and epidemiological models will be explored within this framework, complementing other work with lattice-structured populations.  In the models, interactions within a household occur much more often than interactions between different households.  Primary goals of the models are to better understand how and why spatially targeted and/or clustered treatments affect dynamics of infections, for example varying the rates of pesticide application to crop fields based on the levels of insect infestations among those fields.  Factors such as spatially varying resistance (both long-term, due to e.g. mosaic planting of different crops in different fields; and short-term, e.g. as a result of pesticides) will be included in the models.

Certain analytic quantities associated to these holomorphic systems have surprising connections to algebraic constructions.  Examples from this project that illustrate the rich algebraic structures in a complex dynamical setting include:  (1) the study of one-dimensional polynomials by their associated trees and the connection with valuations on the field of regular functions on the moduli space; (2) an analysis of regular self-maps on toric varieties, the resultant of such mappings, and connections with pluri-potential theory; (3) the structure of the moduli spaces of regular self-maps (e.g. of projective spaces) and their ""dynamical"" compactifications (describing how such systems degenerate) as algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>One of the most familiar examples of such a dynamical system is Newton's method, an iterative algorithm for finding roots of polynomials, first introduced in calculus courses.  Even for this famous and seemingly simple example, we have only recently begun to understand its structure, and its failure in general, using modern mathematical techniques.  With Newton's method (its history, its applications, and recent studies) as a guide, I will pursue a collection of educational projects for students:  (1) undergraduate research projects, with an emphasis on computer exploration of examples; (2) the development of an undergraduate course in dynamics, to present both the theory and recent applications; (3) two workshops for graduate students; and (4) regular student seminars.  The research described above is designed to explore the interplay between chaotic dynamical systems (such as Newton's method and its generalizations) and any underlying algebraic structures.  Such structures add an extra element of symmetry or regularity to a system which might otherwise seem intractable.  The experts in these aspects of complex dynamical systems are concentrated in France, England, Japan, and the US (with smaller groups in Chile, Spain, Poland, and Germany, to name a few); with this project, the Principal Investigator will bring together some of these experts to work with students and clarify these connections between algebra and dynamics.<br/>"

The P.I intends to study free boundary problems of interest in flame propagation, and related to Lord Rayleigh's conjecture that among all clamped plates of a given area, the circular one gives the lowest principal frequency. One of the main objectives of the proposed research is to prove regularity properties of the free boundary. Another area of interest is the optimal regularity of the solution and of the free boundary in the subelliptic obstacle problem. The necessary tools from harmonic analysis and PDEs for the study of these problems will be developed concurrently. The P.I. has also a program aimed at developing the regularity theory of minimal surfaces in Carnot groups. Such program entails the study of several basic questions. Among these, we mention the existence and characterization of traces on lower dimensional manifolds of Sobolev or BV functions. This issue is instrumental also in the study of the Neumann problem for sub-Laplacians. In connection with questions arising in geometry, the P.I. intends to develop a regularity theory for subelliptic fully nonlinear equations modeled on the classical<br/>Monge-Ampere operator. This program involves establishing an appropriate version of the celebrated Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci maximum principle, which in turn requires the investigation of a suitable notion of convexity. The P.I. is also interested in studying the method of ``moving spheres"" for so-called Weingarten hypersurfaces, and in its use to prove symmetry properties of solutions to fully nonlinear equations. The P.I. proposes to integrate this research plan with several educational activities. In particular, we mention the organization of an annual Summer Symposium at Purdue University. The P.I. will supervise undergraduate research projects as part of Purdue's REU program. At the K-12 level, the P.I. hopes to hook receptive young minds organizing fun, hands-on mathematics workshops at the local science museum, as well as in the framework of Expanding Your Horizons conferences. To increase the representation of women in the scientific community, the P.I. will also continue mentoring women in science.<br/><br/>Free boundary problems naturally arise in physics and engineering when a conserved quantity or relation changes discontinuously across some value of the variables under consideration. The free boundary appears, for instance, as the interface between a fluid and the air, or water and ice.  One of the proposed projects aims at studying regularity properties of the free boundary in burnt-unburnt mixtures. The results of this investigation will lead to a better understanding of the models, to the improvement of simulation methods, and ultimately to a precise description of how flames propagate in non-homogeneous media. The P.I. has also a research program that lies at the interface of calculus of variations, partial differential equations, and geometric measure theory. The focus is on the study of analytic and geometric properties of solutions to variational inequalities and PDEs involving a system of non-commuting vector fields. The problems described in the proposal not only arise in a variety of mathematical context (e.g. optimal control theory, mathematical finance, and geometry), but are also of interest in other fields such as mechanical engineering and robotics. The P.I. is committed to the training of future generations of mathematicians, and to increasing the representation of women in the scientific community, via the organization of a variety of educational activities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students.  <br/>"

The primary focus is on constructing, extending and optimizing rigorous numerical techniques and investigating additional settings where computational topology may be used effectively to measure dynamical systems.  When possible, the computational results are verified rigorously, typically through the incorporation of error bounds and the use of topological tools.  The proposed projects include extending existing techniques for computer-assisted studies and proofs for discrete time dynamical systems and forcing theorems for braided stationary solutions.  Two more sets of projects are proposed in areas where the desired rigorous results are still out of reach, although some initial progress has been made.  These include measuring parameter sets for systems in a specified family which exhibit chaotic behavior, and the study of spatial and spatio-temporal pattern formation and evolution using computational homology.  There are many open research projects in these areas (both shorter and longer term) including the study of some very interesting and fundamental modeling questions concerning appropriate spatial and other scales in models.  This grant will fund a teacher-researcher postdoctoral position, undergraduate research projects, and support teaching and research group activities.<br/><br/><br/>Dynamical systems models are being used throughout society.  Some examples include weather models used for hurricane prediction and population models used to study environmental effects on population size and persistence.  Currently, many researchers study dynamical systems like these using high powered computer simulations and statistical techniques.  On the other end of the spectrum, mathematicians have been able to decipher highly complicated dynamics in more abstract mathematical models.  The work described in this proposal aims to serve as a bridge between these two approaches.  More specifically, the investigator and her collaborators focus on the development of computational techniques that use sophisticated mathematical tools and yield mathematically rigorous results.  The mathematical tools come from the fields of algebraic topology, analysis, numerical analysis, and dynamical systems theory and may be used to decipher some of the phenomena of interest in the studied systems.  Prior progress in studying complicated dynamics in models from population ecology and heat convection motivates these continued studies.  In addition to continuing work with existing collaborators, the investigator will mentor a postdoctoral teacher-researcher and advise undergraduate research projects in these areas."

This is equivalent to understanding sets of homomorphisms between a pair of discrete groups (the domain representing the equations and the target the group of interest).  The first half of this project is motivated by the theory of S-bundles, where S is a compact orientable surface.  Surface bundles arise throughout pure mathematics.  If B is a manifold (or other reasonable space), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes  (oriented) of S-bundles over B and the set of (conjugacy classes of) homomorphisms from the fundamental group of B to the mapping class group of S.  The PI intends to develop a general structure theory for this set when the fundamental group of B is finitely  generated (which will always happen when B is compact, for example).  In the second half of this project (joint work with H, Wilton), we study homomorphisms to free (and more generally torsion-free hyperbolic) groups.  Broadly speaking, this is the class of `negatively-curved' groups.  This study is motivated by the first-order logic of these groups.  It is quite remarkable that the geometry of negative curvature has profound implications for first-order logic.  We intend to study these first-order theories from an algorithmic point of view, and find general decision processes which determine if a logical sentence is true or false.      Groups form a natural language for studying symmetries of mathematical objects.  As such, they arise throughout mathematics, and their study is informed by many branches of mathematics.  There are very few basic properties of a `symmetry', the most important of which is that it doesn't lose any information about the space, so it can be undone.  In this project, we treat the groups as objects of intrinsic interest, although the questions that we ask take their motivation from topology, geometry, logic and computer science as well as from within group theory.  Broadly speaking, we take a collection of equations over a group G, and try to understand the set of all solutions to these equations.  In the first half of the project, the group G is the mapping class group of a surface, which captures much of the symmetry of a surface (a space which looks like the plane in small sets).  Studying equations over the mapping class group is of fundamental interest in geometry and topology, through the study of surface bundles (a space which nearby any point decomposes into a pair of smaller sets, one of which is a surface).  The study of equations over the mapping class group gives a general theory parametrizing surface bundles.  The second half of this project studies equations over groups from the point of view of logic, and looks for general algorithms which decide if logical sentences are true of false.    This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Foundations Program."

This is the emerging technology of compressed sensing (CS). In this research, the PI proposes to study a broad range of issues and techniques to advance CS. His proposed reseach includes the introduction of new methodolgies for exploiting solution sparsity to accelerate CS computation, the development of algorithms that utilize operations requiring low storage and maintain robustness to noise and errors in data, and the discovery of efficient methods for minimizing the l1-norms of wide classes of functions such as first and higher-order differences. This project will include an integrated educational program involving a new course, one Ph.D. student, and the participation in the Rice-Houston AGEP program in producing competitive women and minority graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The new emerging technology of ""compressed sensing"" is a complement to traditional data compression. While the traditional technology encodes digital data using fewer bits in order to save storage and transmission time, the new technology can significantly reduce the time, energy, and cost associated with the acquisition of digital data. This is achieved by acquiring digit information of an object of interest from a reduced number of obervations than what is usually necessary. For example, the life of an aeriel such as a space telescope can be greatly extended due to a lower sampling rate (and thus a lower power demand). Hyperspectral and infrared imaging devices can produce the same images with smaller sensors, or if with the same sensors, images at higher resolution. As such, the new technology can lead to breakthroughs for applications where the bottleneck lies in the high cost of data acquisition.<br/>"

The<br/>proposed shearlet approach encompasses the mathematical framework<br/>of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to<br/>combine optimal sparsity (few coefficients to compute), fast<br/>transforms through the power of multiresolution analysis (fast<br/>computation) and full mathematical justification and framework<br/>(great flexibility and versatility).  The sparsity of the<br/>proposed shearlet representation is a direct consequence of its<br/>genuinely multidimensional multiscale character, and its fast<br/>implementation a consequence of its affine mathematical<br/>structure.  The project is organized into three main directions<br/>of investigation, with several specific goals.  First, the<br/>mathematical framework underpinning the shearlets is investigated<br/>to set the foundation for the construction and analysis of<br/>optimally sparse multidimensional representations.  Next these<br/>representations are applied to the decomposition of functions<br/>spaces and operators.  More specifically, the shearlets are used<br/>as building blocks of anisotropic function spaces.  This step has<br/>significant implications in approximation theory, in the study of<br/>Fourier integral operators, and for various nonstandard<br/>regularity spaces associated to partial differential equations. <br/>Third, shearlets are applied to problems from image processing<br/>and image analysis.  Specifically, improved algorithmic<br/>implementations are developed and applied to image denoising,<br/>edge detection and shape recognition.  Tests are conducted on<br/>biomedical data to address specific application-driven problems,<br/>including geometric reconstruction of neuronal morphology from<br/>confocal images and neuronal classification. <br/><br/>Over the past twenty years, multiscale methods and wavelets have<br/>revolutionized signal processing and stimulated an impressive<br/>amount of research in mathematics and engineering.  In fact,<br/>wavelets provide optimally efficient representations of<br/>one-dimensional data and have fast numerical implementations.  As<br/>a result, wavelets are successfully employed in a number of<br/>strategic applications, including the new FBI fingerprint<br/>database and JPEG-2000, the new standard for image compression. <br/>In spite of their remarkable success, wavelets are far from being<br/>optimal in general.  Even though they outperform other<br/>traditional methods, they fail to capture intrinsic geometrical<br/>features of multidimensional phenomena.  For instance, they do<br/>poorly at dealing with features such as the edges of an image or<br/>the boundary surfaces of a solid object, and, as a consequence,<br/>they are unable to handle efficiently the ever larger<br/>multidimensional data sets which are required by many modern<br/>applications.  By contrast, the approach addressed in this<br/>project is truly multidimensional and opens the door to a new<br/>generation of highly efficient methods for the storage,<br/>transmission and processing of data.  The applications arising<br/>from this research facilitate technological advances in sensitive<br/>applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data<br/>transmission and classifications, video surveillance, and storage<br/>of data. <br/>"

Many procedures have been <br/>(and will be) proposed for nonparametric regression based on<br/>different assumptions.

This is specially the case for high-dimensional function<br/>estimation, where to overcome the curse of dimensionality, various <br/>parsimonious models such as projection pursuit, CART, neural nets, <br/>additive models, MARS, etc. are proposed according to different <br/>characterizations of the target function. A main interest in this <br/>research is to construct adaptive estimators by combining a<br/>collection of candidate procedures. The goal for the combined<br/>procedure is to perform automatically as well as (or nearly as well<br/>as) the best original procedure without knowing which one it is.  <br/>The random errors will be assumed to be generally dependent,<br/>including both short- and long-range cases. The effects of<br/>dependence on adaptation capability will be studied. It is<br/>anticipated that theoretically proven and computationally feasible <br/>algorithms will be proposed to combine regression procedures<br/>targeted at various characteristics of the regression function and <br/>different dependence structures for the random errors.<br/><br/>Function estimation is an important statistical tool that tries to<br/>understand accurately the functional relationships between variables based on <br/>data and it has applications in many disciplines for successfully  <br/>addressing scientific questions. In reality, observations are always<br/>subject to random noise (error) from different sources. When the<br/>random errors are dependent on each other, the dependence may<br/>disguise the functional relationship of interest. Long-range<br/>dependence refers to a situation where the errors are still highly<br/>correlated even when they occur at times or locations that are far<br/>away from each other. It is known that such a long-range dependence makes<br/>the estimation of the target function much harder. In applications,<br/>the degree of dependence between the errors is usually unknown,<br/>which makes the function estimation problem even harder. In this<br/>proposal, we intend to develop methods that adaptively handle<br/>different degrees of dependence among the errors so that the<br/>function of interest can be estimated optimally without knowing the<br/>dependence structure of the errors. The research results and related<br/>work by others on long-range dependent data will be brought to<br/>students at various levels in several statistics<br/>courses. Collaborations will be conducted with several professors at<br/>Iowa State University and their students in atmospheric science, <br/>electrical engineering, agronomy and possibly other fields to<br/>appropriately address long-range dependence phenomena, which have<br/>been encountered often and known to cause problems in data analysis <br/>with the existing statistical methods. <br/>"

The interaction of large populations of neurons leads to a complex repertoire of high-dimensional activity patterns that is difficult to analyze.  The dimension of the space of connectivity patterns among neurons is likewise astronomical.  To understand the behavior of neuronal networks, one would like to analyze the relationship between these connectivity patterns and neuronal activity.  This project will develop an analytical approach to distill both network connectivity and activity down to first and second order statistics.  This simplified framework will facilitate studying the relationships between key features of connectivity and activity.  The project centers around a kinetic theory framework to represent populations of neurons by capturing the first and second order statistics among the states of neurons.  The evolution of the kinetic theory equations will be determined by the first and second order statistics of the connectivity.  An approach to estimating these first and second order connectivity statistics from experimental data will link the analysis with biological networks.<br/><br/>The central objective of this project is the development of mathematical tools to analyze the interrelationships between simplified descriptions of neuronal network connectivity and simplified descriptions of neuronal activity.  When linked with experimental data, the analysis may provide insight into the behavior of the neuronal networks underlying the brain's computations.  As this research may provide tools that help scientists better understand the effects of the degradation of neural connections, such as in neurodegenerative disease, it may eventually lead to strategies to mitigate or reverse these effects. Integrated into the project is interdisciplinary training in conjunction with the research as well as a plan to help young people discover exciting ways of applying mathematics to biology, with the goal of inspiring them to pursue further applications of mathematics to biology and other sciences."

The corresponding molecular mechanisms are best characterized for the replication control genes of plasmids in Escherichia coli that face selection at two distinct levels: plasmid copies that systematically over-replicate relative to their cellmates have a higher chance of fixing in descendent cells, but these cells typically have a lower chance of fixing in the population. To analyze the conflict, the mathematical frameworks for multi-scale selection and drift in cells will be extended, focusing on conflict suppression mechanisms, meta-control of selfishness, and how cooperation is prevented by clonal interference.  In addition, an experimental platform will be developed to test how different conditions select for altruism or selfishness, and monitor the dynamics of the conflict by mapping arising mutations to the known control systems. <br/><br/>All social elements--from microorganisms to humans--can benefit from both cooperation and selfishness, and the most successful behavior depends on the parameters of the social scene. The investigators have identified a clean-cut conflict between selfish and altruistic elements in one of the simplest and best studied processes in bacterial cells: Self-replicating pieces of DNA get an immediate advantage by selfishly over-reproducing, but then instead indirectly suffer because they impose a larger burden on the cells upon which they rely. Because other aspects of this system are so well-studied, this provides a unique opportunity to rigorously analyze a complex phenomenon like cooperation in terms of molecular mechanisms and physical chemistry.   General rules for such conflicts will be mathematically derived and experimentally tested, determining conditions for altruistic behavior and identifying mechanisms that enhance or suppress selfishness. By focusing on testable theorems and broad intuitive principles, the results are equally important for education and research."

In the first project, the investigator and his<br/>colleagues will continue their investigation of well-known conjectures<br/>on distribution of rational points and distribution of discriminants<br/>of number fields.  In the second project, the investigator will study<br/>the arithmetic of towers of curves; rational points in such towers<br/>seem to be intimately related with objects of non-abelian Iwasawa<br/>theory, a subject which has enjoyed an explosion of interest in the<br/>last five years.  The proposed projects will involve a great deal of<br/>collaboration with researchers from every part of number theory and<br/>algebraic geometry, and should provide many opportunities for graduate<br/>students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>The foundational problem of number theory is this: find all solutions<br/>in rational numbers to an equation.  For instance, one can ask for<br/>solutions of the Pythagorean equation: for which rational numbers x,y,<br/>and z is it the case that the square of x plus the square of y equals<br/>the square of z?  The Pythagorean equation has been well-understood<br/>for centuries; but many others, like Fermat's equation, present -- to<br/>say the least! -- more serious difficulties, and most equations are<br/>presently beyond our current ability to analyze.

The<br/>investigator proposes several research projects in the area of<br/>rational points.

However, a key difficulty with nonparametric models is model fitting for high dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality. Another difficulty is model inference and interpretation, i.e., how to evaluate or test individual variable effects on the complex surface fit. For heterogeneous data with complicated covariance structure, nonparametric model estimation is even more challenging. The objectives of this proposal are to develop novel and widely applicable procedures to simultaneous model selection and estimation for nonparametric models and their related paradigms in data mining. In the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the PI proposes a host of new regularization techniques for several families of models: smoothing spline ANOVA models for correlated data, semiparametric regression models, support vector machines for supervised and semi-supervised learning. The proposed methodologies constitute key advances over standard methods through their unified framework for achieving model sparsity and function smoothing altogether, their tractable theoretical properties, and their easy adaptation to high dimensional problems. The PI will study asymptotic behaviors of the proposed estimators, explore data-driven procedures for tuning regularization parameters, and develop computation algorithms and softwares to implement the proposed procedures. The PI will also examine finite sample performance of new methods via extensive simulation studies and real data analysis.<br/><br/>In the current information era, the volume and complexity of scientific and industrial databases have been exponentially expanding. As a consequence, the data form keeps gaining higher and higher dimensionality. Analysis of such data poses new challenges to statisticians and is becoming one of the most important research topics in modern statistics. The purpose of this project is to significantly increase the available tools for analyzing complex high dimensional data. In this project, the PI aims to accomplish the following three goals: (1) meet the challenges of nonparametric model estimation and selection within a unified mathematical framework; (2) develop flexible methods with desired statistical properties and high-performance statistical softwares for mining massive data; (3) integrate research opportunities and findings from the above two activities into disciplinary and interdisciplinary statistical education at graduate, undergraduate and high school levels. This research will broaden traditional understanding of nonparametric inferences <br/>and model selection, provide a broad range of researchers and practitioners in various fields including sociology, economics, environmental, biological and medical sciences with state-of-the-art data analysis tools, and help to prepare the next-generation students with the necessary modern statistical perspectives. <br/> <br/>"

The considered problems are nonlinear variational<br/>or partial differential equations, and the degeneracy in question<br/>can take various forms: loss of dimension, loss of regularity, or<br/>unboundedness.  The first set of questions relates to the<br/>mathematical theory of nonlinear elasticity, which studies large<br/>mechanical deformations of three-dimensional elastic bodies.  The<br/>investigator undertakes a long-term research program, with the<br/>scope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell theories through the<br/>methods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their connections<br/>with the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the<br/>(infinitesimal) isometries of surfaces and the effects of<br/>rigidity on the derived theories, studying nonlinear phenomena<br/>such as buckling and blistering for a given shell under<br/>compression (one application is related to plant growth).

A related long-standing<br/>problem in the mathematical theory of elasticity is to rigorously<br/>predict theories of such lower-dimensional objects starting from<br/>the nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.  For<br/>plates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification<br/>of a hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of<br/>the applied forces and resulting in stretching, crumpling,<br/>bending, or a combination of these.

(2) Determine rigidity properties of the birational geometric structure of certain class of projective Fano hypersurfaces, and use variations of these properties to introduce a new point of view in measuring various degrees of non-rationality. (3) Study different aspects concerning the behavior of curves on Fano varieties, especially in  connection to the deformations of the variety and within the context of the minimal model program: expected deformation properties, if satisfied, would bring to light a rather surprising rigidity nature of Fano varieties. Other more speculative projects, notably one regarding a possible connections between Shokurov's ACC Conjecture and resolution of singularities via normalized Nash blow-ups, and one on the behavior of the Cox ring in families of Fano varieties, are outlined throughout the proposal.<br/><br/>The minimal model program, the main program geared towards the birational classification of algebraic varieties, is the general framework of the proposed research.

The existence of<br/>iterable models for specific large cardinals can be used to yield the<br/>determinacy of games of specific lengths, with increasing length<br/>corresponding to increasing large cardinal strength. These games in turn<br/>can be used to decide statements over minimal inner models for large<br/>cardinals. The PI is attempting to extend this correspondence, the first<br/>main test case being open games of length omega one. 2 - The study of<br/>Woodin cardinals leads naturally to a transfinite game known as the<br/>iteration game. Winning strategies (""iteration strategies"") for the good<br/>player in this game are essential to the comparison process that lies at<br/>the heart of inner model theory. Proving that iteration strategies exist<br/>is the single most important problem in the field. The PI has been working<br/>on this problem, contributing to the existing pool of partial results.<br/>Several problems, related to the general problem of iterability but<br/>specialized and more concrete, are investigated as part of this project.<br/>This investigation should provide increased understanding of the main<br/>problem, and hopefully lead to additional partial results. 3 - The PI is<br/>working to solidify the connections between large cardinals and definable<br/>sets of real numbers. Extensive work, much of it done during the '70s and<br/>'80s, provides a detailed analysis of definable sets of reals assuming<br/>determinacy. Later work obtained determinacy from large cardinals. The PI<br/>is working to emulate the existing analysis of definable sets of reals,<br/>working directly from large cardinals. The point here is to try to convert<br/>methods used in the study of definable sets of reals, into methods which<br/>can be used in inner model theory and the study of large cardinals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Set Theory is a branch of Mathematics which attempts to understand the<br/>universe of Mathematics, that is the collection of all objects studied by<br/>Mathematicians, or more precisely the collection of all _sets_. (Numbers,<br/>groups, functions, etc., can all be represented as sets.)  Set Theorists<br/>view this universe as a structure in its own right, a structure which can<br/>itself be analyzed using mathematical reasoning. For example, a Set<br/>Theorist may ask ""is there an embedding of the universe into a similar,<br/>yet not identical, structure?"" Set Theorists work with such embeddings<br/>(""elementary embeddings"") in much the same way that one would work with<br/>functions on numbers, asking ""how similar is the target structure to the<br/>original structure?"" and ""what's the smallest size of a set actually moved<br/>by the embedding?"" Such questions about embeddings of the universe form a<br/>subfield of Set Theory known as the study of large cardinals. The<br/>terminology here hints at the answer to the last question mentioned.<br/>Indeed, the sets actually moved by elementary embeddings are substantially<br/>larger than any object studied in other branches of Mathematics<br/>(substantially larger than the set of real numbers for example). Yet it<br/>turns out that the existence of elementary embeddings has concrete effects<br/>on lower level objects, including concrete effects on real numbers. This<br/>project is part of the on-going effort to better understand large<br/>cardinals, and better understand their effects on the line of real<br/>numbers. The PI, like other researchers in the field, is motivated by the<br/>connection between the abstract and the concrete.<br/>"

The primary questions include existence and stability of stationary solutions in response to a constant or periodically varying input. The proposal also has an educational component; see below.<br/><br/>Traditionally, many physical systems are modeled with a diffusion process. It is often the case that the medium in which the diffusion occurs possesses certain inhomogeneities (e.g. an electron moving in an allow, waves diffusing in rocks underground, etc). The inclusion of this property makes the model far more realistic and reveals a wide variety of new effects, not present in constant or periodic media.  The main goal of the PI's work is to further the<br/>understanding of the consequences of this disorder in the medium.   <br/>Another part of the PI's research stems from his belief in the need for a stronger involvement of mathematical sciences in the explosive growth of biological research.

A recent technique for analyzing a class of such networks allows to view the population dynamics as a certain diffusion process. The PI proposes to extend this technique to a wider class of neuronal models, including a feedback (adaptation) mechanism.  The results will be applied to specific neurobiological problems, such as localization of moving sound sources and contrast adaptation in vision.  The third component in the proposal is educational.

(1) Make significant advances toward the classification of the knot concordance group.  In particular, classify the successive quotients of its  (n)-solvable filtration and find new structure in the group.

From cancer treatments based on the knotting of cellular DNA, to antiviral drugs based on the geometrical shapes of proteins, to non-invasive visualization of the shape of the heart, to contemplating the ``shape'' of space-time itself, we seek precise mathematical descriptions of 3-dimensional objects. When one thinks of a precise mathematical description, one often thinks in terms of numbers, but ordinary numbers are insufficient to capture the complexities of our world.  Multiplication of ordinary numbers is ``commutative.''  However, the physics of the twentieth century has taught us that matter and energy cannot be described merely by numbers. Rather, vectors and matrices are required, and multiplication of matrices is not commutative, that is AB does not usually equal BA.  Every physical interaction is thus based on noncommutative algebra.  This project is investigating how this noncommutative algebra yields a mathematical description of the geometric structure of 3-dimensional space and of objects in 3- dimensional space.  Of particular importance is the manner in which closed strings in 3-dimensional space are knotted in 3- and in 4- dimensions.  The PI will use non-commutative mathematical objects to better understand the knotting of strings and 3-dimensional spaces in general."

In particular, geometric mechanics is characterized by the application of symmetry and differential geometric techniques to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and geometric integration is concerned with the construction of numerical methods with geometric invariant and equivariant properties. Computational geometric mechanics blends these fields, and uses a self-consistent discretization of geometry and mechanics to systematically construct geometric structure-preserving numerical schemes. The proposed research will combine theoretical and computational tools arising from Dirac mechanics and geometry, noncommutative harmonic analysis, and uncertainty quantification to dramatically extend the applicability of computational geometric mechanics and geometric control to engineering problems that evolve intrinsically on nonlinear spaces, such as Lie groups and homogeneous spaces. This will provide insights into the canonical discretization of Dirac constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and interconnected systems. In addition, the study of uncertainty in the context of geometric control will improve the robustness and reliability of the resulting numerical and computational tools.<br/><br/>This research will improve our ability to control interconnected systems of autonomous vehicles in a robust and efficient fashion, by explicitly taking into account the uncertainty inherent in our knowledge of the surrounding environment. Our results will be applicable to the control of distributed sensor networks, consisting of an interconnected set of satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and underwater vehicles. Such sensor networks are an exciting new development in the field of remote sensing that has the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency, coverage, and reliability of the information we obtain about our oceans, environment, and climate.  <br/>More broadly, most complex engineering systems can be expressed as an interconnected system of more elementary components, and our mathematical framework will allow us to more readily understand complex systems in terms of the behavior of its component parts and the manner in which they are interconnected.<br/>"

This activity centers on the Wyoming Applied Analysis & Computing Group, a team consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, University of Wyoming faculty, and faculty from Wyoming's network of community colleges. <br/><br/>Nonlinear partial differential equations arise generically in mathematical models of physical phenomena.  However, a broad understanding of their properties remains a fundamental challenge in pure and applied mathematics. The differential equations that are the focus of this research are physically motivated, and their features (nonlinearity, multiple space dimensions, multiple scales) represent some of the central challenges in the analysis of such equations.  The research agenda includes investigation of a recent conjecture about the formation of violent oscillations in the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation; this conjecture is part of an emerging belief that the formation of these oscillations may have a universal character.  The validation of the appearance of such universal behavior in differential equations is certain to drive a wave of new developments in the analysis of nonlinear phenomena.  On a mathematical level, the plan of attack is based on a broad array of analytical techniques, including Evans functions, singular perturbations, dynamical systems, spectral theory for linear operators, complex analysis, and numerical analysis.  The anticipated results, if achieved, have the potential to make an impact on applications and other areas of mathematics.  One of the research projects aims to extend the asymptotic analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems arising in the analysis of integrable partial differential equations; such extensions are expected to be useful in the seemingly unrelated analysis of orthogonal polynomials and random matrices.<br/><br/>The breadth of mathematical tools required by the research agenda ensures that the Wyoming Applied Analysis & Computing Group will serve as an ideal training ground in applied analysis and computation for the next generation of researchers and students.  In addition to collective work on the research agenda, the group will host an annual two-week immersion into research activities for select community-college faculty.  Additionally, the group's activities will include participation in the annual ""articulation conferences"" that are held to connect the math and science departments at the University of Wyoming with those at Wyoming's seven community colleges.  These activities will strengthen the mathematical network across the state.  The group's recruitment and training strategy is partially based on the development of a novel calculus course that treats numerical methods as an intrinsic part of calculus.  The course prepares students to participate in the group at an early stage of their careers. <br/>"

I am interested in classes of groups that arise as symmetries of geometric objects, such as tripodal spaces.<br/>Understanding something about the geometry of these objects often can be translated into algebraic information about the group. I plan to develop tools from algebra and analysis to study tripodal geometry, with a particular emphasis on understanding geometric properties which only become apparent on a large scale.<br/>"

Many of the<br/>connections between topology and contact geometry are mediated by<br/>Legendrian knots (these are knots that are tangent to a contact<br/>structure), thus the first main theme of the proposed research is<br/>Legendrian knots. As part of this proposal the general structure<br/>of Legendrian knots will be studied. The expected outcome will be<br/>various classification results for certainLegendrian knots and contact<br/>structures; and, moreover, a betterunderstanding of Legendrian surgery<br/>(an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian <br/>knots in higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology.<br/>There is very little known about contactstructures, or Legendrian knots,<br/>in dimensions above three. By investigating  Legendrian knots in these <br/>dimensions the nature of contactstructures should be illuminated, just<br/>as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact<br/>structures. The final part of the proposed research centers on the <br/>connection between contact structures and hydrodynamics discovered a few<br/>years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. Here work with<br/>Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, <br/>closed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic<br/>instability from the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads<br/>into the study of energy minimization for fluid flows and relations between<br/>contact and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/>Contact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries <br/>ago,in the study of geometric optics and partial differential equations.<br/>Through the centuries contactstructures have touched on many diverse areas<br/>of mathematics and physics,including classical mechanics and thermodynamics.<br/>In everyday life oneencounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel <br/>parking a car,using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play <br/>of light ina glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of <br/>their work to this subject  but only in the last decade or two has it moved<br/>into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance is due to the recent<br/>remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and<br/>beautiful theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of<br/>all this recent work is the intimate connections between contact<br/>structures and topology in dimension three. Thus by studying this abstract<br/>notion of a contact structure one can learn many subtle things about the<br/>universe in which we live. For example, the study of contact geometry<br/>has recently lead to some unexpected advances in our understanding of<br/>the flow of idealized fluids. The Principal Investigator will explore<br/>connections between contact structures and topology in all (odd)<br/>dimensions, continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics)<br/>via contact geometry and analyze intriguing new conjectures concerning<br/>string theory and contact geometry. The Principal Investigator will<br/>also engage in several educational endeavors, including the support and<br/>encouragement of graduates students and the creation of introductory<br/>and survey materials to bring the rapidly developing field of contact<br/>geometry to a wider audience.<br/><br/><br/>"

It is based on the PI's recent successful efforts to create a numerical approach for the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict linear response of a nonlinear chaotic forced-dissipative dynamical system to an external perturbation with improved skill, based on a precise geometric response formula for systems with chaotic attractors. While the method developed is observed to perform well for relatively simple dynamical systems, complex realistic climate models are more computationally expensive, have nonlinear interactions on multiple scales, and sometimes include stochastically parameterized processes. Here the PI proposes several numerical strategies to adapt the new approach for complex multiscale nonlinear forced-dissipative, and, possibly, stochastically parameterized dynamical systems with many variables and highly non-Gaussian equilibrium state, as well as reduce its computational cost. Successful implementation of proposed algorithms should help create a novel computational framework for global climate change prediction. The proposal also suggests development of a set of graduate-level courses with strong emphasis on the basic subjects of chaotic nonlinear dynamics, atmospheric and oceanic physics, and computational weather and climate prediction, which are the key topics needed to become an interdisciplinary weather and climate research scientist. These courses will give graduate students an opportunity to interact directly with the PI's research and learn a variety of advanced theoretical approaches and numerical methods directly from the PI through graduate advising.<br/><br/><br/>The ability of the linear fluctuation-dissipation approach to identify the ranges of parameter perturbations which produce catastrophic climate response can be helpful in determining potentially harmful types of anthropogenic intervention into the Earth's global climate cycle. This data may provide additional information to help define economic, political and legislative initiatives to preserve our environment and to develop advanced technologies for more reliable environmentally-friendly renewable power systems. In addition, such an approach is also suitable for the inverse climate change problem, where the geological evidence of past climate changes is used to compute the range of physical forcing parameters which triggered these climate changes, which can help to determine the cause of these climate changes on the planetary scale.  The set of courses under the PI's development may potentially evolve into a consistent interdisciplinary educational program on the graduate level to train future climate and weather research scientists with heavy mathematical and computational bias, which could eventually be adopted as a basic educational standard for climate and weather research. Implementation of this program will reduce the burden on national weather and climate research centers and laboratories which currently spend substantial efforts on the training of their employees at the postdoctoral level."

The theoretical problems are concerned with spectral properties of large dimensional random matrices. More precisely, four of the main objectives of the program are: 1) further develop new covariance estimation methods;  2) further our understanding of the spectral properties of relevant large random matrices; 3) find and contribute to areas of application where this high-dimensional statistics framework is relevant; 4) train graduate students in high-dimensional statistics and make undergraduate students at least aware of possible pitfalls of classical methods and of better alternatives when available. More specifically, statisticians are now often faced with ""n by p"" data matrices X, for which p, the number of variables recorded per observations, is of the same order of magnitude as n, the number of recorded observations, and p and n are both large. The sample   covariance matrix computed from this data is of great importance to a number of applications, as it underlies widely used methods like principal components analysis. However, the theoretical results which underlie the method, classically developed in the ""small p and large n"" setting, fail to apply in the ""large n and large p"" setting just described. Hence, a thorough study of sample covariance matrices in this setting is needed. Eigenvalues of such large dimensional matrices are of particular interest. The investigator plans to launch a multi-pronged effort to get at various kinds of properties of these objects: for instance, he plans to develop theoretical results that will allow inferential work to be done from computation of extreme eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices, develop new methods of estimation of the whole covariance matrix, and also work on the impact of naively plugging-in the sample covariance matrix as a proxy for the population covariance in certain optimization problems which depend on this latter parameter. An effort will be made to try and apply this theoretical work to real-world problems, both to raise awareness in applied communities about the pitfalls associated with high-dimensional covariance matrices, and to shape the models that will be studied to be of most relevance to applied researchers.<br/><br/>Technological progress allows us to store and use massive amounts of data about many aspects of our daily lives. An interesting problem is to use the data to understand how certain traits depend on each other. In the stock market, we might be interested in how the behavior of one stock affects the behavior of another stock; understanding all these interrelationships leads to having a measure of the risk taken by investing in portfolios that use the corresponding stocks. Statisticians have a number of tools to deal with all these interrelationships. We can discover ways to look at the data so that, even if all interrelationships are small or weak, so each trait ""should"" not help us learn too much about any other trait, we might still find combinations of the traits that carry enormous amounts of information. We also know what typical values for these combinations are, so we might be able to detect unusual features in the data set by looking at it the right way. Those statistical techniques have very wide applications in various fields of science, ranging from climatology to genetics, image recognition, finance etc... Thousands of research papers are published each year that use these techniques. However, the theory that underlies these statistical techniques was created in an era where massive datasets just did not exist. This research project is focusing on theories and their applications that are better suited to handle our current massive datasets. The applications should allow us to see structure where the classical tools fail to see any and tell us when there is no structure when the classical tools tell us there is. We also have increasing evidence that our standard tools give us often very inaccurate results about our standard measures of risk or amount of information carried in combination of traits. It seems that risks might be underestimated and amount of information might be overestimated. Part of this research program will be dedicated to measuring how inaccurate the classical results are for large datasets, how much practical predictions are affected, and how a more relevant theory can be used for correcting these inaccuracies.<br/>"

Randomization offers a way to successfully address this issue. The project focuses on ""transplanting"" methods of numerical linear algebra to the study of stochastic eigenanalysis, and using the theoretical results thus obtained for the development of high-performance computational algorithms, as well as in other applications such as the study of Internet networks, building more reliable cell phone networks, and so on.

First, a stochastic model will be<br/>developed to represent how water molecules interact with the surface<br/>of a protein.  Water plays a crucial role in the functioning of<br/>proteins, and must be accounted for in molecular dynamics simulations<br/>which attempt to predict the dynamics of a protein molecule.  The<br/>detailed inclusion of water molecules in such simulations is however<br/>very costly and limits the practical scope of these simulations.  The<br/>stochastic model for the water-protein interaction to be<br/>developed in the research is intended to<br/>provide a more efficient representation of the effects of water and<br/>thereby accelerate protein dynamics calculations.

Asymptotic and stochastic<br/>techniques will be employed to characterize molecular motors operating<br/>in multiple dimensions and/or with multiple degrees of freedom, and to<br/>incorporate random modulations in the force potentials.  The Immersed<br/>Boundary computational method, recently extended to include thermal<br/>fluctuations, will be used to simulate molecular motor processes in a<br/>way which incorporates in a natural way osmotic effects and the<br/>dynamics of the fluid medium.<br/><br/>More broadly, this CAREER project comprises a research program and<br/>course developments at the undergraduate and graduate levels which<br/>will apply the principal investigator's prior experience in turbulence<br/>modeling to new problems in microbiology, and provide more systematic<br/>opportunities to communicate knowledge and problem-solving<br/>approaches to undergraduate and graduate students.  The research<br/>objective pertaining to the interaction between protein and water<br/>molecules has the potential for providing a significant speedup in<br/>simulations of protein dynamics by reducing the cost of modeling the<br/>effects of the water.  Accelerated protein dynamic simulations would<br/>expedite both our basic understanding of protein dynamics and the<br/>technological development of drugs and devices designed to interact<br/>with proteins.

Zeng, University of Virginia<br/>DMS-0239389<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>This project is concerned with various perturbation problems in the dynamics of some Hamiltonian or near Hamiltonian PDEs, such as nonlinear wave equations and nonlinear Schroedinger equations, etc. The main issues include: a) finding correct formal asymptotics and<br/>their rigorous justification when singular perturbations are present; b) studying the dynamics in neighborhoods of special orbits representing typical qualitative properties, such as periodic, quasi-periodic, homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits. Three types of interrelated problems involving perturbations will be investigated: 1) Regular Hamiltonian perturbations of systems with homoclinic orbits to saddle-centers, e.g. perturbations of sine-Gordon breathers. 2) Perturbations containing highest order derivatives. With this type of perturbations to PDEs, the nature of the systems can be changed dramatically, e.g. loss of finite speed propagation and/or disappearance of solutions backward in time. Impact of both dissipative and conservative perturbations on the dynamics will be studied. 3) Hamiltonian motions with fast oscillations. Averaging method and formal multi-scale analysis are applied in deriving the limiting wave or Schroedinger maps. In addition to justifying the convergence on various time scales, the structural stability will be studied, which are in the form of normally elliptic type geometric singular perturbation problems.<br/><br/>Many well-known evolutionary PDEs, as mathematical models, are approximations of real world dynamical systems. In order to have better understanding of the original problems, we need to study not only these PDEs, but their perturbations as well, which may include factors like small viscosity or weak elasticity, etc. On the other hand, while there are some special well-understood ones, it is usually rather difficult to study the qualitative properties and temporal asymptotic behavior of many evolutionary PDEs. Rigorous and formal asymptotic analyses provide effective ways to study the dynamics of systems close to those special ones. This proposal focuses on certain regular and singular perturbation problems related to waves, ferromagnetism, etc., involving rapid oscillations, strong dissipation, strong dispersion etc. In conjunction with this, it is also proposed to incorporate several aspects of this research into curriculum development. This effort will include an application-minded reform of some current courses and the development of a new graduate PDE dynamics course presenting the dynamical system point of view for PDEs. In addition, research and education will be woven together through the development and improvement of seminars and vertically integrated work groups.<br/><br/>"

Such laws arise in diverse areas such as the study of biological networks, earthquakes and fully turbulent flows. The investigator's research vision is to bring some of these laws within the scope of rigorous mathematical analysis. To this end, seemingly unrelated problems are treated within a unified framework that combines mathematical methods from dynamical systems, partial differential equations and probability theory. Explicit connections between these areas are used to provide a fundamental understanding of the microscopic origin of `universal' scaling  laws in (a) models of domain coarsening in materials science and physical  chemistry, (b) dynamic scaling of transport coefficients in polymer  chemistry, (c) models of turbulence. Analogies with classical probability are also used to guide new investigations of universality in dynamical systems.<br/>These research goals are closely tied to concrete improvements in education and training. Scaling and self-similarity are used as a unifying theme in a program for curricular innovation for undergraduates that stresses the extraction of simple quantitative answers from complex models. This includes the development of new freshman and senior seminars and an REU program.<br/><br/>This mathematical research is motivated by problems of fundamental technological significance in fluid mechanics, materials science and physical chemistry. Studies of domain growth in materials science improve understanding of the stability of binary alloys and coarsening of nanoscale islands on thin-film substrates. Improved numerical methods for the simulation of polymers advance the analysis of biochemical flows, such as the manipulation of individual strands of DNA in confined channels. A deeper understanding of universality in dynamical systems enhances knowledge of the transition to chaos in several fluid flows, and is the first step in the control of such flows. The plans for undergraduate education place early emphasis on the basic utility of scaling analysis in emerging areas for the application of mathematics such as biology, physical chemistry and geosciences. They also include the development of innovative expositions at the undergraduate level of successful mathematical research in these fields. This contributes to a growing demand for mathematical sophistication in these areas, and is critical for sustained impact. The educational plans stress small classes, undergraduate research, and outreach to under-represented groups, in the firm belief that careful, individual mentoring of students is the foundation for  a diverse and talented  scientific workforce.<br/>"

The PI and his collaborators have worked on the problem of finding the densest packings in 8 and 24 dimensions, using the technique of linear programming bounds. They have studied the sphere packing and associated coding problems in context of potential energy minimization. This has led to various new questions and techniques, such as the concept of universal optimality, gradient descent in the space of packings, and inverse problems which may have applications to molecular self-assembly. This project will explore some of the questions that arose in previous investigations, as well as other fundamental questions such as improvement of asymptotic bounds on the density of sphere packings. Another component of the project is arithmetic geometry, especially the study of K3 surfaces and their automorphisms, such as Shioda-Inose structures. The PI also proposes to study arithmetic applications such as the description of modular curves and surfaces, Galois representations and the computation of modular forms and elliptic curves of high rank. The project also encompasses related questions in computational number theory. Lattices are a unifying theme of the topics of the proposal, and one of the broad goals of the project is to understand explicitly families of interesting lattices in high dimensions.<br/><br/>The ""greengrocer's problem"" of packing equal sized non-overlapping spheres efficiently in space is a classical problem in geometry. Nevertheless, it turns out to have surprising and beautiful connections with various parts of mathematics, physics, and computer science. Its theoretical and practical ramifications extend to Lie algebras, exceptional finite groups, quadratic forms, coding theory, cryptography and energy minimization in physics. This project will seek to further our understanding of sphere packings in high dimensions as well as explore and exploit these connections. Arithmetic geometry seeks to understand the properties of the natural numbers using the powerful tools of algebraic geometry. One of the most spectacular successes of twentieth century algebraic geometry is Faltings' Theorem (erstwhile Mordell's Conjecture), which provides the final link in a trichotomy which links the number of rational points on an algebraic curve to its topological genus, and roughly establishes how many solutions we can expect to an equation linking two variables. The analogous question of how many solutions we can expect to an equation linking three or more variables is still quite a mystery. Some of the questions the PI intends to investigate involve the arithmetic of surfaces, especially K3 surfaces, which are important in mathematics and physics. The project also hopes to make progress on the still murkier computational aspects, such as how to find these solutions. The PI will also develop courses and seminars in topics related to the proposal, and aim to involve graduate and undergraduate students actively in this research. Other aims of the project will be to develop algorithms and open-source code, as well as a catalog of interesting codes in different spaces."

More precisely, he will investigate the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series induced from parabolic subgroups. When the degree of the cover is trivial, this reduces to the case of Eisenstein series on linear algebraic groups as studied by Langlands, Shahidi, and others, which have been instrumental in formulating and proving portions of the Langlands program. By studying metaplectic forms in families ranging over all finite covers (including the trivial one), surprising new structure emerges. Brubaker and his collaborators have demonstrated that the resulting Fourier-Whittaker coefficients contain Dirichlet series in several complex variables (so-called ``multiple Dirichlet series'') whose coefficients are described in terms of crystal graphs. These crystal graphs encode information about representations of quantum groups, which are deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. In this situation, the relevant Lie algebra is associated to the Langlands dual group of the group on which one builds the Eisenstein series. The proposal seeks to develop this theory more completely and explore the novel connections it suggests between number theory, quantum groups and combinatorial representation theory. <br/><br/>Langlands' program was initially conceived as a stunning collection of conjectures relating functions with interesting arithmetic properties (e.g., counting the number of integer solutions to an equation) to functions with good analytic properties (e.g., having symmetries and being the solution of a natural differential equation). But similar kinds of duality have been observed in geometry and mathematical physics, leading to geometric and quantum versions of the Langlands programs, respectively.  In short, these dualities have become a lens through which a large portion of modern mathematics and mathematical physics can be organized and understood. However, the explicit underlying mechanisms which relate, for example, arithmetic functions to analytic functions remain largely a mystery. In these projects, Principal Investigator Brubaker with his collaborators and students will use the data provided by the above special examples to attempt to find such a mechanism and attempt to better understand the relationships between various incarnations of the Langlands program in arithmetic, geometry, and physics. An equally important component of the projects is the training of students at all levels by creating a tiered system of mentoring. To bolster these efforts, a set of course materials will be developed to reflect the changing emphasis in modern number theory on analytic techniques, focusing on computational approaches and example-based learning to reinforce concepts"

The presence of nonlinearity often requires a combination of asymptotic and perturbation methods, scientific computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis to achieve a solid mathematical framework for understanding a given physical system.  By direct collaboration with both industrial partners and members of the physics and electrical engineering academic community, quantitative models for the nonlinear optics and atomic systems of interest will be developed based upon first principles.  These models will be studied in appropriate parameter regimes where simplified nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be applied. The results will then be recast in terms of their original experimental context so that the theoretical predictions can be tested, verified, and modified as necessary.  The specific applications of interest concern optical parametric oscillators, optical fiber lasers and devices, and Bose-Einstein condensates.  All these systems exhibit a stable evolution of nonlinear pulses, fronts, and periodic wavetrains.  <br/><br/>This research in mathematical modeling and analysis addresses three classes of important problems.  With rapidly developing materials and devices, nonlinear optics remains at the forefront of enabling technologies for communications and information systems. Of primary importance is the stabilization of optical pulses.  This research aims to provide a general description of the stability of pulses in a wide variety of lasers and devices where nonlinearity plays a key role.  Optical parametric oscillators have tremendous potential application for tunable coherent radiation, pattern recognition, and optical information processing.  This work will establish regions of control for the pulse and front structures in these optical devices, facilitating practical implementation of the technology.  Bose-Einstein condensates, which have been only recently realized experimentally, are expected to have applications in quantum logic and matter-wave transport.  Trapping the condensate and sustaining it for long time periods are fundamental for making the Bose-Einstein condensates a viable technology. This research will focus on various periodic trap configurations that can stabilize the condensate in both attractive and repulsive states. <br/>"

The main goal of the project is to find good definitions of compact moduli functors, with special regard to the moduli theory of surfaces. As part of the moduli theory project special efforts are devoted to reflexive sheaves and their behavior with respect to morphisms in an effort to develop a theory that includes many results for reflexive sheaves of rank 1 that are similar to results already known for line bundles. This is very important in order to develop a moduli theory of singular varieties, which in turn is essential for geometrically meaningful compact moduli spaces. Another problem the investigator is studying is generalizations of Shafarevich's conjecture and its applications to the case of higher dimensional bases, in particular the problem of boundedness and rigidity for families of varieties of general type.  This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and still in its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science cryptography, coding theory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in theoretical physics. Studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is changing in space-time. This project focuses on compact moduli spaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and they give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially different from others. Presently the existence of compact moduli spaces is known for low dimensional problems. The investigator is studying the higher dimensional case. As part of the project, but somewhat independent of the above, the investigator and his graduate students are running a website that works as a forum for graduate students and young researchers in algebraic geometry. Users of this website can pose questions that are likely to be known to experts but not available in the literature. The main goal of this project is to open a new venue for a larger number of students to access the knowledge of experts in the field helping to achieve a more equal opportunity environment. In addition, the collected database provides references to results that are too ""small"" to occupy an entire article, but too important to ignore, as well as a collection of potential research problems for graduate students."

The fractal dimension, D, of an object or data set is a roughness measure and routinely estimated in scientific studies. Long-memory dependence in time series or spatial data plays key roles in the discussion of issues such as global warming. It is associated with power-law correlations and quantified by the Hurst coefficient, H. In principle, fractal dimension, D, and Hurst coefficient, H, are independent of each other: fractal dimension is a local property, and long-memory dependence is a global characteristic. Nevertheless, the two notions have been linked through the celebrated relationship that indicates that the fractal dimension added to the Hurst coefficient equals n+1, for a self-similar surface in n-dimensional space. This relationship is based on the assumption of self-similarity, which has hardly ever been put to test. Recently developed stochastic models allow for any combination of fractal dimension, D, and Hurst coefficient, H, and therefore challenge the relationship and the role of self-similarity. Has the prevalence of self-similar model been a roadblock, keeping scientists from exploring and understanding a wide range of local and global behavior in complex systems? Or is it indeed a breakthrough, which lets scientists focus on models for which the above relationship holds, while other combinations of D and H are physically meaningless? This research develops tests for self-similarity and thereby addresses these problems. Along the way, new insight into the behavior of statistical estimators of fractal dimension and Hurst coefficient, software for the fast and exact simulation of self-similar and related classes of random processes, an analysis of topographic data for Oregon and Washington state, and new theoretical results for stationary random functions will emerge. Visualization tools and Freshman Seminars at the University of Washington will introduce undergraduate students to mathematical and statistical modeling, to fractals, long-memory dependence, and self-similarity, and to the natural beauty and diversity of the Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>Many natural phenomena such as mountains, clouds, ferns and rocks have features that look alike across scales. A little piece might indeed resemble the whole if the scale is not disclosed. Over the past decades, this notion of self-similarity has emerged as a popular and fruitful theme in a vast number of scientific studies. This research develops statistical tests, which allow scientists to assess whether their observations and data are compatible with classical assumptions of self-similarity. Alternative models allow for distinct behaviors at different scales and might inspire and encourage new theories across disciplines. The research is paired with the development of visualization and simulation tools as well as Freshman Seminars, through which students are introduced to mathematical and statistical modeling, to fractals, long-memory dependence, and self-similarity, and to the natural beauty and diversity of the Pacific Northwest. <br/>"

Another emphasis will be on a probabilistic analysis of random combinatorial objects, and in particular their limit shapes, which are geometric shapes that arise in the asymptotic limit when the size of the model becomes large. More generally, the study of combinatorial models in a probabilistic setting raises many fascinating questions, for example questions about limiting fluctuations and about connections to random matrix theory. The technical toolbox of techniques that the investigator hopes to employ to attack such problems is very varied and involves both algebraic methods (e.g. generating functions, linear algebra), analytic methods (for example the calculus of variations) and general probabilistic techniques.<br/><br/>The scientific and educational value of the project is manifold. The combinatorial objects of interest have delighted pure mathematicians for many years for their inherent beauty and elegant structure. But also, amazingly, such seemingly ""useless"" mathematics has turned out to have deep connections to branches of physics and to some very applied mathematical disciplines like probability theory and random matrix theory. Thus, for example, alternating-sign matrices are related to ""square ice"", a simplified model for an ice crystal studied by statistical physicists, while at the same time appearing in the study of an algorithm for computing matrix determinants, which are a ubiquituous concept used in practically all the sciences and engineering disciplines. And Young tableaux, which originated with the mathematical study of symmetry, have been found to be related to random matrix theory, an important mathematical theory which has its origins in attempts by nuclear physicists to model the complex interactions in the nuclei of heavy elements. The combination of theoretical elegance and applied utility makes these research topics highly attractive from a scientific standpoint, and also very suitable as the focus for educational activities planned by the investigator, which would have as their goals to attract promising students to mathematics and the sciences and to promote public appreciation of the value of scientific research.<br/>"

This connection opens the door to a deeper understanding of the analytic structure of Tracy-Widom laws. It also presents a new method for investigating the universality question at the spectral edge for both random matrices and random Schroedinger.<br/>The second set of problems concerns bulk fluctuations for ensembles of matrices with no assumed symmetry.

Finally, the investigator looks at several applications of RMT to wireless technology where probabilistic and analytic techniques from RMT are employed to estimate the capacity and performance of multiple-antenna communication systems with feedback.<br/><br/>Matrices and their spectra (eigenvalues) are fundamental objects throughout mathematics and its applications.  The study of random matrices (again, RMT) addresses the natural question: ""What do the eigenvalues of the typical matrix look like?""  Or, said another way: ""What properties of the spectra are universal in that they depend only on the rough characteristics (e.g. symmetries) of the matrix ensemble?"" It is therefore not surprising that RMT has serious impact in disparate areas of mathematics ranging from Statistics to Number Theory to Operator Algebras, as well as in Physics and Engineering.  On the theoretical front, this project brings new ideas to the study of the universal properties of the largest eigenvalues in symmetric matrices and also the bulk (or generic) eigenvalues in matrices without symmetry.  On the more directly applied side, this project looks at problems in the theory of wireless technology where, interestingly, the design and performance analysis of many efficient communication systems leads to mathematical problems cast in the language of RMT.  The engineering issues here are of the utmost practical importance - while the demand for wireless communications continues to grow, the spectrum remains a limited resource.

The author wants to <br/>bound these numbers for sparse graphs, i.e., graphs in which every <br/>subgraph has bounded average degree. Here the goal is to show that such <br/>graphs have Ramsey numbers which grow linearly in the size of the graph. <br/>An additional topic is to study various extremal problems. In particular <br/>to obtain extensions of classical Turan's theorem and prove better bounds <br/>on the Max Cut in the graphs with forbidden subgraphs. Some of these <br/>problems were posed many years ago by Erdos, and despite all efforts are <br/>still open. Another set of questions deals mainly with the study of the <br/>chromatic and choice numbers of graphs. Usually there is a huge gap <br/>between these two parameters, so one of the goals in this proposal is to <br/>understand the graphs for which chromatic and choice numbers are equal. <br/>Finally the PI also intends to study the asymptotic properties of random <br/>and pseudo-random graphs which is one of the central topics in <br/>Probabilistic Combinatorics.<br/><br/> Concepts and questions of Combinatorics appear naturally in many <br/>branches of mathematics, and have also found applications in other <br/>disciplines. These include applications in Information Theory and <br/>Electrical Engineering, in Statistical Physics and Molecular Biology, and <br/>most notably in Computer Science. The PI is convinced that progress in the <br/>problems he discusses will be interesting and significant, and will lead <br/>to new developments in Discrete Mathematics. He believes that the new <br/>approaches and techniques resulting from this project will be applicable <br/>and useful in other fields as well. The author also proposes a wide range <br/>of educational measures closely related to his project. He plans to <br/>develop a series of courses for senior undergraduate and starting graduate <br/>students, which will serve as a gentle introduction to the variety of <br/>powerful methods in modern Combinatorics. Part of these courses will be <br/>closely related to the research problems in this proposal. Along the <br/>course, the author plans to integrate research activities into the <br/>teaching by introducing open questions that will motivate the students to <br/>undertake research on these fascinating topics, which can lead to a B.A. <br/>thesis or Ph.D. dissertation.<br/>"

First the Principal Investigator developes applications of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to analyze multiple time series in a Bayesian framework. She shows how to incorporate features such as seasonal variation, random interventions, endogenous variable relationships, and long-range dependence in a Bayesian linear model for multivariate time series. The Bayesian framework allows for incorporation of prior information, such as knowledge about the covariance structure between series, and results in computationally feasible likelihood evaluations. The Bayesian model proposed can be used to describe some of the time series features observed in practice, but is restricted by its linear structure. The second area of research focuses on methods for modeling complicated nonlinear time series relationships in a non-Bayesian setup. The theoretical framework is based on recent advances in nonparametric function and density estimation in the regression setting. First, a test is developed for nonlinear periodic behavior and show how to model that behavior. Next simplified linear relationships among multiple nonlinear series using a nonparametric test applied to linear combinations of nonlinear series are explored. The simplified relationships can be used to improve forecasts of the individual series. Finally, full multivariate nonlinear models are developed using multivariate kernel density methods and local fitting of vector autoregressions. To help promote use of the new methods in practice, part of the effort is devoted to developing algorithms that are computationally feasible. The third project area focuses on educational innovations to improve statistical training and communication skills among engineers and applied statisticians. Improvement of these skills will help foster interactions with investigators in other discip lines.    The overall goal of the research is to develop methods that can be used to better understand complex relationships among real-world processes. Statistical tools are developed that can be used, for example, to investigate long-range dependent relationships between environmental series in order to assess global changes in the earth's atmosphere, or to analyze important nonlinear relationships among economic series. To help insure that future statistics practitioners have sufficient training to use such methods, educational innovations are developed, in parallel, aimed at improving data analysis, computing, and communication skills at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. By better educating students in the application of statistics to real-world problems, they will be better equipped to use statistical methods for understanding complex real-world dynamics and making intelligent policy decisions."

Because of automated data collection methods, there is now<br/>a surfeit of severely multi-dimensional records.  Grouping them into homogeneous clusters to better understand them is a desirable goal in a variety of applications, yet classical statistical methods are computationally infeasible in many cases.  I propose to develop parallel methodology for this context.  Although the methodology and theory developed will be quite general and for potential use in applications ranging from business, medicine, the environment, software quality assessment, I will conduct the research in the context of three scientific collaborations.  The first pertains to the<br/>US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) self-reported Toxic Releases Inventory (TRI) databases, where profiling the different facilities in terms of their product, demographic and business information can improve the accuracy of records, as well as better characterize them vis-a-vis their emissions mix.  The second project is to assess the reliability of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans, with a view to understanding the cognitive processes of the brain, as a first step to patient care and therapy.  The third application is in bioinformatics where the goal is to cluster microarray data and also to analyze two-dimensional proteomic gel images.  This will help in isolating genes and understanding their relationship with different disorders.  <br/><br/>Clustering is in general a very difficult problem, with empirical solutions even for very moderately sized datasets.  I propose to develop multi-pass methodologies in several different scenarios.  I also propose multi-scale simulation approaches to estimation in a high-dimensional context.  One of the biggest challenges faced by simulation methods due to high dimensionality is the low mobility around the space to be traversed because of its vastness.  I propose to address this issue by connecting these high-dimensional spaces to lower-dimensional ones  (which are significantly smaller) and by using these lower scales to traverse from one corner of the higher-dimensional space to another.  A final goal of this five-year plan is to investigate the development and estimation in more complex models for proteomic gel data.  Most of the plans proposed will be possible only with a parallel computing interface.  This is increasingly critical in a large number of scientific applications, and I propose to simultaneously provide statistics students with the necessary expertise by designing suitably tailored graduate and undergraduate classes.<br/>"

Most existing dimension reduction methods are developed under the assumption that the data are independent. Consequently, they may be inefficient and sometimes even inappropriate for analyzing spatial/temporal data which are often naturally correlated. The proposed research intends to fill in this gap by developing inverse regression based dimension reduction methods for data arising from three different types of spatial/temporal processes: spatial point processes, recurrent event processes and quantitative spatial processes. Specific goals of the project include 1) developing general frameworks and methods for conducting dimension reduction for both univariate and multivariate spatial point processes and 2) generalizing these methods to the cases of recurrent event processes and quantitative spatial processes. Special attentions will be given when the dimension of the response is also high. In addition, the PI will also develop computationally efficient analytical tools such as second-order analysis for the modeling of massive recurrent event process data.<br/><br/>With the fast development of modern data collection technologies, especially with the increased availability of more accurate Global Positioning System and Geographical Information System, large-scale spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal data have become rapidly available in recent years. Many of these data are massive and highly complex in nature, posing unprecedented challenges to data analysis. The proposed research will develop efficient statistical tools that can be used to analyze such data. The PI will collaborate closely with field scientists from various disciplines to apply these tools to solve real-life problems that have motivated this research. Specific goals of these collaborations includes, but are not limited to, 1) improving the understanding of tropical forestry diversity, 2) better assessing the health effects of air pollution on asthmatic children and 3) providing more accurate spatial predictions of US watershed characteristics such as discharges and fluxes. Key educational components of the project include providing interdisciplinary statistical trainings to students especially minority students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels and helping three local high schools improve their AP Statistics teaching."

Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis. One seeks to decompose complex problems into fundamental components. These components are then analyzed for their basic characteristics. Finally, the solution is reconstructed through a recombination of the components.

There are three directions in the proposed research: Wiener Chaos decomposition for linear and nonlinear equation, analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains, and statistical inference for stochastic partial differential equations. Wiener Chaos decomposition is a stochastic analog of the classical Fourier method and is a powerful tool in the study of stochastic equations, from both analytical and numerical points of view. In particular, Wiener Chaos decomposition is the key component of several new numerical algorithms for nonlinear filtering and of an efficient computational procedure for statistical moments of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Analysis of stochastic partial differential equations in domains is necessary for development of a complete theory, similar to the one for deterministic partial differential equations. In addition to purely theoretical results about existence and uniqueness of solutions, this analysis leads to new numerical methods for such equations. Methods of statistical inference make it possible to relate an abstract equation to a concrete problem from applications. Unlike finite-dimensional systems, a consistent estimation in a stochastic partial differential equation is possible even when both the observation time and the amplitude of noise are fixed.<br/> Stochastic partial differential equations are both an interesting mathematical object and an effective modeling tool in various branches of applied science, such as ecology, finance, meteorology, and navigation. Equations studied in this project can describe, for example, the term structure of interest rates, the propagation of an oil spill in the ocean, and the motion of the target on the radar screen. The research objectives of the project are to study mathematical properties of stochastic partial differential equations and to develop effective computational and statistical methods for relating an equation to a model. The educational objective of the project is to increase understanding of stochastic partial differential equations among the students and researchers both inside and outside of the mathematical community. This educational objective will be achieved by developing several basic and special topics courses and by organizing a research seminar on applications of stochastic partial differential equations."

The first mathematical problem concerns an integral mean inequality which would constitute a sharpening of a known lifetime result for Brownian motion in convex, simply connected planar domains normalized so that the largest disk they contain has radius one (or asymptotically one.) The second problem concerns a packing measure analysis of harmonic measure which would provide an analogue to the results of Makarov which relate a lower bound on the growth of the derivative of a univalent function to the proper Hausdorff measure function for the support of harmonic measure on the boundary of a domain. The education plan includes redesigning the senior/beginning graduate mathematical statistics courses to give the students a feeling for data and teaching a course for undergraduate mathematics majors by a modified Moore method, in order to give our undergraduates insight into the process of doing mathematical and statistical research. This award will fund both research in mathematics and course development in the mathematical sciences. During the award period, it is proposed to redesign an upper level statistics course to include work with actual data instead of focusing entirely on the mathematical theory behind statistics. There are also plans to teach a course for mathematics majors using self-discovery techniques in order to give undergraduates insight into the process of doing mathematical research. Two mathematical questions will be researched during the award period. One problem involves studying the pathological behavior of a certain class of mathematical functions. The techniques employed are related to those used for the study of fractals. The second pr oblem is derived from considering the lifetime of a particle moving randomly inside a region and dying when it touches the boundary of the region. Different regions allow the particle to live different lengths of time. Applications of this research are relevant in applied contexts, such as in studying stress on beams."
