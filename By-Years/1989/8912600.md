Marine algae are rich sources of metabolites that function as defenses against
herbivores and have potential applications as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
and growth regulating substances. An understanding of how environmental factors
contribute to the variability of these products may have important implications
and may help determine how man's impact on the nearshore environment will affect
the interaction between algae and their predators. Drs. Hay and Fenical will
assess how physical and biological stresses interact with the algae's resistance
to predation and examine the variability of the process.
