This is a project to provide peer-reviewed small research grants through the
Advancement of the Discipline program of the American Sociological Association.
It is a continuation of a very successful program that assisted a significant
number of promising sociologists to undertake pilot research projects or to
complete limited but innovative and creative studies. The maximum amount for an
NSF/ASA small research grant will be $4,000. Half of the funding for these
grants will come from NSF, and half from the ASA. Proposals are reviewed for
scientific merit. The selection committee consists of four members of the ASA
Council, the ASA Vice President, the ASA Executive Officer, and one
representative from NSF. The structure of the selection committee assures that a
panel of distinguished social scientists evaluates the proposals. %%% Through
the coordination and outreach of the American Sociological Association, funds
are allocated expeditiously and in accord with scientific merit for scholars to
engage in exploratory research where support from other sources would be
difficult to acquire. Thus, these small grants constitute an invaluable form of
venture capital for research that has the potential for challenging the
discipline, for stimulating new lines of scientific research, and for
facilitating new networks of scientific collaboration.
