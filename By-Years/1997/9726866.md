Systems, Computation and Control Engineering have played a key role in the
design and manufacture of products in many plants such as chemical, mechanical,
aerospace, electric, and electronic industries. Active research on dynamic
systems and controls has been pursued in various disciplines of engineering, and
the education of systems and control engineers is an important issue in every
engineering discipline and every country. The objective of this workshop is to
bring together educators and researchers from Japan, the United States and
Vietnam to discuss the integration of research and education in the field of
systems, computation and control. The control theory and related areas such as
computations and communications as well as application problems such as process
control, manufacturing and mechanical systems control will be covered. The
workshop will serve as a spring board for initiating a long lasting cooperation
of the three countries as well as neighboring Asian countries on this important
subject.
