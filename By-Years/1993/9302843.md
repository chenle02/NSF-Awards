The research entails developing methods of geometric measure theory and
calibrated geometries to the study of area minimizing surfaces. Other components
of the project involving the CO-PI's concern problems in topology and number
theory. The proposal is an RUI proposal and as such contains a component dealing
with aspects of undergraduate education for which the talents of the
investigators provide an injection of initiatives.
