This research aims at defining, studying, and simulating a functional processor
architecture which provides high performance and efficient VLSI implementations.
The architecture under consideration uses functional decomposition of the
execute-access mechanisms and hardware implementation of the access mechanisms
of data structures. Research is directed towards the design of the access
portion of the processor, the development of an appropriate instruction set for
the architecture, the specification of the required execute-access
intercommunication, the exploration on the use of area-inexpensive queue caches,
and the detailed simulation of the architecture. Improving performance of
multiprocessors is an important area of research. This research is a
comprehensive planned effort which defines a decoupled architecture for
simulation, determines the degree of functionality associated with the data
access process, and promotes the use of intelligent memory concepts. Results
developed can improve bottlenecks associated with the access-execute mechanism
in high- performance computers.
