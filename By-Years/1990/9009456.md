This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Maurice LeBrun of
the University of Texas to conduct collaborative research for six months with
Dr. Tatsuoki Takeda of the Naka Fusion Research Establishment, Japan Atomic
Energy Research Institute, in Naka-machi, Ibaraki-ken, Japan. They will apply
large scale numerical simulation methods to the study of plasma transport
processes in toroidal magnetic confinement devices, with a goal of increased
understanding and predictive capability. Dr. LeBrun has been involved in the
development of a particle simulation model and code for studying confined
plasmas in realistic geometries. The Naka Fusion Research Establishment has a
strong theoretical and experimental program centered around the JT-60 tokamak,
one of the three largest plasma fusion experiments in the world. This
collaboration will enable the P.I. to interface with scientists studying the
physics of large plasma confinement devices, and thus apply model to physically
relevant studies.
