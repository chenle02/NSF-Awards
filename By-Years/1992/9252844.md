The camp at SUNY/College at Old Westbury extends the summer program,
established six years ago, for minority high school students to fifty African-
American and Hispanic middle school students (grades seven through nine) and
admits them to the Science Training and Education Program (STEP). Activities in
the four-week summer camp include intensive instruction in mathematics,
communication skills, and computer science and analytical skills usable in
developing research oriented science projects. Students ar exposed to career
exploration activities such as science projects. Students are exposed to career
exploration activities such as field trips to industries, government
laboratories and college research labs complete with pre-tour briefing, post-
tour evaluations and informal meetings with scientists, along with mentoring by
college role models. Group workshop strategies for reinforced learning,
motivation through team competitions, a supportive climate, experienced staff
and carefully chosen courses tailored to students' needs are the key elements of
this SSC. Programs which assist students in developing positive attitudes
towards SEM careers, increase their academic confidence and encourage parent
participation in education are incorporated.
