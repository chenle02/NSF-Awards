Darling-Hammond&lt;br/&gt;1317068&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Stanford
University project provides elementary teachers, grades 3-5 with a pedagogical
framework and related resources for distinguishing quality science teaching. The
study focuses on developing and testing a framework, the Quality Science
Teaching Continuum (QSTC), to determine its capacity to serve as a potent
formative and collaborative tool with which teachers can reflect on their
science teaching practices and recognize student behaviors that are indicators
of engagement and science learning. The project includes an intensive
professional development (PD) that will accompany the instrument designed to
develop teachers' understanding of (1) pedagogy, (2) science process and
content, (3) community building, and (4) use of QSTC to improve classroom
instruction and student engagement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teachers will be
videotaped during classroom science instruction at various points in the two-
year process, and the resulting digital library of teaching videos provides an
ongoing reference resource for teachers and others when reflecting on their
practice. The project provides a proof of concept and examines the use of a
specific, formative, integrative instrument, the QSTC, within an immersive
teacher professional development program.
