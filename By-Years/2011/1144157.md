The organizations and institutions which historically have borne the
responsibility for the curation, management, preservation, and retrieval of
information contained in physical objects now find themselves confronted by the
similar need to manage digital data though the challenges of doing so are
distinctly different. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will convene a committee
of experts from the National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Research Data and
Information (BRDI) to:&lt;br/&gt;- Conduct a three day public workshop public of
key stakeholders for intensive structured discussions in order to obtain a
better understanding of the unprecedented challenges of managing what has been
called an "exaflood" of data. &lt;br/&gt;- Design and implement a focused study
to better understand the needs and opportunities for a workforce with blended
skills and expertise necessary to effectively manage and preserve diverse
digital resources and workforce changes as "digital natives" enter the
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;- Generate a report that will inform the community on the
education and training needs and requirements, career alternatives, and
workforce development in regards to digital curation.
