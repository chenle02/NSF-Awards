This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a chromate- and phosphate-free metal surface pre-treatment product that reduces
cost, and provides significant environmental and health benefits. Iron and zinc
phosphate chemicals are currently widely used in surface treatment processes,
which require from 7 to 10 process steps, consume energy to heat treatment
baths, and produce a large quantity of waste that must be treated. This adds
cost, and results in phosphate discharge to the environment. Based on the Phase
I project, a chromate- and phosphate-free pre-treatment chemical will be further
developed in this project. This chemical reduces the number of pre-treatment
process to less than 5 steps, can be used at ambient temperature, and produces
90% less waste. It is expected to demonstrate enhanced performance in corrosion
protection and paint adhesion over similar products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader commercial impacts of this project will be to dramatically reduce cost,
complexity and negative environmental impact of metal surface pretreatment in
manufacturing processes without compromising performance. Potential applications
will be in automobile, aerospace, steel (coil coatings), consumer electronics,
appliance, and many other industries. An important societal impact will be the
better protection to workers in plants, as this process is not toxic and does
not require elaborate waste disposal procedures. This project will also enhance
the scientific understanding of mechanisms by which pretreatments contribute to
the protection of metals.
