9308955 Norman I propose to design and implement a scalable adaptive mesh
radiation hydrodynamics simulation code for use on MPP platforms. This code will
be quite general in the sense that can be used in many astrophysical situations
to solve "Grand Challenge" level problems. Additionally, the algorithm and code
rely on the solution of large parallel sets of equations, a situation for which
MPP computing technology is well suited. My investigations will be oriented
towards developing schemes for the efficient solution of these large parallel
sets of equations.
