The purpose of this meeting will be to bring together as a group, for the first
time, researchers working on all aspects of nonlinear optics in guided wave
geometries and to define the current state-of-the-art. General objectives are to
highlight the similarities between various effects in planar waveguide, fiber
and surface polariton geometries, to provide a forum for the discussion of
nonlinear waveguide phenomena from different perspectives, to improve the
interaction between theory and experiment in nonlinear pulse propagation and
nonlinear waveguide studies, to encourage the development of novel waveguide
structures and materials to enhance nonlinearites, and to address novel
nonlinear effects such as photorefractive grating and harmonic generation.
