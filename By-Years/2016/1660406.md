****Technical Abstract**** This award aims to explicate the process by which
electrons that are initially localized on the f-orbitals of rare earth based
heavy fermion compounds can be induced to join the itinerant states comprising
the Fermi surface(FS), and the critical fluctuations of the electronic structure
that accompany this electronic de-confinement transition. The role of
frustration in suppressing magnetic order in heavy fermions that form on the
geometrically frustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice will be investigated. Two
distinct ground states are envisaged: a spin liquid where the conduction
electrons are decoupled from the fluctuating moments, whose electrons are
consequently excluded from the FS, and a Fermi liquid, where a strong Kondo
effect delocalizes the f-electrons, which are now incorporated in an expanded
FS. These two non-ordered states are separated at T=0 by a purely electronic
transition, driven by fluctuations between the large and small FS states. The
synthesis of new materials to support both the measurement program of the PI and
those of her collaborators is a central theme of this project. Participating
undergraduate and graduate students will gain practical and portable experience
in a variety of different synthesis and experimental techniques. This research
makes extensive use of national research facilities, including neutron
scattering centers at NIST and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

****Non-Technical Abstract**** While all materials are disordered at high
temperatures, with no discernible patterns or correlations in their
configurations, the onset of an ordered phase such as superconductivity or
magnetism is overwhelmingly favored as the temperature is reduced. This project
seeks to explicate the properties of systems with the most extreme form of
order, which occurs exactly at a temperature of absolute zero. The quantum
mechanical nature of such a phase transition is paramount, with the result that
normal behaviors like the conduction of heat or electricity are drastically
modified- even at nonzero temperatures. Here, geometrical constraints associate
with a lattice of magnetic moments will be used to realize such T=0 transitions,
and their properties will be studied using neutron scattering experiments
carried out at NIST and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The synthesis of new
materials to support both the measurement program of the PI and those of her
collaborators is a central theme of this project. Participating undergraduate
and graduate students will gain practical and portable experience in a variety
of different synthesis and experimental techniques.
