This project investigates whether the rise in income inequality over the last
three decades can be explained in part by the growth of corporate restructuring.
Internal job ladders within firms may have been weakened by changes such as the
growth of out-sourcing of employment, privatization of public sector work, the
de-regulation of service industries, mergers, and a shift in the balance of
power towards shareholders and away from managers. The research will test the
importance of these restructuring changes by comparing changes in earnings
inequality across 115 cities between 1970 and 2000 using decennial Census data.
Changes in corporate restructuring (e.g., increases in subcontracting
industries) are expected to be correlated with increases in wage inequality
across the four panels.
