This award provides partial support for the Second International Conference on
Earthquake Mitigation and Preparedness. The conference is designed for
researchers, policy makers and managers from the United States and overseas.
Objectives are to provide a forum for researchers to present their findings to
the user community and to receive input on future research needs; to provide a
means of transferring theoretical seismic research to those who have the
responsibility for implementation; to provide a setting for exchange of
information among policy-makers and administrators; to increase public awareness
and understanding of earthquake hazard and preparedness through public education
programs and neighborhood "self-help" programs.
