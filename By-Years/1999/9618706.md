The purpose of the proposed work is to understand how to use the chemical
variation of lavas erupted at the Earth's surface to provide better insight into
the physical processes occuring in the deep Earth. We will use dynamic computer
models that calculate the coupled flow of melt and mantle to explore the
sensitivity of observable geochemistry to changes in mantle processes. At the
same time we will compile reference geochemical and geophysical data-sets to
compare with and test the models. Through a combination of theory and
observation, this work may give much stronger constraints on deep Earth
processes than either classical geodynamics or geochemistry alone.
