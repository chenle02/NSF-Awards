The experiments proposed here ask what role mRNA processing plays in regulating
the structure, stability and translation of messenger RNAs. Specifically, we
intend to identify both the cellular factors involved in mRNA 3' end cleavage
and polyadenylation and the genes that encode them. We will then be able to ask
physiological and biochemical questions about the roles of these factors in the
regulation of mRNA levels during cellular growth and at different stages of the
cell cycle. We will employ a direct biochemical assay to screen a large
collection of conditional lethal mutants for enzymatic defects in mRNA 3' end
formation that affect cell viability or growth. We will clone and characterize
the genes using classical genetic and molecular biological techniques. We will
search for second site revertants in the expectation of identifying other genes
whose products play a role in mRNA processing. These mutants will also be used
in temperature shift studies to determine the effects of each defect on the
stability, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation of mRNAs. The isolated
genes will be used to determine the effect of knockout mutations, site directed
alterations and controlled expression on cell growth and the ultimate fate of
the abnormally processed mRNAs. In a parallel biochemical approach, we will
begin to purify the factors which catalyze specific cleavage and polyadenylation
of yeast mRNAs. This is a proposal to investigate a very poorly understood part
of the process by which genetic information is decoded and expressed, viz. the
assembly of a finished messenger RNA molecule from its precursor, and the
transport of the messenger RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
