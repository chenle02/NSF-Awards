Proposal 0112654&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliability Theory of Software Designed
Using Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dick Hamlet, Portland State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defining, developing, and reusing
software components is today accepted&lt;br/&gt;as the best line of attack on
the problem of expensive and unreliable&lt;br/&gt;software systems. In other
engineering disciplines, component-based&lt;br/&gt;systems have been the key to
rational design, in which engineers can&lt;br/&gt;predict the behavior of
complex systems before they are built and&lt;br/&gt;tested. This research
focuses on the quality of software components.&lt;br/&gt;A foundational theory
is developed to allow the designer of a system,&lt;br/&gt;working from data
sheets that describe proposed components, to estimate&lt;br/&gt;the reliability
of the system that will result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals of this research
are:&lt;br/&gt;-- To develop a quantitative, mathematical description of the way
in&lt;br/&gt;which component reliability measurements can be made and later used
for&lt;br/&gt;calculating system reliability.&lt;br/&gt;-- To experiment with
the theory in simple, revealing cases, to expose&lt;br/&gt;problems in the
theory and improve it by experimental feedback.&lt;br/&gt;-- To implement
research-prototype support tools, particularly for the&lt;br/&gt;system
designer, that make experimentation easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
