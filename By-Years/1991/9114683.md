This award supports one visit in the first year by Dr. Simon C. Moss, and one by
post-doctoral researcher P.C. Chow, of the University of Houston, University
Park, and one each in the second year, to CSIRO, Clayton, Victoria, Australia,
to work with Dr. Stephen W. Wilkins of the Division of Materials Science and
Technology on the Division of Materials Science and Technology on the x-ray
microstructural characterization of thin films and multilayers of semiconductors
produced by various means. The researchers intend to select a few materials for
intensive study and join their respective instrumental and theoretical skills to
develop new insights and analytical methods. The research topics include: (1)
semiconductor multilayer (superlattice) structures; (2) studies of interfaces in
incoherent structures; and (3) studies of ordering, vibrational effects and
localized distortions within multilayer and thin-film structures. The three
topics are somewhat interrelated in that they require very careful attention to
data collection and to scattering theory.
