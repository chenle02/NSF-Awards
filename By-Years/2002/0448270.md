CAREER: NANOFIBER FORMATION DIRECTLY BY POLYMER MELTS: A SOLVENT-FREE APPROACH

Formation of nanofibers from electrically-charged polymer melts remains a
subject of great importance in polymer processing and fluid mechanics. This
grant will establish an integrated research and teaching infrastructure that
will allow development of procedures to control fiber formation on the
nanoscale. Complete numerical simulation studies of electrically-charged polymer
melts in electrospinning will be performed. Comparative experiments, including
flow visualization, will be carried out to provide a quantitative test of the
theoretical predictions. Progress in nanofiber formation will make an important
contribution to polymer rheology and processing. In particular, this solvent-
free approach for nanofibers directly from melts will overcome current barriers
to commercializing electrospinning, such as high process cost and low production
rate. Simulations that incorporate electrically-driven flows, crystallization,
flow stability in a single tool can provide a platform for guiding design of
nanofibers of advanced materials that are finding uses in filtration, protective
clothing and biomedical applications. The PI will develop a short course on
ethics of scientific research, and incorporate bio-transport and bioseparations
into the curriculum. The grant will enable research experiences for middle and
high school teachers and will help them to develop modules on fiber science,
provide research experiences to urban high school, and provide research
experiences for Cornell undergraduate students. The education and outreach plan
leverages existing successful programs at Cornell that have several important
goals: providing research experience for students from underrepresented group,
as well as for teachers, and developing the aforementioned demonstration modules
for use by K-12 students and teachers.
