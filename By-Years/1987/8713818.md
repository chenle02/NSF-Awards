This project addresses two major gaps in general equilibrium theory: a full
treatment of monopolistic competition and an explanation of the convergence of
prices towards their equilibrium values. These are fundamental and as yet
unresolved problems in economic theory. The insights from this project should
improve the basic paradigm used by economic theorists to study market
performance. Imperfect competition is modelled by taking firms to be "moderately
small," although not so small the situation is essentially perfectly
competitive. "Smallness" should be defined endogenously, by free entry in large
markets, not by assuming that firms having rising average cost curves after a
point. Prices are chosen by firms, but production requires time so that the
competition is effectively Cournot-like. Stability theory has to be reconsidered
as a learning process. Prices should be formed by firms making rational
decisions. This is made possible by recognizing that out of equilibrium either
sellers or buyers have market power. There is incomplete information. Each round
yields a set of signals in the form of excess supplies or demands for individual
firms. From this they can update their priors on the unknown parameters of the
economy. In the next round, they choose production before the market opens and
also choose new prices. Since the process is one of cumulative information (past
signals still enter into present decisions), the failure of standard stability
theory may not prevent better results in convergence.
