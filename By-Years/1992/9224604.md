9224604 Yariv This project wil investigate the fundamental noise properties of
semiconductor lasers. The need for narrow bandwidth and frequency stabilized
semiconductor lasers in coherent lightwave communication networks is crucial.
For multi-channel distribution systems it is important that the laser frequency
will be known exactly. In addition narrow laser linewidth increases the S/N
ratio and the network's channel capacity. Narrow linewidth lasers are also
needed for microwave links, precision spectroscopy, time and frequency standards
and many other important applications. This research is motivated with the view
of a significant, orders of magnitude, reduction of the quantum limited phase
noise and increased frequency stability of the semiconductor laser. Another
prospect is amplitude noise squeezing below the standard quantum noise limit.
These important problems will be pursed using the concept of a semiconductor
laser with dispersive loss. This work will continue and expand unfunded,
exploratory studies in our group. The early results from these preliminary
studies are promising. A subcontract to Professor Shevy at the University of
Miami will contribute to the work on frequency stabilization and linewidth
reduction ***
