This action funds Evan Joon Hyuk Park of Yale University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Studying the visual cortex in active animals using optical
probes," during the summer of 2012 at Osaka University in Osaka, Japan. The host
scientist is Professor Tetsuya Yagi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to further develop miniature
microscopes and optical techniques to study the representation and
transformation of visual information in the brain, particularly in the primary
visual cortex. There are many questions about the visual cortex that still need
to be answered and new technologies being developed are providing this
opportunity.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
