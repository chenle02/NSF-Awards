This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
inorganic and organometallic chemistry between Kenneth J. Balkus, Jr. of the
University of Texas at Dallas and Fethi Bedioui of the Ecole Nationale
Superieure de Chimie in Paris. The objectives of their research are to prepare
novel, microporous materials and to evaluate their electrochemical activity.
They will synthesize and modify zeolites. Related metal oxides research will
involve electrochemistry and electrocatalysis with novel zeolite host-guest
materials. Zeolites are important new materials with applications, for example,
in diagnostic pharmaceuticals and in chemical sensors. This project will advance
our understanding of the reactivity of zeolite composites and their homogenous
properties. This collaboration takes advantage of complementary resources and
expertise. The U.S. investigator and his group at the University of Texas are
experts in the synthesis and characterization of catalytic materials and will
prepare the new materials. This will be complemented by French expertise in
electrochemical analysis.
