CIF: Small: Primitives for Cryptography and Communications Principal
Investigator: Andrew Klapper, University of Kentucky Pseudorandom sequences and
highly nonlinear functions are essential for digital communications and
information technology. They are used in stream cipher cryptosystems, spread
spectrum systems in cellular telephones, GPS systems, satellite communications,
error-correcting codes for digital communication, and large simulations for such
applications as weather prediction, reactor design, oil well exploration,
radiation cancer therapy, traffic flow, and pricing of financial instruments. In
each case sequences or nonlinear functions with particular properties are
needed. Yet few general constructions of high quality pseudorandom sequences and
highly nonlinear functions are known. This research involves the development and
analysis of a large supply of these tools for a variety of applications in
cryptography, coding theory, and simulations. In 1994 Klapper and Goresky
proposed "feedback-with-carry shift registers" (FCSRs), pseudorandom generators
which are easily implemented and which rapidly generate sequences with many
desirable properties. These generalize to algebraic feedback shift registers
(AFSRs). Many basic properties of FCSRs and AFSRs have been determined and they
have been used in stream ciphers and quasi-Monte Carlo. This project addresses
issues concerning FCSR and AFSR sequences including (1) The development of new
classes of highly nonlinear functions for use in block ciphers and stream
ciphers, (2) the development of new tools for the analysis of nonlinear
functions based on the "with-carry" paradigm, (3) the solution of the "register
synthesis problem" for AFSRs, (4) the identification of new classes of AFSR
sequences with good randomness properties, and (5) the extension of various
ideas and methods in cryptography to vector valued functions and sequence
generators.
