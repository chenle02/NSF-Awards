This project uses time-dependent liquid crystal thermography to capture images
of the incipient pool phenomenon in dielectric fluids. The results focus on two
issues: the distribution of temperature across the heated surface, and the
inherently transient nature of the incipient boiling phenomenon. The technique
produces a temporal sequence of images of the surface temperature distribution.
These images show the surface temperature patterns as the system approaches,
passes through, and sustains nucleate pool boiling. Of particular interest is
the transient process by which the nucleation sites activate and grow in number
to displace the single-phase convection. The effects of surface preparations,
fluid subcooling, and content of dissolved gases will be investigated. The
results include real-time color images, and measurements of the spatial-averaged
surface temperature and surface temperature spectra for selected configurations.
