Ebert As part of a study of the possible influence of large-scale current
patterns on the recruitment of sea urchins, we have been monitoring the weekly
settlement of sea urchins at sites in northern and southern California since
1990. Past El Nino events appear to have significantly affected the settlement
of several species. In northern California, an unusually high sea urchin
settlement in 1992 and 1993 was associated with the breakdown in upwelling and
changes in surface currents, as indicated by satellite imagery. In southern
California, however, there was evidence of decreased settlement. Currently a new
El Nino event is occurring in the southern hemisphere. We propose a
collaborative study that will expand the spatial scale of our observations to
include central California and to increase the taxonomic scope of our
investigations by including brachyuran crabs and bivalves. This investigation
will provide a unique opportunity to test predictions based on our earlier work
in different oceanographic regions.
