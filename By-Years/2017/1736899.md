In 2015, as part of a series of cybersecurity initiatives made public by the
U.K. Prime Minister and the U.S. President, the two nations announced that MIT's
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the
University of Cambridge, would organize a special collaborative competition in
cybersecurity dubbed Cambridge2Cambridge. The event took place in 2016 at MIT
and the two universities agreed to a follow-on event, to be held in the summer
of 2017. Cambridge University will host this event at their campus in the U.K.
and the event will include several schools from the United States. Thirty-one
U.S. students have been selected based on their performance in a preliminary
contest including students from MIT, Carnegie-Mellon University, Columbia
University, United States Air Force Academy, Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
University of Tampa and University of Puerto Rico. All of the U.K. Centers of
Cyber Excellence (sponsored by the Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ)
will participate and represent the U.K.

This project promotes international cooperation in cybersecurity, furthering
relationships between countries and among students. Several private companies
with advanced cybersecurity capabilities, including Boeing, BP, Raytheon, BAE
Systems, State Farm Insurance and Akamai, will provide mentors for student
participants. They will encourage students to consider careers in a field that
is intellectually challenging and of critical importance to U.S. and
international security. This award is co-funded by the Global Venture Fund from
the NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.
