This award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanism B Program will
support a Graduate Research Fellowship Program Round Table to be held at the
Reaction Mechanisms Conference at UC-Davis. In addition to the round table, the
award also enables the participants to attend the highly successful Reaction
Mechanisms Conference. The primary objective of this round table is to provide
trainings to students in preparing competitive professional proposals. The round
table also provides faculty members with information with which they can guide
their students in drafting competitive proposals. Being able to write
competitive proposals is crucial to the success of young chemists in their
future careers, especially academic ones. Success in securing a research
fellowship could steer their career choices to Science, Technology, Engineering
and Math. Early exposure to high quality research and interactions with world-
renowned chemists could all change the life of the aspiring chemists.
