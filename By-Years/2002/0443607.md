0443607&lt;br/&gt;Balasubramanian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award
supports US-Dutch cooperative research on string theory and cosmological
spacetimes involving Vijay Balasubramanian and J. de Boer at the University of
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The project will develop three inter-related issues:
a) the physics of the cosmological constant and the origin of cosmology from
string theory, b) the quantum mechanical origin and nature of gravitational
thermodynamics and singularity resolution in cosmological and black hole
settings, and c) how time-dependent universes are described in string theory.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University
of Amsterdam is currently one of the premier institutions in Europe doing string
theory. The Dutch team has strengths on aspects of unstable systems with open
string tachyons, cosmological singularities in string theory, the physics of de
Sitter space, AdS/CFT correspondence, the construction of a holographic dual
description of Minkowski space, brane destabilization in highly curved
backgrounds, and on conformal field theory, non-commutative superspace, and
supersymmetric gauge theories. These strengths complement those of the US
team.&lt;br/&gt;
