This is a planning workshop to link geoscientists directly with the
nanoscience/technology and technology transfer communities. Goals of this
meeting are to identify how to develop and implement community interests in
developing a generation of nanotechnology-enabled sensors and sensor arrays that
are needed for effective utilization of monitoring networks that are presently
being deployed by NSF, scientists, state and local governments, and industry.
The workshop will produce guidance on sensor applications that would benefit
from nanotechnology, prioritize development targets, and develop a roadmap for
creating sensors and arrays that will remain robust and operational during long
term field deployments. Broader Impacts of the work build essential
infrastructure for science and engineering across engineering, science, and
environmental boundaries.
