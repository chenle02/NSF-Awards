McMurdo Sound is representative of large areas of the Southern Ocean which are
seasonally or permanently covered by sea-ice. Inputs of microalgal carbon into
McMurdo Sound are seasonally episodic and appear to be strongly influenced by
inputs from sea ice microbial communities and advection from the Ross Sea. The
hypothesis of this project is that the trophic role of nano- and
microzooplankton reflects the episodic nature of primary production in this
system. Using McMurdo Sound as a study site, the research will examine seasonal
and spatial variation in: 1) the distribution of nano- (2-20 um) and micro-
(20-200 um) zooplankton, microalgae and bacteria. 2) growth rates of
microzooplankton. 3) grazing impact of nano- and microzooplankton communities on
algae and bacteria. Dominant bactivores in this system will be identified and
the use of dissolved free amino acids and detritus as nutritional sources for
individual microzooplankton species evaluated. Results of this study will
improve the understanding of the role of microbial food webs in the cycling of
carbon in ice-covered regions of the Southern Ocean.
