This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project proposes to
fabricate a new, innovative instrument for efficient, noninvasive, in vivo
imaging of tumor oxygenation and pH by using Overhauser Enhanced Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (OMRI). Such instruments are not commercially available. Tumor
hypoxia and acidosis are hallmarks of cancer that are critical for understanding
complex cancer biology, and to assess anti-cancer chemotherapies in longitudinal
studies of mouse models. Yet non-invasively quantifying tumor hypoxia and
acidosis during longitudinal studies remains challenging. This innovation
includes cycling of the magnetic field strength between low fields for EPR
irradiation (< 200 Gauss) to high field for MRI data acquisition (4700 Gauss).
The unique field-cycling electronics and custom magnet design will enable the
fast switching of the magnetic field strength in less than 10 msec. With this
new system the technology would enable the mapping of oxygen partial pressure
and pH in tumors and other biological tissues. In addition, it represents for
researchers a new tool to evaluate novel contrast agent designs and/or modify
existing ones.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to raise the
technical and performance ceiling of magnetic field cycling to new heights. This
capability will encourage and support researchers to develop new contrast agents
for hyperpolarization that will greatly improve sensitivity. The instrumentation
will allow quantification of pO2 and pH, as well as redox potential during pre-
clinical in vivo investigations pertinent to understanding carcinogenesis and/or
development of improved cancer therapies. Furthermore, our resistive and
electrically powered solenoid magnet will change the perception that such
magnets cannot be used for MRI. This innovation will open the door to a new and
unique approach to generate stable magnetic fields using electrically resistive
solenoids. Researchers in cancer biology and cancer therapeutics will be very
interested in potential applications of this new methodology. In addition,
researchers measuring relaxation times at low magnetic fields will be potential
customers. Presently there are no companies in the United States providing such
systems
