The School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Program in Biology at the University
of Houston-Clear Lake is comprised of seven full- time faculty engaged in a wide
variety of research projects within the area of Cellular and Molecular Biology.
The biology faculty seek funding to sponsor students from the nine local area
community college systems. Funding for each year will provide student
scholarships, registration fees for a three-unit topics course, student health
insurance for the summer, laboratory supplies for the research project, and one-
month summer salary for the program director. The current application is to
recruit 14 students per year for a summer laboratory research internship. This
will offer the top quality minority and women students form UH-CL's regional
community college population an opportunity to obtain first-hand experience in a
research arena. The division is extremely active in supporting undergraduate
research. The participating faculty have published or submitted 28 papers co-
authored by undergraduates in the last five years. Over 50 undergraduate
students have participated in research activities in our laboratories since
1983.
