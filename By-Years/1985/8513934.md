The corrosion of metals in concrete is a multibillion dollar problem in the
United States. Reinforced concrete structures such as highway pavements,
bridges, buildings, and other types of structures are deteriorating as a result
of the corrosion of the steel reinforcement in the concrete. The mechanism of
corrosion of steel in concrete is not well known in spite of the extensive use
of reinforced concrete as a construction material. Many factors affect the
action of corrosion of steel, such as chlorides, electrical currents, cement-
paste chemistry, and interrelationships of all materials.
