This project focuses on the study of the effects of varying the strength of the
atomic interactions in a binary, two-spin-state Bose-Einstein Condensate in
Rb-87. Two avenues of research will be pursued. In the first series of
experiments the physics of a Feshbach resonance will be uniquely examined using
the double-condensate system. In these experiments the second condensate
component is used as a tool that permits approaching the resonance suddenly from
both sides, and in a novel manner. In the second series of experiments the
Feshbach resonance will be used to create binary Bose fluid systems of varying
interaction strengths, with a particular emphasis on the physics of component
separation. In this set of experiments the second component serves as a phase
reference for interferometric studies of a condensate in the vicinity of a
resonance.
