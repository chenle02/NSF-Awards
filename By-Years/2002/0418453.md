What is lost when a language dies? How does each of the world's myriad languages
reflect a unique way of expressing human experience? As linguistic diversity
diminishes rapidly in the modern world, the documentation and study of
endangered languages becomes ever more pressing. With support from the National
Science Foundation, Dr. Timothy J. Thornes will work to preserve, through
intensive documentation via video and audio recordings, the Northern Paiute
language of the Great Basin region of western North America. His work with some
of the eldest and most fluent speakers and with teachers and students of the
language includes an ongoing exploration of how to make field work relevant to
the academic community as well as to the communities whose languages are being
lost. This study will provide insight into how this highly endangered language
with many complex features fits into a typology of the world's languages. The
project will expand the amount of quality materials for use by the indigenous
communities in their linguistic and cultural preservation efforts. As North
American Tribes, and endangered language communities generally, begin to take
stock of what is lost as speakers age, linguists and anthropologists are also
taking stock of the contribution each language makes to our understanding of
this most intimate expression of cultural identity.
