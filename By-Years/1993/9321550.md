Affine scaling methods form an important class of point algorithms for solving
a linear programming problem, and there have been some major developments in the
convergence and convergence rate theory of these methods. In particular, when
the problem may be degenerate, if the step size is less than equal to two thirds
of the distance to the boundary, the primal converges to the interior of the
optimal face, while the dual to the analytic center of the optimal dual face.
Also, by a step selection strategy, these methods have been shown to converge
superlinearly. More efficient variants have also been developed. Under this
project, four different aspects of these methods are being studied: 1) study of
their convergence properties, convergence rates and complexity; 2) study of
stable implementations to achieve these higher rates of convergence in computer
implementations; 3) study of their connection to Kalman filter and their
application to solving stochastic linear programming problems; and, 4) study of
their efficient implementations in vector/parallel/distributed computing
environments.
