The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz FT-NMR for use in sophomore
and higher level courses. Students in the first organic chemistry courses are
using it in the determination of the dynamics and structures of milligram
quantities of products obtained in the microscale organic laboratory. In
advanced courses 2D techniques are employed in structure analysis of newly
synthesized molecules. Additionally, the instrument is used extensively in the
very active undergraduate research program.
