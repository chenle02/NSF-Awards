This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Young
Mathematicians in C*-Algebras" that will be held August 10-15, 2020 at the
University of Münster, Germany. This conference is organized for and by
Master's/Ph.D. students and postdocs in operator algebras and related areas,
with the goal of fostering scientific interaction between young researchers.
Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras focuses on recent developments in operator
algebras (both von Neumann and C*-algebras), noncommutative geometry, and
related areas of mathematical analysis, with a particular emphasis on the
interplay between operator algebras and the fields of geometric group theory,
logic, and dynamical systems.

The conference will feature three mini-courses by established researchers (Jesse
Peterson, Astrid an Huef, and Christopher Schafhauser) alongside many
contributed talks by participants, as well as mentoring activities designed to
increase retention of underrepresented groups in operator algebras and a keynote
address by Betül Tanbay. This award gives US-based early career researchers and
members of underrepresented groups an opportunity to attend and participate in
this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups via advertising in a variety of venues. More
information will be made available at: https://ymcstara.org/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
